https://openalex.org/W1964626085,"The β2 adrenoreceptor (β2AR) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activated by catecholamines. Agonist activation of GPCRs leads to sequential interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, which activate cellular signaling cascades, and with GPCR kinases and arrestins, which attenuate GPCR-mediated signaling. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor catecholamine-induced conformational changes in purified β2AR. Here we show that upon catecholamine binding, β2ARs undergo transitions to two kinetically distinguishable conformational states. Using a panel of chemically related catechol derivatives, we identified the specific chemical groups on the agonist responsible for the rapid and slow conformational changes in the receptor. The conformational changes observed in our biophysical assay were correlated with biologic responses in cellular assays. Dopamine, which induces only a rapid conformational change, is efficient at activating Gs but not receptor internalization. In contrast, norepinephrine and epinephrine, which induce both rapid and slow conformational changes, are efficient at activating Gs and receptor internalization. These results support a mechanistic model for GPCR activation where contacts between the receptor and structural determinants of the agonist stabilize a succession of conformational states with distinct cellular functions.

They are responsible for the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters and are the largest group of targets for drug discovery. GPCRs are remarkably versatile biological sensors, responding to a broad spectrum of chemical entities ranging in size from a single photon of light, to ions, to small organic compounds, to peptides and protein hormones (1.Ji T.H.

Rhodopsin has long been used as a model system for studying the structure and mechanism of activation of GPCRs. It is the only GPCR for which a high resolution structure is available (2.Palczewski K.

Light-induced conformational changes have been elucidated by a series of elegant biophysical studies (3.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies provide evidence that photoactivation of rhodopsin involves a rotation and tilting of transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) relative to TM3 (3.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Light-induced conformational changes have also been observed in the cytoplasmic domain spanning TM1 and TM2 (6.Altenbach C. Klein-Seetharaman J. Hwa J. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7945-7949Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic end of TM7 and helix 8 (5.Altenbach C. Klein-Seetharaman J. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15493-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Structural and biophysical studies on other GPCRs are more limited. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of β2ARs labeled with environmentally sensitive fluorescent probes detects movement of both TM3 and TM6 upon agonist binding (9.Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More detailed analysis of conformational changes in TM6 of the β2AR provide evidence for a rigid body motion similar to that observed upon activation of rhodopsin (10.Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J.

Additional support for movement of TM3 and TM6 in the β2AR comes from zinc cross-linking studies (12.Sheikh S.P. Vilardarga J.P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A.

Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cysteine cross-linking studies in the M3 receptor provide evidence for the movement of the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM6 toward each other upon agonist activation (15.Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on this limited set of experiments, it appears that the agonist-induced conformational changes leading to G protein activation for monoamine receptors are similar to those observed for rhodopsin. However, the process linking agonist binding to these conformational changes for rhodopsin may not be generalizable to the larger family of GPCRs for hormones and neurotransmitters because of the unique covalent interaction between rhodopsin and its agonist trans-retinal. Thus, the dynamic processes of agonist association and dissociation common to other GPCRs are not part of the activation process of rhodopsin, and the mechanism by which ligand binding leads to structural changes in GPCRs is poorly understood. A number of kinetic models have been developed to describe the process of agonist activation. These models are based on indirect measures of receptor conformation such as ligand binding affinity and G protein activation studies. Perhaps the most widely cited model is the extended ternary complex model (16.Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 17.Weiss J.M. Morgan P.H. Lutz M.W. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 181: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18.Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A simplified version of this model (referred to as the two-state model) is commonly used as a conceptual framework to discuss experimental results. The two-state model proposes that a receptor exists primarily in two states, the inactive state (R) and the active state (R*). In the absence of ligands, the level of basal receptor activity is determined by the equilibrium between R and R*. The efficacy of ligands reflects their ability to alter the equilibrium between these two states. Full agonists stabilize R*, whereas inverse agonists stabilize R. Although often discussed in the context of two receptor states, the extended ternary complex model is compatible with multiple receptor states, and several lines of experimental evidence support the existence of multiple states (18.Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 19.Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 346-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We have used fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy to characterize the diversity of conformational states of the β2AR (20.Ghanouni P. Gryczynski Z. Steenhuis J.J. Lee T.W. Farrens D.L. Lakowicz J.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24433-24436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We found that the conformational states induced by full and partial agonists are distinguishable. Moreover, we found that a single catecholamine agonist induces or stabilizes at least two conformational states that are distinguishable from the unliganded state. Based on these studies, we proposed the existence of an intermediate state between the inactive (unliganded state) and the fully activated state. We now show that it is possible to observe and characterize an intermediate state by kinetic analysis. We use fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor agonist-induced conformational changes in purified β2AR over time. Our results support a mechanistic model for GPCR activation, where contacts between the receptor and structural determinants of the agonist stabilize a succession of conformational states with distinct cellular functions. Buffers—The buffers used are as follows: Buffer A, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1% dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace); Buffer B, Buffer A and 1 mm EDTA; Buffer C, Buffer A with 300 μm alprenolol (Sigma) and 1 mm CaCl2; Buffer D, Buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2; Buffer E, Buffer A with 0.01% cholesterolhemisuccinate. Receptor Purification and Labeling—β2AR was expressed in Sf9 cells and solubilized using methods described previously (21.Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the detergent-solubilized β2AR was purified by M1-FLAG affinity chromatography (Sigma). The receptor was eluted from the M1-FLAG resin in Buffer B. The concentration of functional, purified receptor was determined using a saturating concentration (10 nm) of [3H]dihydroalprenolol as described previously (21.Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). FLAG-purified receptor was diluted to a concentration of 1 μm and labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-meleimide (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 1 μm for 1 h on ice. Labeled receptor was then purified by alprenolol-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (21.Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The receptor was eluted from alprenolol-Sepharose with Buffer C and loaded directly onto M1-FLAG resin. The M1-FLAG resin was washed with Buffer D to remove free alprenolol and eluted with Buffer B. Two liters of Sf9 cells typically yield 500 μl of a 5 μm solution of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled β2AR (TMR-β2AR). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Experiments were performed on a SPEX FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer with photon counting mode using an excitation and emission bandpass of 3.2 nm. Approximately 25 pmol of TMR-β2AR was desalted into 500 μl of Buffer E immediately before spectroscopy. For time course experiments, excitation was at 541 nm, and emission was monitored at 571 nm. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed at 30 °C, and the sample underwent constant stirring. Fluorescence intensity was corrected for dilution by ligands in all experiments and normalized to the initial value. All of the compounds tested had an absorbance of less than 0.01 at 541 and 571 nm in the concentrations used, excluding any inner filter effect in the fluorescence experiments. Spectra were corrected for fluorescence of the ligand when it was greater than 1% of the basal fluorescence of TMR-β2AR (only required for tyramine). cAMP Accumulation—The production of cAMP was determined by adenylyl cyclase activation FlashPlate assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (22.Swaminath G. Lee T.W. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced Internalization—HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-β2AR were cultured in poly-lysine-coated 12-well plates for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with different drugs for 10 min before fixing without permeabilization with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (with Ca2+ and Mg2+). After blocking with 2.5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (with Ca2+ and Mg2+), the cells were stained with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes)-conjugated M1 antibody (Sigma) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for 30 min. The unbound antibody was removed by washing four times with phosphate-buffered saline (with Ca2+ and Mg2+). The cells were harvested with 1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline, and the intensity of Alexa-488 emission was measured on a FluorMax-3 spectrofluorometer. The excitation was at 485 nm, and the emission was from 495 to 580 nm with an integration time of 0.3 s/nm. The fluorescence intensity was normalized after subtracting the background from cells without M1 antibody. Statistical Analysis—Curve fitting and statistical analysis were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Monitoring Agonist-induced Conformational Changes in the β2 AR with a Fluorescent Probe at the Cytoplasmic End of TM6—To study agonist-induced conformational changes in the β2AR, we monitor fluorescence intensity of purified β2AR labeled at Cys-265 with tetramethylrhodamine maleimide (TMR-β2AR) as a function of time. We have shown previously that it is possible to monitor agonist-induced conformational changes in β2ARs labeled at Cys-265 with either fluorescein maleimide (10.Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J.

Whelan R.J. Zare R.N. Kobilka B.K. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An environmentally sensitive fluorophore covalently bound to Cys-265 is well positioned to detect agonist-induced conformational changes relevant to G protein activation. Based on homology with rhodopsin (2.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4970) Google Scholar), Cys-265 is located in the third intracellular loop (IC3) at the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane 6 (TM6) (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis studies have shown this region of IC3 to be important for G protein coupling (24.O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

The sites of interaction between catecholamines and the β2AR have been extensively characterized (26.Strader C. Sigal I. Dixon R. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 27.Wieland K. Zuurmond H.M. Krasel C. Ijzerman A.P. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interactions with the aromatic ring and the chiral β-hydroxyl have both been mapped to TM6 (27.Wieland K. Zuurmond H.M. Krasel C. Ijzerman A.P. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9276-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine-induced Conformational Changes in β2AR Are Biphasic—Fig. 2A shows the response of TMR-β2AR to a saturating concentration of two catecholamine agonists: norepinephrine and dopamine. The time versus intensity traces were fit with one-site and two-site exponential association functions. A two-site fit was significantly better than a one-site fit for the response to norepinephrine (p < 0.0001). In contrast, there was no significant difference between one-site and two-site fits for the response to dopamine. In Fig. 2A, the two-site fit for norepinephrine is broken into its component rapid (t1/2rapid = 2.8 ± 0.4 s) and slow (t1/2slow = 70 ± 6 s) phases. Of interest, the rapid phase of the response for norepinephrine is similar to the monophasic response observed for dopamine (t1/2 = 4.2 ± 0.3 s) (Table I).Table IRates of the rapid and slow phases of the conformational response to catecholaminesDrugsFast component, t½Slow component, t½Numberssn an = number of experiments.Isoproterenol2.6±0.2147±1019Epinephrine4.5±0.6164±2010Norepinephrine2.8±0.470.2±6.110Dopamine4.2±0.310a n = number of experiments. Open table in a new tab The Role of the Chiral β-Hydroxyl in Biphasic Conformational Changes—The difference in the response of TMR-β2AR to dopamine and norepinephrine can be attributed to the chiral β-hydroxyl present in norepinephrine but absent in dopamine (Fig. 2A). Thus, conformational changes involving receptor interactions with the catechol ring, the catechol hydroxyls, and the amine nitrogen (present in both dopamine and norepineprine) are rapid, whereas conformational changes associated with interactions between the receptor and the β-hydroxyl (present in norepinephrine) are ∼10 times slower. This is somewhat surprising considering that the β-hydroxyl contributes ∼2 kCal/mol of binding energy (as determined by equilibrium binding affinity). The relatively slow rate of formation of this interaction between the receptor and the β-hydroxyl suggests that the conformational transition required to accommodate this interaction involves traversing a relatively large energy barrier. Comparing the effects of (-) and (+) enantiomers of norepinephrine on TMR-β2AR further demonstrates the importance of the chiral β-hydroxyl in the slow phase of the conformational response to norepinephrine. As shown in Fig. 2B, a rapid phase of comparable magnitude is observed for both isomers; however, during the slow phase for (+) norepinephrine, there is a relative decrease in fluorescence. Thus, it appears that the β-hydroxyl of (+) norepinephrine binds to the β2AR but stabilizes a different conformational state. It is interesting that the rate of the slow component for (+) norepinephrine is comparable with that for (-) norepinephrine. However, we do not know whether the β-hydroxyl of (+) norepinephrine binds to the same amino acid side chain in the β2AR as the β-hydroxyl of (-) norepinephrine. To further characterize the structural components responsible for the rapid and slow conformational changes, we examined the response to a panel of ligands that are structurally related to catecholamines (Fig. 3). Like norepinephrine, isoproterenol and epinephrine both have chiral β-hydroxyls and both induce a biphasic change in the intensity of TMR-β2AR (Fig. 3A). The magnitude of the slow component (isoproterenol ≈ epinephrine > norepinephrine) correlates with the presence of an alkyl substituent on the amine of the agonist. Moreover, the rate of the slow component for norepinephrine, which lacks an amine substituent, is significantly faster (t1/22 = 70 ± 6 s) than that of the slow components for epinephrine (t1/22 = 164 ± 20 s) and isoproterenol (t1/22 = 147 ± 10 s) (Table I). Thus, like receptor interactions with the chiral β-hydroxyl, conformational changes involving interactions between the amine substituent and the β2AR are relatively slow. The Catechol Ring Is Required for the Rapid Component of the Biphasic Conformational Change—To understand the structural basis of the rapid phase of TMR-β2AR response to catecholamines, we compared responses to dopamine, tyramine, catechol, and resorcinol (Fig. 3B). Tyramine, which differs from dopamine in lacking the meta-hydroxyl on the catechol ring, does not induce a detectable change in the fluorescence of TMR-β2AR. Thus, the catechol structure is essential for the rapid conformational response. In fact, catechol alone induces a small, rapid response in TMR-β2AR, whereas no detectable response is observed with resorcinol. The difference in the magnitude of the fluorescence response to dopamine and catechol can be attributed to the interaction of the amine nitrogen of dopamine and Asp-113 in TM3 of the β2AR (Fig. 1). Therefore, this interaction must occur on a similar rapid time scale (t1/2 < 5 s). Sequential Binding Model—These fluorescence experiments provide evidence for a sequential binding model (Fig. 4) in which the process of binding of a small organic agonist occurs by kinetically distinguishable steps through discrete intermediate conformational states. This model proposes that the unliganded receptor exists in a dynamic and relatively flexible state R (see Fig. 4) that can undergo transitions to an undetermined number of states. The flexibility of the unliganded state is based on fluorescence lifetime studies (20.Ghanouni P. Gryczynski Z. Steenhuis J.J. Lee T.W. Farrens D.L. Lakowicz J.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24433-24436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and the observation that R is more susceptible to thermal denaturation (29.Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and proteolysis (30.Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, R may undergo spontaneous transitions to a state capable of activating the G protein, explaining the high basal activity observed for some GPCRs (31.Parnot C. Miserey-Lenkei S. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 336-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We propose that in the R state, the receptor does not have a high affinity binding site for the agonist. That is, in the R state, the specific amino acid side chains involved in agonist binding (Fig. 1) are not arranged to simultaneously coordinate the ligand. These interactions between the receptor and the agonist are formed sequentially, such that each interaction increases the probability of the subsequent interaction. The process results in a series of intermediate states (R1 and R2 and R3). In our model, we hypothesize that R1 results from interactions between the catechol ring of the agonist and TMs 5 and 6 of the receptor. R2 occurs when the amine nitrogen interacts with TM3. Our speculation that binding of the catechol ring precedes the binding of the amine is based on the observation that catechol alone induces a rapid conformational response in TMR-β2AR (Fig. 3B). In contrast, tyramine, which lacks an intact catechol ring but has the amine group, produces no conformational change that can be detected by our reporter on TM6. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the response for dopamine is greater than that for catechol, suggesting that the interaction between the amine and Asp-113 facilitates or stabilizes the interaction of the catechol ring with TM5 and TM6. The transitions from R to R1 and R2 are rapid. R3 occurs when the receptor engages the β-hydroxyl. The transition from R2 to R3 is slow. The Rapid and Slow Conformational States May Have Different Functional Properties—The relatively large difference in the rates of the rapid and slow conformational responses suggest that the different receptor states may have distinct functional properties. Agonist binding promotes interactions between the β2AR and Gs, thereby activating signaling cascades. Agonists also promote interactions between the β2AR and GRKs and arrestins, which block access to G proteins and, for many GPCRs, mediate endocytosis of the receptor (32.Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to determine the functional properties of the intermediate states proposed in the sequential binding model (Fig. 4), we examined the effect of the panel of catecholamine-related compounds on G protein activation (cAMP accumulation, Fig. 5A) and interactions with GRK and arrestin (β2AR endocytosis, Fig. 5B). The state stabilized by binding of the catechol ring alone (R1) is not sufficient to activate the G protein. However, R2, the state stabilized by binding the catechol ring and the amine (dopamine), efficiently interacts with Gs. Maximal cAMP accumulation in response to dopamine is ∼95% of that induced by isoproterenol. Thus, dopamine is a strong partial agonist for the β2AR in promoting interactions with Gs. In contrast, dopamine is only marginally effective at promoting β2AR internalization (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the dopamine is less efficient at stabilizing interactions between the β2AR and GRK and/or arrestin. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol, which stabilize both R2 and R3, are significantly more effective in stimulating β2AR internalization. Thus, the slow transition from R2 to R3 appears to be required for promoting interactions between the receptor and GRK and/or arrestin. Conclusion—By examining conformational changes in the β2AR induced by a panel of closely related ligands, we gain insight into the sequence of events linking ligand binding to receptor activation. Moreover, our studies demonstrate that a single small organic ligand such as norepinephrine can induce at least two kinetically and functionally distinct conformational states: a rapid state capable of activating Gs and a slow state required for efficient agonist-induced internalization. Since interactions between the β2AR and GRK and/or arrestin are required for internalization, it is likely that the slow conformational state promotes interactions between the β2AR and one or both of these regulatory proteins. It is interesting to speculate that the kinetics of ligand binding may be responsible for the timing of the sequence of receptor activation and desensitization. Our results are in agreement with studies on the μ-opioid receptor demonstrating that different ligands induce distinct conformational states that differ in promoting G protein activation and receptor internalization (33.Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). More recently, time-resolved peptide binding studies on the neurokinin receptor revealed that an agonist peptide binds with biphasic kinetics. The rapid binding component was associated with a cellular calcium response, whereas the slow component was required for cAMP signaling (34.Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that our finding that a single agonist can induce or stabilize multiple functionally distinct conformational states will be generalizable to other GPCRs, particularly those activated by peptides and protein hormones where there are a larger number of sites of interaction between receptor and agonist. A better understanding of this conformational heterogeneity will facilitate the design of more effective and selective pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2034399323,"Lipid rafts are specialized regions of cell membranes enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that are involved in immune activation and signaling. Studies in T-cells indicate that these membrane domains serve as sites for release of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By budding through lipid rafts in T-cells, HIV selectively incorporates raft markers and excludes non-raft proteins. This process has been well studied in T-cells, but it is unknown whether lipid rafts serve as budding sites for HIV in macrophages. Recently, we proposed a new model of retroviral biogenesis called the Trojan exosome hypothesis (Gould, S. J., Booth, A., and Hildreth, J. E. K. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 10592-10597). This model proposes that retroviruses coopt the existing cellular machinery for exosomal release. Here, we performed the first test designed to differentiate between the lipid raft hypothesis of retroviral biogenesis and the Trojan exosome hypothesis. Using macrophages, we examined the relative abundance of several host proteins on the cell surface, in lipid rafts, and on both HIV particles and exosomes derived from these cells. Our results show significant differences in the abundance of host proteins on the cell surface and in HIV. Moreover, our data demonstrate discordance in the abundance of some proteins in lipid rafts and in HIV. Finally, our data reveal a strong concordance between the host cell protein profile of exosomes and that of HIV. These results strongly support the Trojan exosome hypothesis and its prediction that retroviral budding represents exploitation of a pre-existing cellular pathway of intercellular vesicle trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2108018232,"The 3C-like proteinase of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has been proposed to be a key target for structural-based drug design against SARS. In order to understand the active form and the substrate specificity of the enzyme, we have cloned, expressed, and purified SARS 3C-like proteinase. Analytic gel filtration shows a mixture of monomer and dimer at a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml and mostly monomer at 0.2 mg/ml, which correspond to the concentration used in the enzyme assays. The linear decrease of the enzymatic-specific activity with the decrease of enzyme concentration revealed that only the dimeric form is active and the dimeric interface could be targeted for structural-based drug design against SARS 3C-like proteinase. By using a high pressure liquid chromatography assay, SARS 3C-like proteinase was shown to cut the 11 peptides covering all of the 11 cleavage sites on the viral polyprotein with different efficiency. The two peptides corresponding to the two self-cleavage sites are the two with highest cleavage efficiency, whereas peptides with non-canonical residues at P2 or P1′ positions react slower. The P2 position of the substrates seems to favor large hydrophobic residues. Secondary structure studies for the peptide substrates revealed that substrates with more β-sheetlike structure tend to react fast. This study provides a basic understanding of the enzyme catalysis and a full substrate specificity spectrum for SARS 3C-like proteinase, which are helpful for structural-based inhibitor design against SARS and other coronavirus.

Currently, 23 genome sequences of different variations of SARS coronavirus have been released at the NCBI web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Coronaviruses are members of positive-stranded RNA viruses featuring the largest viral RNA genomes up to date. The SARS coronavirus replicase gene encompasses two overlapping translation products, polyproteins 1a (∼450 kDa) and 1ab (∼750 kDa), which are conserved both in length and amino acid sequence to other coronavirus replicase proteins. Polyproteins 1a and 1ab are cleaved by the internally encoded 3C-like proteinase to release functional proteins necessary for virus replication. The SARS 3C-like proteinase is fully conserved among all of the released SARS coronavirus genome sequences and is highly homologous with other coronavirus 3C-like proteinase. Two crystal structures of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (5.Anand K. Palm G.J. Mesters J.R. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Hilgenfeld R.

Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The structure of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase contains three domains. The first two domains form a chymotrypsin fold, which is responsible for the catalytic reaction, and the third domain is α-helical with unclear biological function.

An 8-mer peptide has been docked on the model of SARS 3C-like proteinase to study the possible interactions of the protein and the substrate (18.Chou K.C. Wei D.Q. Zhong W.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) Similar to other coronaviruses, a sequence analysis revealed 11 cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase on the SARS polyprotein. The substrate specificity of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase is determined mainly by the P1, P2, and P1′ positions (19.Hegyi A. Ziebuhr J. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The P1 position has a well conserved Gln residue, and the P2 position has a hydrophobic one. Unlike other previously identified coronavirus 3C-like proteinases, which have Leu/Ile at position P2, SARS 3C-like proteinase also tolerates Phe, Val, and Met residues at P2 position. To study the substrate specificity of SARS 3C-like proteinase, we have cloned, expressed, and purified the protein and studied its activity toward 11 peptides covering the 11 cleavage sites on the virus polyprotein. Our results confirm that purified SARS 3C-like proteinase is active toward substrate peptides mapped from the cleavage sites on the polyprotein and reveals the substrate requirement of the proteinase-binding site. This study helps to understand the mechanism of SARS polyprotein process and provides clues for drug design. Cloning of SARS-CoV 3C-like Proteinase —The reverse transcriptional mixture of SARS-CoV RNA from supernatant fluid of the virus-infected Vero cells using random primers was generously supplied by Dr. Y. Lu from Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control. For cloning of the cDNA of 3C-like proteinase of the virus, the first stand cDNA mixture was subjected to PCR amplification using a pair of specific primers, comprising F99 (5′-AGT GGT TTT AGG AAA ATG GCA TTC CC-3′) and R108 (5′-TTG GAA GGT AAC ACC AGA GC-3′) to amplify a 917-bp fragment containing full-length 3C-like proteinase coding sequence. The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then cloned directly into pGEM T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The resultant sequence confirmed that the amplified fragment was the same as that of SARS-CoV 3C-like proteinase. Construction of Plasmid pET 3CLP-21x —The gene of the SARS 3C-like proteinase was amplified by PCR from the cloning vector (pGEM T Easy) described above using primers 3CLP-Nhe (5′-CACTGCTAGCGGTTTTAGGAAAATGGCATTCCC-3′) and 3CLP-Xho (5′-CACTCTCGAGTTGGAAGGTAACACCAGAGC-3′). The PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI and ligated with NdeI/XhoI-digested pET21a DNA. The resulting plasmid pET 3CLP-21x encodes a 35.1 kDa protein containing a C-terminal His6-Taq. Expression of 3C-like Proteinase —pET 3CLP-21x was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium-containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) until the A600 reached 0.8 and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The pelleted cells were suspended in buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 7.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), at 2% of the original culture volume. After cell lysis by ultrasonic, the cell lysate was separated by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min. The filtrated supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated by 50 ml of buffer A. After being washed in 100 ml of buffer A, the 3C-like proteinase was eluted with the gradient of 1–100% buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 7.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The eluted enzyme was concentrated and loaded on a gel filtration column Sephacryl S-200 HR (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated by 180 ml of buffer C (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After elution with another 180 ml buffer C, we received over 95% purified 3C-like proteinase. Analytic Gel Filtration —The aggregation state of the SARS 3C-like proteinase was analyzed using a Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) on ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography. Freshly purified protein was diluted to 4 and 0.2 mg/ml and equilibrated at room temperature for 2 h. 400 μl of 4- and 2-ml 0.2 mg/ml samples were injected into the Superdex 75 HR column and eluted with the buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluted peaks were monitored at 280 nm on fast protein liquid chromatography. CD Spectra —All of the CD spectra of the proteinase and the substrate peptides were recorded on a Jobin Yvon CD 6 spectrometer at 20 °C. The CD spectra of 3C-like proteinase were recorded in 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. For near-UV CD spectrum, a cell with a path length of 1 mm was used and the proteinase concentration is 544 μm, whereas a cell with a path length of 0.1 mm and 54.4 μm of proteinase solution was used for far-UV CD spectrum. The substrate peptides were solved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, and the final concentration was2mm. A cell with a path length of 0.1 mm was used. Each spectrum was the average of four scans corrected by subtracting a spectrum of the buffer solution in the absence of proteinase/peptide recorded under identical condition. Each scan in the range of 184–260 nm for far-UV CD and of 250–320 nm for near-UV CD spectra was obtained by taking data points every 0.5 nm with integration time of 1 s and a 2-nm bandwidth. Thermal denaturation spectrum was recorded by CD at 218 nm using the same condition for far-UV CD spectrum from 10 to 90 °C with an interval of 0.5 °C. Secondary structure content was calculated using the program VARSLC1 (20.Johnson Jr, W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) Synthesis of Substrate Peptides —The substrate peptide S01 was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/tert-butyl strategy (21.Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the peptide from Rink resin and removal of all of the side-chain protecting groups were achieved in trifluoroacetic acid solution. The crude peptide was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, LabPrep System, Gilson) on a Vydac C18 semi-preparative column (218TP510, 10 by 250 mm, Vydac) with gradients of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide homogeneity and identity were analyzed by analytical HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS), respectively. Other substrate peptides of HPLC purity from S02 to S11 were purchased from GL Biochemistry Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Peptide Cleavage —The proteolysis activity of the SARS 3C-like proteinase was determined by peptide cleavage assay. Peptide S01 (Table I) was used as substrate and was incubated with the enzyme in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, at room temperature. The cleavage mixture was analyzed by RP-HPLC. To verify the cleavage site on the substrate peptide, the two products were purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC using a 15-min 0–50% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. The relative molecular weights of the products were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (BIFLEX III time-of-flight mass spectrometer, Bruker).Table ICatalytic parameters and relative cleavage efficiencies of eleven peptides that represent all of the eleven cleavage sites in SARS coronavirus polyproteinPeptideCleavage siteSequenceKmkcatkcat/Km(kcat/Km)relmmmin-1mm-1 min-1S01P1/P2TSAVLQ/SGFRK-NH21.15 ± 0.2812.2 ± 2.910.6 ± 0.6aDetermined by Lineweaver-Burk plot.1.00S02P2/P3SGVTFQ/GKFKK0.583 ± 0.0862.55 ± 0.354.38 ± 0.26aDetermined by Lineweaver-Burk plot.0.41S03P3/P4KVATVQ/SKMSD0.353 ± 0.013bDetermined by fitting reaction kinetic data as in Equation 1 at low substrate concentration.0.03S04P4/P5NRATLQ/AIASE0.556 ± 0.126bDetermined by fitting reaction kinetic data as in Equation 1 at low substrate concentration.0.05S05P5/P6SAVKLQ/NNELS0.202 ± 0.003bDetermined by fitting reaction kinetic data as in Equation 1 at low substrate concentration.0.02S06P6/P7ATVRLQ/AGNAT1.44 ± 0.473.29 ± 1.072.29 ± 0.09aDetermined by Lineweaver-Burk plot.0.22S07P7/P8REPLMQ/SADAS0.0176 ± 0.0022bDetermined by fitting reaction kinetic data as in Equation 1 at low substrate concentration.0.002S08P8/P9PHTVLQ/AVGAC1.94 ± 0.661.68 ± 0.570.865 ± 0.028aDetermined by Lineweaver-Burk plot.0.08S09P9/P10NVATLQ/AENVT0.976 ± 0.014bDetermined by fitting reaction kinetic data as in Equation 1 at low substrate concentration.0.09S10P10/P11TFTRLQ/SLENV0.286 ± 0.0200.847 ± 0.0512.96 ± 0.11aDetermined by Lineweaver-Burk plot.0.28S11P11/P12FYPKLQ/ASQAW0.549 ± 0.1051.57 ± 0.282.86 ± 0.21aDetermined by Lineweaver-Burk plot.0.27a Determined by Lineweaver-Burk plot.b Determined by fitting reaction kinetic data as in Equation 1 at low substrate concentration. Open table in a new tab The relative enzyme activity at different pH values was determined in citric acid/phosphate buffer (pH 5, 6, 7, and 8) or glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 9 or 10) containing 6.8 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm S01 as substrate, and 2.14 μm SARS 3C-like proteinase with a final volume of 50 μl. The cleavage reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution and analyzed by RP-HPLC (LabPrep System, Gilson) on a Zorbax C18 analytic column (4.6 × 250 mm, Agilent). Cleavage products were resolved using a 15-min 0–50% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. To determine the kcat/Km for the substrate, 0.2 mm of substrate peptide was incubated with SARS 3C-like proteinase in 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3. The concentration of the enzyme varied from 0.90 to 22.5 μm because of the different cleavage activity to different substrates. Reaction aliquots were removed at different times within 7 h and analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above. kcat/Km was determined by plotting substrate peak area as Equation 1, lnPA=C-kcatcEt/Km(Eq. 1) where PA is the peak area of the substrate peptide, cE is the total concentration of 3C-like proteinase, and C is an experimental constant. Km and kcat of the proteinase for selected substrates were determined by incubation of the substrate peptide at different concentration varying from 2 to 0.1 mm with SARS 3C-like proteinase in 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, for 20 min and analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above. The concentration of the enzyme varied from 1.07 to 17.1 μm because of the different cleavage activity to different substrate. Peak areas were calculated by integration and converted to absolute units by using peptide standards. The reaction rate was calculated for all of the cleavage products of two experiments and averaged. Km and kcat were calculated by the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Biosynthesis, Purification, and Secondary Structures of Recombinant SARS CoV 3CL Proteinase —The C-terminal His tagged SARS 3C-like proteinase has been successfully expressed in E. coli and purified. Induction was first done at 37 °C. As a result, the majority of 3C-like proteinase can be found in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate. Induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then done at 30 °C for 3 h. As a result, most of the 3C-like proteinase was found in the soluble fraction. The protein was purified by nickel column followed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Fig. 1). Approximately 10 mg of purified protein can be obtained from 1-liter cells. The protein can be concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3. The CD spectra of SARS 3C-like proteinase were shown in Fig. 2. Far-UV and near-UV CD spectra show that the purified protein has well defined secondary and tertiary structures. Far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 2a) shows a positive peak at 196 nm and two negative peaks at 209 and 222 nm, respectively, which clearly indicates for a mixed α and β structure. Calculated secondary structure content shows 26% of α -helix and 23% of β -sheet, similar to those in the TGEV 3C-like proteinase crystal structure (22 and 26%, respectively). Near-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 2b) shows a broad positive peak at ∼280 nm and a small positive shoulder at 291 nm, indicating a well folded tertiary structure. Thermal melting of the protein by monitoring the CD signal at 218 nm (Fig. 2c) gives a sigmoid denaturation curve and a Tm of 61 °C, indicating a highly cooperative thermodenaturation. Aggregation State and Enzyme Activity —Because both the crystal structures of the 3C-like proteinase in TGEV and human coronavirus give dimer structure and the residues at dimeric interface are conserved in coronavirus, it has been proposed that the dimer may be the biological functional form of the protein (5.Anand K. Palm G.J. Mesters J.R. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Hilgenfeld R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 6.Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Dynamic light-scattering experiment shows that both hCoV 229E and TGEV 3C-like proteinases exist as a mixture of monomer (65%) and dimer (35%) at a concentration of 1–2 mg/ml (6.Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). We have performed analytical gel filtration of SARS 3C-like proteinase at different concentrations using a Superdex 75 column (Fig. 3). At the concentration of 4 mg/ml, two peaks corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric form of the protein appeared while only one peak corresponding to the monomeric form was found at a lower concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The dissociation constant of the dimer was estimated to be around 100 μm. In vitro peptide or protein cleavage assays of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase usually were performed with a protein concentration at micromolar level (22.Ziebuhr J. Herold J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ziebuhr J. Heusipp G. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3992-3997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we also used a peptide cleavage assay with the SARS 3C-like proteinase concentration not >22.5 μm that corresponds mainly to the monomer form of the enzyme. This raises an interesting question whether the minor amount of the dimer plays a major role in catalysis, although we are still not clear about the exact form of the protein in the cell under a molecular crowding environment. To answer this question, the proteolysis activity of SARS CoV 3C-like proteinase at different enzyme concentrations was studied. Peptide S01 was used as substrate and was incubated with the proteinase in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, at room temperature. The cleavage mixture was analyzed by RP-HPLC. The peak area of the substrate S01 decreases as reaction time increases, whereas the area of two newly formed peaks increases. The products were collected and identified by MALDI-TOF MS with experimental (M + H)+ of 593 and 618, respectively, that were identical to the theoretical (M + H)+ of the C-terminal pentapeptide and N-terminal hexapeptide. This confirms that the substrate is cleaved by the SARS CoV 3C-like proteinase at the predicted fragile Gln-Ser peptide bond. The observed kcat/Km was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” at different proteinase concentrations between 4.5 and 0.9 μm (shown in Fig. 4). The observed kcat/Km increases linearly with the increase of the enzyme concentration. Using the estimated dissociation constant of ∼100 μm, we can deduce from the linear dependence that the monomeric form of SARS CoV 3C-like proteinase almost has no catalytic activity, whereas the kcat/Km of the dimeric form is ∼1.4 × 103 mm–1 min–1. This result supports the previous prediction that the dimer of the 3C-like proteinase is the active form of the enzyme and also explains that the low in vitro activity of CoV 3C-like proteinases compared with other monomeric virus 3C proteinases is because of the low concentration of the active dimeric form under the assay conditions. Substrate Specificity —Eleven 11-mer peptides derived from the 11 cleavage sites of 3C-like proteinase upon the SARS polyprotein have been synthesized and tested for SARS 3C-like proteinase cleavage experiment (Table I). The proteolysis activity of expressed SARS CoV 3C-like proteinase at different pH was tested as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When peptide S01 was used as substrate as shown in Fig. 5, the proteinase had the highest activity at around pH 7 and decreased at another pH, resulting a bell-shaped curve. When pH decreased to 5, the proteolytic activity of the enzyme decreased to 10% because of the protonation of the catalytic His-41. To investigate the relationship between the proteolysis activity and the secondary structure of the substrates, far-UV CD spectra were recorded for all of the peptides at 2 mm (for S09 the peptide concentration was 0.2 mm because of its low solubility) (see Fig. 6a). The secondary structure contents were calculated using VARSLC1 (20.Johnson Jr, W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) with the CD data in the range of 184–260 nm for each peptide with the exception of S09 (which has very low solubility) and summarized in Table II. Although not obvious in the CD spectra, each peptide forms more or less sheet structures. The calculated sheet content reflects the formation of a β-strandlike extended conformation in equilibrium with other turnlike or random conformations. Fig. 6b shows an interesting tendency in which substrate peptide with small kcat/Km has relatively less content of sheet but more of other unordered structure, suggesting that the formation of β-strandlike extended structure is favored for binding to the enzyme and proteolysis. As shown in the crystal structure of TGEV 3C-like proteinase, residues P5 to P3 of the substrate form an antiparallel β-sheet with segment 164–167 of the long strand eII of the enzyme on one side and with segment 186–191 on the other side (6.Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The binding modes of substrate to different coronavirus 3C-like proteinases were predicted to be identical by comparing the crystal structure of the substrate-binding regions of the free proteinases of hCoV and SARS CoV and of TGEV proteinase in complex with a hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone inhibitor (6.Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Substrate peptide that tends to form an extended β-strandlike conformation would be the preferred choice to bind with the enzyme, resulting in a small Km and a large kcat/Km. It is also supported by a previous study (25.Cordingley M.G. Callahan P.L. Sardana V.V. Garsky V.M. Colonno R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9062-9065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on 3C proteinase in which helix-destabilizing residues were often found in close proximity to cleavage sites.Table IICalculated secondary structure contents for the 11-peptide substratesHelixSheetTumOtherS015352732S023422431S032252846S042243045S0510192744S062253043S071184041S085212945S104223341S112303236 Open table in a new tab Of all of the 11 peptides tested, S01 and S02 were the most suitable substrates for SARS CoV 3C-like proteinase cleavage, which were derived from the N-terminal and C-terminal self-cleavage sites, respectively. Km of S01 was determined as 1.15 ± 0.28 mm, which is three times larger than that of hCoV 229E 3C-like proteinase for a 15-mer substrate, 0.39 ± 0.07 mm. The relative large Km was counteracted by a large kcat, 12.2 ± 2.9 min–1, which is an order larger than that of the five other substrates whose kcat and Km values are also determined by the Lineweaver-Burk plot (Table I). Most of the cleavage sites of coronavirus polyprotein have a conserved (Leu/Ile)-Gln↓ (Ser, Ala, or Gly) core sequence (the cleavage site is indicated by ↓). However, the SARS coronavirus polyprotein has three noncanonical cleavage sites with Phe, Val, or Met in the P2 position and one noncanonical cleavage site with Asn in the P1′ position. Here, peptides S02, S03, and S07 are derived from the three noncanonical cleavage sites at P2 and peptide S05 is derived from the one noncanonical cleavage site at P1′. With the dipeptide sequence of Asn-Asn at positions P1′ and P2′, peptide S05 has relatively low catalytic efficiency, which is the second lowest one among all of the 11 peptides. Peptides S02 and S03 have a Phe and a Val, respectively, in the position P2 and have similar cleavage activity as other substrates with Leu in P2 position, indicating that Phe or Val can also be well fitted in the large hydrophobic S2 pocket so that the substitutions are tolerated for 3C-like proteinase cleavage. The substitution by a relative large hydrophobic amino acid Phe did not affect the substrate binding, whereas substitution by a relative small hydrophobic amino acid Val decreased the cleavage activity, indicating an important role of pocket S2 in anti-SARS drug design. On the other hand, peptide S07, which has a methionine in the P2 position, is the substrate with least cleavage activity among 11 substrates. The low cleavage activity of S07 may be caused by the mutant from Leu to Met, although it may also be affected by other reasons such as different secondary structures. As shown in the far-UV CD spectrum, peptide S07 may adopt an unusual helix-like, type II polyproline conformation, which has a strong negative peak at ∼200 nm and a positive peak at ∼230 nm. The formation of the polyproline helix will disturb the conformation transition to β-strandlike-extended structure of the substrate peptide and disable the binding of the substrate to the enzyme. It is also supported by the factor that this peptide has the least content of sheet. Hegyi and Ziebuhr (19.Hegyi A. Ziebuhr J. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have studied the conservation of substrate specificities among coronavirus 3C-like proteinase from three coronavirus by using peptides corresponding to the four cleavage sites on the viral polyprotein. Our findings that the two peptides S01 (P1/P2) and S02 (P2/P3) corresponding to the two self-cleavage sites of the SARS 3C-like proteinase are the two most reactive ones and S05 (P5/P6) is less reactive are comparable to their results. This implies that SARS 3C-like proteinase follows the same substrate specificity rules governing all of the coronavirus 3C-like proteinase. As we have studied, the substrate specificities of SARS 3C-like proteinase using peptides covering all of the 11 cleavage sites try to correlate not only the conserved sequences but also secondary structures of the substrate peptides. The full spectrum of substrate specificity for SARS 3C-like proteinase studied here can be extended to understand other coronavirus 3C-like proteinases. In summary, the recombinant SARS 3C-like proteinase has been successfully cloned and expressed. The purified protein exists in a mixture of monomer and dimer at a concentration of 4 mg/ml but mostly monomer at 0.2 mg/ml. The specific activity of the enzyme decreases linearly with the decrease of enzyme concentration implying that only the dimeric form is active and that the dimeric interface could be targeted for structural based drug design against SARS 3C-like proteinase. The enzyme can cut the 11 peptides covering all of the 11 cleavage sites on the viral polyprotein with different efficiency. Substrates with a more β-sheetlike structure tend to react fast. The P2 position of the substrates seems to favor large hydrophobic residues. This study provides basic understandings of the enzyme catalysis and substrate specificity for SARS 3C-like proteinase and helpful information for structurally based inhibitor design."
https://openalex.org/W2052660678,"Based on the role of phosphorylation of the histone H2A variant H2AX in recruitment of DNA repair and checkpoint proteins to the sites of DNA damage, we have investigated gammaH2AX as a reporter of tumor radiosensitivity and a potential target to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy. Clinically relevant ionizing radiation (IR) doses induced similar patterns of gammaH2AX focus formation or immunoreactivity in radiosensitive and radioresistant human tumor cell lines and xenografted tumors. However, radiosensitive tumor cells and xenografts retained gammaH2AX for a greater duration than radioresistant cells and tumors. These results suggest that persistence of gammaH2AX after IR may predict tumor response to radiotherapy. We synthesized peptide mimics of the H2AX carboxyl-terminal tail to test whether antagonizing H2AX function affects tumor cell survival following IR. The peptides did not alter the viability of unirradiated tumor cells, but both blocked induction of gammaH2AX foci by IR and enhanced cell death in irradiated radioresistant tumor cells. These results suggest that H2AX is a potential molecular target to enhance the effects of radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2084893631,"We previously suggested that oxidation of the active site cysteine of peroxiredoxin (Prx) I or Prx II to cysteine sulfinic acid in H2O2-treated cells is reversible (Woo, H.

With the use of these antibodies, we demonstrated that not only the cytosolic enzymes Prx I and Prx II but also the mitochondrial enzyme Prx III undergo reversible sulfinylation.

On examination of the redox state of Prx in several mammalian cell lines that had been metabolically labeled with 35S, we observed that, on two-dimensional gels, the 35S-labeled acidic spots corresponding to sulfinylated Prx I and Prx II increased in intensity during exposure of cells to H2O2 and then underwent a shift back to the spots corresponding to the respective reduced forms after removal of H2O2 in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (13Woo H.A.

To develop an alternative approach to the complex procedure involving isotopic labeling of cells, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry for the detection of proteins containing hyperoxidized cysteine residues, we prepared rabbit antibodies to a sulfonylated peptide based on the active site sequence common to mammalian Prx I to IV. With the use of immunoblot analysis with these antibodies, we reinvestigated Prx oxidation and now not only confirm the reversibility of sulfinylation of cytosolic Prx isoforms but also demonstrate reversibility of the sulfinylation of mitochondrial Prx. These results are thus discrepant with the recent observation by Chevallet et al. (15Chevallet M. Wagner E. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. J. Biol.

The peptide (1 mg) was then dried for 15 min under vacuum without heating, and the resulting residue was dissolved in 500 μl of water. A portion (10 μg) of the oxidized peptide was then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column that had been equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; elution was performed over 60 min with a linear gradient of 0 to 100% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The major peak (>95%) eluted at 34.0 min and was subjected to analysis with a Voyager-STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer to confirm the sulfonic oxidation state of the peptide.Antibody Production—The sulfonylated Prx peptide (2 mg) was coupled to 10 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) by incubation overnight at room temperature in the presence of 7 mm glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The peptide-hemocyanin conjugate was mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant for the initial injection and with complete Freund's adjuvant for booster injections. After the initial injection with 1 mg of peptide, rabbits were subjected to two booster injections, each of 500 μg of peptide, administered (at multiple subcutaneous sites) at 4-week intervals. Antisera (20–60 ml) were collected 1 week after the second booster injection, and the immunoglobulin G fraction was precipitated with 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. Antibodies that recognized the nonoxidized Prx peptide were removed by treating the immunoglobulin G fraction with the thiol peptide coupled to Affi-Gel-15 affinity resin (Bio-Rad).Preparation of Oxidized Prx I—Recombinant human Prx I (5 μg) was incubated in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 200 μm NADPH, 2.5 μm recombinant human Trx, 46 nm rat Trx reductase, 1 mm H2O2, and 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0).

The separated proteins were transferred eletrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated with the antibodies to the sulfonylated Prx peptide. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). The membrane was also probed with rabbit antibodies to Prx I, to Prx II, or to Prx III, the specificity of which has been described previously (16Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C.

To explore the possibility of immunological detection of Prx proteins containing a hyperoxidized cysteine residue, we prepared rabbit antibodies to the sulfonylated signature peptide. To assess the specificity of the antibodies, we combined oxidized (sulfinylated) and nonoxidized forms of Prx I in various ratios and then subjected equal amounts of these mixtures to immunoblot analysis with the antibodies (Fig. 1A). The intensity of the Prx I band detected by the antibodies increased as the mole fraction of oxidized Prx I increased, suggesting that the antibodies are specific for oxidized Prx. The specificity of the antibody preparation was also apparent from immunoblot analysis of lysates derived from HeLa cells, A549 cells, or Raw264.7 cells that had been treated or not with H2O2 (Fig. 1B). For all three cell types, the antibodies to the sulfonylated Prx peptide detected Prx isoforms (one band for Prx I and Prx II, which contain the same number of amino acid residues, and another for Prx III) only in the H2O2-treated cells, not in the nontreated cells.The active site Cys-SH of Prx is oxidized by H2O2 to sulfinic acid both in vitro and in vivo (10Chae H.Z.

Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The sulfinylated enzyme is resistant to further oxidation, but it undergoes a slow autoxidation to the sulfonylated form when the enzyme is denatured (12Yang K.-S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Oxidized Prx that has been subjected to SDS-PAGE thus contains both sulfinylated and sulfonylated forms of the protein. Given that a sulfonylated peptide was used to generate the rabbit antibodies, we investigated the possibility that the antibodies recognize sulfonylated Prx but not the sulfinylated form of the enzyme. We prepared sulfonylated Prx I by further oxidizing the sulfinylated enzyme with H2O2 under denaturing conditions and then subjected the two forms to immunoblot analysis in an anaerobic chamber with reagents rendered free of oxygen. The resulting blots revealed no substantial difference in intensity between the sulfinylated and sulfonylated Prx I bands, even when the antibodies were diluted until the blot intensities became faint (Fig. 1C). Thus, although a sulfonylated peptide was used as the immunogen, the resulting antibodies recognize both the sulfinylated and sulfonylated forms of Prx with similar avidity, rendering it unnecessary to take special precautions to oxidize Prx completely to the sulfonic state before immunoblot analysis.We next used the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies to monitor the formation and disappearance of sulfinylated Prx enzymes. Raw264.7 cells were exposed to 200 μm H2O2 for 10 min and then incubated for various times in H2O2-free medium in the presence of cycloheximide, after which cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). As observed in Fig. 1B, the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies yielded a pronounced band for both Prx I and Prx II and a lower intensity band for Prx III only in cells exposed to H2O2. The intensity of the band corresponding to oxidized Prx I and Prx II gradually decreased with time after removal of H2O2, whereas the intensities of the bands detected with antibodies to Prx I, to Prx II, or to Prx III remained unchanged during the time course. Exposure of the immunoblot obtained with the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies for a longer period of time also revealed a gradual decrease in the intensity of the oxidized Prx III band, although the rate of this decrease was lower than that apparent with the oxidized Prx I/II band. Given that new protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide, these results are indicative of conversion of the oxidized enzymes rather than of their turnover (degradation of oxidized enzymes and de novo synthesis). We also subjected Raw264.7 cell lysate, together with purified Prx I, Prx II, and Prx III, to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to each Prx isoform (Fig. 2C). By comparing the resulting immunoblot intensities, we estimated that the amounts of Prx I, Prx II, and Prx III in Raw264.7 cells are ∼3, ∼2, and ∼0.7 μg/mg of soluble protein, respectively. Given that the amounts of Prx I and Prx II are similar in these cells and that the immunoblot intensity of the Prx I/II band obtained with the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies decreased to near zero after removal of H2O2 from the culture medium, the sulfinylated forms of both Prx I and Prx II must have been reduced in response to H2O2 withdrawal.Fig. 2Reversible sulfinylation of Prx I, Prx II, and Prx III in Raw264.7 cells monitored by immunoblot analysis with the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies.A and B, Raw264.7 cells were exposed to 200 μm H2O2 for 10 min, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and incubated for various times in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and cycloheximide (10 μg ml—1). Cell lysates (25 and 150 μg of protein, respectively) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (A) or two-dimensional PAGE (B) followed by immunoblot analysis with the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies (α-Prx-SO3) or with antibodies to Prx I (α-Prx I), to Prx II (α–Prx II), or to Prx III (α-Prx III), as indicated. In all panels, the times shown represent the total time elapsed, including the 10-min period of H2O2 treatment. The blot with α-Prx-SO3 shown in A was exposed to x-ray film for 30 s (upper panel) or 60 s (lower panel). The region of the two-dimensional gels shown in B corresponds to molecular sizes (vertical) of 22–28 kDa and to isoelectric points (horizontal) of 7.6–8.2 for Prx I, 4.9–5.6 for Prx II, and 5.9–6.4 for Prx III. The positions of oxidized (Ox) and reduced (Re) Prx enzymes are indicated. C, lysates (5 μg for Prx I and Prx II, 10 μg for Prx III) prepared from untreated Raw264.7 cells and the indicated amounts of recombinant Prx I, Prx II, or Prx III were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the corresponding antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The lysates derived from Raw264.7 cells after treatment with and removal of H2O2 were also subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis before immunoblot analysis. Antibodies to each isoform revealed a near complete acidic shift of Prx I, Prx II, and Prx III on exposure of the cells to H2O2, and this shift was followed by the gradual reversion of the immunoreactive spots to the normal position after H2O2 removal (Fig. 2B). The sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies recognized the acidic spots but not the original or recovered normal spots for the three Prx enzymes. These observations thus support the notion that reduction of the sulfinic moiety is the major mechanism underlying the reversion of acidic Prx enzymes to the normal form (13Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar).Finally, with the use of immunoblot analysis with the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies, we monitored the sulfinylation of Prx isoforms in A549 (Fig. 3A) and HeLa (Fig. 3B) cells that had been exposed to 100 μm H2O2 for 10 min and then allowed to recover in the presence of cycloheximide. For A549 cells, the intensity of the band corresponding to sulfinylated Prx I and Prx II gradually decreased to near zero after removal of H2O2. Given that the abundance of Prx I is much greater than that of Prx II in A549 cells (Fig. 3C), these results show that the sulfinylation of Prx I is reversible in these cells, as was that of Prx II. Although the rates were slower for HeLa cells than for Raw264.7 or A549 cells, the reduction of the three oxidized Prx isoforms was also apparent in HeLa cells.Fig. 3Reversible sulfinylation of Prx I, Prx II, or Prx III in A549 and HeLa cells monitored by immunoblot analysis with the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies.A and B, A549 cells (A) and HeLa cells (B) were exposed to 100 μm H2O2 for 10 min and then allowed to recover from oxidative stress as in Fig. 2A, after which cell lysates (25 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. In all panels, the times shown represent the total time elapsed, including the 10-min period of H2O2 treatment. C, lysates (5 μg for Prx I and Prx II, 10 μg for Prx III) of untreated HeLa or A549 cells and the indicated amounts of recombinant Prx I, Prx II, or Prx III were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the corresponding antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)While this work was in progress, Chevallet et al. (15Chevallet M. Wagner E. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37146-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported that, among the four isoforms of Prx (Prx I, II, III, and VI) they studied, sulfinylation of only Prx II was reversible during recovery of cells from oxidative stress. This study (15Chevallet M. Wagner E. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37146-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was performed by mass spectrometric analysis of spots on two-dimensional gels derived from HeLa cells that had been pulse-labeled with deuterated lysine. The researchers concluded that the regeneration of reduced Prx III and Prx VI was achieved by de novo synthesis, not through reduction of the sulfinylated enzymes. The oxidized Prx I molecules in the acidic spot returned to the normal spot as observed with Prx II. Unexpectedly, however, mass spectrometry revealed that the returned Prx I molecules still harbored cysteine sulfinic acid. Chevallet et al. (15Chevallet M. Wagner E. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37146-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) thus suggested that reversion of the acidic spot corresponding to sulfinylated Prx I to the normal spot corresponding to the reduced enzyme may not be the result of bona fide reduction of sulfinic acid to thiol. This observation indicates that mechanisms other than sulfinic acid reduction (such as dephosphorylation, decarboxylation, deacylation, and arginylation) can result in the shift of Prx I from the acidic spot to the normal spot. Our immunoblot analysis with the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies, however, failed to detect sulfinylated or sulfonylated Prx I in the normal spot of Prx I molecules returned from the acidic spot, suggesting that reduction of sulfinic acid is the major mechanism underlying the acidic-to-normal shift. Although we cannot explain this discrepancy, there are two caveats to the interpretation of the study of Chevallet et al. (15Chevallet M. Wagner E. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37146-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). First, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a sensitive, but not a quantitative, technique. Although it can detect small amounts of sulfinylated enzyme, it cannot determine the percentage of molecules in the normal spot that contain sulfinic acid. Second, the rate of reversion of the oxidized spot to the normal spot was slow in HeLa cells, with the consequence that the mass spectral analysis of the normal spot was performed with <10% of total Prx I molecules (Fig. 7 in Ref. 15Chevallet M. Wagner E. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37146-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Given that the amino acid sequence of Prx I is 80% identical to that of Prx II and that both proteins are located in the cytosol, it is not surprising that both enzymes manifest the same redox chemistry in response to oxidative stress. Prx III also shares 60% sequence identity with Prx II but is located in mitochondria. Our data indicate that sulfinylated Prx III is also reduced during the recovery of cells from oxidative stress, albeit at a rate slower than that apparent for Prx I or Prx II, suggesting that a sulfinyl-reducing system is also present in mitochondria. We were not able to examine the other three mammalian isoforms of Prx (Prx IV to VI) in the present study, because Prx IV (a secreted protein) is not expressed in the three cell types analyzed and the sulfinylation-sulfonylation-specific antibodies do not recognize oxidized Prx V or Prx VI.In conclusion, our study is the first to describe the preparation and characterization of antibodies that specifically recognize sulfinylated or sulfonylated proteins. Our immunoblot method offers distinct advantages relative to existing techniques for the detection of such proteins that require isotopic labeling of cells, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry (13Woo H.A.

The reversible sulfinylation of Prx has been proposed to constitute a mechanism for the regulation of H2O2 signaling (3Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A.

Sulfinylation does not appear to be a rare event, given that 1–2% of the cysteine residues of soluble proteins from rat liver were detected as cysteine sulfinic acid; in contrast, cysteine sulfonic acid was not detected (20Hamann M. Zhang T. Hendrich S. Thomas J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, given that Prx I was recently shown to function as a tumor suppressor in aging mice (21Neumann C.A. Krause D.S. Carman C.V. Das S. Dubey D.P. Abraham J.L. Bronson R.T. Fujiwara Y.

Here we show that oncogenic H-RasV12 contributes to the loss of actin stress fibers by inducing cytoplasmic localization of p21Cip1, which uncouples Rho-GTP from stress fiber formation by inhibiting Rho kinase (ROCK). Concomitant with the loss of stress fibers in Ras-transformed cells, there is a decrease in the phosphorylation level of cofilin, which is indicative of a compromised ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Inhibition of MEK in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 results in restoration of actin stress fibers accompanied by a loss of cytoplasmic p21Cip1, and increased phosphorylation of cofilin. Ectopic expression of cytoplasmic but not nuclear p21Cip1 in Ras-transformed cells was effective in preventing stress fibers from being restored upon MEK inhibition and inhibited phosphorylation of cofilin. p21Cip1 was also found to form a complex with ROCK in Ras-transformed cells in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of the PI 3-kinase pathway resulted in loss of p21Cip1 expression accompanied by restoration of phosphocofilin, which was not accompanied by stress fiber formation. These results suggest that restoration of cofilin phosphorylation in Ras-transformed cells is necessary but not sufficient for stress fiber formation. Our findings define a novel mechanism for coupling cytoplasmic p21Cip1 to the control of actin polymerization by compromising the Rho/ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway by oncogenic Ras.

Strikingly, the level of p21 expression is highly increased in various human cancers such as breast cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma (9.Biankin A.V. Kench J.G. Morey A.L.

One possibility is that p21 is sequestered away from the nucleus in transformed cells thereby preventing it from binding to nuclear cyclin/CDK complexes, thus allowing sufficient cyclin/CDK activity for cell cycle progression (13.Orend G. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Alternatively, relocalization of p21 to the cytoplasm may target cytoplasmic molecules such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) thereby promoting cell survival (7.Asada M. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazono K. Fukumuro K. Mizutani S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, regulate cell morphology, cytokinesis, and cell motility through reorganization of actin filaments (14.Bar-sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The interplay between these GTPases plays a critical role in the regulation of cell morphology and motility. Activation of Rac enhances cell spreading and migration by stimulation of actin polymerization at the plasma membrane and promoting lamellipodia formation. By contrast, Rho stimulates contractility and adhesion by inducing the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Rho cycles between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms, and the GTP-bound form binds to specific targets to exert its biological functions. Two closely related Rho kinases, ROCK-I and -II, have been established to be key downstream effectors of Rho to form stress fibers and focal adhesions (15.Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Rho kinases contribute to the increased actin-myosin II-mediated contractility by directly phosphorylating myosin light chain (MLC) and negatively regulate myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) by phosphorylating myosin binding subunit (MBS) of MLCP (16.Amano M.

Rho kinases also activate LIM kinase, which subsequently phosphorylates cofilin and thereby inhibits its actin-depolymerizing activity, thus leading to stabilization of actin stress fibers (18.Maekawa M.

Cells transformed by oncogenic Ras are characterized not only by deregulated growth control but also pronounced alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and adhesive interactions. Changes in the organization of actin filaments are highly correlated with anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity, suggesting a fundamental role for actin fibers in cell growth control (20.Bondy G.P.

Cell. 2002; 13: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24.Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) have shown that transformation of fibroblasts cells by oncogenic Ras induces constitutive activation of MEK, which causes disruption of actin cytoskeleton by inactivating the Rho-ROCK-LIM kinase pathway. The inhibition of Rho-dependent stress fiber formation contributes to the increased motility of Ras-transformed fibroblasts (24.Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this inactivation has not been elucidated. In this study, we show that cytoplasmic p21 plays a critical role in the morphological and cytoskeletal changes observed in Ras-transformed fibroblasts. We demonstrate that sustained activation of both MEK and PI3K effector pathways are necessary for the elevation of p21 protein in the cytoplasm of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. The cytoplasmic p21 forms a physical complex with ROCK and inhibits its activity, thereby contributing to the loss of actin stress fibers by compromising the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Our findings suggest a novel physiological role for cytoplasmic p21 in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton by oncogenic Ras. Antibodies and Reagents—The mouse monoclonal anti-ROCK-I mAb (clone 46) and anti-ROCK-II mAb (clone 21) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-p21Cip1 mAb and rabbit polyclonal antibody detecting cofilin phosphorylated by LIMK at Ser-3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (hVIN-1) was from Sigma Chemical. The rabbit polyclonal anti-cofilin was from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). The rabbit anti-ROCK-I pAb was kindly provided by Dr. Jian Du in Dr. Greg Hannon's laboratory (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY). Secondary antibodies Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Oregon green-conjugated and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidins were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). U0126, LY294002, and Y27632 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Cell Culture and Retroviral Infection—Normal NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the Tissue Culture Facility of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% BCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidifier air (5% CO2) atmosphere, at 37 °C. The stable cell line expressing H-RasV12 was obtained by the following protocol: pWZL-Hygro H-RasV12 and corresponding empty retroviral vector were used to transfect the ecotropic packaging cell line ϕ NX. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate method. At 72 h post-transfection, viral supernatants were collected, filtered, and supplemented with 4 μg/ml polybrene. The supernatant was then used to infect NIH3T3 cells. After infection, cells were selected in hygromycin (50 μg/ml) for 14 days. Plasmids and Transfection—Retroviral pWZL-Hygro H-RasV12 vector was a generous gift of Yvette Seger in the Hannon laboratory (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). pEGFP-full-length-p21 (amino acids 1–164) and pEGFP-ΔNLS-p21 (amino acids 1–140) were provided by Dr. Minoru Asada (International Medical Center of Japan). pEGFP-N1-XAC, expressing wild-type Xenopus cofilin tagged with EGFP at the C terminus, was kindly provided by James Bamburg (Colorado State University). For transient transfection, cells were grown at 60–70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% BCS. Cells were transfected with a total of 2 μg of expression vectors per dish, using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were split and plated onto glass coverslips followed by incubation for additional 24 h. In some cases, cells on the coverslips were treated with Me2SO, U0126, or LY294002 for various time periods, then the coverslips were harvested and processed for immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, then blocked for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. For immunofluorescence, fixed cells were incubated for 1h with mouse monoclonal p21 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal vinculin antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. To visualize F-actin, Oregon green, or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:100) was diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for staining. The coverslips were stained with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and then mounted using Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Samples were examined, and pictures were acquired on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Photometrics Sensys (Oberkochen, Germany) cooled CCD camera using Openlab 3.1.1 software. All photographs were taken at the same magnification. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared as previously described in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet-P40 including protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) (8.Tanaka H. Yamashita T. Asada M. Mizutani S. Yoshikawa H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 1 h at 4 °C using polyclonal anti-ROCK-I antibody. The immunocomplexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) slurry (50% v/v), washed four times with lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For Western blot, control and treated cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate before direct extraction in 2× SDS Laemmli Sample Buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 10 μg of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The membrane was blocked for 30 min in 5% nonfat dried milk or 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, followed by incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Rho-GTP Pull-down Assay—Measurement of GTP-bound Rho was performed using the Rho Activation Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the RhoA-binding domain of Rhotekin expressed as a GST fusion protein was used to affinity precipitate GTP-bound Rho from cells lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Precipitated Rho-GTP was then detected by immunoblot analysis, using a monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Ras Uncouples Rho-GTP from the ROCK/LIMK/Cofilin Pathway—NIH3T3 fibroblasts have a flat morphology and welldeveloped stress fibers, whereas cells transformed by H-RasV12 are rounded and lack stress fibers (Fig. 1A). RasV12 is known to activate several effector pathways including Raf/MEK/MAP, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and RalGDS (25.Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 92: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 26.Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warme P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To dissect which signaling pathway is necessary for the prevention of stress fiber formation in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, we treated Ras-transformed cells with U0126 or LY294002, which specifically inhibit MEK or PI3K, respectively. We found that the disruption of stress fibers and focal adhesions observed in Ras-transformed cells were reversed by treatment with U0126 but not by LY294002 (Fig. 1A). These observations are in agreement with previous studies that showed that activation of the MEK-dependent pathway, but not PI3K, is necessary for disruption of the actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by oncogenic Ras (23.Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24.Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We also observed that the restoration of stress fibers and focal adhesions by U0126 requires ROCK activity, because either dominant negative ROCK-I or the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, were able to prevent stress fiber formation caused by U0126 (data not shown). The small GTPase, RhoA, is known to act upstream of ROCK and induce the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (14.Bar-sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). To examine whether the cytoskeletal changes induced by Ras oncogene were elicited by regulation of RhoA activity, we measured the levels of Rho-GTP, using an assay that only captures the active GTP-bound form of the GTPase (28.Ren X. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Although three isoforms of Rho protein were described, we measured only RhoA-GTP, because neither RhoB nor RhoC were detectable in NIH3T3 (data not shown). The level of RhoA-GTP in Ras-transformed cells was higher than that in parental NIH3T3 (Fig. 1B), but the difference was abolished by U0126, consistent with the results obtained by others (29.Chen J.C. Zhuang S. Nguyen T.H. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2807-2818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that sustained activation of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is required for the activation of RhoA protein. More importantly, these data demonstrate that active RhoA-GTP, despite its increased level, is no longer coupled via its interaction with ROCK to the formation of stress fibers in Ras-transformed cells. It was previously reported that a MEK-dependent pathway leads to disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in Ras-transformed fibroblasts by down-regulation of ROCK-I/II protein expression (23.Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24.Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In these studies, they showed that the amount of Rho-GTP in Ras-transformed cells was comparable to or higher than that of the untransformed control cells. Therefore, we also compared the levels of ROCK-I/II proteins between untransformed and Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. No changes in the levels of either ROCK-I or -II proteins were detected (Fig. 1C). ROCK-I/II can activate LIM kinase, which in turn phosphorylates cofilin and thereby inhibits its actin-depolymerizing activity, thus leading to stabilization of stress fibers (30.Bamburg J.R. Mcgough A. Ono S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 31.Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To determine if Ras causes any decrease in phosphorylated cofilin in NIH3T3 cells, we used an antibody that detects cofilin phosphorylated by LIM kinase at the Ser-3 residue. We found that cofilin phosphorylation was significantly decreased by expression of Ras (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated cofilin was restored following treatment of Ras-transformed cells with the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 1C). These results indicate an alternative mechanism exists, other than a decrease in ROCK-I/II proteins as previously reported in Ras-transformed NRK and Swiss 3T3 cells (23.Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24.Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), for uncoupling Rho-GTP from activating Rho kinases. Elevated Levels of Cytoplasmic p21 Correlates with the Disruption of Stress Fibers in Ras-transformed Cells—Despite its implied role as a tumor suppressor, the level of p21 protein is significantly elevated in many types of human cancer (2.Roninson I.B. Cancer Letts. 2002; 179: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, we found that p21 protein expression is induced by Ras in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with recent studies showing that Ras activates p21 transcription and promotes p21 protein stability via blocking proteasome-mediated degradation (32.Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2036-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33.Gartel A.L. Najmabadi F. Goufman E. Tyner A.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The p21 protein was decreased in Ras-transformed cells by MEK inhibition in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). It was completely undetectable at 24 h post-treatment of U0126. This demonstrates that the increase in expression of p21 protein in Ras-transformed cells was dependent on sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Interestingly, the decrease of p21 following U0126 treatment was temporally associated with the restoration of stress fibers and increase in cofilin phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B). These observations suggested an inverse relationship between the concentration of p21 protein and the formation of stress fibers. Recently, it was reported that p21 is induced in the cytoplasm during neuronal differentiation and is involved in blocking Rho-induced actin remodeling leading to neurite outgrowth (8.Tanaka H. Yamashita T. Asada M. Mizutani S. Yoshikawa H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine if cytoplasmic p21 was involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, we performed immunofluorescence staining to determine the localization of p21. We found that in 90% of Ras-transformed cells p21 exists abundantly in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Fig. 2C), whereas p21 was not detectable in the majority of asynchronous NIH3T3 cells (data not shown), which is consistent with our Western blot data (Fig. 2A). However, the p21 protein became barely detectable in the cytoplasm of 70% Ras-transformed cells if treated with the MEK inhibitor for 5 h (Fig. 2C). Concomitant with a decrease in cytoplasmic p21, at 5 h post-treatment of U0126, there was an increase in the levels of phosphorylated cofilin, although it was too early to monitor obvious reassembly of stress fibers (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the loss of p21 from the cytoplasm and restoration of cofilin phosphorylation might be associated with MEK inhibition-mediated reassembly of stress fibers. Cytoplasmic p21 Is Sufficient for the Maintenance of Disorganized Stress Fibers in Ras-transformed Cells—To directly determine whether the expression of cytoplasmic p21 is sufficient to block stress fiber formation in Ras-transformed cells, we transfected Ras-transformed cells with either a full-length p21 or p21 with a deletion in the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Following 48 h post-transfection, we treated the cells with U0126 for an additional 24 h, which caused complete loss in the expression of endogenous p21 but not in that of exogenous p21 (data not shown). Therefore, we could determine if ectopic expression of ΔNLS-p21 would affect the restoration of stress fibers by the MEK inhibitor. Ectopic expression of either ΔNLS-p21 or full-length p21 had no effect on the morphology of Ras-transformed cells in the absence of U0126 (Fig. 3A). However, 88% (44/50) of cells expressing the EGFP-ΔNLS-p21 in the cytoplasm were refractory to the restoration of stress fibers caused by MEK inhibition, whereas most of cells expressing the EGFP control or EGFP-full-length p21 in the nucleus failed to show such a resistance (Fig. 3B). We also observed that exogenous p21, but not ΔNLS-p21, relocalized to the nucleus similarly as endogenous p21 following MEK inhibition (Figs. 2C and 3B), confirming that cytoplasmic p21, but not nuclear, conferred such a refractory effect. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ΔNLS-p21, but not full-length p21, was sufficient to cause disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in 47% (39/83) of untransformed NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3C). It is noteworthy that full-length p21 showed nuclear-specific pattern of expression in 90% of transfectants, implying that p21 is normally localized in the nucleus under the absence of oncogenic Ras activation. Collectively, these results suggest that localization of p21 to the cytoplasm by Ras is involved in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In Vivo Interaction of p21Cip1 with ROCK—ROCK is known to act downstream of Rho to induce stress fiber formation in fibroblasts (15.Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In one report, the expression of cytoplasmic p21 promotes neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons by forming complex with ROCK and inhibiting its activity (8.Tanaka H. Yamashita T. Asada M. Mizutani S. Yoshikawa H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine whether endogenous p21 physically interacts with ROCK in vivo, we immunoprecipitated ROCK from Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells in which p21 is highly expressed. We found that endogenous p21 was coprecipitated with an anti-ROCK-I antibody (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that endogenous p21 forms a complex with ROCK-I in vivo. Next, we sought to determine whether ectopic expression of cytoplasmic p21 in NIH3T3 cells could directly interfere with ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. For this purpose, we measured the level of phosphorylation of exogenously expressed cofilin after cotransfecting EGFP-tagged cofilin in combination with ΔNLS-p21 or controls. The phosphorylation of exogenous EGFP-cofilin was significantly reduced by ΔNLS-p21 protein but not by the wild-type p21 (Fig. 4B). In addition, treatment of a specific ROCK inhibitor, Y27632 (10 μm), effectively blocked the phosphorylation of EGFP-cofilin, an observation consistent with the notion that endogenous ROCK is an upstream effector mediating LIM kinase-dependent phosphorylation of exogenous EGFP-cofilin as well (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that association of p21 with ROCK in the cytoplasm is the mechanism by which ROCK/LIMK/cofili"

Here we show that one of its possible functions is to transport cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipoprotein particles by a process involving PLTP interactions with cellular ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). When ABCA1 was induced in murine macrophages or ABCA1-transfected baby hamster kidney cells, PLTP gained the ability to promote cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells. Although PLTP alone had lipid efflux activity, its maximum activity was observed in the presence of high density lipoprotein particles. Pulsechase studies showed that the interaction of PLTP with ABCA1-expressing cells played a role in promoting lipid efflux. Overexpression of ABCA1 dramatically increased binding of both PLTP and apoA-I to common sites on the cell surface. Both PLTP and apoA-I were covalently cross-linked to ABCA1, each protein blocked cross-linking of the other, and both PLTP and apoA-I stabilized ABCA1 protein. These results are consistent with PLTP and apoA-I binding to ABCA1 at the same or closely related sites. Thus, PLTP mimics apolipoproteins in removing cellular lipids by the ABCA1 pathway, except that PLTP acts more as an intermediary in the transfer of cellular lipids to lipoprotein particles.

HDL phospholipids sequester cholesterol that desorbs from the plasma membrane, and lipid-poor HDL apolipoproteins remove both cholesterol and phospholipids by an active transport process.

The discovery of ABCA1 has allowed us to address in more detail the role of ABCA1 in this PLTP-enhanced lipid efflux. Our current findings confirm that ABCA1 expression is required for PLTP lipid efflux activity and that this probably involves direct interactions of PLTP with ABCA1. These studies suggest a model whereby PLTP mimics apolipoproteins in removing cellular lipids by the ABCA1 pathway, except that PLTP requires the presence of lipoprotein acceptor particles for optimum lipid transport activity. Lipoproteins, ApoA-I, and Phospholipid Vesicles—LDL and HDL were prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation in the density range 1.019–1.063 and 1.125–1.21 g/ml, respectively, and HDL was depleted of apoE and apoB by heparin-agarose chromatography (20Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsinized HDL was prepared as previously described (21Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by treating HDL with trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C at an HDL/trypsin protein ratio of 40:1. This procedure digests ∼20% of the total HDL protein content of HDL without disturbing its lipid composition. ApoA-I was purified from HDL, delipidated, and labeled with125I as described previously (20Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL was acetylated by the method of Goldstein et al. (22Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles were prepared with phosphatidylcholine by sonication as described (23Cheung M.C. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recombinant PLTP—Recombinant wild-type and mutant PLTP was isolated by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column chromatography from serum-free conditioned culture medium collected from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with a His-tagged human PLTP cDNA using methotrexate as selection agent (5Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F. Lok S. Tu A.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The isolated PLTP fractions were assayed for phospholipid transfer activity and for purity by SDS-PAGE. Mutant PLTP contained four amino acid substitutions (L16R, L89P, Q270R, and S387P) as described previously (24Hailman E. Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Tu A.Y. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12172-12178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PLTP was labeled with125I using the IODO-BEAD iodination reagent (Pierce) and Na125I to a specific activity of 400–500 cpm/ng of protein, and the integrity of the125I-PLTP was verified by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE gels. Cell Culture and Lipid Efflux—Murine J774 macrophages and BHK cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). BHK cells expressing human ABCA1 were generated using the mifepristone-inducible GeneSwitch System (Invitrogen) as described (25Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Control (mock) BHK cells were derived from the same clonal line transfected with plasmids lacking the ABCA1 cDNA insert. All cells were grown and maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum until experimental treatments. To induce ABCA1 expression, J774 macrophages were incubated for 24 h with DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (DMEM/BSA) plus 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL followed by 20–24-h incubations with DMEM/BSA plus 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM/BSA plus 10 nm mifepristone (25Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Control macrophages were treated identically except without 8-Br-cAMP, and control BHK cells were mock transfectants treated identically. To radiolabel cellular cholesterol, 0.5–1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the acetylated LDL medium (macrophages) or to the growth medium 24 h prior to mifepristone treatment (BHK cells) (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To label phospholipids, 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline chloride (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the induction media followed by two washes of cells (27Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To measure lipid efflux, cells were incubated with DMEM/BSA with or without the indicated acceptor particles for 2–6 h at 37 °C and chilled on ice, and the medium was collected and centrifuged to remove detached cells. For cholesterol efflux, the medium was counted for3H, and the cells were assayed for free and esterified [3H]cholesterol after isolation by thin layer chromatography (27Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For phospholipid efflux, medium and cellular choline-labeled phospholipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol and assayed for3H radioactivity (27Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Lipid efflux was calculated as the percentage of free [3H]cholesterol or [3H]choline-labeled phospholipids released into the medium. Cell Surface and ABCA1 Binding of ApoA-I and PLTP—For the competitive sequential binding assay, BHK cells were first incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with DMEM/BSA containing the indicated concentrations of either apoA-I or PLTP, chilled to 0 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS/BSA, and then incubated for 2 h with ice-cold HEPES-buffered DMEM/BSA containing 2 μg/ml125I-apoA-I or125I-PLTP with or without 300 μg/ml unlabeled apoA-I or PLTP, respectively. Cells were washed twice at 0 °C with PBS/BSA and twice with PBS, and cell-associated radioactivity and cell protein were measured after digestion in 0.1 n NaOH (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as ng of125I-apoA-I or125I-PLTP per mg of cell protein after subtraction of values in the presence of unlabeled apoA-I and PLTP, respectively. For the ABCA1 binding assay, BHK cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml125I-PLTP or125I-apoA-I without or with a 200 μg/ml concentration of either PLTP or apoA-I, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with PBS containing 1 mg/ml DSS (cross-linking agent), washed twice with cold PBS containing 20 mm glycine (to quench cross-linker), and extracted with detergent. ABCA1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, and 125I-labeled ABCA1 was detected by PhosphorImaging (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling of ABCA1—Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with DMEM/BSA containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed and dislodged from the dish at 0 °C in buffer containing protease inhibitors. ABCA1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, and35S-labeled ABCA1 was detected by PhosphorImaging. ABCA1 Stabilization—Cholesterol-loaded J774 macrophages were incubated with DMEM/BSA plus 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 20 h, washed twice with PBS/BSA, and then incubated for 6 h with DMEM/BSA with or without 8-Br-cAMP with or without either 10 μg/ml apoA-I or PLTP. Microsomal membranes were isolated from homogenized cells by ultra-centrifugation, membrane proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and ABCA1 was identified by immunoblot analysis (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of membrane protein were added per gel lane. Our previous studies showed that PLTP enhanced the ability of HDL to promote cholesterol efflux from normal but not Tangier disease fibroblasts (15Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), implicating the involvement of ABCA1. To further test this idea, we examined the effects of PLTP on cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from J774 murine macrophages expressing low and high levels of ABCA1. To distinguish between different mechanisms of lipid efflux, we incubated cells for 6 h with or without PLTP in the presence of either albumin alone (controls) or albumin plus HDL, trypsinized HDL (TrHDL), or purified apoA-I. HDL phospholipids promote efflux of cholesterol and, to a lesser extent, phospholipids by ABCA1-independent diffusional mechanisms, whereas HDL apolipoproteins remove cellular cholesterol and phospholipids by the ABCA1 pathway (14Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, apolipoprotein-digested TrHDL promotes lipid efflux by diffusion only, purified apoA-I by the ABCA1 pathway only, and HDL by both mechanisms (21Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the basal state, where ABCA1 levels are very low, HDL and TrHDL promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages to a greater extent than did apoA-I (Fig. 1A) and had small stimulatory effects on phospholipid efflux (Fig. 1C). The addition of PLTP to these media slightly increased or had no effect on lipid efflux. Thus, when lipid efflux occurs largely by diffusional mechanisms, PLTP has very little lipid efflux activity. When macrophage ABCA1 was induced by 8-Br-cAMP (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 29Smith J.D. Miyata M. Ginsberg M. Grigaux C. Shmookler E. Plump A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28634-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux was markedly increased and exceeded that promoted by either HDL or TrHDL (Fig. 1, B and D). With these cells, the addition of PLTP greatly enhanced cholesterol and phospholipid efflux in the presence of HDL or TrHDL but had little effect in the absence of lipid acceptors or in the presence of apoA-I. These results show that PLTP stimulates cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from J774 macrophages by an ABCA1-dependent process, but this occurs only in the presence of phospholipid-rich HDL particles. To confirm that ABCA1 was involved in the PLTP-enhanced lipid efflux, we measured the effects of PLTP on cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from BHK cells transfected with an inducible ABCA1 gene (25Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). With mock-transfected cells, where ABCA1 protein is barely detectable (25Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), apoA-I had no ability to promote cholesterol or phospholipid efflux above control levels (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, both HDL and TrHDL promoted significant cholesterol efflux and small levels of phospholipid efflux. The addition of PLTP to each of these media had no effect on lipid efflux. Inducing ABCA1 expression in these transfected cells led to an increase in HDL-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux and activated apoA-I-mediated lipid transport (Fig. 2, B and D). As with J774 macrophages, PLTP had little effect on cholesterol or phospholipid efflux when added to the apoA-I-containing medium but markedly enhanced efflux of these lipids in the presence of HDL or TrHDL. With these ABCA1-expressing cells, the addition of PLTP to the control medium also significantly increased cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. The studies with ABCA1 transfectants suggest that PLTP has the ability to stimulate lipid efflux even in the absence of other lipid acceptors. To confirm this, we measured cholesterol efflux from mock- and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells during incubations with increasing concentrations of PLTP added to medium containing no acceptors, including albumin. Results showed a concentration-dependent increase in cholesterol efflux only from the ABCA1 transfectants (Fig. 3). These results indicate that PLTP alone is capable of removing cholesterol from cells expressing high levels of ABCA1. We also measured cholesterol efflux in the presence of the same concentrations of heat-inactivated PLTP or a mutant form of PLTP having ∼10% normal phospholipid transfer activity (24Hailman E. Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Tu A.Y. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12172-12178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Heat-inactivated PLTP completely lacked cholesterol efflux activity, and mutant PLTP had a markedly reduced activity (Fig. 3B). These results show that the PLTP-stimulated cholesterol efflux from ABCA1 transfectants was not simply due to an increase in protein mass but required some structural determinants associated with its phospholipid transfer activity. We examined the effects of PLTP on ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in the presence of non-HDL phospholipid particles. LDL and phospholipid vesicles stimulated cholesterol efflux from both mock- and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells (Fig. 4). The addition of PLTP to these media enhanced cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-transfected cells (Fig. 4B) but not from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A), but the incremental increase was similar to that seen when PLTP was added to control medium alone. Thus, the PLTP effect on ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux appears to have some selectivity for HDL particles. The above results suggest that the direct interaction of PLTP with ABCA1-expressing cells plays a role in promoting cholesterol efflux. To test this possibility further, we first incubated cells for 4 h with PLTP and then measured cholesterol efflux from washed cells during 2-h incubations without PLTP but with different acceptors. Pretreatment of ABCA1-transfected cells with PLTP significantly increased subsequent cholesterol efflux in the presence of albumin alone (control) or albumin plus either HDL, TrHDL, LDL, or phospholipid vesicles (Fig. 5A). The relative increase was smaller than when PLTP was added directly to the lipoprotein-containing medium, as would be expected if only the small amount of prebound PLTP was enhancing cholesterol efflux. This pretreatment had no effect when ABCA1-transfected cells were subsequently incubated with apoA-I or when mock-transfected cells were incubated with any of these acceptors (Fig. 5B). These results support the concept that the interaction of PLTP with cells rather than with lipoproteins in solution is primarily responsible for the enhanced lipid efflux. Induction of ABCA1 increases the number of high affinity cell surface binding sites for apoA-I (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 31Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). We performed cross-competitive binding studies to determine whether PLTP also interacts with these same sites. ABCA1 induction in BHK cells increased high affinity binding of125I-PLTP and125I-apoA-I 14- and 12-fold, respectively (Fig. 6). For the cross-competition studies, we pretreated cells at 37 °C for 4 h with increasing concentrations of competitor, washed the cells, and then measured binding of125I-labeled PLTP or apoA-I after subsequent 2-h incubations at 0 °C. This sequential protocol is effective because apolipoproteins dissociate slowly from their high affinity binding sites at 0 °C, and thus most of these sites remain blocked at this temperature during the first several hours after the removal of apolipoproteins (21Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This approach has the advantage of minimizing interactions between ligand and competitor in solution, which can give false positive results. Preincubating cells with increasing concentrations of unlabeled apoA-I blocked 80% of the subsequent binding of 125I-PLTP (Fig. 6A), and preincubating cells with increasing concentrations of PLTP blocked 67% of the subsequent binding of125I-apoA-I (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that PLTP and apoA-I interact with common high affinity binding sites on ABCA1-expressing cells. To obtain evidence for the functional significance of these binding sites, we tested the effects of increasing concentrations of PLTP on apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from BHK cells. Since PLTP has less ability than apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux in the absence of HDL (Fig. 2), increasing ratios of PLTP to apoA-I should inhibit cholesterol efflux if saturable common binding sites are involved. Although PLTP had no effect on ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux at similar apoA-I to PLTP mass ratios (10 μg/ml each) (Fig. 2), raising the concentration of PLTP progressively decreased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells (Fig. 6C). A significant inhibition was observed at a PLTP to apoA-I mass ratio of 2.5:1. Thus, the binding sites shared by apoA-I and PLTP appear to play a role in ABCA1-dependent cholesterol transport. Cross-linking studies have suggested that apoA-I binds directly to ABCA1 (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 31Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We tested whether this is also the case for PLTP by incubating mock- and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells with125I-PLTP, treating cells with the cross-linking agent DSS, isolating ABCA1 by immunoprecipitation, and detecting125I-labeled ABCA1 by phosphorimaging of SDS-PAGE gels. Results with ABCA1-transfected cells showed a single iodinated band with an apparent molecular mass greater than 300 kDa that was barely visible in mock-transfected cells and was markedly reduced in intensity when the binding incubations were performed in the presence of a 100-fold excess unlabeled PLTP or apoA-I (Fig. 7A). No band was evident in the absence of DSS (not shown). Excess unlabeled PLTP or apoA-I also blocked cross-linking of125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 (Fig. 7B). These findings suggest that PLTP and apoA-I bind to ABCA1 by the same or very similar mechanisms. The interaction of apoA-I with cells stabilizes ABCA1 protein by interfering with its calpain-mediated degradation (33Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 34Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that PLTP also stabilizes ABCA1 by comparing the effects of apoA-I and PLTP on the level of ABCA1 protein in J774 macrophages, which were shown previously to have a rapid turnover rate of ABCA1 protein (35Wang Y. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5692-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). When ABCA1 was induced by cholesterol loading and 8-Br-cAMP treatment, the addition of either apoA-I or PLTP to the cAMP medium for the last 6 h of incubation led to a severalfold increase in the membrane content of ABCA1 (Fig. 8A). When cAMP was removed from the medium during this 6 h, the level of ABCA1 was markedly reduced, consistent with degradation of the preformed protein after the removal of inducer (26Oram J.F.

There is an urgent need to develop new effective antituberculosis drugs with bactericidal mechanisms different from those of the presently available agents.

Recently, ISO was shown to have considerable antimycobacterial activity in vitro and to be effective against various clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the range of 1-10 μg/ml (8Phetsuksiri B.

An early note reported that ISO, like isoniazid (INH) and ethionamide (ETH), strongly inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids (9Winder F.G. Collins P.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 63: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a result since confirmed with the demonstration that all types of mycolic acids are affected (8Phetsuksiri B. Baulard A. Cooper A.M. Minnikin D.E. Douglas J.D. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition it was noted that ISO also inhibited shorter chain fatty acid synthesis (8Phetsuksiri B. Baulard A. Cooper A.M. Minnikin D.E. Douglas J.D. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Winder F.G. Collins P.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 63: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Winder F.G. Ratledge C.

Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), cultured on Luria-Bertani broth or agar medium (Invitrogen) and containing kanamycin at a concentration of 25 μg/ml, was used for generating recombinant clones. Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain 1173P2 was used for whole-cell labeling, MIC determinations, cell-free reactions, and expression of M. tuberculosis H37Rv desA1, desA2, and desA3 genes. Liquid cultures of M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27711) were grown in Sauton medium containing 0.025% tyloxapol (12Sauton B. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1912; 155: 860-861Google Scholar). Recombinant M. bovis BCG clones were selected on Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) enrichment (Difco) (13Cohn M.L. Waggoner R.F. McClatchy J.K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1968; 98: 295-296PubMed Google Scholar) or on Sauton medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin. To determine whether the addition of this oleic acid supplement could override the effects of ISO, a series of 10-fold dilutions of M. tuberculosis was prepared from stock culture in a glycerol-alanine-salts medium with phosphate-buffered saline as diluent. An aliquot (5 μl) of each dilution was spotted on two types of agar plates, those with 7H11 agar medium supplemented with OADC or those with non-oleic acid-containing ADC (albumin-dextrose-catalase), prepared with the incorporation of ISO to a final concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 μg/ml. After inoculation, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 21 days. The growth rates and bactericidal effects were scored by comparing size and number of colonies on plates. Whole-cell Radiolabeling and Analysis of the in Vivo Effects of ISO and Sterculic Acid on Fatty Acid and Mycolic Acid Synthesis—Mycobacteria were grown in Sauton medium at 37 °C to A600 nm 0.250. ISO (a gift from Dr. P. Draper, National Institute of Medical Research, London, UK) was added followed by further incubation for 8 h before the addition of 1,2-[14C]acetate (110 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml. Cells were labeled for 24 h, harvested, washed, saponified with 15% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide at 100 °C overnight, methylated, and extracted (8Phetsuksiri B. Baulard A. Cooper A.M. Minnikin D.E. Douglas J.D. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts containing equal amounts of radiolabeled fatty acid methyl esters and mycolic acid methyl esters from control and ISO-treated cells were subjected to TLC on silica gel plates (silica gel 60 F254, Merck) that had been impregnated with 10% silver nitrate and activated (14Morris L.J. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 717-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plates were developed twice in petroleum ether-acetone (90:10), radioactive bands were located by autoradiography, and the oleic acid methyl ester standard was visualized by spraying with 10% sulfuric acid and anisaldehyde (15Dunphy P.J. Kerr J.D. Pennock J.F. Whittle K.L. Feeney J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 136: 136-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To analyze the effects of ISO on the synthesis of individual fatty acids, extracted methyl esters were treated with Trisil® (Pierce) to silate any free hydroxyl groups, and products were dissolved in hexane and injected onto a capillary HP-1 column (5 m × 0.53 mm inner diameter) (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) coupled to a Hewlett Packard HP 5890 Series II GC with a thermal conductivity detector attached to a GC-RAM™ radio detector (Inus Systems, Tampa, FL). The initial column temperature was 80 °C, which was increased to 185 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min, followed by an increase at the rate of 5 °C/min to a final temperature of 345 °C. The eluted peaks of labeled FAMEs were identified by comparison of their retention time with those of available fatty acid methyl ester standards. Analysis of the effects of sterculic acid, the Δ9-desaturase inhibitor, on oleic acid synthesis was performed by whole cell labeling with [1,2-14C]acetate followed by argentation TLC and GC analysis, as described above. The effects of sterculic acid and ISO on mycolic acid synthesis were compared by argentation TLC. Confirmation of Position of Double Band in Mono-unsaturated Fatty Acid—Fatty acids were derived from harvests of M. tuberculosis H37Rv wild type, M. bovis BCG wild type, and M. bovis BCG overexpressing M. tuberculosis desA3 and converted to the methyl esters (8Phetsuksiri B. Baulard A. Cooper A.M. Minnikin D.E. Douglas J.D. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methyl esters (0.5 mg) were dissolved in 50 μl of a pyridine-dioxane mixture (1:8) followed by the addition of 500 μg of OsO4 in 50 μl of dioxane (16Evans J.E. Dulaney J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The solution was allowed to stand for 2 h at room temperature followed by another hour after the addition of 1.5 ml of a suspension of 16% Na2SO3 in water-methanol (1:3:4). The mixture was gradually acidified to pH 3.0 with HCl and extracted twice with n-hexane. The combined hexane extracts were dried under nitrogen and silated as described above. The osmium-oxidized-silated products were dissolved in n-hexane, and 1-μl aliquots were analyzed by GC/mass spectroscopy (Thermo-Quest gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer) under the following operating conditions: 30-m by 0.25-mm capillary column (Supelco); oven temperature, 60 to 170 °C at 30 °C for 1 min, then from 170 to 300 °C at 4 °C min-1; carrier gas, He; total running time, 32 min. The following fatty acid methyl esters, C18:1 Δ6, C18:1 Δ7, C18:1 Δ9, C18:1 Δ11, C18:1 Δ12, C18:1 Δ15, purchased from Supelco Inc. (Bellefonte, PA), were likewise oxidized and analyzed. Cell-free Reaction for Analysis of the in Vitro Effect of ISO on Oleic Acid Synthesis—The wild type M. bovis BCG strain was grown in Sauton medium supplemented with FeSO4 (20 mg/liter) (17Kashiwabara Y. Nakagawa H. Matsuki G. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 78: 803-810Google Scholar) and 0.025% Tyloxapol. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, pulse-disrupted by probe sonication, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The Δ9-stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was assayed as described with minor modifications (18Fulco A.J. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 993-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture containing 1 μmol of NADPH (Sigma) in 0.1 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 2 mg of the M. bovis BCG 27,000 × g supernatant in a total volume of 1 ml. Mixtures were preincubated in the presence or absence of ISO (dissolved in 20 μl of a solution in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide and 1% Tween 20) at 37 °C for 20 min before the addition of 25 nmol (0.25 μCi) of [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA (10 μCi/μmol in 0.01 m 1:1 sodium acetate:ethanol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Purified recombinant six-histidine-tagged protein (3.7-22 μg) produced in M. bovis BCG was added to some assays. After further incubation at 37° for 30 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 ml of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution, saponified, and methylated. The radiolabeled products were resolved by argentation-TLC in petroleum ether:acetone (90:10, two developments), and the incorporation of radioactivity into oleic acid was analyzed using a Bioscan System 2000 Imaging Scanner (Bioscan Inc., Washington, D.C.). Detection of M. tuberculosis desA3 Transcript—M. tuberculosis H37Rv was maintained in Sauton broth for RNA isolation and subsequent RT-PCR. After the addition of lysozyme and proteinase K to a cell suspension in RNase-free water, total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The purified RNA was used subsequently in RT-PCR to detect desA3 transcripts. Reverse transcription and PCR were carried out sequentially in a single tube using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences). Each room-stable bead contained Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor, buffer, nucleotides, Taq DNA polymerase, and 30 μl of RNA template in RNase free water. The RT-PCR reaction was conducted in a programmable master-gradient thermal machine (Eppendorf, Germany) using specific desA3 primers 5′-GGT GAC CGA CTT AGC CAT ACG CTT-3′ (upper primer) and 5′-AGC ATC ACC TCT ATC CGG AC TGC C-3′ (lower primer). The thermal program involved reverse transcription at 55 °C for 30 min followed by the initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min. The amplification was performed for 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The final extension was set at 72 °C for 10 min. Negative controls contained all reaction components except the RNA template. To determine whether transcribed mRNA or contaminating DNA was amplified, purified nucleic acids were subjected to DNase and RNase treatment before cDNA synthesis and PCR. The amplicons obtained from RT-PCR were analyzed for the 341-bp fragment specific for M. tuberculosis desA3 by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (0.089 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.044 m boric acid, and 0.001 m EDTA) at 100 V for 1 h. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV transillumination. Cloning and Overexpression of the M. tuberculosis desA Gene Family in M. bovis BCG—Two primers were designed to correspond to the 5′ and 3′ ends of each open reading frame previously identified as M. tuberculosis desA1 and desA2 (Rv0824c and Rv1094, respectively) (20Cole S.T. Blosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Kinglmei K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krongh A. McLean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Osborne J. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rogers J. Rutter S. Seeger K. Skelton J. Squares S. Squares R. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrel B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar). A 1034-base pair fragment of desA1 was PCR amplified with the primers 5′-CTCTGAATTCTCACCGGGCTAACGAC-3′ and 5′-CAGCCAAACTGACCGACCTGCA-3′, sense and antisense, respectively. A similar strategy was used to amplify a 895-base pair fragment of desA2 with the primers 5′-CACAAAACCTGTTGCTGAAGCCGCTGACCC-3′ and 5′-GCTAGAATTCGAGTGCGACGCTACTCCG-3′. Underlined sequences indicate the introduced EcoRI restriction sites. The PCR-amplified desA1 and desA2 genes were gel-purified, cut with EcoRI, and cloned into BalI-EcoRI sites of pMV261 under the control of the transcriptional and translational signals of the heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) promoter (21Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Benet L.T. Bansal P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). The desA3, Rv3329c, was overexpressed in pVV16, a derivative of pMV261, allowing the production of C-terminal six-histidine-tagged fusion proteins under the control of the phsp60 promoter (22Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The desA3 gene was amplified using the primers 5′-GTCGAGCAAAGCTTGGCTGCCAGATCGTC-3′ and 5′-AGGGAGAAGCATATGGCGATCACTGACGTC-3′ (underlined sequences correspond to HindIII and NdeI restriction sites, respectively). The 1360-base pair PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into the similarly digested pVV16. The resulting expression vectors, pMV261desA1, pMV261desA2, and pVV16desA3, were electroporated into M. bovis BCG competent cells as described (23Kremer L. Baulard A. Estaquier J. Content J. Capron A. Locht C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the production of recombinant DesA1, DesA2, and DesA3 proteins was then analyzed by immunoblotting (DesA1 and DesA3) or SDS-PAGE stained with silver nitrate and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (DesA2). Total protein extracts from each strain were loaded, separated on 0.1% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). The production of recombinant DesA1 and six-histidine-tagged DesA3 proteins was revealed using primary anti-DesA1 antibodies raised in a mouse (a gift from Dr. Brigitte Gicquel) and primary mouse anti-His-tagged antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary mouse antibodies (Sigma) were then used, and color detection for proteins was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega, Madison, WI). To locate DesA3 within the bacterial cell, Western blotting was performed using subcellular fractions prepared from the DesA3-His-tagged recombinant strain. The cytosol was recovered as the supernatant after centrifugation of cell lysate at 200,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet represented the cell membrane fraction. Aliquots (100 μg) of protein from each fraction were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Alignment of amino acid sequences was achieved with Multalign (www.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin.html). Purification of Recombinant His-tagged M. tuberculosis DesA3—The recombinant M. bovis BCG containing pVV16/desA3 were grown to mid-log phase (A600 0.7) at 37 °C in Sauton medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin and 20 mg/liter FeSO4. Cells were harvested and washed once in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 8. The cell pellet (20 g wet weight) was subsequently resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm MOPS, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 500 mm NaCl) and sonicated for 10 cycles (60 s on; 90 s off) on ice. After the cell lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 g for 30 min, the resulting supernatant was collected and loaded onto a 1-ml metal BD-Talon™ resin-chelating column (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) previously equilibrated with 20 ml of buffer A. Column washing was performed with 25 ml of buffer A followed by 25 ml of buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted using buffer A containing 50, 100, or 200 mm imidazole. The elution fractions were checked by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and Western blot. The 200 mm imidazole fraction, which contained His-tagged M. tuberculosis DesA3, was subsequently adjusted to a volume of 2.5 ml with buffer B (10 mm MOPS pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol), desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and concentrated, and the protein concentration was measured before the determination of the enzymatic function of the purified protein. Determination of the Effect of Overexpression of desA3 on the MIC of ISO—The microplate alamar blue assay as modified from Yajko et al. (24Yajko D.M. Madej J.J. Lancaster M.V. Sanders C.A. Cawthon V.L. Gee B. Babst A. Hadley W.K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2324-2327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the MIC of ISO. Inocula were prepared from M. bovis BCG and the recombinant strain harboring the pVV16desA3 construct. Cells were grown in Sauton medium containing 0.025% Tyloxapol to a turbidity equal to that of a No. 1 McFarland standard (∼2.0 × 107 colony-forming units/ml). Serial dilutions of ISO from a stock solution in Me2SO were prepared in Sauton medium. Duplicated treatments with different concentrations of ISO were conducted. Four controls were included that contained medium-only, culture-only, medium plus Me2SO, and culture plus Me2SO. At the outset, 10× alamar blue solution was added to the controls. After incubation overnight at 37 °C in a moisture control chamber, alamar blue was added to all treated wells. Plates were further incubated, and the color in each treated culture was recorded. MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of ISO for which the blue dye in the treated culture did not turn pink. ISO Inhibits the Synthesis of Unsaturated Fatty Acids and Mycolic Acids—Previous studies with [1,2-14C]acetate as a precursor of fatty acid synthesis showed that ISO inhibited the synthesis of both mycolic acids and shorter chain fatty acids in M. tuberculosis (8Phetsuksiri B. Baulard A. Cooper A.M. Minnikin D.E. Douglas J.D. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this latter respect, ISO differed from INH and ETH, suggesting a different mode of action of ISO. To evaluate the effects of ISO on the synthesis of saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and mycolic acids, extracts containing 14C-labeled fatty acid and mycolic acid methyl esters were prepared from untreated and ISO-treated M. tuberculosis cultures and analyzed by argentation-TLC. In the presence of ISO at concentrations as low as 1 μg/ml, there was an apparent decided decrease in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids concomitant with a partial increase in the synthesis of saturated fatty acids (Fig. 2). Measurement of the radioactive counts in the relevant bands established that ISO at 1.0 μg/ml inhibited unsaturated fatty acid synthesis by 60%. The effect of ISO on mycolic acid synthesis, reported previously (8Phetsuksiri B. Baulard A. Cooper A.M. Minnikin D.E. Douglas J.D. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can also be seen by this simple analysis; clearly, ISO inhibited the incorporation of [1,2-14C]acetate into all types of resolved mycolic acids (Fig. 2). The cellular fatty acids synthesized under present conditions by M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG are palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, and tuberculostearic acid (Fig. 3, A and C), in accord with earlier reports (25Chou S. Chedore P. Haddad A. Paul N.R. Kasatiya S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 1317-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chou S. Chedore P. Kasatiya S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 577-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG treated with ISO at 2.0 μg/ml, the incorporation of [1,2-14C]acetate into oleic acid and tuberculostearic acid was almost totally eliminated as determined by radio-GC (Fig. 3, B and D). Similar results were obtained at 1 μg/ml ISO. The Effects of Oleic Acid Supplement on Partial Rescue of M. tuberculosis from ISO—The observations that ISO inhibited oleic acid synthesis in M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG led to the concept that supplementation of the growth medium with oleic acid should rescue cells from the killing effect of ISO. The addition of oleic acid to the 7H11 agar medium in the form of the OADC partially reversed the bactericidal effect of ISO; there was comparable growth on the OADC-supplemented medium with or without ISO; however, the albumin-dextrose complex without oleic acid could not support growth in the presence of ISO (Fig. 4). Demonstration of Δ9 Desaturase Activity in Cell-free Extracts and the Effects of ISO—The specific inhibition of oleic acid synthesis by ISO suggested that the drug target is the aerobic desaturation system responsible for the synthesis of oleic acid from stearoyl-CoA in mycobacteria (17Kashiwabara Y. Nakagawa H. Matsuki G. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 78: 803-810Google Scholar, 18Fulco A.J. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 993-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fulco A.J.

To test this hypothesis M. bovis BCG was grown in iron-supplemented medium, sonicated, and centrifuged at low speed, and both the cell wall pellet and the supernatant containing both cytosol and plasma membrane were assayed for Δ9 fatty acid desaturase activity. The assay was performed as originally described by Fulco and Bloch (18Fulco A.J. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 993-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For instance, ferrous ions were added to the culture medium rather than to the reaction mixture itself because iron was shown to be required at the terminal stage of synthesis and/or assembly of the desaturase system (17Kashiwabara Y. Nakagawa H. Matsuki G. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 78: 803-810Google Scholar). Only the supernatant allowed the conversion of stearoyl-CoA to the oleic acid derivative in the presence of atmospheric oxygen and NADPH. Consistent with the findings of Fulco and Bloch (18Fulco A.J. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 993-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the absence of NADPH in the assay mixture, no oleic acid was detected. ISO consistently inhibited the incorporation of radioactivity into the oleic acid, but not into stearic acid, by 7% at 0.1 μg/ml and 61% at a concentration of 1.0 μg of ISO/ml in one typical experiment. Overexpression of M. tuberculosis desA1, desA2, and desA3 Genes in M. bovis BCG and Evidence That desA3 Encodes a Fatty Acid Desaturase—Three open reading frames in the genome of M. tuberculosis are annotated as putative fatty acid desaturases: desA1, desA2, and desA3 (20Cole S.T. Blosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Kinglmei K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies K. Feltwell T.

Squares R. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrel B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar). All three open reading frames of desA were amplified by PCR, cloned in-frame into the mycobacterial expression vector pMV261 or pVV16, and constitutively expressed under the control of the hsp60 promoter in M. bovis BCG. Production of all three proteins was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and staining with silver and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Des A2) or by immunoblotting (DesA1, DesA3) (results not shown). To assess the cloned open reading frames for Δ9-desaturase activity, the three overexpression strains and M. bovis BCG wild type were labeled with [1,2-14C]acetate, and their derived fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by argentation-TLC. Quantitation of the production of [14C]oleic acid was performed by scraping and counting the bands corresponding to the methyl ester of oleate. The des"

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; VCP, valosin-containing protein; ALG-2, apoptosis-linked gene-2; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein of 78 kilodaltons; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; RNAi, RNA interference; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS, nano-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with tandem mass spectrometry; Thaps, thapsigargin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; IEF, isoelectric focusing; NDK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNAs. is the principal organelle for proteins destined for the secretory pathway and is also the site of biosynthesis for steroids and many lipids. Any alterations in the ER environment, such as perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis, elevated secretory protein synthesis, deprivation of glucose or other sugars, altered glycosylation, and/or the accumulation of misfolded proteins, may cause ER stress and consequently cell death (1.Kaufman R.J.

Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). It has been shown that misfolded proteins lead to an ER stress response, whether the misfolded proteins build up within the ER or outside the ER (e.g. in the nucleus or cytosol) (3.Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Jimbo A. Kikuchi T. Yamagata T. Momoi M.Y. Kominami E. Kuida K. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Momoi T. Hum. Mol.

This may be because interference with proteasomal degradation by misfolded proteins in any cellular compartment may inhibit proteasomal degradation of misfolded ER proteins that would otherwise be degraded by the proteasome following translocation out of the ER (4.Nishitoh H.

Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death (8.Lockshin R.A. Williams C.M. J. Insect Physiol. 1964; 10: 643-649Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 9.Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12912) Google Scholar), is triggered by ER stress by an unknown mechanism. Apoptotic pathways have been divided into an extrinsic pathway, which is triggered by cell death receptors such as Fas and mediated by the aspartyl-specific cysteine protease caspase-8 or caspase-10, and an intrinsic pathway, which is triggered by the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and its subsequent complex formation with Apaf-1, (d)ATP, and caspase-9 (10.Earnshaw W.C.

In contrast, apoptosis triggered by ER stress proceeds via an alternative intrinsic pathway that does not require cytochrome c or Apaf-1 (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M.

All three of these pathways require the formation of molecular complexes that mediate caspase activation; in the case of the intrinsic pathway, this complex has been referred to as an apoptosome (10.Earnshaw W.C.

Although the molecular components that mediate ER stress-induced cell death have not been identified previously, recent studies (21.Kilic M. Schafer R. Hoppe J. Kagerhuber U. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22.Hoppe J. Kilic M. Hoppe V. Sachinidis A. Kagerhuber U. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have suggested that ER-based caspase-12 zymogen is present as part of a high molecular weight (greater than 600 kDa) complex. In order to discern the mechanism(s) by which ER stress triggers cell death pathways, we developed a cell-free system of ER stress-induced cell death that involves the addition of microsomes to a 400,000 × g supernatant (100,000 rpm) that lacks both Apaf-1 and cytochrome c. Initial studies indicated that microsomes isolated from thapsigargin-treated cell extracts are capable of mediating an Apaf-1 and mitochondrial-independent intrinsic cell death pathway (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M. Stoka V. Del Rio G. Bredesen D.E. Ellerby H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21836-21842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This system provided an opportunity to purify functional components and deplete candidate components that mediate ER stress-induced cell death. In the present study, we have used a set of complementary approaches, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS, RNA interference, co-immunoprecipitation, immunodepletion of candidate proteins, and reconstitution studies, to identify mediators of the ER stress-induced cell death pathway. The present work describes the use of these approaches to identify two molecules, valosin-containing protein (VCP) and apoptosis-linked gene-2 (ALG-2), that appear to play a role in mediating ER stress-induced cell death in at least some paradigms. Cells and Culture Conditions—Apaf-1–/–-immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts and the human embryonic kidney 293T cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Apaf-1–/–-immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived by retrovirally driven T-antigen expression in Apaf-1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts provided by Dr. Peter Gruss, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany. Cell-free Extracts, Cell Fractionation, and Western Blotting—Cell-free cytoplasmic extracts and microsomes were prepared as described previously (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H.

The 20,000 × g (14,000 rpm, Eppendorf Centrifuge, 5417R) supernatant that lacks whole cells, nuclei, and mitochondria was recentrifuged at 400,000 × g (100,000 rpm Beckman Coulter Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge) for 1 h for the preparation of microsomes. The resulting supernatant contains the soluble cytosolic fraction (S), and the microsomal pellet (P) represents the ER membrane and lumen proteins as well as Golgi membranes. Cellular fractions were also probed with anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody and anti-β-tubulin as standard marker proteins for ER and cytosol, respectively. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were performed as described earlier (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M. Stoka V. Del Rio G. Bredesen D.E. Ellerby H.M. J. Biol.

Membranes were probed with a 1:500 dilution of caspase-3 polyclonal antibody or a mouse-specific anti-caspase-9 polyclonal antibody (both from Cell Signaling Laboratories), a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-PDI, a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-β-tubulin, a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-VCP monoclonal antibody (all from BD Pharmingen), a 1:750 dilution of rabbit anti-ALG-2 (Swant, Switzerland), 1:2500 dilution of rabbit anti-nm23H-1 (NDK; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a 1:100 dilution of anti-caspase-12 antibody (gift of Dr. Junying Yuan), or a 1:500 dilution of caspase-12 antibody (Exalpha Biologicals, Inc.). Purification Procedures—The resuspended microsomal fraction from untreated and 0.5 μm thapsigargin-treated cells (24 h) was loaded onto a 5 × 100-cm Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). The fractions eluted from the column were analyzed for caspase cleaving activity. All fractions that were capable of cleaving procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 completely were pooled and subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Protocol for the Identification of Microsomal Proteins—Crude microsomes, partially purified microsomal fractions, or 20,000 × g supernatants from untreated and thapsigargin-treated Apaf-1–/– cells or 293T cells were prepared as described above. Samples were prepared for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Protein spots of interest were manually excised from the gel and processed for trypsin digestion (Promega) at 37 °C for 4 h. The resulting tryptic peptides were then extracted from the gel by aqueous 10% formic acid extraction and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectra of digested gel spots were obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Voyager DESTR TOF (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The obtained mass spectra were externally calibrated with an equimolar mixture of angiotensin I, ACTH(1–17), ACTH(18–39), and ACTH(7–38). In some cases, the proteolytic peptide mixtures were also analyzed by reverse-phase nanohigh pressure liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Mass spectrometric data were analyzed with the bioinformatics data base system RADARS (Genomic Solutions) (24.Field H.I. Fenyo D. Beavis R.C. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) using the search engine ProFound for Peptide Mass Fingerprints matching against peptides from known protein sequences entered in publicly available protein data bases (e.g. NCBI). Immunoprecipitations and Immunodepletions—Transient transfection, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M.

Briefly, Apaf-1–/– cells were transfected with 6 μg of pcDNA3, FLAG-pC9, or pC12. Twenty four hours later, ER stress was induced with 50 nm thapsigargin (Thaps). Cells were gently lifted 12 h after thapsigargin treatment, washed once with PBS at room temperature, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (500 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA). A total of 500–1000 μg of protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation. The lysate was first pre-cleared with an appropriate control IgG corresponding to the host species of the primary antibody. The pre-cleared cell lysate was incubated with 0.5–5 μg of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Later, 20 μl of the appropriate resuspended agarose conjugate was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1–6 h. After extensive washes, proteins bound to protein A-Sepharose or protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were subjected to (a) one-dimensional SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis or (b) two-dimensional IEF SDS-PAGE for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. For immunodepletion and caspase-processing assays, microsomes were isolated from cell-free 20,000 × g (14,000 rpm, Eppendorf Centrifuge, 5417R) extracts prepared from thapsigargin-treated cells, as described above. The microsomal pellet was washed twice with 10 mm Tris-Cl/NaCl, pH 7.4, reconstituted in the same buffer, and briefly sonicated to disperse the pellet fraction. A total of 50–100 μg of protein was subjected to immunodepletion using either mouse or goat anti-VCP antibody, anti-ALG-2 antibody, anti-NDK antibody, or anti-AIF monoclonal antibody conjugated to Sephadex beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunodepletion of samples in all panels was also performed with control antibodies of the same type (Fig. 3, a and b, 3rd lanes). Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C with the antibodies, protein A/G-Sepharose was added to the samples and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 6 h. Samples were spun briefly to pellet the protein A/G-Sepharose conjugate. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed for (a) the respective immunodepleted protein that would indicate the extent of immunodepletion of the candidate protein, and (b) probed for GRP78 or PDI as ER marker proteins to serve as loading controls. Additionally, caspase processing assays were carried out by incubating 50–100 μg of the supernatant protein at 36 °C for 1 h with untreated 400,000 × g supernatants isolated from untreated cells. Following the reactions, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Membranes were probed with anticaspase-9 antibody. siRNA Synthesis—Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were generated by in vitro transcription using the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit from Ambion. siRNAs were designed to target two or more regions each for ALG-2, VCP, AIF, and NDK-A (nm23-H1) based on predicted accessible (loop) and unique (specific) regions. The following siRNA sequences were designed: ALG-2 (GenBank™ accession number AAB38108) regions 307–327 and 403–423; VCP (GenBank™ accession number NP_033529) regions 792–812 and 1320–1340; AIF (GenBank™ accession number AAB38108) regions 305–325, 326–346, and 651–671; and NDK-A (nm23-H1, GenBank™ accession number X73066) regions 91–111, 280–300, and 416–436. siRNA Transfection—Apaf-1–/– cells (1 × 105 cells per well in 6-well dishes or 2.5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) with no antibiotics for 16 h. Transfection of siRNA specific for each target transcript was carried out using Ambion's siPORT Amine transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 μl of siPORT amine was mixed with 95 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. siRNA (80 nm) was added to the diluted siPORT transfection reagent and further incubated for 15 min. The final volume of the sample was diluted to 500 μl with Opti-MEM. Cells were overlaid with the reagent mixture, incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and then replaced with fresh medium. To estimate the efficiency of the transfections, fluorescently labeled siRNAs targeting the luciferase gene (region 152–173) from the luciferase-expressing vector pGL2-control (Promega) was used. The GAPDH siRNA (Ambion) sequence derived from the 5′ region of the GAPDH mRNA served as a positive control. Thirty six hours after ALG-2, VCP, and NDK-A (nm23-H1) siRNA transfection, and 72 h after AIF siRNA transfection, cell extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. In order to study the effect of ER stress on cells after reducing the ALG-2, VCP, NDK, and AIF concentrations, cells were exposed to ER stress agents including thapsigargin or brefeldin-A. Twenty four hours after transfection with ALG-2, VCP, and NDK-A siRNA (and 48 h after AIF siRNA transfection), cells were exposed to 50 nm Thaps or 2.0 μm brefeldin-A for 24 h. (These time points corresponded to the times when protein reduction could be demonstrated by immunoblotting.) Thapsigargin/brefeldin-A-induced cell death was quantified, and cell extracts were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot for caspase-9 processing. Caspase Activity Assay and Evaluation of Apoptosis—The synthetic fluorogenic substrates benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Z-DEVD-AFC) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Z-LEHD-AFC) were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products and dissolved in dimethylformamide as a 10 mm stock solution. Cell-free extracts (100 μg of protein) made from untreated or thapsigargin-treated cells were incubated with 100 μm peptide substrate. Caspase activity was determined by measuring the release of AFC from the synthetic substrates using continuous recording instruments as described earlier (25.Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were analyzed using a SpectraMAX 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 444 and 538 nm, respectively. Assessment of cell death was carried out by pelleting floating and adherent cells (after trypsinization) as described previously (26.Castro-Obregon S. Del Rio G. Chen S.F. Swanson R.A. Frankowski H.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14376-14381Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 1× PBS, 0.4% trypan blue, and cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Cell death was determined as the percentage of dead cells over the total number of cells. Statistical significance was determined by two-way analysis of variance analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant for p < 0.05. Plasmids, Transfection, and in Vitro Translation—Transient transfections were performed as described earlier (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M. Stoka V. Del Rio G. Bredesen D.E. Ellerby H.M. J. Biol.

Typically, 1 × 106 or 2 × 106 cells were seeded into 6- or 10-cm dishes, respectively, and transfected a day later with 2 or 6 μg of the specified construct using a ratio of 1 μg of DNA, 5 μl of Superfect transfection reagent. The transfection efficiency using these conditions was about 30% for the Apaf-1–/– cells. Plasmids pC12, pC7, pVCP, pALG-2, pcalreticulin, pC9, and pC3 were transcribed and translated (T7 polymerase) using the TnT system (Promega) for 2 h at 30 °C. The success of in vitro translations was monitored by PAGE. In vitro translated VCP (3 μl), ALG-2 (3 μl), caspase-7 (3 μl), and caspase-12 (3 μl) were incubated in 25 μlof in vitro translation buffer (2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 36 °C for 1 h with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled caspase-9 (3 μl) or caspase-3 (3 μl) in the presence or absence of 5 mm Ca2+, 100 μm ATP, and 100 ng of microsomes isolated from Apaf-1–/– cells treated with thapsigargin for 8 h. The 8-h treatment time was chosen because it was associated with a complete lack of cellular caspase activity, caspase processing, and cell death (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H.

At the end of the reaction, samples were analyzed for caspase-9 or caspase-3 processing by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Identification of Candidates That Mediate ER Stress-induced Cell Death—Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the ER Ca2+-ATPase, has profound effects on the cell. Protein transport from the ER is blocked by depleting the ER of Ca2+, as is the folding of several proteins, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER (28.Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z.

We used these compounds to induce ER stress and identify the molecular components that mediate cell death. The overall approach included the following two steps: in the first step, a list of putative ER-apoptosomal components was generated, and in the second step, some of these components were validated or refuted by depletion and reconstitution experiments. In the first step, we fractionated the caspase-activating extract from the microsomes of cells that had undergone ER stress induced by thapsigargin. These fractions were derived from Apaf-1-null cells so that the previously described mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of cell death was inactivated. Microsomes isolated from untreated and thapsigargin-treated Apaf-1–/– cells were briefly sonicated and passed through a Sephadex G-75 column. Fractions (0.1 ml) were collected and incubated at 36 °C for 1 h with 400,000 × g (100,000 rpm) supernatants isolated from untreated cells to evaluate caspase processing. At the end of the reaction, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Membranes were probed with anti-caspase-9 or anti-caspase-3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, fractions 6–8 obtained from microsomes isolated from thapsigargin-treated cells (Fig. 1, b and d), but not from untreated cells (Fig. 1, a and c), were capable of activating the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (fractions 5 and 9 were partially activating, Fig. 1, b and d), and these same fractions demonstrated caspase activity, based on the cleavage of LEHD-AFC and DEVD-AFC (Fig. 1e). These results are compatible with our earlier studies indicating caspase activation in Apaf+–/– cells treated with thapsigargin (13.Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M. Stoka V.

In order to generate a list of putative ER-apoptosomal components, we utilized four complementary approaches. In the first approach (a), the active fractions from the Sephadex G-75 column were pooled and subjected to two-dimensional IEF SDS-PAGE coupled with MALDI-TOF MS or nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS, or to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE coupled with the same mass spectrometric analyses. In the second approach (b), one-dimensional SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE patterns from 20,000 × g (14,000 rpm) extracts or microsomes isolated from untreated cells were compared with those isolated from thapsigargin-treated cells. Protein spots that showed at least a 1.5-fold increase in ER-stressed cells were then identified by MALDI-TOF MS and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. In the third approach (c), proteins co-immunoprecipitated with caspase-12 from ER-stressed cells were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and"

Here, we define the involvement of GnT-V in modulation of homotypic cell-cell adhesion in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 and mouse NIH3T3 cells. Increased GnT-V expression resulted in a significant decrease in the rates of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Reduced cell-cell adhesion was blocked by function-blocking antibody against N-cadherin and abrogated by pre-treatment of cells with swainsonine, demonstrating the involvement of N-cadherin in the cell-cell adhesion and that changes in N-linked β(1,6)glycan expression are responsible for the reduction in rates of adhesion, although this reduction could be mediated by the altered N-linked glycosylation of glycoproteins other than N-cadherin. Overexpression of GnT-V had no effect on the levels of cell surface expression of N-cadherin; however, it did cause a marked enhancement of both β(1,6) branching and poly-N-acetyllactosamine expression on N-cadherin. GnT-V overexpression resulted in decreased N-cadherin clustering on the cell surface induced by anti-N-cadherin antibody and affected the outside-in signal transduction pathway of ERK mediated by N-cadherin. Overexpression of GnT-V sensitized stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins by growth factors and expression of v-src, which is consistent with its reduction of cell-cell adhesion. In vitro, GnT-V-overexpressing cells showed increased motility concomitant with increased phosphorylation of catenins. Moreover, GnT-V-deficient embryo fibroblasts from GnT-V homozygous null mice (GnT-V-/-) express N-cadherin and showed significantly increased levels of N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion compared with those from GnT-V+/- mice. These levels of adhesion were inhibited significantly by transient expression of GnT-V, confirming the hypothesis that levels of GnT-V can regulate cadherin-associated homotypic cell-cell adhesion. Aberrant N-linked β(1,6) branching that occurs during oncogenesis can, therefore, lessen cell-cell adhesion, contributing to increased cellular motility and invasiveness.

Recent studies demonstrate that aberrant glycosylation of several types of cell surface receptors results in dysfunctional intracellular signaling and altered cellular behavior. For example, mutations in an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, POMGnT-I, cause aberrant glycosylation of skeletal muscle dystrophin, resulting in dys-functional neuromuscular junctions (4Yoshida A. Kobayashi K. Manya H. Taniguchi K. Kano H. Mizuno M. Inazu T. Mitsuhashi H. Takahashi S. Takeuchi M. Herrmann R. Straub V. Talim B. Voit T. Topaloglu H. Toda T. Endo T. Dev.

Mutations in POMGnT-I have been shown to result in multiple phenotypes, some of which have been classified as “muscle-eye-brain” disease, a form of muscular dystrophy. In addition, increased expression levels of another N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, GnT-V, have been shown to inhibit α5β1 integrin adhesion to fibronectin, as well as stimulating cell migration through this matrix glycoprotein, most likely by inhibiting α5β1 receptor clustering in the plasma membrane (5Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M.

Increased expression of GnT-V is observed during the oncogenesis of many cell types as a result of the stimulation of its transcription through the ras-ets signaling pathway. This enzyme synthesizes a multiantennary branch on N-linked glycans, the branch containing GlcNAcβ(1,6)Man. Studies have examined the expression of these branched N-linked oligosaccharides in various human and murine tumors and cell lines derived from them (6Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 945-950PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fernandes B. Sagman U. Auger M. Demetrio M. Dennis J.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 718-723PubMed Google Scholar, 8Seelentag W.K. Li W.P. Schmitz S.F.

Mice that lack GnT-V expression due to targeted deletion (GnT-V-/- or Mgat5-/-) have been used to study the effects of eliminating GnT-V activity on tumor progression (11Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). When crossed with mice that express the polyoma middle T-antigen under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, the rate of invasion and metastasis of the mammary tumors was significantly reduced in the GnT-V-/- mice. This study provided strong evidence that changes in β(1,6) branching of N-linked glycans due to altered GnT-V activity affect carcinoma progression in vivo. During the investigation of possible mechanisms by which GnT-V expression levels could regulate carcinoma invasiveness and motility, cells transfected with a retroviral construct encoding GnT-V that showed increased β(1,6) branching were observed to display altered calcium-dependent cell aggregation properties. Because calcium-dependent aggregation was likely due to altered cadherin function, and because reduced cell-cell adhesion in transformed cells can cause increased cell migration and lead to increased invasiveness and metastasis, we focused on testing the hypothesis that changes in GnT-V expression result in altered cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion and downstream intracellular signaling pathways. This hypothesis is relevant to the understanding of oncogenic transformation, because oncogenesis is often associated with decreased cell-cell adhesion, alterations in adhesion-mediated signaling pathways, and changes in organization of the cytoskeleton that can influence cell migration and invasiveness. Our results showed that increased expression of GnT-V activity in two fibroblastic cell types, HT1080 and NIH3T3, caused increased levels of N-linked β(1,6) branching and poly-N-acetyllactosamine on N-cadherin, a concomitant decrease in the rates of homophilic cell-cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin, as well as a stimulation of cadherin-mediated cell migration. Induction of GnT-V expression inhibited clustering of cell surface N-cadherin and enhanced the susceptibility of β-catenin and p120ctn phosphorylation by growth factors and the src oncogene, consistent with the increased migratory phenotype of GnT-V-overexpressing cells. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from GnT-V-/- mice showed an increased rate of calcium-dependent cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion compared with MEF from GnT-V+/- littermates; this increased rate of adhesion was decreased when the GnT-V-/- MEF were transfected with a construct encoding GnT-V, confirming that cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is regulated by GnT-V expression levels. Cell Lines and Materials—HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (CCL-121), NIH3T3 cells (CRL-1658), and MCF-7 cells (HTB-22) were obtained from ATCC; bovine serum albumin (BSA), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), swainsonine (SW), function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against N-cadherin (A-CAM, clone GC-4) and E-cadherin (DECMA-1), phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin, and proteinase K were products of Sigma.

Mgat5 (GnT-V)-deficient mice were kindly provided by Dr. James Dennis from the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada and were re-derived by Dr. Jarmy Marth from the University of California at San Diego. Cell Culture—HT1080 and NIH3T3 cells transfected with a retroviral plasmid encoding mouse GnT-V cDNA (pTJ66GnT-V) (5Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained and passaged routinely at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM growth media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals), supplemented with 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin (Sigma). Cell Aggregation Assay—Cell aggregation assays were performed as described previously (12Jiang W.G. Hiscox S. Hallett M.B. Horrobin D.F. Mansel R.E. Puntis M.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5043-5048PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, subconfluent cells were washed with PBS and then detached with HCMF buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 0.02% trypsin and 2 mm CaCl2. Single cell suspensions were prepared, washed, and resuspended in HCMF buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 at a concentration of 105 cells/ml. 300-μl aliquots of cell suspension were added to the wells of 24-well plates pre-coated with 1% BSA and incubated for different times at 37 °C with 80 rpm agitation. For some experiments, EDTA (2 mm), EGTA (2 mm), function blocking antibody against N-cadherin (A-CAM, 50 μg/ml), E-cadherin (DECMA-1, 1:100), β1 integrin (mAb13, 50 μg/ml), α5 integrin (mAb16, 2 mg/ml), and non-immune IgG (50 μg/ml) were added into the cell suspension, respectively. For swainsonine-treated cells, 1 μg/ml swainsonine was added into the culture media for 24 h before cells were prepared for the aggregation assay. Cell aggregation was measured using an inverted phase-contrast microscope by counting the number of cells in aggregates (three or more cells) in each field over a total of five randomly chosen fields, calculating the mean and standard error of these measurements, and expressing the mean relative to the mean total number of cells per field as percent aggregation (13Sanchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Balboa M.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3817-3828PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent aggregation was calculated by subtracting values obtained from aggregation assays in the presence of EGTA (2 mm) from the values of the total number of aggregating cells. The levels of aggregating cells in EGTA were typically <10% of the total number of aggregating cells. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cells were grown to subconfluency and detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS. Cells (106) were washed, resuspended in 100 μl of FCM buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.01% sodium azide), and then incubated with rabbit antibody against N-cadherin (1:100) at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100). After washing with FCM buffer, cells were labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (10 μl) at 4 °C for 30 min. Analysis was then performed using the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) instrument. Immunoblotting and Lectin Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). 20 μg of protein from total cell lysates, determined by using the BCA protein assay procedure (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL), were boiled in 2× SDS-sample buffer for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 4-20% polyacrylamide minigel, and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 3% BSA in TBS, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) or biotinylated lectins (1:2500) in TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with TBS and probed with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:3000) or streptavidin (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. After the membrane was washed with TBST, protein bands were developed with ECL reagents and exposed on x-ray film. Images of immunoblots and lectin blots were quantitated using a Fluor-S (Bio-Rad) instrument. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Cell surface protein labeling with biotin was performed as described before (5Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Sub-confluent cells were washed and detached using 2 mm EDTA. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed by incubation with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of N-cadherin, lysates (500 μg of protein) were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with protein-A-agarose at 4 °C under agitation for 1-2 h to remove nonspecific adsorption to the agarose beads. After the determination of total protein using a BCA assay, cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of polyclonal antibody against N-cadherin for 3 h at 4 °C under agitation, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h with agitation. The pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gels were then transferred onto PVDF membrane and probed with streptavidin-HRP (1:5000). After stripping, the membrane was subjected to Western blotting with antibody against N-cadherin as described above. For lectin precipitation of N-glycans (14Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48451-48457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of biotinylated lectins overnight at 4 °C with agitation, followed by incubation with streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h with agitation. After SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer, as described above, N-cadherin was detected on the blots using antibody against N-cadherin. Quantitative analyses were performed by densitometric scanning of bands resulting from lectin binding, and results were expressed as “lectin binding of N-cadherin.” Antibody Immobilization and Clustering Assays—For antibody immobilization experiments (15Pece S.

Plates were washed with PBS and then incubated with polyclonal antibody against N-cadherin (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 1% BSA. Cells were grown to confluence, serum-starved for 18-24 h, and harvested with 2 mm EDTA treatment. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM and added into the antibody-coated plates at 37 °C for different times. After non-adherent cells were removed with washing, attached cells were lysed and used for the phospho-ERK1/2 assay. Poly-l-lysine-coated plates were used in control experiments. For antibody-clustering experiments (15Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), a single cell suspension was prepared, as described above, and added into the culture dishes pre-coated with 0.4% poly-HEMA (sigma). Cells were incubated with polyclonal antibody against N-cadherin (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 60 min, and cadherin receptor clustering was induced by an additional incubation with 5 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG for different times at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2P2O7, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4 and lysed for the phospho-ERK1/2 assay. Quantitative analyses were performed by densitometry on both phospho-ERK and total ERK protein data. Results were also expressed as “relative ERK phosphorylation” by dividing the level of the phospho-ERK signal by the ERK protein signal at each time point. Assay of MAPK Activation Mediated by Cell-Cell Adhesion—Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion was performed as described previously (15Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown to confluence and serum-starved overnight in DMEM culture media containing 10 mm Hepes. Cells were then incubated with DMEM containing 4 mm EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C. The EGTA chelates Ca2+ and disrupts cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. Then, Ca2+-free medium was removed, and CaCl2 was adjusted back to 1.8 mm (Ca2+ switch) to induce cadherin-mediated intercellular interactions. Cells were harvested at different time points after the addition of Ca2+ and then lysed for assay of phospho-ERK1/2 by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody against phospho-ERK1/2. Quantitative analyses were performed by densitometry and expressed as “relative ERK phosphorylation,” as described above. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Catenins and Growth Factor Receptors— Cells were grown to confluence and serum-starved overnight. One hour before the treatment of cells with growth factors, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of PTP, was added to cultures to inhibit PTP activity (17Muller T. Choidas A. Reichmann E. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10173-10183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 18Guo X. Rao J.N. Liu L. Rizvi M. Turner D.J. Wang J.Y. Am. J.

After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, 2 mm PMSF, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin) for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (350 μg of protein) were used for immunoprecipitation of N-cadherin, catenins, and growth factor receptors as described above. Immunocomplexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%), transferred onto PVDF membrane, and probed with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20). After stripping, the membrane was subjected to Western blotting with antibody against N-cadherin, catenins, or growth factor receptors, as described above. Transient Expression of v-src Oncogene—Both mock and GnT-V-transfected cells were cultured in DMEM growth medium containing l-glutamine and 10% FBS. Transient transfections of v-src were performed with Lipofectamine™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions using 5 μg of DNA/60-mm dish. Cells were incubated for 48-72 h after transfection, rinsed with cold PBS, and then lysed for the tyrosine phosphorylation assay of whole cell lysates and p120ctn as above described. In Vitro Cell Motility Assay—Cell motility assays were performed using 12-well Transwell units with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate inserts as described by Hazen et al. (19Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R.

Cells (3 × 104) suspended in 0.5 ml of DMEM plus 0.1% BSA were added to the upper compartment of the Transwell unit, and 0.75 ml of fibroblast-conditioned medium was added into the lower chamber. Conditioned medium was from a 24-h incubation of NIH3T3 cells with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid in serum-free DMEM culture media (19Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed using a cotton swab, whereas the cells that migrated to the underside were fixed and stained with crystal violet. The number of cells on the underside of the membrane was counted in five different fields with a light microscope at 100× magnification, and the mean ± S.D. was calculated. For swainsonine-treated cells, 1 μg/ml swainsonine was added into the culture media for 24 h before cells were removed for addition to the upper chamber of the Transwell apparatus. For some experiments, cells were added into the Transwell apparatus in the presence of function blocking antibody against N-cadherin (A-CAM, 50 μg/ml), E-cadherin (DECMA-1, 1:100), β1 (mAb13, 50 μg/ml), and α5 integrin (mAb16, 2 mg/ml). Wound healing assays were performed as described previously (5Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar) to detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins during cell migration. Briefly, cells were cultured to sub-confluence in 30-mm dishes and serum-starved overnight. Approximately 20 wounds were made on the cell monolayer by scratching about 20 mm with a 200-μl sterile yellow plastic tip. To initiate cell migration, complete growth media were added to the dishes, and cells were then harvested at different times and lysed for determination of tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins, as described above. Isolation and Identification of Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts—Mouse embryo fibroblasts were prepared as described (20Abbondanzo S.J. Gadi I. Stewart C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 803-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) from embryos resulting from the mating of 2-month-old mice heterozygous for GnT-V expression (GnT-V+/-) (11Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos were isolated at E13.5 of development using the day of copulation plug as day 0.5. The embryos were dissected from the uterus, washed twice in fresh PBS to remove any blood, followed by removal of hearts and livers. Individual embryo carcasses were then transferred separately into 15-ml tubes that contained 5 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Triturating the tissue through a 10-ml pipette three times dissociated the tissue into small clumps of cells. DMEM (25 ml) with high glucose (HyClone) containing 10% FBS, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin was then added into the tube. A total 30 ml of cell suspension was transferred into a T-75 culture flask and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Dissociated cells attached and gave rise to MEF after 2-3 days. The genotype of each MEF culture was identified by PCR analysis using genomic DNA prepared as described (Transgenic animal model core, University of Michigan). In brief, cells were harvested and lysed with 600 ml of TNES buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS) containing 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 55 °C for 3-5 h. After complete digestion, 167 μl of 6 m NaCl was added to the reaction mixture, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at room temperature for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and genomic DNA was then precipitated by adding an equal volume of ice-cold 95% ethanol. The DNA pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Primers specific for wild type GnT-V (5′ primer, 5′-CCTCCTCCTCCACAGCAGAAT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CCGCTGCTGGATGGTGAAGTG-3′), yielding 0.26-kb PCR product and for LacZ (5′ primer, 5′-TTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-ATGTGAGCGAGTAACAACCCGTCGGATTCT-3′), yielding 0.36-kb PCR product were used for PCR analysis. These primer pairs were developed and determined to allow accurate genotyping of MEF. Transient transfections of GnT-V-deficient MEF with GnT-V cDNA were performed with LipofectAMINE™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions using 5 μg of DNA/60-mm dish. Cells were incubated for 48-72 h after transfection and then used for calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, as described above. Fluorescent Staining—Cells were plated on coverslips and incubated at 37 °C overnight to allow cell spreading. Cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min followed by three times washing with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Trit"

However, the precise mechanism by which bile acids enhance DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression is unknown. Although several bile acids enhanced DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression, deoxycholic acid (DCA) was the most potent. DCA stimulated JNK activation and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 blocked DCA-induced DR5/TRAIL-R2 mRNA and protein expression. Reporter gene analysis identified a 5′-flanking region containing two Sp1 binding sites within the DR5/TRAIL-R2 promoter as bile acid responsive. Sp1 binding to one of the two sites was enhanced by DCA treatment as evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. JNK inhibition with SP600125 also blocked binding of Sp1 to the DR5/TRAIL-R2 promoter. Finally, point mutations of the Sp1 binding site attenuated promoter activity.

At present three major groups of MAPKs are known: the classic p42/44 MAPK or extracellular receptor kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1 and 2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2), and p38 MAPK. The p42/44 MAPKs are mainly involved in cell survival and proliferation pathways, and their inhibition potentiates bile acid-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes (5.Qiao L. Studer E. Leach K.

Insight into how the bile acid-stimulated MAPK pathways are cytotoxic is, therefore, of scientific and potential clinical relevance. Bile acid-triggered apoptosis involves death receptor activation. Consistent with their known effects on gene expression, bile acids stimulate transcription of the death receptor 5/tumor necrosis factor-related, apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor 2 (DR5/TRAIL-R2) expression and aggregation, promoting a death receptor-dependent apoptosis (10.Higuchi H.

The importance of bile acid-mediated DR5/TRAIL-R2 induction has been amply demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo observations (10.Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R. El-Deiry W.

In previous studies examining bile acid-mediated DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression and cell death, a cell line with a defective p53 mutant was utilized, thereby, excluding a role for p53 in bile acid-DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression (10.Higuchi H.

An FXR agonist also failed to enhance expression of this death receptor. The observations make it likely that bile acid enhances DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression by a MAPK signaling pathway. The overall objective of this study was to test the hypothesis thatbileacidenhancesDR5/TRAIL-R2transcriptionbyaMAPK-dependent process. To address this hypothesis, the following two questions were formulated: (i) Do MAPK inhibitors block bile acid-mediated DR5/TRAIL-R2 transcription? (ii) What is the transcription factor responsible for bile acid-associated DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression? The results indicate that DCA-mediated JNK1/2 activation contributes to DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression. The DCA-stimulated JNK1/2 pathway was found to be associated with the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor. Thus, Sp1 appears to be a bile acid-responsive transcription factor that contributes to DR5/TRAIL-R2 gene expression downstream of JNK1/2.

Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a commercial protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture; Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). After insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected. Samples were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with appropriate primary antibodies at dilution of 1:1,000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) were incubated at a dilution of 1:2,000 to 1:10,000. Bound antibody was visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HuH-BAT cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and cDNA was prepared using an random primer and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as previously described in detail (10.Higuchi H.

PCR primers for human TRAIL-R2/DR5 were as follows: forward 5′-TGC AGC CGT AGT CTT GAT TG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCA CCA AGT CTG CAA AGT CA-3′. For an internal control, primers for 18 S ribosomal RNA were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). After electrophoresis in 1% low melting temperature agarose gel, the expected base pair PCR products were identified, and the PCR products were eluted into Tris-HCl using a DNA elution kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Extracted PCR products were prepared as standards at the concentrations of 109, 108, 107, 106, 105, 104, and 103 copies/μl. The identity of the PCR products was verified using dye terminator technology. Real-time PCR was performed with the Roche LightCycler using SYBR green as the fluorophore (Molecular Probes) (10.Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R. El-Deiry W. Gores G.J. J.

For the quantitation of each mRNA, real-time PCR was performed using the cDNA samples obtained from the HuH-BAT cells. The standard curve was used to calculate the copy number in the experimental sample. The copy number of TRAIL-R2/DR5 mRNA in each sample was normalized using the copy number of 18 S RNA. All PCR conditions and primers were optimized to produce a single product of the correct base pair size. Reporter Plasmid Construction—The plasmid pGL2-DR5/TRAIL-R2-Full containing 1.6 kb upstream of the ATG site through intron 2 in human DR5/TRAIL-R2 genomic DNA has been described previously, and was a kind gift from El-Deiry and co-workers (University of Pennsylvania) (10.Higuchi H.

The firefly luciferase-based reporter plasmids, pGL3-basic and pGL3-promoter, containing 195 bp of the SV40 minimal early promoter (pGL3-SV), were obtained from Promega. The 5′-flanking lesion (corresponding nucleotide position at –1220/–2, numbers from the ATG site) and the downstream lesion containing exon 1 through intron 1 (nucleotide position at –1/+416) were amplified by PCR using primers: forward 5′-GTC CAT GCT AGC AGC TTC ACT CCT GAG CCA GT-3′/reverse 5′-GCA CTC AGA TCT GCG GTA GGG AAC GCT CTT ATA G-3′ for –1220/–2 lesion, and 5′-AC GTC CAT GCT AGC CAT GGA ACA ACG GGG ACA G-3′ and 5′-AC GCA CTC AGA TCT CGT GCT TCA CGC AGC TTA CT-3′ for –1/+416 lesion. The PCR fragments were purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and gel extraction and digested with NheI and BglII. The –1223/–2 fragment was subcloned into the pGL3-basic vector between NheI and BglII sites to make pGL3–5′-1223. The –1/+416 fragment was subcloned into the pGL3-basic vector or pGL3-SV vector to make pGL3-Int1+416 and pGL3-SV-Int1+416, respectively. Deletion mutants of the pGL3–5′-1220 were generated by using an Erase-Base system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Point mutations were introduced to the pGL3–5′-1220 by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis technology using the primers: 5′-GGA TCT GAT TCG CCA AGT TCC GAA TGA CGC C-3′ and 5′-GGC GTC ATT CGG AAC TTG GCG AAT CAG ATC C-3′ for Sp1 binding site 1; and 5′-GAA AGT ACA GCC GCG AAG TTC CAA GTC AGC CTG-3′ and 5′-CAG GCT GAC TTG GAA CTT CGC GGC TGT ACT TTC-3′ for Sp1 binding site 2. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by nucleotide-sequencing analysis. Reporter Gene Assay—HuH-BAT cells cultured in 24-well plates were co-transfected with 5 ng of TK-Renilla-CMV and 250 ng of firefly luciferase-based reporter plasmids described above. Twelve hours after the transfection, cells were incubated with bile acids or media (control) for 8 h, and then cell lysates were prepared as previously described (10.Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y.

Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantitated using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and firefly luciferase activity was normalized using Renilla luciferase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from the HuH-BAT cells using high salt extraction as described previously (30.Rust C. Karnitz L.M. Paya C.V. Moscat J.

The buffer composition of the final nuclear extract was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 140 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× concentration of the protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Single-stranded complimentary synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Six microliters of nuclear extract containing up to 6 μg of protein was incubated on ice in binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, 300 mm KCl, 20% Ficoll, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)).C. O. The binding reaction was initiated by addition of 20,000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide probe and continued for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies for supershifting or competing double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the binding buffer 15 min prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotides. Samples were loaded onto 4% or 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. The gel was dried and exposed to BioMax-MR films at –70 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes and/or specific competitors used for EMSA were: AP-1 consensus sequence (AP-1 cons.), 5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CCG GAA-3′; CREB/ATF cons., 5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′; Sp1 cons., 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG-3′; Sp1 binding site 1 (Sp1 BS1), 5′-CAT TCG GGG CGG GGC GAA TCA-3′; and Sp1 BS2, 5′-GAC TTG GGG CGG CGC GGC TGT-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells were incubated with formaldehyde (final concentration, 1%) at room temperature for 20 min, to obtain a cross-linking of DNA and DNA-bound proteins. After washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were collected and lysed within 200 μl of the SDS lysis buffer provided by the kit. The cell extracts were sonicated to shear the DNA into 200- to 1,000-bp fragments, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The DNA concentration in the supernatant was quantitated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Samples containing 100 ng of DNA were diluted with the ChIP dilution buffer obtained from the kit, to make a final volume of 1,050 μl. 50 μl of each sample was used for non-immunoprecipitation control experiments (e.g. samples not treated with antisera). The remaining samples (1 ml) were subjected to the immunoprecipitation by adding rabbit-polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (final concentration, 5 μg/ml) and 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose-50% slurry. After washing the agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions, the protein A-agarose·immune complexes were eluted with the lysis buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). The elution was repeated three times, and 750 μl (total volume) of elutes were obtained from each vial. 50 μl of each elute was stored for a Sp1 immunoblot analysis to determine the immunoprecipitation efficiency. 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to the remaining samples, and the samples were incubated at 65C° for 5 h to reverse cross-linking. After the samples were digested with proteinase K, DNA fragments were purified by the phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation methods. The DNA pellet was resolved in 20 μl of water. The PCR primers were designated to amplify 215-bp fragments containing both Sp1 BS1 and Sp1 BS2. The sequences of the primers were as follows: 5′-AGG TTA GTT CCG GTC CCT TC-3′, forward; 5′-CGC GTG CTG ATT TAT GTG TC-3′, reverse. The copy number for precipitated DR5/TRAIL-R2 promoter fragments was quantitated using real-time PCR technique, and the copy number was normalized by the copy number of the DR5/TRAIL-R2 promoter fragments within parallel samples handled identically except for omission of the immunoprecipitation step. Statistical Analysis—All data represent at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Differences between groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance and a post hoc Bonferroni test. Bile Acids Up-regulate DR5/TRAIL-R2 Expression—Initially, we screened several bile acids for their effects on DR5/TRAIL-R2 induction to ascertain which bile acids were the most potent in augmenting expression of this death receptor. Among the bile acids tested (100 μm), deoxycholic acid (DCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and the glycine-conjugated form of deoxycholic acid (GDCA) were the most effective in up-regulating DR5/TRAIL-R2 protein (Fig. 1A) and mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the hydrophilic, cytoprotective bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) did not significantly enhance DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression. In contrast to their effects on DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression, bile acids altered neither DR4, DcR1, nor DcR2 protein expression. Thus, bile acid-mediated TRAIL-related receptor up-regulation is DR5/TRAIL-R2-specific. Because DCA was the most potent in inducing DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression, we choose this bile acid for the remainder of our studies. Next, the concentration-dependent response for DR5/TRAIL-R2 up-regulation by DCA was examined. DCA up-regulates DR5/TRAIL-R2 mRNA and protein level in a concentration-dependent manner with concentrations ≥ 150 μm sufficient to induce maximum DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, DCA, at all concentrations tested, did not alter expression of the related DR4/TRAIL-R1 receptor. Thus, DCA selectively up-regulates DR5/TRAIL-R2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Bile Acid-mediated DR5/TRAIL-R2 Induction Is JNK-dependent—Several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated by DCA (5.Qiao L. Studer E. Leach K. McKinstry R. Gupta S. Decker R.

Therefore, we formulated the hypothesis that bile acid-activated MAPK activity was responsible for DR5/TRAIL-R2 gene induction by DCA. To test this hypothesis, several different kinase inhibitors, including the p42/44 MAPK inhibitor PD098059, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the JNK1/2 inhibitor SP600125 were screened for the effects on DR5/TRAIL-R2 protein expression. Among the inhibitors tested, the JNK1/2 inhibitor SP600125 completely abrogated DCA-induced DR5/TRAIL-R2 protein expression, whereas the p42/44 and p38 MAPK inhibitors failed to block DR5/TRAIL-R2 induction (Fig. 2A).

Na,K-ATPase is a transmembrane protein that transports three Na+ out of the cell and two K+ in, utilizing ATP hydrolysis as the driving force. The electrochemical gradient, established by the Na,K-ATPase, is essential for maintenance of cell-specific functions, such as muscle contraction and nerve transmission. The ion gradient also drives many plasma membrane transport processes, including Na+-coupled Ca2+ transport by the Na/Ca-exchanger and uptake of nutrients, such as glucose, in kidney and gut via Na+ cotransporters. Na,K-ATPase is composed of two subunits: the catalytic α subunit, which binds translocating cations and ATP, and the β subunit, which modulates cation affinity and is necessary for proper folding and translocation of the Na,K-ATPase to the plasma membrane (1Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T.A.

Cardiac glycoside sensitivity is conferred by the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, and this class of drugs is used to treat congestive heart failure. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity by cardiac glycosides is believed to be a major mechanism by which these drugs exert their positive cardiac inotropic effect (13Akera T. Brody T.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1977; 29: 187-220PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brody T.M. Akera T. Fed. Proc. 1977; 36: 2219-2224PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee C.O. Am. J.

Inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase raises intracellular Na+, which in turns increases intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ produces a positive inotropic response of the heart. Two isoforms, α1 and α2, are expressed in rodent heart, and three isoforms, α1, α2, and α3, are expressed in human heart. However, it is unknown which specific α isoform mediates this cardiac glycoside positive inotropic effect in either species. It has been suggested that inhibition of the high affinity α2 isoform followed by inhibition of the low affinity α1 isoform by the cardiac glycoside digoxin results in increased contractility of rat hearts (17Kang W. Weiss M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that differences in cardiac glycoside sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase isozymes determine their therapeutic and toxic effects such that the high affinity Na,K-ATPase mediates the positive inotropic effects, whereas the low affinity Na,K-ATPase is responsible for toxic effects of cardiac glycosides (18Maixent J.M. Charlemagne D. de la Chapelle B. Lelievre L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6842-6848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of mice expressing genetically reduced levels of α1 and α2 isoforms demonstrated differential cardiac function of these isoforms, indicating that they may differentially regulate the cardiac glycoside-induced positive inotropy (9James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The approximate 50% reduction in α2 isoform expression resulted in an increase in contractility of the heart, whereas decreased cardiac contractility was observed in mice lacking one copy of the α1 isoform gene. As reduction of the α2 isoform mimicked the cardiac glycoside-induced positive inotropy, it was suggested that the α2 isoform might play a role in this effect, whereas inhibition of the α1 isoform may be responsible for toxic effects of cardiac glycosides. Recently it has been suggested that both α1 and α2 isoforms regulate cardiac contractility and cardiac glycoside-induced positive inotropy (19Schwartz A. Petrashevskaya N.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, evidence also exists implicating only the α1 isoform in regulation of cardiac contractility (20Kometiani P. Askari A. Liu J. Xie Z. Askari F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1415-H1421Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies are necessary to determine the functional role of different isoforms in the regulation of cardiac contractility and the cardiac glycoside effects. Several studies suggest that cardiac glycosides may function by mechanisms other than inhibition of Na,K-ATPase. Low concentrations of digitoxin have been shown to activate the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor (RyR), 1The abbreviations used are: RyRryanodine receptorESembryonic stemMAPmean arterial pressureECFextracellular fluidEOendogenous ouabain. suggesting its involvement in positive cardiac inotropy by digitoxin (21McGarry S.J.

Physiol. 2002; 282: H1118-H1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to the digitoxin effect on RyR, other studies have suggested that cardiac glycosides are transported across the plasma membrane into the cell and that intracellular action is responsible for the increase in heart contractility (23Nunez-Duran H.

Steinkopf, Darmstadt, Germany1984: 56-71Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore non-Na,K-ATPase receptors for ouabain have been suggested, dissociating its involvement in positive cardiac inotropy (25Fujino M. Fujino S. Satoh K. Nakai T. Kado T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 311: 449-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that cardiac glycoside receptors other than Na,K-ATPase exist raises the question whether inhibition of Na,K-ATPase is the only mechanism for cardiac glycoside-induced cardiac positive inotropy. ryanodine receptor embryonic stem mean arterial pressure extracellular fluid endogenous ouabain. To determine whether the Na,K-ATPase, and specifically the α2 isoform of Na,K-ATPase, mediates the cardiac glycoside-induced positive inotropy we developed animals expressing the α2 isoform with reduced cardiac glycoside affinity (α2R/R) and analyzed cardiac contractility after administration of ouabain. If an increase in cardiac contractility is not observed in targeted animals in the presence of cardiac glycosides, this proves that the Na,K-ATPase and specifically the α2 Na,K-ATPase isozyme is mediating ouabain-induced cardiac positive inotropy. However, if ouabain induces an increase in heart contractility in the gene-targeted animals, then some other receptor must be mediating this effect. We analyzed the cardiac response to ouabain administration using both isolated work-performing heart preparations and intact animals. Our results clearly demonstrate that the increase in heart contractility by low concentrations of cardiac glycosides is mediated through the α2 Na,K-ATPase and not through other receptors as ouabain-induced cardiac positive inotropy was not observed in the α2R/R animals. Generation of Mice Expressing the Cardiac Glycoside-insensitive α2 Na,K-ATPase Isozyme—The L111R and N122D amino acid substitutions were introduced into the α2 isoform by two base pair mutations in exon 4 using PCR site-directed mutagenesis as shown in Fig. 1. The whole exon 4 was used as template for PCR site-directed mutagenesis and was excised from an 8.6-kb subclone of the α2 isoform gene. Furthermore two silent base pair substitutions were made to introduce a BstBI site. The amplified fragment containing the desired mutations was ligated back into the 8.6-kb subclone. The LoxP-neomycin-LoxP cassette was cloned into intron 3 at a site 750 bp upstream of exon 4. The thymidine kinase gene was inserted downstream of the cloning sequence. The presence of the desired mutation in the targeting vector was verified by both sequence analysis and BstBI restriction digest. The Duffy ES cell line was transfected with the targeting vector by electroporation, and successful homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The 5′ probe was derived from intron 3, whereas the 3′ probe was derived from intron 4 of the α2 isoform gene. The presence of the BstBI site and desired mutation in exon 4 was analyzed in successfully targeted ES cells by PCR. The assumption was made that the existence of a BstBI site in exon 4 indicates the presence of the desired mutation as sequence analysis of the targeting vector demonstrated the successful introduction of this site along with the desired RD mutation. The exon 4 sequence was amplified by PCR using P1 (5′-AGCTCAGGACATTCTGG) and P2 (5′-CTCCTAACCACGCTCCTAG) primers, and the amplified fragments were treated with BstBI restriction enzyme. Successfully targeted ES cells were subjected to the second electroporation with the Cre-recombinase-encoding vector. Following the transfection, ES clones were duplicated, and one set was grown in medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. Genomic DNA was extracted from the neomycin-sensitive ES cells, digested with PstI, and analyzed by Southern blot using the 3′ and 5′ probes described above. The presence of the BstBI site, and therefore the presence of the desired mutation, in exon 4 was analyzed in targeted ES cells by PCR as described above. Chimeric mice were generated via blastocyst injection of the ES cell clone 39 and were bred to Black Swiss mice for two generations to establish a hybrid line. Homozygous knock-in mice were obtained by heterozygous mating. Genotyping was performed by allele-specific PCR analysis across the LoxP site in intron 3 of the genomic DNA. The presence of the mutation in homozygous α2R/R mice was verified by sequence analysis of exon 4 using P1 and P2 primers described above. Whole Tissue Preparation—Whole tissue homogenates were used for Western blot analysis. For each tissue preparation, tissues were pooled and homogenized on ice with two 30-s bursts of a Polytron homogenizer in 2-7 ml, depending on the tissue, of 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4. Following Polytron homogenization, tissues were further Dounce-homogenized and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Crude Microsomal Preparations—Crude microsomal preparations were used for [3H]ouabain binding assays and were prepared as described previously (26Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), omitting NaI treatment. Briefly, for each preparation, tissues were pooled from five animals and homogenized on ice with two 30-s burst in 2 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm imidazole, and 1 mm EDTA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and ultracentrifuged at 40,800 rpm for 1 h using an SW 50.1 Beckman rotor. Following ultracentrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA buffer and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed via standard methods (9James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B Mol.

In brief, protein samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in loading buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.9), 5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in 1% nonfat dry milk in TBST (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated in TBST containing α1 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody (α6F, University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybrid Bank), α2 isoform-specific monoclonal McB2 antibody (Dr. K. Sweadner), α3 isoform-specific monoclonal MA3-915 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), and KETTY polyclonal antibody, which recognized the C-terminal KETTY sequence of all α isoforms (Dr. Jack Kyte) at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), immunoreactivity was visualized following treatment with the ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) by using the Kodak BioMax MR x-ray film. Equal protein loading for each Western blot analysis was confirmed following initial immunoreactivity visualization by reprobing the membranes with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific rabbit monoclonal 6C5 antibody (Advanced ImmunoChemical Inc.). In brief, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were washed in TBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by their incubation in anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody for 1 h. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary antibody. Immunoreactive visualization was performed as described above. Analysis of Ouabain Binding by Na,K-ATPase in Microsomal Protein Preparations from Wild Type (α2W/W) and Homozygous Knock-in Mice (α2R/R)—Total [3H]ouabain binding was performed as described previously (9James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly 100-500 μg of crude membrane preparations were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in reaction mixture containing 20 μm [3H]ouabain, 10 mm sodium meta-vanadate, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm Tris-PO4, and either 0 or 30 μm unlabeled ouabain. Following incubation the crude membrane preparations were filtered through 1.2-μm glass microfiber Whatman GF/C filter paper and washed five times with 7 ml of water using a Brandel cell harvester. The filter-associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific [3H]ouabain for each microsomal preparation was determined by using an excess of unlabeled ouabain (1 mm) and was subtracted from total binding obtained using 30 μm ouabain. Subtraction of nonspecific binding from total binding obtained in kidney samples from both genotypes and in heart and skeletal muscle samples from targeted animals resulted in zero value. Analysis of Cardiovascular Performance in Intact Closed Chest Animals—Adult male and female mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg ketamine/g of body weight and 100 μg thiobutabarbital/g of body weight (Inactin, Research Biochemical International, Natick, MA). Polyethylene tubing (0.4 mm in diameter) was inserted into the abdominal aorta from the right femoral artery and connected to a low compliance pressure transducer (COBE Cardiovascular, Arvada, CO) for measurement of mean arterial pressure. A high fidelity, 1.8-French Millar Mikro-Tip transducer (Model SPR-612, Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) was inserted into the right carotid artery and advanced into the left ventricle to monitor cardiac performance. The right femoral vein was cannulated for infusion of dobutamine or ouabain. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intraventricular pressure from the COBE transducer and the Millar transducer were analyzed using a MacLab4/s data acquisition system connected to a Macintosh 7100/80 computer for each dobutamine dose. Average values for heart rate, MAP, and systolic left ventricular pressure were measured from the pressure waveforms and were determined for each animal from at least 50 consecutive beats during the final 30 s of each 3-min dosage period. Maximum dP/dt and dP/dt at 40 mm Hg (dP/dt40) for each dobutamine and ouabain infusion were calculated from the first derivative of the pressure waveforms. Work-performing (Anterograde) Mouse Heart Preparation—Cardiac contractile parameters were also obtained using a work-performing heart apparatus as described previously (27Grupp I.L. Subramanian A. Hewett T.E. Robbins J. Grupp G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1401-H1410PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, wild type and targeted mice were anesthetized, and the hearts were quickly removed and placed in a dish containing heparinized, oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution prewarmed at 37.7 °C. The aorta was isolated, and the mouse heart was suspended via its ascending aorta on a 20-gauge cannula allowing for retrograde perfusion of the coronary arteries. Perfusion with 37.7 °C oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution occurred from heated storage cylinders positioned above the heart to produce a constant pressure of 60 mm Hg, which was maintained via an overflow. A PE50 catheter was inserted through the pulmonary vein opening of the left atrium past the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The catheter was pushed through the apical wall of the left ventricle until the flanged end of the catheter rested against the ventricular wall. The atria, ventricles, and valves remained intact. The pulmonary vein was cannulated, and the perfusion was switched to anterograde. The left ventricular pressure and its derivatives, +dP/dt and -dP/dt, were recorded via a COBE pressure transducer and data acquisition system. Heart rate, aortic pressure, and temperature were also recorded on a Grass polygraph and computerized. All cardiac measurements were taken with mean aortic pressure fixed at 50 mm Hg and venous return fixed at 5 ml/min (left ventricular minute work = 250 mm Hg × ml/min). Coronary flow was measured with a Transonic flowmeter (Model T206). Temperature was continuously monitored via a Physi-temp probe (Thermalert Model TH-8). Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 2.0 mm Ca2+ (standard) or 1.5 mm Ca2+ (low), and base-line functional parameters were obtained at the different Ca2+ concentrations. The effects of the cardiac glycoside ouabain on the functional parameters of the hearts were assessed at 1.5 mm Ca2+. Increasing concentrations (1 × 10-9 to 8 × 10-6m) of ouabain, to produce a cumulative concentration-response curve, were infused and mixed into the perfusate via catheters inserted into the aortic tubing 8 cm above the heart. The hearts were exposed to each concentration until maximal effect was reached (usually a period of 5 min). The final concentration of ouabain delivered to the heart was calculated based on stock concentration, infusion rate, and cardiac output. Statistical Analysis—Two-way analysis of variance for time and treatment with repeated measurements was performed, and posthoc test of Fisher's least significant difference was obtained. Generation of Mice Expressing a Cardiac Glycoside-insensitive α2 Na,K-ATPase Isozyme—The ouabain sensitivity of the mouse α2 isoform was reduced by introducing L111R and N122D amino acid substitutions in the first extracellular domain of this isoform (Fig. 1). The Arg-111 and Asp-122 residues are naturally present in the low affinity rodent α1 isoforms and were shown previously to confer cardiac glycoside insensitivity of the rodent α1 isoforms. Also our laboratory has previously demonstrated that these substitutions in the sheep α1 isoform reduced its ouabain affinity by 1000-fold without altering its enzymatic activity (28Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 29Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6638-6641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a BstBI restriction enzyme site was introduced as a silent mutation for easy identification of the targeted allele. The ouabain-insensitive α2 isoform mice were generated by the Cre-LoxP gene targeting strategy as depicted in Fig. 2. The strategy consists of two sequential ES cell transfections. The first transfection introduces the targeting sequence into one of the wild type alleles by homologous recombination. Successful homologous recombination results in heterozygous ES cell clones having a targeted allele containing the LoxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette and the desired L111R and N122D mutations. The second transfection introduces Cre-recombinase, which excises the neomycin resistance-conferring cassette from the targeted allele by recombination of two LoxP sites. Successful recombination generates heterozygous ES cells containing the desired mutation in exon 4 and one LoxP site in intron 3 within the targeted allele. Following the first ES cell transfection, two successfully targeted ES cell clones, 5A and 10A, were identified by Southern blot analysis following the PstI restriction digestion of their genomic DNA (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The 7-kb fragment, which was detected in all screened ES cell clones, corresponded to the wild type allele. The 3.5-kb fragment corresponded to the targeted allele and results from the additional PstI site within the neomycin resistance cassette of the targeted allele. The introduced BstBI site was retained in ES cell clones 5A and 10A, and therefore, it was assumed that L111R and N122D amino acid substitutions were also retained (data not shown). Cre-recombinase transfection of clone 5A resulted in successful excision of the neomycin resistance cassette in one ES cell clone, clone 39 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). As excision of the neomycin cassette resulted in elimination of the additional PstI site, both targeted and wild type alleles are detected as 7-kb fragments by Southern blot analysis of the PstI-digested genomic DNA. The intensity of the 7-kb fragment is higher in clone 39 than in the original 5A clone, indicating that it is composed of two 7-kb fragments, one corresponding to the wild type allele and the other corresponding to the targeted allele. ES cell clone 39 retained a BstBI site and therefore the desired L111R and N122D amino acid substitution in exon 4 (data not shown). Chimeric animals were generated via blastocyst injections of ES cell clone 39 and were crossed to Black Swiss females to yield heterozygous α2W/R animals. Heterozygous mating was used to generate wild type (α2W/W), heterozygous (α2W/R), and homozygous (α2R/R) offspring that were born in normal Mendelian ratios. The genotype of the animals was identified by the PCR amplification of their genomic DNA, which identifies the wild type allele as a 307-bp fragment and the targeted allele as a 342-bp fragment (Fig. 2C). The α2R/R animals retained the desired mutation as shown by the sequence histogram of their genomic DNA (Fig. 2D). The α2R/R Mice Express the α2 Isoform of the Na,K-ATPase with Reduced Ouabain Affinity and Normal Expression and Tissue Distribution—Introduction of the L111R and N122D amino acid substitutions in the α2 isoform reduced its ouabain affinity in the α2R/R mice as demonstrated by [3H]ouabain binding (Fig. 3A). As expected, no [3H]ouabain binding was detected in kidney from each genotype due to expression of only the low affinity α1 isoform. Total [3H]ouabain binding in wild type heart and skeletal muscle microsomal preparations was attributed to the high affinity α2 isoform. No [3H]ouabain binding was detected in microsomal preparations from the same tissues of the α2R/R mice. This demonstrated a successful reduction in the ouabain affinity of the α2 isoform carrying the L111R and Q122D substitutions. The total [3H]ouabain binding in brain tissue from the α2R/R animals was not fully abolished due to expression of high affinity α3 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase. However, it was reduced by 21%, which correlates well with the amount of the α2 isoform expressed in brain. 2P. F. James and J. B. Lingrel, unpublished data. We also analyzed the protein expression of the α2 isoform in tissues from α2R/R mice to determine whether the desired amino acid substitutions altered its expression and tissue distribution. Western blot analysis of tissue preparations from the α2W/W and α2R/R mice indicated normal protein expression and tissue distribution of the α2 isoform carrying the L111R and N122D amino acid substitutions (Fig. 3B). The α2 isoform of Na,K-ATPase was expressed in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle in both wild type and targeted animals. It is important to point out that an anomalous migration pattern of the α2 isoform was observed in heart and skeletal muscle from both genotypes and resulted from protein overload in these samples. The expression and tissue distribution of the α1 and α3 isoforms in α2R/R mice were analyzed to determine whether any compensatory mechanisms in expression of these two α isoforms resulted from modification of the α2 isoform gene. Western blot analysis showed normal protein expression and tissue distribution of both the α1 and the α3 isoforms in α2R/R mice (Fig. 3B). The α1 isoform was expressed in kidney, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and protein expression levels in these tissues were qualitatively indistinguishable between the two genotypes. The α3 isoform retained its brain-specific expression in targeted animals, and its protein expression level was indistinguishable from that in wild type (Fig. 3B). Furthermore total Na,K-ATPase protein levels, as detected by KETTY antibody that recognizes all the α isoforms, remained normal in tissues of α2R/R animals compared with wild type (Fig. 3B). There was no observable difference in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression in each Western blot analysis, indicating relatively equal protein loading (data not shown). Thus, amino acid substitutions reduced ouabain affinity of the α2 isoform but did not alter its normal prot"
https://openalex.org/W2151305802,"Mutation of the mouse <i>Usp14</i> gene, encoding the homolog of yeast deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6, causes ataxia. Here we show that deletion of the <i>UBP6</i> gene in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> causes sensitivity to a broad range of toxic compounds and antagonizes phenotypic expression and <i>de novo</i> induction of the yeast prion [PSI<sup>+</sup>], a functionally defective self-perpetuating isoform of the translation termination factor Sup35. Conversely, overexpression of ubiquitin (Ub) increases phenotypic expression and induction of [PSI<sup>+</sup>] in the wild type cells and suppresses all tested <i>ubp6</i>Δ defects, indicating that they are primarily due to depletion of cellular Ub levels. Several lines of evidence suggest that Ubp6 functions on the proteasome. First, Ub levels in the <i>ubp6</i>Δ cells can be partly restored by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that deletion of Ubp6 decreases Ub levels by increasing proteasome-dependent degradation of Ub. Second, fluorescence microscopy analysis shows that Ubp6-GFP fusion protein is localized to the nucleus of yeast cell, as are most proteasomes. Third, the N-terminal Ub-like domain, although it is not required for nuclear localization of Ubp6, targets Ubp6 to the proteasome and cannot be functionally replaced by Ub. The human ortholog of Ubp6, USP14, probably plays a similar role in higher eukaryotes, since it fully compensates for <i>ubp6</i>Δ defects and binds to the yeast proteasome. These data link the Ub system to prion expression and propagation and have broad implications for other neuronal inclusion body diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2047857263,"The activity of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, and consequently their influence on cellular functions, can be substantially altered by phosphorylation. Several protein kinases that modulate Kv channel activity are found in membrane subdomains known as lipid rafts, which are thought to organize signaling complexes in the cell. Thus, we asked whether Kv1.4 and Kv4.2, two channels with critical roles in excitable cells, are found in lipid rafts. Acylation can target proteins to raft regions; however, Kv channels are not acylated, and therefore, a different mechanism must exist to bring them into these membrane subdomains. Because both Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 interact with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), which is acylated (specifically, palmitoylated), we examined whether PSD-95 can recruit these channels to lipid rafts. We found that a portion of Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 protein in rat brain membranes is raft-associated. Lipid raft patching and immunostaining confirmed that some Kv4.2 is in Thy-1-containing rafts in rat hippocampal neurons. Using a heterologous expression system, we determined that palmitoylation of PSD-95 was crucial to its localization to lipid rafts. We then assessed the contribution of PSD-95 to the raft association of these channels. Co-expression of PSD-95 increased the amount of Kv1.4, but not Kv4.2, in lipid rafts. Deleting the PSD-95 binding motif of Kv1.4 eliminated this recruitment, as did substituting a palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 mutant.

In particular, it has been suggested that Kv1.4, which is located axonally and presynaptically (1.Cooper E.C. Milroy A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Lowenstein D.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 965-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), modulates action potential propagation (2.Debanne D. Guerineau N.C. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and neurotransmitter release (3.Jackson M.B. Konnerth A. Augustine G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, Kv4.2 is localized to the somatodendritic region of neurons (4.Alonso G. Widmer H. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), where it is poised to influence the excitability of the postsynaptic membrane (5.Hoffman D.A. Johnston D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3521-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Adams J.P. Anderson A.E. Varga A.W. Dineley K.T. Cook R.G. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The activity of these channels, and therefore their influence on cellular functions, can be significantly altered by protein kinases and phosphatases. The activity of Kv1.4 is known to be affected by protein kinase C (PKC) (7.Murray K.T. Fahrig S.A. Deal K.K. Po S.S. Hu N.N. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and tyrosine kinases (8.Peretz A. Sobko A. Attali B. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1999; 519: 373-384Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), while Kv4.2 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) (9.Anderson A.E. Adams J.P. Qian Y. Cook R.G. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5337-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), PKC (10.Nakamura T.Y. Coetzee W.A. Vega-Saenz d.M. Artman M. Rudy B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1775-H1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) (6.Adams J.P. Anderson A.E. Varga A.W. Dineley K.T. Cook R.G. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Certain isoforms of the above kinases are found in membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts, which are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and are thought to exist in a “liquid-order” state that is distinct from the more fluid, disordered state exhibited by surrounding phospholipids (11.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 12.Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). This tightly ordered array of cholesterol and sphingolipids more readily incorporates molecules with saturated, unbranched side chains and tends to exclude molecules with unsaturated side chains. Thus, many proteins that reside in rafts, including several protein kinases, G proteins and other members of signal transduction cascades, are often acylated, particularly myristoylated and/or palmitoylated (13.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In some cases, this acylation can serve as a targeting signal for lipid rafts (13.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The enrichment of signaling molecules in lipid rafts has led to speculation that these microdomains serve to organize and concentrate signaling complexes in the cell. Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 are not known to be acylated. Thus, if they are present in lipid rafts, the mechanism by which they are recruited is not known. Therefore, we first determined if these Kv channels are found in lipid rafts. Both Kv channels interact with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) (14.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 15.Wong W. Newell E.W. Jugloff D.G. Jones O.T. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20423-20430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain protein, which is acylated (specifically, palmitoylated, Ref. 16.Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we also assessed whether PSD-95 can recruit these channels to lipid rafts. We show that a portion of Kv1.4, Kv4.2, and PSD-95 protein in rat brain membranes is found in lipid raft fractions. We then exploited heterologous expression to determine the role of palmitoylation in the targeting of PSD-95 to raft regions, and demonstrate that a palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 mutant is not trafficked to rafts. Next, we assessed the contribution of PSD-95 to the lipid raft localization of Kv1.4 and Kv4.2. Co-expression of PSD-95 increased the amount of Kv1.4, but not Kv4.2, in lipid rafts, and substituting a palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 mutant eliminated this recruitment. Surprisingly, a Kv1.4 deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif was largely excluded from lipid rafts, whether or not PSD-95 was co-expressed. This suggests that binding to an endogenous PDZ domain protein in tsA201 cells allowed raft localization of Kv1.4. This work represents the first evidence that PSD-95 binding can recruit Kv channels to lipid rafts, a process that could facilitate interactions with the protein kinases that affect Kv channel activity. Materials—The Kv1.4 cDNA (residues 1–655) in the expression vector pSVK3 and the antibodies to Kv1.4 (17.Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol.

Myc-tagged PSD-95 in the expression vector pGW1-CMV was a generous gift from Dr. Morgan Sheng (Harvard University, Boston, MA). ECFP-Kv4.2 (a full-length Kv4.2 tagged with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, ECFP), ECFP-Kv4.2ΔVSAL (an ECFP-tagged deletion mutant lacking the Val-Ser-Ala-Leu (VSAL) motif at the C terminus) and C3,5S-PSD-95 (a palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 mutant in which the cysteine residues at positions 3 and 5 are replaced by serine residues) have all been previously described (15.Wong W.

All chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Oakville, ON, Canada) unless otherwise indicated. Preparation of ECFP-Kv1.4 and ECFP-Kv1.4ΔETDV—ECFP-Kv1.4, an ECFP-tagged version of full-length Kv1.4, was prepared by Pfu-Turbo PCR, using the Kv1.4/pSVK3 plasmid (residues 1–655; Dr. Owen Jones) as the template, and 5′-TTTGAATTCATGGAGGTGGCAATGGTG-3′ (introduces an EcoRI site) and 5′-TTTGGGCCCTTTTCACACATCAGTCTCCACAGC-3′ (introduces an ApaI site) as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The resulting PCR product was then ligated into the EcoRI and ApaI sites of pECFP-C1 to generate ECFP-Kv1.4. A Kv1.4 deletion mutant lacking the last four C-terminal amino acids (Glu-Thr-Asp-Val; ETDV) (ECFP-Kv1.4ΔETDV) was prepared in the same manner as ECFP-Kv1.4, except that 5′-TTTGGGCCCTTTTCACACAGCCTTTGCATT-3′ was substituted as the reverse primer to introduce a premature stop codon before the ETDV motif. Preparation of Sucrose Density Gradients—To assess the lipid raft localization of Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 in native tissue, sucrose density gradients were prepared (18.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) from rat brain membranes (as in Ref. 19.Jones O.T. Bernstein G.M. Jones E.J. Jugloff D.G. Law M. Wong W. Mills L.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6152-6164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain membrane protein (1 mg total) was solubilized in 2 ml of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in MBS (MES-buffered saline; 25 mm MES pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl). After homogenizing with 10 up-and-down strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer, the extract was adjusted to 45% sucrose and overlaid with 4 ml of 30% sucrose in MBS and 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MBS. The sucrose gradient was formed by centrifuging at ∼200,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW41 rotor. Twelve 1-ml aliquots were removed beginning at the top. To assess the contribution of PSD-95 to the lipid raft localization of the Kv channels, ECFP-Kv1.4, ECFP-Kv4.2 or their respective deletion mutants were transfected alone or co-transfected with PSD-95 or C3,5S-PSD-95 into tsA201 cells (also known as HEK293T cells) using calcium phosphate precipitation (three 100-mm plates per transfection condition), as described previously (15.Wong W. Newell E.W. Jugloff D.G. Jones O.T. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20423-20430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS; 139 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.48 mm KH2PO4) and solubilized in 2 ml 1% Triton X-100 in MBS. Lipid raft isolation was carried out as above although 20 up-and-down strokes were used to homogenize the lysates, which were then adjusted to 40% sucrose. As before, twelve 1-ml aliquots were removed beginning at the top. Cholesterol Depletion and Repletion—tsA201 cells were transfected with ECFP-Kv1.4, ECFP-Kv4.2 or PSD-95 as described above. To deplete cholesterol, cells were washed once with D-PBS 48 h after transfection, and incubated with 2% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (cyclodextrin; Sigma) in serum-free medium for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were repleted with cholesterol by incubating them in a mixture of 80 μg/ml cholesterol (Sigma) and 2% cyclodextrin for 1.5 h at 37 °C (20.Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradients were then prepared as above. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting of Sucrose Density Gradients— Equal volumes of each sucrose gradient aliquot were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) using antibodies against Kv1.4 (1:20000), Kv4.2 (from Dr. Owen Jones, 1:1000; Sigma, 1:400), PSD-95 (1:10000; Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), Thy-1 (1:250; BD Pharmingen, Mississauga, ON, Canada), Na+/K+-ATPase (1:50; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), β-actin (1:3000; Sigma), green fluorescent protein (GFP) to detect ECFP (1:15000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and SAP97 (1:1000; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON, Canada). Quantification was done with a GS-670 imaging densitometer and Molecular Analyst 1.1 (Bio-Rad). Slot Blotting of Sucrose Density Gradients—Ganglioside M1 (GM1) was used as a marker of lipid rafts in tsA201 cells. In order to pinpoint the location of lipid rafts in sucrose density gradients prepared from mock-transfected tsA201 cells, equal aliquots of each fraction were diluted 1:100 and applied to nitrocellulose membrane with a slot blot apparatus (Invitrogen). After extensive washing with PBS and blocking with 5% Carnation powdered skim milk, the membrane was then incubated with 1:1000 cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by ECL. Detection of Cellular Free Cholesterol with Filipin—Cholesterol depletion disrupts the integrity of lipid rafts, which is often demonstrated by re-location of GM1 into higher density fractions (21.Watzl C. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22.Saeki K. Miura Y. Aki D. Kurosaki T. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We proved that cholesterol depletion and repletion were successful in tsA201 cells by detecting free cellular cholesterol with filipin (Sigma) as previously described (23.McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3601-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and transfected with salmon sperm DNA (mock-transfected) the following day. Cholesterol depletion and repletion were carried out as described above, and results were compared with control cells incubated with serum-free DMEM for the same period. Cells were fixed for 1 h with 2% paraformaldehyde and then stained with 50 μg/ml filipin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were mounted with Slowfade (Molecule Probes), sealed with nail polish and imaged with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a digital camera (Zeiss AxioCam) and a 40× objective, using identical exposure settings. Lipid Raft Patching in Neurons—Postnatal rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as previously described (24.Brewer G.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from 2–3-day-old rats, incubated in 2 mg/ml papain (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and then mechanically triturated in Neurobasal A/B27 (Neurobasal A medium with 2% B27 supplement, 2 mm l-glutamine and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin; all from Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). Neurons were separated from other brain cells with an Optiprep (Invitrogen) density gradient. The neuron-enriched layer was plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated German glass coverslips (Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) at a density of 4 × 104 cells/coverslip and maintained in Neurobasal A/B27. Cultures were re-fed every 4 days by removing half of the conditioned medium and replacing it with an equal volume of fresh medium. Cells were used at 21 days in culture for the lipid raft patching procedure (25.Aarts L.H. Verkade P. van Dalen J.J. van Rozen A.J. Gispen W.H. Schrama L.H. Schotman P. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After chilling on ice for 15 min, neurons were washed with ice-cold D-PBS supplemented with 0.7 mm CaCl2 and 0.48 mm MgCl2 (D-PBS/CM). They were subsequently incubated with 1:50 anti-Thy-1 (the same antibody used to immunoblot rat brain membranes) in 0.1% BSA in d-PBS/CM for1hon ice, followed by 1:200 goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 in 0.1% BSA in d-PBS/CM for 1 h on ice. The neurons were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice and methanol for 5 min at -20 °C. After blocking with 5% BSA, Kv4.2 was detected with 1:100 anti-Kv4.2 (Sigma), followed by a 1 h incubation with 1:200 goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (both antibodies were diluted in 0.1% BSA/d-PBS/CM). The coverslips were mounted with Slowfade and sealed with nail polish. Image stacks spanning 0.25 μm (with images spaced 25 nm apart) were collected and deconvolved in AxioVision 3.1 (Carl Zeiss Inc.) using the nearest neighbors algorithm. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to analyze immunoblotting data following arcsine transformation to produce data with a normal distribution (26.Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1974: 185-186Google Scholar). Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Kv1.4, Kv4.2, and PSD-95 Are Found in Lipid Rafts in Rat Brain Membranes—Immunoblots of sucrose density gradients prepared from rat brain membranes show a portion of Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 protein in low density membrane fractions, with the majority in high density membrane fractions at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 1). These results were replicated in five independent gradient preparations. We confirmed the quality of our preparation by immunoblotting the sucrose density gradients for a non-raft membrane protein, Na+/K+-ATPase (27.Pesanova Z. Novotny J. Cerny J. Milligan G. Svoboda P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and a membrane protein marker of lipid rafts, Thy-1 (28.Laux T. Fukami K. Thelen M. Golub T. Frey D. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). As expected, Na+/K+-ATPase was found exclusively in the high density membrane fractions at the bottom of the gradient, and Thy-1 was found exclusively in a low density membrane fraction (Fig. 1). An earlier study did not detect Kv4.2 in lipid rafts (immunoreactivity was confined to the bottom of the gradient) (29.Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Since that study used a lower detergent:protein ratio, which has been shown to increase the amount of raft protein extracted (30.Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it is surprising that a raft association for Kv4.2 was not detected. However, it should be noted that positive and negative controls for raft- and non-raft proteins were not provided in that study, and the reproducibility of the results was not discussed. Although our Kv4.2 antibody has been extensively employed to detect Kv4.2 in immunoblots of heart tissue (31.Wickenden A.D. Jegla T.J. Kaprielian R. Backx P.H. Am. J.

Birks B.R. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1800-H1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also probed a sucrose density gradient with a commercially available antibody against Kv4.2 (6.Adams J.P. Anderson A.E. Varga A.W.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3164-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found PSD-95 in both low and high density membrane fractions, essentially mirroring the distributions of Kv1.4 and Kv4.2. Unfortunately, three of the earlier studies did not use negative controls to delineate non-raft fractions (35.Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 36.Perez A.S. Bredt D.S. Neurosci.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3164-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the other three studies used both positive and negative markers for raft association (37.El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Brock S.C. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44984-44992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38.Fallon L. Moreau F. Croft B.G. Labib N. Gu W.J. Fon E.A. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus providing strong evidence that a portion of PSD-95 protein is localized to lipid rafts. Palmitoylation Is Necessary to Localize PSD-95 to Lipid Rafts in tsA201 Cells—Sucrose gradients prepared from mock-transfected tsA201 cells were probed for GM1, which was used as a positive marker of lipid rafts because these cells do not express Thy-1 or caveolin (41.Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Band intensities for GM1 peaked in fractions 4 and 5 (Fig. 2A); therefore, these fractions were designated as the lipid raft fractions. To verify that fractions 4 and 5 were free of non-raft proteins, we also immunoblotted for Na+/K+-ATPase and β-actin. Immunoreactivity for these proteins was confined to the high-density fractions at the bottom of the gradients, confirming our ability to separate lipid rafts from other membrane and cellular components. We then prepared density gradients from tsA201 cells transfected with wild-type PSD-95 or a palmitoylation-deficient mutant, C3,5S-PSD-95 (42.Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 532-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Dual palmitoylation at the N terminus is necessary for the localization of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) (43.Arni S. Keilbaugh S.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28478-28485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), linker for activation of T cells (LAT) (44.Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) (45.Hiol A. Davey P.C. Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Fischer E.R. Chen C.K. Milligan G. Druey K.M. Jones T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to raft microdomains. We therefore predicted that a PSD-95 mutant lacking the requisite cysteine residues at positions 3 and 5 would not localize to lipid rafts. Wild-type PSD-95 distributed between raft and non-raft fractions, with most of the protein in the bottom of the gradient (non-raft fractions) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, C3,5S-PSD-95 was primarily concentrated at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 2A), although very faint bands were detected in the low density raft fractions after overnight exposure (data not shown). This demonstrates that palmitoylation assists in bringing PSD-95 into lipid rafts in tsA201 cells. These results were replicated using three independently transfected cell batches. However, they differ from a previous study which reported that an identical PSD-95 mutant remained significantly raft-associated and that removing the N terminus and three PDZ domains was required to abolish immunoreactivity in the low density raft fractions (36.Perez A.S. Bredt D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 258: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A possible explanation arises from the different cell types used for heterologous expression: tsA201 cells in our study, COS-7 cells in (36.Perez A.S. Bredt D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 258: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although both are derived from kidney tissue, they likely exhibit different patterns of protein expression. COS-7 cells may express an endogenous protein that bi"

Their structure functions to protect the ends of linear chromosomes and ensure chromosomal stability. One of the mammalian telomere-binding factors, TRF1, localizes telomeres by binding to double-stranded telomeric DNA arrays. Because the overexpression of wild-type and dominant-negative TRF1 induces progressive telomere shortening and elongation in human cells, respectively, a proposed major role of TRF1 is that of a negative regulator of telomere length. Here we report another crucial function of TRF1 in telomeres. In conditional mouse TRF1 null mutant embryonic stem cells, TRF1 deletion induced growth defect and chromosomal instability. Although no clear telomere shortening or elongation was observed in short term cultured TRF1-deficient cells, abnormal telomere signals were observed, and TRF1-interacting telomere-binding factor, TIN2, lost telomeric association. Furthermore, another double-stranded telomeric DNA-binding factor, TRF2, also showed decreased telomeric association. Importantly, end-to-end fusions with detectable telomere signals at fusion points accumulated in TRF1-deficient cells. These results strongly suggest that TRF1 interacts with other telomere-binding molecules and integrates into the functional telomere structure.

These results strongly suggest that TRF1 interacts with other telomere-binding molecules and integrates into the functional telomere structure. Telomeres are specialized DNA structures positioned at the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes (1.Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Since the original work of Muller (2.Muller H.J. Collecting Net. 1938; 13: 183-195Google Scholar) and McClintock (3.McClintock B. Genetics. 1941; 26: 234-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the telomere has been thought to protect chromosome ends from degradation and end-to-end fusions. Telomeres consist of repetitive G-rich DNA sequences and associated proteins that function to distinguish natural chromosome ends from damage-induced DNA breaks. During the proliferation of mammalian cells, telomeres shorten after each round of DNA replication, because DNA polymerase fails to synthesize the distal ends of chromosomal DNA (4.Olovnikov A.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1973; 41: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). This “end replication problem” limits the growth potential of normal cells. However, in cells that divide indefinitely (e.g. germ and tumor cells), telomere length is maintained by telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that adds telomeric TTAGGG repeats onto the 3′ ends of chromosomes (5.de Lange T. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 265-293Google Scholar, 6.Harley C.B. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 247-262Google Scholar, 7.Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben-Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W. Kaneko S. Murakami S. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 241-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The length of telomeric DNA repeats has been believed to be crucial for the proper function of telomeres. Indeed, chromosomal stability has been shown to require a minimum telomere length. However, more recent studies indicate that telomere function critically depends on structural aspects of the telomere rather than length alone (8.Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the formation of a functional telomere structure requires the expression of several telomere-interacting molecules. In mammals, three telomeric DNA-binding proteins, termed POT1, TRF1, and TRF2, have been identified (9.Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 10.Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T. Science. 1995; 270: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 11.Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). POT1 binds to single-stranded TTAGGG repeats. In contrast, TRF1 and TRF2 homodimerize and bind specifically to double-stranded TTAGGG repeats through their Myb-related DNA-binding domains. Although TRF1 and TRF2 possess similar biochemical characteristics, their roles in telomere function are quite distinct. Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, TRF2 promotes T-loop formation in which the 3′ telomeric overhang is invaded into the preceding duplex telomeric repeat array (12.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). Overexpression of dominant-negative TRF2 activates the ATM/p53 or p16/RB pathways and induces cellular senescence or apoptosis (13.Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 14.Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4338-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of TRF2 induces end-to-end fusions and chromosomal instabilities (15.van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 16.Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that TRF2 is a key player in “functional telomere structure” and protects chromosome ends. In contrast, current evidence indicates that TRF1 functions to negatively regulate telomere length (17.van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Overproduction of wild-type or dominant-negative TRF1 induces progressive telomere shortening or elongation, respectively. However, TRF1 expression appears to play no role in cell growth in humans as demonstrated by its dominant-negative form. The TRF1 protein has been shown to associate with additional factors, called tankyrase 1 and 2, which also modulate telomere length (18.Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 19.Smith S. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Tankyrase 1 and 2 are a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that targets TRF1 and induces progressive telomere lengthening via the dissociation of TRF1 from telomeric structures in humans (19.Smith S. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20.Cook B.D. Dynek J.N. Chang W. Shostak G. Smith S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TIN2 mimics TRF1 function to negatively regulate telomere length (18.Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Dominant inhibition studies suggest that the primary function of TRF1 is to regulate telomere length (17.van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). However, these overexpression studies do not rule out the possibility that some endogenous TRF1 remains bound to telomeres in cells expressing the dominant-negative mutant (17.van Steensel B. de Lange T.

To directly test the role of TRF1 in telomere function, we generated conditional TRF1-deficient embryonic stem (ES) 1The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; mTRF1, murine TRF1; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Ab, antibody; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MBN, mung bean nuclease; OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; PI, propidium iodide. cells. We now demonstrate that murine TRF1 (mTRF1) is absolutely required for normal cell growth, telomere structure, and chromosomal stability. TRF1 Targeting and Expression Constructs—13.9 kb of genomic DNA containing the mTRF1 gene was isolated from a 129SV genomic phage clone. To make a mTRF1 targeting construct, a 1.4-kb EcoRV-EcoRI fragment 5′ and a 5.7-kb SpeI-EcoRI fragment 3′ to exon 1 of mTRF1 gene were subcloned into the XhoI and SalI sites of the targeting vector pLNTK, respectively. To make a mTRF1 expression plasmid pCLC-mTRF1, a 1.6-kb mTRF1 cDNA fragment was isolated from a C57BL/6 mouse thymocyte cDNA phage library. Generation of Targeted and Transgenic ES Cells—To generate mTRF1+/- ES cells, 20 μg of the linearized mTRF1 targeting plasmid was electroporated into 2 × 107 E14 ES cells as described (22.Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). To generate mTRF1-/- ES cells that carry the mTRF1 transgene, the neo gene flanked by loxP sites in the targeted locus was removed by infection with adenovirus expressing the site-specific Cre recombinase (23.Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). One of the mTRF1+/-, conTG+, Mer-Cre-Mer+ ES cell clones, HB, was retargeted with the targeting plasmid. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle—ES cells were labeled for 30 min in media containing 20 μm BrdUrd and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20 °C. After rehydration in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed cells were treated with 2 n HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, washed extensively in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), and stained with anti-BrdUrd Ab (Becton Dickinson) diluted 1:100 in the blocking buffer for 20 min. After several washes, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab (e-bioscience) diluted 1:200 in the blocking buffer for 20 min. After several washes, the cells were incubated for 20 min with 50 μg/ml RNase A. Propidium iodide (PI) (10 μg/ml) was added just before analysis. For TUNEL analysis, apoptotic cells were stained with a MEBSTAIN Apoptosis Direct kit (Medical & Biological Laboratory, Nagoya, Japan). The cells were analyzed on a FACScan with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Antibody Production—Full-length mTRF1 and mTRF2 cDNAs were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-2 and pGEX-4T-3, respectively (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant fusion molecules were used to immunize rabbits. Anti-mTRF1 and anti-mTRF2 Abs were affinity-purified. Immunofluorescence Analysis—ES cells were treated with colcemid (0.1 μg/ml) for 2 h and allowed to swell in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm glycerol, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2). Cytospun cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and incubated with rabbit anti-mTRF1, anti-mTRF2, or anti-mTIN2 Abs at 37 °C for 40 min. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Zenon Alexa 568 Fluor (Molecular Probes) was used for detection of single staining. The anti-mTRF1 Ab for double staining was conjugated with Alexa 568 using a Zenon labeling kit (Molecular Probes). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, observed under fluorescence microscopy, and analyzed with AxioVision software (Zeiss). Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)—ES cells were harvested after colcemid treatment (0.1 μg/ml) for 2 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in methanol: acetic acid (3:1). The cell suspensions were placed on wet, clean slides and dried overnight. FISH with Cy3-labeled (C3TA2)3 peptide nucleic acid was performed as described (24.Zijlmans J.M. Martens U.M. Poon S.S. Raap A.K. Tanke H.J. Ward R.K. Lansdorp P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7423-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Slot Blot Analysis—Preparation of fixed chromatin and ChIP were performed as described (22.Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Fixed and solubilized chromatin before immunoprecipitation (for input DNA) and immunoprecipitated chromatin bound to protein A beads were digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 90 min at 56 °C and extracted once with phenol/chloroform. The precipitated DNA was un-cross-linked for 8 h at 70 °C, denatured in 0.4 n NaOH for 5 min, neutralized with a 0.5 m Tris-HCl pH 8.0 solution containing 1.5 m NaCl, and slot-blotted onto a nylon membrane (Paul) with Hybri-slot manifold (Invitrogen). The blot was probed with γ-32P-labeled (C3TA2)4 or minor satellite (5′-GACTGAAAAACACATTCGTTGGAAACGGGATTTGTAGAACAGTGTATATCAATGAGTTACAATGAG-3′) oligonucleotides. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis and Terminal Restriction Fragments Analysis—ES cells were mounted in low melting point agarose plugs (5 × 106 cells/plug) following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The plugs were digested with or without MBN (40 units/plug) at 37 °C for 30 min and with HinfI (160 units/plug) overnight. The digested plugs were separated on a 1.1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE maintained at 14 °C, using a CHEF DR-II pulsed field apparatus (Bio-Rad). Pulsed field electrophoresis was performed with 6 V/cm constant for 12 h at a ramped pulse from 1 to 10 s. For examining TRFs containing telomeric sequences, the gel was dried at 60 °C for 3 h, denatured in a 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH solution for 30 min, neutralized in a 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer for 30 min, and probed with γ-32P-labeled (C3TA2)4 telomeric DNA oligonucleotides in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution at 37 °C overnight. Following high stringency washes in 0.1× SSC at 42 °C for 1 h, the gel was autoradiographed. For examination of the status of the 3′ overhangs of the telomeric sequences, the denaturing and neutralization steps were omitted. Generation of Conditional mTRF1-deficient ES Cells—To generate mTRF1-deficient ES cells, we introduced a mTRF1 targeting plasmid, pLNTK-mTRF1TV (Fig. 1A), into E14 mouse ES cells. pLNTK-mTRF1TV potentially introduces a deletion of the initiation codon containing exon 1. Of 44 clones screened, six were identified as correctly targeted with the mTRF1 exon 1 on one allele replaced with the neo gene (mTRF1+/-). We then introduced pLNTK-mTRF1TV again into the neo-deleted mTRF1+/- ES clone, 14-2C2, to target the second allele of mTRF1. Although the targeting efficiency was about the same as that in the first round of targeting (six targeted clones of 22 drug-resistant clones analyzed), no homozygous mutant (mTRF1-/-) ES cell clones were identified (0 of 118 clones screened). These data suggested that mTRF1 may be essential for cellular growth or viability. Therefore, we next introduced a mTRF1 expression plasmid into 14-2C2 and then retargeted. Of 34 clones screened, four clones were targeted to the mTRF1 locus, and two (R11 and R35) were mTRF1-/- (data not shown). Western blot analysis confirmed no endogenous TRF1 expression in these mTRF1-/- ES cells expressing exogenous mTRF1 molecules (Fig. 1E, lane R35, and not shown). Because six amino acid substitutions exist between TRF1 derived from the 129 strain (E14) cDNA (DDBJ data bases with accession number AB109563) and the C57BL/6 strain (exogenous transgene) cDNA (25.Broccoli D. Chong L. Oelmann S. Fernald A.A. Marziliano N. van Steensel B. Kipling D. Le Beau M.M. de Lange T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it is possible to distinguish endogenous and exogenous TRF1 in terms of size in SDS-PAGE. To further confirm that TRF1 is critical for cellular growth or viability and to examine how TRF1 is involved in these cellular events and the functional telomere structure, we established conditional mTRF1-deficient ES cells. We introduced a mTRF1 expression plasmid containing exogenous mTRF1 cDNA flanked by loxP sites and a plasmid expressing a Mer-Cre-Mer fusion molecule into 14-2C2. Mer-Cre-Mer is hormone-dependently (OHT) imported into the nucleus and functions as a site-specific Cre recombinase on the nuclear DNA substrate (26.Zhang Y. Riesterer C. Ayrall A.M. Sablitzky F. Littlewood T.D. Reth M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). From the mTRF1+/- ES cell clone HB, which contains these two plasmids (mTRF1+/-, conTG+), we established two clones of the conditional mTRF1 null mutant ES cells (mTRF1-/-, conTG+), LR8 and LR50, by retargeting with the mTRF1 targeting vector (Fig. 1, C and E, lanes LR8 and LR50). Genotypes of the cells used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1B. Growth Defect of mTRF1-deficient ES Cells—We assayed the growth potential of the conditional mTRF1-deficient ES cells. Each of three sublines of LR8, LR50, control clones M21 (mTRF1-/-, TG+), or HB were cultured in the absence or presence of OHT (0.8 μm) for 2 days and examined for mTRF1 expression. Most of the exogenous mTRF1 in all LR8 and LR50 sublines and in HB disappeared by 2 days of OHT treatment, but not in M21 (Fig. 2A, row for 2 days of OHT treatment (-/+), and data not shown). Southern blot analysis also confirmed that most of the exogenous mTRF1 transgene flanked by loxP sites were OHT-dependently deleted (Fig. 1D, lanes HB, LR8, and LR50). OHT was washed out after 2 days of incubation, and the treated ES cells were further cultured. As shown in Fig. 2B (left panel), control ES cells treated with OHT did not show any growth defect. On the other hand, OHT pretreatment clearly induced growth delay to the conditional mTRF1-deficient ES cells LR8 and LR50, and the doubling time was extended to about twice that of OHT-untreated cells (Fig. 2B, right panel, + lanes). This growth defect gradually recovered after 6 days of OHT (-) culture. Correlating with the growth recovery, re-expression of mTRF1 was observed in the OHT pretreated LR8 and LR50 (Fig. 2A, rows for 6 and 8 days low LR8 (+), and data not shown). These data indicated that a small percentage of the cells treated with OHT for 2 days still contained the mTRF1 transgene, and this minor but transgene-positive population expands because of a predicted advantage in growth over the mTRF1-negative cells. Furthermore, the mTRF1-deficient ES cell clones established from the LR8 and LR50 sublines treated with OHT also displayed continuous growth retardation phenotypes (data not shown). Because TRF1 deletion induced growth defects, we examined p53 activation, p16 accumulation, and apoptosis induction in the conditional mTRF1 mutant ES cells treated with OHT. No clear accumulation of p16, p21, or p53 was observed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). However, PI and TUNEL staining showed a small (10-15%) but consistent induction of the sub-G1 and TUNEL-positive apoptotic population in the TRF1-deficient ES cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, we performed cell cycle analysis using BrdUrd incorporation and PI staining. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the efficiency of BrdUrd incorporation into the cells and the S phase transition of the cell cycle were not affected in the growth-retarded conditional TRF1-deficient ES cells, but the relative percentage of the S phase population reproducibly decreased (average percentage ± standard deviation for three independent experiments; 59.15 ± 3.13% in 8-1 (+) against 71.81 ± 1.75% in 8-1 (-) cells; represented one of the three analyses in Fig. 2E). Because ES cells are difficult to arrest at any particular stage of the cell cycle, and these analyses could not be conducted under a synchronous condition, we were not able to determine the cell cycle stage that was affected by the TRF1 deficiency. Dissociation of TIN2 and TRF2 from Telomeres in mTRF1-deficient ES Cells—Because the majority of the conditional TRF1-deficient ES cells survived in culture, we next studied how TRF1 deficiency affects telomere structure. Interphase and metaphase spreads were prepared from control M21 ES cells or conditional LR8-1 mTRF1-deficient ES cells pretreated with or without OHT or mTRF1-deficient ES cells, and the nuclear and telomeric localization of the telomere-associated factors, mTRF1, mTRF2, and mTIN2, were examined. As shown in Fig. 3, without OHT pretreatment, mTRF1, mTRF2, and mTIN2 all formed telomere-associated nuclear speckles in interphase and localized in the telomeres of metaphase spreads in M21 and LR8-1 (Fig. 3, A and B; data not shown). In OHT-treated M21 cells, localization of these telomere factors was not affected (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, OHT-pretreated LR8-1 showed distinct staining profiles. In correlation with Western blot analyses (Fig. 2A), more than 90% of OHT-treated LR8-1 cells lost their mTRF1 foci (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, in mTRF1-negative LR8-1 cells, mTIN2 lost telomeric association in both interphase and metaphase spreads, but mTRF2 remained associated with telomeres (Fig. 3, B and C, TIN2 and TRF2 panels; and data not shown). However, this telomeric association of mTRF2 was consistently and reproducibly less extensive (Fig. 3C, TRF1 and TRF2 panels). LR50 behaved identically to LR8-1 after OHT treatment, and such phenotypes were maintained in the TRF1-deficient clones (data not shown). These data demonstrated that mTIN2 is indeed an mTRF1-dependent telomere-associating factor, as in humans (18.Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). It is now suggested that there is some functional interaction, direct or indirect, between mTRF1 and mTRF2 for the telomere association of mTRF2. To further quantitate the effect of mTRF1 deletion on the telomeric association of these telomere-associated factors, we performed ChIP analyses. Fixed and solubilized chromatin fractions were prepared from control M21 and LR8-1 cells with or without OHT pretreatment and incubated with anti-mTRF1, anti-mTRF2, anti-mTIN2, or control Abs (rabbit preimmune serum and anti-CENP-A Ab). Because centromeres are physically adjacent to the p-arm telomeres in mice, we used CENP-A, one of the centromere-binding molecules, as a control target molecule for ChIP. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, OHT pretreatment induced mTRF1 deletion but had no effect on the expressions of mTRF2, mTIN2, and CENP-A in LR8-1 cells. Slot blot analysis demonstrated that telomeric DNA arrays were enriched by anti-mTRF1, anti-mTRF2, and anti-mTIN2 Abs but not by preimmune serum and anti-CENP-A Ab from either M21 or LR8-1 cells (Fig. 4B and data not shown). In M21 cells, OHT treatment did not greatly affect the recovery of telomeric DNA arrays (Fig. 4, B and C, upper panels). However, in LR8-1 cells pretreated with OHT, the recovery of telomeric DNA arrays by anti-mTRF1 and anti-mTIN2 was reduced to less than and about 25%, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C, lower panels). Furthermore, telomeric signals of the OHT-treated LR8-1 cells immunoprecipitated with anti-mTRF2 were also reduced to about 40%. Importantly, anti-CENP-A specifically precipitated minor satellite DNA arrays from both cell lines, and the amount of precipitation was not changed despite OHT pretreatment, suggesting that the phenotypes of the telomere-associated factors in the OHT-treated LR8-1 are specific. The same findings were also obtained in other control and conditional mTRF1-deficient cell lines (data not shown). These results were consistent with our immunohistochemical staining data and further strengthened the notion that the telomeric localization of mTIN2 is dependent on that of mTRF1. Moreover, these data supported the supposition that there is no competition for telomeric binding between TRF1 and TRF2, as was proposed by de Lange and co-workers (12.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar) and further suggested that mTRF1 is, to some extent, involved in the telomere association of mTRF2. In the in vitro studies, human TRF1 showed bending and parallel pairing activities against double-stranded DNA containing the telomeric repeats (27.Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28.Griffith J. Bianchi A. de Lange T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was speculated that these activities could facilitate or stabilize T-loop formation mediated by TRF2 in vivo (12.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). According to the previous data (29.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), TRF2 preferentially localizes to the junction where double-stranded telomeric repeats are invaded by the 3′ telomeric overhang in the T-loop structure. If complete deletion of TRF1 induces reduction of T-loop formation, it is possible that mTRF2 reduction associated with the telomere in the mTRF1-deficient ES cells may occur. Abnormal Telomere Structure and Chromosomal Instability in mTRF1-deficient ES Cells—Finally, we examined the telomeric DNA arrays, telomere length, and chromosomal stability in the mTRF1-deficient ES cells. Metaphase spreads prepared from M21, LR8-1, and LR50-7 cells with or without OHT pretreatment were hybridized with the peptide nucleic acid-telomere probe. As shown in Fig. 5A, typical 4 spot telomere signals on one metaphase chromosome were observed in M21 cells with or without OHT treatment and LR8-1 and LR50-7 cells without OHT treatment. However, in LR8-1 and LR50-7 cells pretreated with OHT and cultured for 3 more days, metaphase chromosomes showed abnormal and diffused telomere signals. Approximately 12% (11.7% for LR8-1 and 12.7% for LR50-7) of the metaphase chromosomes examined displayed more than one telomere signal at the end of one sister chromatid (inset in Fig. 5A, LR50-7 (+), and Table I). Furthermore, we frequently observed unequal intensities of two telomere signals between one arm of sister chromatid ends, and about 2% of the chromatid ends completely lost telomere signals (Fig. 5A, inset, LR8-1 (+), and Table I). Chromosome instability in the form of end-to-end fusions was barely detected in the short term cultured mTRF1-deficient ES cells as revealed by DAPI staining (Table I).Table IChromosomal abnormalities associated with the deletion of TRF15 days after 2 days of OHT treatmentHBLR8-1LR50-7−OHT+OHT−OHT+OHT−OHT+OHTEndogenous TRF1+/−+/−−/−−/−−/−−/−TRF1 cDNA+−+−+−No. of metaphases analyzed101010101010No. of chromosomes/metaphase40.140.341.2404140.4No. of abnormal telomere signalsa“Abnormal” denotes the presence of more than one telomere signal at the end of one sister chromatid.bThe numbers in parentheses indicate the percentages of total telomeres detected.

Open table in a new tab Induction of replicative senescence or overexpression of dominant-negative TRF2 induces 3′ overhang of single-stranded telomeric DNA erosion (15.van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 30.Stewart S.A. Ben-Porath I. Carey V.J. O'Connor B.F. Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and overexpression of dominant-negative TRF1 induces progressive telomere elongation (17.van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the telomere length and status of the 3′ overhang of the telomeric arrays in the conditional mTRF1-deficient ES cells treated with OHT by Southern blot analysis. Although we have seen abnormal telomere signals in the metaphase spreads prepared from the short term cultured mTRF1-deficient ES cells (Fig. 5A), by means of TRF assay, there were no clear changes in their size, distribution, and signal intensity (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the single-stranded 3′ overhang of the telomeric signals was not considerably affected in LR8-1 or LR50-7 cells pretreated with OHT (Fig. 5C). The present data suggest that the frequently observed abnormal telomere signals, detected by peptide nucleic acid-telomere FISH, in the short term cultured TRF1-deficient ES cells, hardly ever result from dynamic telomere DNA rearrangements. We also examined telomeric arrays and chromosomal stabilities in the mTRF1-deficient ES cell clones prepared after about 50 cell divisions. We found accumulation of abnormal chromosomes in mTRF1-deficient cells in addition to the abnormal telomere signals as seen in the short term cultured mTRF1-deficient cells, and as many as 11-15% of metaphase chromosomes showed end-to-end fusions (Fig. 5E and Table II, clones 81-7 and 81-24). Furthermore, most of the fused chromosomes contained telomeric DNA arrays at the fusion points (Fig. 5E, arrow). Intensities of telomeric DNA signals on the ends of mTRF1-deficient metaphase chromosomes became highly divergent in contrast to those of the mTRF1-positive clones (Fig. 5D), potentially indicating the induction of inter-telomeric recombinations. Supporting this possibility, at least some population of the TRFs detected by the telomere probe clearly elongated in these mTRF1-deficient ES cell clones (Fig. 5F). Of course, the reduction of telomeric association of mTRF2 in mTRF1-deficient cells may have contributed to this chromosomal instability phenotype, in addition to the growth defect.Table IIEnd-to-end fusions observed in mTRF1 KO cellsClone 81-8 TRF1+Clone 81-26 TRF1+Clone 81-7 TRF1−Clone 81-24 TRF1−No. of metaphases analyzed10101212No. of chromosomes/metaphase41.241.139.437.5No. of end-to-end fusionsaThe numbers in parentheses indicate percentages of metaphase chromosomes detected.11 (2.7)10 (2.4)55 (11.6)68 (15.1)Containing TTAGGG103453Not containing TTAGGG10102115No. of chromosome fragmentsaThe numbers in parentheses indicate percentages of metaphase chromosomes detected.006 (1.3)1 (2.7)No. of ring chromosomes (chromatid-type fusion)aThe numbers in parentheses indicate percentages of metaphase chromosomes detected.001 (0.2)4 (0.9)a The numbers in parentheses indicate percentages of metaphase chromosomes detected. Open table in a new tab There was no growth defect in the human cell lines overexpressing dominant-negative TRF1 (17.van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The reason why two different TRF1 knock-out systems gave rise to different results is not clear, but this issue is probably important for dissecting the roles of TRF1 in cell growth. One possibility is that the cells overexpressing dominant-negative TRF1 sustained some endogenous TRF1 at their telomeres, which might be sufficient for their normal cell growth. Another possibility is that the growth potential associated with TRF1 might be independent from telomere-bound TRF1. Furthermore, we could not evaluate the proposed function of TRF1 on telomere length regulation because of the much longer telomeric DNA arrays in mouse (Fig. 5B). However, the current data strongly suggested that mTRF1 integrates into the “functional telomere structure,” and therefore the dysfunction of TRF1 is potentially involved in cellular senescence related with telomere erosion and chromosomal instabilities. So far, a number of TRF1 interacting molecules such as TIN2, Tankyrase, KU70/80, and PINX1 have been shown to mimic or modulate some functions of TRF1 (18.Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat.

Furthermore, recent findings demonstrated that association of POT1 with telomeres is partly mediated by TRF1 (33.Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). To further address the issue of how TRF1 is integrated into the functional telomere structure, it is important to clarify how each TRF1-associated molecule and other telomere-binding factors are involved with the phenotypes of the mTRF1 null cells described in this study. Addendum—While this manuscript was under review, Karlseder et al. (34.Karlseder J. Kachatrian L. Takai H. Mercer K. Hingorani S. Jacks T. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6533-6541Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reported that deletion of the first exon of mouse TRF1 (Terf1) results in growth defects and promotes embryonic death, consistent with our results.

First, to determine whether rSK3 could co-assemble with rSK2 we created rSK3VK (an SK3 mutant insensitive to block by UCL 1848). When rSK3VK was co-expressed with rSK2 the resulting currents had an intermediate sensitivity to UCL 1848 (IC50 of ∼5nm compared with 120 pm for rSK2 and >300 nm for rSK3VK), suggesting that rSK3 and rSK2 can form functional heteromeric channels. To detect co-assembly of SK3 with SK1, we initially used a dominant negative construct of the human SK1 subunit (hSK1YP). hSK1YP dramatically reduced the SK3 current, supporting the idea that SK3 and SK1 subunits also interact. To determine whether these assemblies were functional we created rSK3VF, an rSK3 mutant with an enhanced affinity for tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) (IC50 of 0.3 mm). Co-transfection of rSK3VF and hSK1 produced currents with a sensitivity to TEA not different from that of hSK1 alone (IC50 ∼15 mm). These results suggest that hSK1 does not produce functional cell-surface assemblies with SK3. Antibody-staining experiments suggested that hSK1 may reduce the number of functional SK3 subunits reaching the cell surface. Additional experiments showed that co-expression of the rat SK1 gene with SK3 also dramatically suppressed SK current. The pharmacology of the residual current was consistent with that of homomeric SK3 assemblies. These results demonstrate interactions that cause changes in protein trafficking, cell surface expression, and channel pharmacology and strongly suggest heteromeric assembly of SK3 with the other SK channel subunits.

Small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (SK 1The abbreviations used are: SK, small conductance calcium-activated potassium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ABS, antibody blocking solution; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TEA, tetraethylammonium chloride. channels) are widely expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. In many neurons SK channels underlie some components of the post-spike after-hyperpolarization (see e.g. Ref. 1.Sah P. Faber E.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). They also have important functions in non-neuronal tissues. Native SK channels have a characteristic pharmacology. They can be blocked by the bee venom toxin apamin and several selective small molecule blockers that we have developed (such as UCL 1848) that are active at nanomolar or subnanomolar concentrations (2.Chen J.Q.

Molecular cloning studies have identified three closely related genes (SK1, -2, and -3) which code for SK channel subunits in mammalian cells (5.Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 6.Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Morris-Rosendahl D.J. Gargus J.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In both Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines, expression of the rat homologues of SK2 and SK3 (rSK2 and rSK3 respectively) results in the formation of functional homomeric SK channels. Further, both homomeric rSK2 and homomeric rSK3 channels can be blocked by either apamin or UCL 1848 at concentrations that are similar to those reported for native channels (8.Hosseini R. Benton D.C.H. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. Moss G.W.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The potencies of both compounds depend on the subunit composition of the channel, with the IC50 for blocking homomeric SK2 channels being ∼18-fold lower than for SK3. The behavior of SK1 is different to that of other SK genes. Initial expression studies of the human SK1 gene (hSK1) showed that it can produce functional channels in the Xenopus oocyte expression system and these channels are insensitive to apamin at concentrations of up to 100 nm (5.Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Subsequent work, however, expressing hSK1 in mammalian cell lines, showed that most cells produce channels that are blocked by apamin with an IC50 of ∼3–12 nm. A few cells also produce an apamin-insensitive current component (9.Shah M. Haylett D.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10.Strobaek D. Jorgensen T.D. Christophersen P. Ahring P.K. Olesen S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). More recent oocyte work suggests that, in fact, expression of the human SK1 gene also produces some apamin-sensitive channels in this system (11.Grunnet M. Jensen B.S. Olesen S.P. Klaerke D.A. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 441: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reason for this behavior is unclear and it consequently remains unknown whether SK1 forms apamin-sensitive channels or apamin-insensitive channels, or both, in vivo. Interestingly, the rat SK1 gene differs from its human counterpart because it does not produce functional channels when expressed alone in either oocytes or mammalian cell lines (12.Bowden S.E. Fletcher S. Loane D.J. Marrion N.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overlapping patterns of expression for SK1, SK2 and SK3 within the CNS (5.Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 13.Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 476-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that heteromeric assembly of SK subunits may occur. That co-assembly may occur is also suggested by the work of Ishii et al. (15.Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) where it was shown that injection of an SK1-SK2 dimer or co-injection of mRNA for hSK1 and rSK2 into Xenopus oocytes resulted in currents with an apamin sensitivity between that of homomeric hSK1 and rSK2. Following this observation we have recently shown that co-transfection of the rat SK1 and SK2 genes in HEK cells produces channels with a novel pharmacology, suggesting that subunits from these genes can also assemble to form functional heteromeric channels (16.Benton D.C.H. Monaghan A.S. Hosseini R. Bahia P.K. Shah Y. Haylett D.G. Moss G.W.J. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite the progress being made toward understanding SK1/SK2 interactions, much less is known of the interactions between SK3 and the other SK subunits. Interestingly, however, it has been reported that a fragment of SK3, when transfected into the Jurkat cell line, acts as a dominant negative, suppressing the endogenously expressed SK2 current (17.Miller M.J. Rauer H. Tomita H. Rauer H. Gargus J.J. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27753-27756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that SK2 and SK3 may be able to form a heteromeric complex. The principle aim of the present work was to examine, in more detail, the possibility that SK3 interacts with the other SK channel subunits; SK1 and SK2. Constructs—The rat SK1, SK2, and human IK1 (SK4) genes subcloned into the pTracer or pcDNA3 mammalian expression vectors were a generous gift from Prof. Len Kaczmarek and Dr. William Joiner (Yale University). The rat SK1 clone (accession number AF000973) encodes a full-length transcript and was re-engineered to eliminate the 5′-untranslated region and replace it with an optimal Kozak sequence (gccacc) just prior to the start methionine (starting protein sequence MSSRSH...). The rat SK3 gene (accession number AF292389) was previously cloned from a rat SCG library (8.Hosseini R. Benton D.C.H. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. Moss G.W.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 Zeo+ plasmid (Invitrogen). The human hSK1 clone (accession number U69883) was a generous gift from Prof. J. P. Adelman (Vollum Inst.). Mutations were made using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or by standard overlap extension PCR. Constructs were sequenced on an ABI 377 sequencer using the Big Dye II sequencing kit. The TEA-sensitive mutations, which substitute phenylalanine for valine in rSK2 (SK2VF) and rSK3 (SK3VF) are at structurally equivalent amino acid positions (366 and 515 in rSK2 and rSK3, respectively). The UCL 1848-insensitive mutation of rSK3 (SK3VK) substitutes a lysine residue for a valine at position 491. In the dominant negative construct of hSK1 (hSK1YP) proline is substituted for tyrosine at position 351. Plasmid DNA for transfection was purified using Maxi Prep or Midi Prep kits (Qiagen). Maintenance and Transient Transfection of HEK 293 Cells—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were plated into 35-mm culture dishes and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The protocol for transfection of HEK cells was varied slightly according to the precise aims of the experiment. For studies of the pharmacology of homomeric SK channels we used 1 μg of plasmid. For experiments where hSK1YP or rSK1 were co-expressed with another SK gene we used 2 μg of hSK1YP or rSK1 construct to 1 μg of the other. For co-expression of hSK1 and the change-of-function mutants 1 μg of each was used. For immunohistochemistry cells were transfected with 1 μg of rSK3 alone or with 1 μg of rSK3 together with 4 μg of hSK1 or rSK1. In addition, for all experiments, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of QBI plasmid DNA (Qbiogene), which expresses GFP, allowing identification of transfected cells. LipofectAMINE 2000 (1 μl/μg of DNA) and plasmid DNA were mixed in Opti-MEM and added to cells plated into 35-mm culture dishes. After incubation overnight the cells were re-plated into 35-mm dishes and used within 2 days for recording. Cells used for immunohistochemistry were plated on 18-mm square glass coverslips. Immunohistochemistry—Transfected cells plated on glass cover slips were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being fixed for 10 min using freshly made 4% w/v paraformaldehyde (in PBS). Cells were washed in PBS again and permeabilized using 100% methanol for 10 min. After a further wash in PBS the cells were then left in an antibody-blocking solution (ABS) consisting of 2% w/v bovine serum albumin and 2% w/v horse serum in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then incubated for 4 h in the primary anti-rSK3 antibody (Chemicon) at a concentration of 0.3 μg/μl. To remove excess primary antibody, the cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20 and then incubated in a 1:200 dilution of a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Chemicon) for 1 h. All antibodies were diluted in ABS. Following incubation, cells underwent a final wash in PBS with 0.1% v/v Tween-20. Coverslips were mounted onto slides (previously cleaned with ethanol) using a small drop of antifade mount (Vector Laboratories Inc.). All staining operations were carried out at room temperature (∼22 °C). Stained cells were viewed with a Leica TCS confocal microscope. Electrophysiology—Currents were recorded from HEK 293 cells using conventional whole cell voltage clamp methods. The bathing solution contained (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, glucose 10, HEPES 10, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The pipette filling solution contained (in mm): KCl 130, HEPES 10, K2HEDTA 5, and CaCl2 1.2 (free Ca2+ 1 μm). The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using stability constants from Martell and Smith (18.Martell A. Smith R. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1974: 199Google Scholar). The 50 μm (unbuffered) calcium pipette filling solution contained (in mm): KCl 140, HEPES 10, and 0.05 CaCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). Patch pipettes were fabricated from 1.5 mm o.d. borosilicate glass (Harvard), fire-polished, and coated with Sylgard resin. They had resistances of 2–4 MΩ when filled with the above solution. Experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–25 °C). Membrane currents were recorded with either a List EPC7 amplifier using a Digidata 1320A interface and pClamp 8.2 software (Axon Instruments) for acquisition, or a HEKA EPC9 patch clamp amplifier under control of Pulse software. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Acquired current traces were analyzed with either Clampfit 8.2 or HEKA Pulsefit. Routinely, cells were held at –80 mV and current-voltage relationships generated by applying 100 ms voltage steps to potentials between –120 mV and +40 mV. Since untransfected (wild-type) HEK 293 cells exhibit an outwardly rectifying current at potentials positive to 0 mV the effect of blockers was measured at –20 mV. Similarly, comparisons between currents in cells transfected with or without dominant negative construct were made at this potential. Data Analysis—The effect of blocking agents was expressed as the current at –20 mV in the presence of blocker as a percentage of that in its absence. The resulting concentration-inhibition curves were fitted by the Hill equation in the form of Equation 1, y100=IC50nH[I]nH+IC50nH(Eq. 1) where y is the current in the presence of blocker as a percentage of the control, [I] is the concentration of inhibitor, nH is the Hill coefficient, and IC50 is the concentration of blocker that reduces the current to 50% of the control value. Curve fitting was performed by the method of least squares using the curve fitting routine of Origin 6.1 (Microcal). Comparison of the currents developed in the presence and almost complete absence of free intracellular Ca2+ suggested that under the conditions used virtually all (>95%) of the current was due to activation of SK channels (data not shown). The curves were, therefore, fitted assuming that complete inhibition of the current was possible. Where appropriate, values are quoted as the mean ± S.E. The Students t test (two-tailed, unpaired) was used to determine the significance of results. Drugs and Reagents—All materials used for tissue culture were obtained from Invitrogen. UCL 1848 (8,14-diaza-1,7-(1, 4)-diquinolinacyclotetradecaphanedium tetratrifluoroacetate) was synthesized in the Department of Chemistry, UCL as previously described (2.Chen J.Q. Galanakis D. Ganellin C.R. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3478-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) was purchased from Sigma. HEPES and HEDTA were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were of Analar quality and obtained from Merck or Sigma. SK3 Can Co-assemble With SK2 Forming Functional Channels—It has previously been reported that expression of a dominant negative of SK3 can suppress SK2 currents in Jurkat cells (17.Miller M.J. Rauer H. Tomita H. Rauer H. Gargus J.J. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27753-27756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that SK3 and SK2 subunits co-assemble in this expression system. However, it is not yet clear whether functional channels are made by co-assembly of SK2 and SK3. We addressed this question using a mutant of SK3, SK3VK, which is very insensitive to block by apamin 2G. W. J. Moss, A. S. Monaghan, and Y. A. Shah, unpublished observations. and UCL 1848, a selective small molecule blocker developed in our laboratories (2.Chen J.Q. Galanakis D. Ganellin C.R. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3478-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3.Benton D.C.H. Dunn P.M. Chen J.Q. Galanakis D. Ganellin C.R. Malik-Hall M. Shah M. Haylett D.G. Jenkinson D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 39PGoogle Scholar). In control experiments on cells expressing SK3VK alone, 300 nm UCL 1848 had little or no effect on the amplitude of currents (Fig. 1, B and D). The advantage of using UCL 1848 as a blocker (rather than apamin) is that it has a similar potency for blocking SK2 to apamin but, unlike apamin, its action on SK2 is much more rapidly reversed, so we were able to obtain full recovery after ∼3 min washout (Fig. 1, A and C). This cannot be obtained with apamin (10.Strobaek D. Jorgensen T.D. Christophersen P. Ahring P.K. Olesen S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells expressing SK2 alone were blocked by UCL 1848 with an IC50 of 110 ± 26 pm (Fig. 1D), an essentially identical value to the one previously reported (8.Hosseini R. Benton D.C.H. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. Moss G.W.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, when rSK3VK was co-expressed with SK2 the concentration-inhibition curve was shifted to lie between those of SK2 and SK3VK (Fig. 1, C and D). The intermediate sensitivity of the channels formed is particularly obvious in recordings that were sufficiently long and stable to apply multiple doses of drug; one such experiment is shown in Fig. 1C. Clearly the majority of current is mediated by SK3VK-SK2 heteromeric channels in these co-transfected cells or the second application of drug would not provide such a large increase in the fraction of channels blocked. Our results are thus consistent with the idea that SK3, like SK1, can assemble with SK2 forming functional heteromeric channels in vitro. Effect of a Dominant Negative hSK1 Subunit on rSK3 Currents—Next, to examine possible assembly of SK3 with SK1 we used a dominant negative construct of hSK1 (hSK1YP) (Fig. 2). We performed three types of control experiments with this construct. First, we tested hSK1YP co-expression with hSK1 to make sure that it can knock down the wild-type SK1 currents. To do this we compared the size of currents in cells transfected using SK1 alone with those transfected using the same quantity of SK1 and a 2-fold excess of hSK1YP. As expected, the hSK1YP construct substantially reduced the SK1 current (Fig. 2D). Second, to confirm the effectiveness of this construct in co-assembly experiments, we expressed SK1YP with the wild-type rSK2 gene. The human SK1 gene and the rat SK2 gene have been shown to form subunits that co-assemble in oocytes. We therefore expected to see knock down of SK2 current. Again we compared the size of currents in cells transfected using SK2 alone with those of cells transfected using the same quantity of SK2 and a 2-fold excess of SK1YP. As expected, there was a substantial reduction in currents when cells were co-transfected with the dominant negative (Fig. 2, B and D). This result is consistent with the idea that in mammalian cells, as well as in oocytes, SK1 and SK2 can co-assemble (even though the pharmacological properties of hSK1 appear to be quite different in the two expression systems). Interestingly, there was more current remaining than would be predicted if both constructs express equally well, subunits assembled at random and only a single subunit of hSK1YP were sufficient to render SK1/SK2 channels nonfunctional. The reason for this is not clear. It may reflect either a partial recovery of function, preferred stoichiometries of the SK1/SK2 interaction or variations in expression levels. However, to ensure that overexpression of a competing plasmid does not itself cause the apparent reduction in SK currents, we performed a final control experiment testing the effect of hSK1YP on the current in cells transfected with hIK1. As in the previous cases, we used a 2-fold excess of the hSK1YP construct over the hIK1 plasmid and compared the currents against those obtained using hIK1 alone. In these experiments the magnitude of the mean hIK1 current was slightly, but not significantly, reduced as a result of co-transfection with hSK1YP (Fig. 2, C and D). This suggests that competition for expression by a 2-fold excess of the hSK1YP construct does not account for the reduced currents seen when hSK1YP is transfected with wild-type SK1 or SK2. The hSK1YP construct thus seems suitable for assessing subunit co-assembly. Having completed these control experiments, we compared cells transfected with SK3 alone or cells transfected with the same quantity of SK3 and a 2-fold excess of dominant negative. The records shown in Fig. 2, A and D demonstrate that SK3 currents were greatly depressed in the presence of hSK1YP. Thus, the effect of hSK1YP on rSK3 currents strongly suggests an interaction occurs between these two channel subunits. However, this result does not prove that hSK1 and rSK3 can co-assemble to form functional channels at the cell surface. In an attempt to detect the presence of functional heteromeric channels we therefore used the change-of-function strategy described in the next section. TEA-sensitive SK3 and SK2 Mutants—Expression of hSK1 in HEK 293 cells produces currents, which are relatively insensitive to block by TEA (Fig. 3A). In our control experiments, TEA blocked homomeric hSK1 channels, rSK2 channels, or rSK3 channels, with IC50 values of 14.1 ± 1.0, 2.8 ± 0.7, and 8.7 ± 1.8 mm respectively (Fig. 3D, data not shown and Fig. 6). The value for hSK1 is similar to that reported from oocyte experiments (15.Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The TEA sensitivity of K+ channels has been shown to be altered by changing just a single amino acid in the potassium channel pore sequence; at the right position, an aromatic residue provides sub-millimolar TEA affinity (19.Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We therefore mutated SK3 to introduce a phenylalanine at this position creating the mutant rSK3VF. This mutation caused the expected increase in sensitivity to TEA; the concentration-inhibition curve was fitted to a single component Hill-Langmuir equation with an IC50 for block by TEA of 0.31 ± 0.07 mm and an nH value of 0.9 ± 0.2 (Fig. 3, B and D). Surprisingly, when rSK3VF was co-expressed with hSK1 the concentration-inhibition curve for TEA was virtually identical to that of homomeric hSK1 (IC50 16 ± 1.5 mm, nH 0.8 ± 0.1, Fig. 3, C and D). This suggests that SK3VF made little or no contribution to the observed current.Fig. 6Co-expression of rSK1 and rSK3VF. TEA concentration-inhibition curves for wild-type rSK3 (▴) and rSK3VF alone (•) or co-expressed with rSK1 (□). The Hill equation fits the data with IC50 values of 8.6 ± 1.6, 0.31 ± 0.07, and 0.24 ± 0.02 mm, respectively. Each data point is the mean of three or more experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To validate the approach used above we repeated the experiment by creating rSK2VF, an equivalent mutation in the SK2 channel. We would expect to be able to obtain a dose response curve between that of SK1 and SK2VF when these subunits are co-expressed because assembly of SK2 with hSK1 has been previously described (15.Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It would also be expected from our dominant negative studies. In control experiments, SK2VF, like SK3VF, displays a marked increase in sensitivity to TEA; the IC50 for block being 0.31 ± 0.05 mm, nH 1.0 ± 0.2 (Fig. 4, A and C). An additional observation was that introduction of phenylalanine at this site changed the time course of the current seen when a voltage jump was applied (Fig 4A). (There is also a suggestion of this same effect in some records obtained with our SK3VF mutant (Fig. 3), but it is less pronounced.) The process underlying this change is as yet unknown and merits further study. In the present case, however, we noted that cells transfected with SK2VF and hSK1 tended to produce SK current with kinetics that were intermediate between those of homomeric SK2VF and homomeric hSK1 (Fig. 4B). Further, in co-transfected cells it was possible to determine that current sensitivity to TEA was between that of hSK1 and rSK2VF, as shown in Fig. 4B and by the averaged data shown in Fig. 4C. The concentration-inhibition curve for co-transfected cells has an IC50 of 3.5 ± 0.9 mm. In addition to a change in the IC50, if co-assembly is occurring, then one might expect the dose-response curve to become rather shallow because it would represent a number of different populations where various stoichiometries of hSK1 and rSK2VF subunits have formed. When, for the purpose of comparison, both sets of data are fitted to a single component Hill curve, the co-expressed channel data is clearly best fitted with a smaller Hill coefficient for TEA block (nH value of 0.55 ± 0.10, compared with values of 1.2 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.2 for hSK1 and rSK2VF homomers, respectively). Again this argues in favor of co-assembly. Thus, the interaction of SK2 with SK1 in mammalian cells is entirely consistent with the idea that heteromeric channel assemblies can be formed. In contrast, our studies of the interaction between SK3 and SK1 do not provide evidence of functional heteromeric assemblies. Co-expression of rSK3 and rSK1—We became concerned that the suppression of rSK3 by hSK1 could be an artifact of using the human SK1 clone in combination with rat SK3. We therefore decided to examine currents arising from expression of the rat SK1 gene with rSK3. We started by comparing Ca2+-activated K+ currents in HEK 293 cells transfected with rSK3 either alone or in combination with rSK1. As expected, cells transfected with rSK3 alone exhibited large currents with an approximately linear current-voltage relationship, which reversed close to the predicted value of Ek (Fig. 5, A and D). When cells were transfected with SK3 together with rSK1, however, currents were markedly reduced (Fig. 5, A and C) although, the reversal potential was unchanged (Fig. 5D) and a small SK-like current was still clearly present. This result appears to confirm an interaction between SK1 and SK3 that reduces the SK3 current component, as was seen with the human SK1. However, a small SK current might be explained if SK1 and SK3 co-assemble to form a channel that is less sensitive to Ca2+ activation. In order to test this possibility we repeated the experiment, this time recording with a pipette solution containing 50 μm Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C the results obtained were virtually identical to those with 1 μm free Ca2+. Thus, the reduction in current does not reflect a shift in the Ca2+ activation curve. These results might still be explained in a number of ways. It could be, for example, that this residual current is carried by SK1/SK3 channels, which have a smaller conductance or lower open probability than SK3 homotetramers. Alternatively, the remaining currents may reflect a smaller residual SK3 component. In this case, both rSK1 and hS"

These multiprotein complexes are involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes such as signal transduction and cellular homeostasis. α1 is the membrane pore-forming subunit, whereas β is an intracellular subunit that binds to α1, facilitating and modulating channel function. We have expressed, purified, and characterized recombinant β3 and β2a using both biochemical and biophysical methods, including electrophysiology, to better understand the β family's protein structural and functional correlates. Our results indicate that the β protein is composed of two distinct domains that associate with one another in a stable manner. The data also suggest that the polypeptide regions outside these domains are not structured when β is not in complex with the channel. In addition, the β structural core, comprised of just these two domains without other sequences, binds tightly to the α interaction domain (AID) motif, a sequence derived from the α1 subunit and the principal anchor site of β. Domain II is responsible for this binding, but domain I enhances it. Voltage-dependent calcium channels selectively enable Ca2+ ion movement through cellular membranes.

Functional roles for these channels vary based on cell type. In muscle, both skeletal and cardiac, the predominant VDCCs (CaV1.1 and CaV1.2) cause release of Ca2+ into the cytosol from intracellular stores, thereby initiating contraction (1Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Bers D.M. Perez-Reyes E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 339-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In neurons and endocrine cells, neurotransmitter or hormone secretion requires VDCC activity. In addition, electrical activity, specifically the action potential in cardiac myocytes, is regulated by VDCCs. Finally, calcium influx and concentration controlled by VDCCs plays a significant role in neuronal gene expression (3Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Pathways have been elucidated, where for one example, VDCC activity gives rise to phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor (4Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), thereby activating transcription of a myriad of target genes. The VDCC comprises four distinct polypeptides: α1, α2δ, β, and γ (5Catterall W.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). α1 is the membrane pore-forming subunit and numbers between 1800 and 2400 residues in length. Its sequence exhibits repeats comprising four transmembrane modules or domains, akin to the tetrameric architecture of potassium channels. Each module contains the canonical transmembrane arrangement for voltage-gated ion channels i.e. six transmembrane segments. Modules are connected by linkers that are located in the intracellular milieu, as are both the N and C termini. The high voltage-activated channel subunits, CaV1.x and CaV2.x (α1), numbering seven in total, share a high degree of sequence similarity but nevertheless encode distinct electrophysiological activities. The β subunit was first isolated biochemically in tight association with α1 (6Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Four isoforms have been discovered, ranging in size from 52 to 78 kDa (7Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The lack of a transmembrane region suggested that β very likely interacts with the channel through one of the intracellular domains of α1. Campbell and coworkers (8Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) found such a region in the linker between repeats I and II of the α1 subunit. The data indicate that α1 and β subunits interact directly with each other with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (9Leung A.T. Imagawa T. Block B. Franzini-Armstrong C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 994-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β also interacts with other regions of α1 (10Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. Dewaard M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 525: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), depending on the isoform, but the region discovered by Campbell and coworkers appears to be the primary, high affinity site of interaction. The electrophysiological function of the β subunit is a modulatory one (15Lacerda A.E. Kim H.S. Ruth P. Perez-Reyes E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N.

It increases VDCC peak current amplitude from 10- to 18-fold depending on the channel type. Furthermore, β accelerates channel activation, modifies inactivation kinetics, and shifts the voltage-dependence of the channel (18Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It has been convincingly shown that β acts by both chaperoning VDCCs to the membrane and modulating gating (19Yamaguchi H. Hara M. Strobeck M. Fukasawa K. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19348-19356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Brice N.L. Berrow N.S. Campbell V. Page K.M. Brickley K. Tedder I. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The diverse β isoforms have quantitatively different effects on the various electrophysiological parameters. These isoform differences suggest a mechanism for the cellular specificity of VDCC activity through combinatorial permutations of different β isoform subunits associating with different α1 isoforms. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of the β subunit remains unclear. Protein-protein interactions, which have been mapped to a minimum of 18 residues in the α1 module I–II linker described above, dubbed the AID (α interaction domain), and a 30-residue sequence in VDCC β, dubbed the BID (β interaction domain), play a critical role (8Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 22De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although, considerable attention has been paid to VDCC β, especially on the functional level, little experimental data is available concerning the protein's tertiary structure. Cloning and sequencing of the various β isoforms from a spectrum of species showed that two sequence regions were fairly conserved (Fig. 1). Based on the identification of these regions, structure-function analyses have shown that much of the functional activity associated with VDCC β resides in these two regions (22De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Subsequently, bioinformatic analysis, including molecular modeling studies, proposed that these two regions have structural similarity to SH3 and guanylate kinase folds (23Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here, we describe experimental studies of the VDCC β protein, which give insight into the domain structure of the protein and the interaction between those domains, as well as correlate this data with functional biochemistry and electrophysiology. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of VDCC β3Subunit—Recombinant rat VDCC β3 subunit (M88751) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 Tuner (Novagen), containing the “RIL” Codon Plus™ plasmid (Stratagene), using a modified pET21 (Novagen) vector (an His8 and TEV protease site were engineered between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET21d, a gift of Dr. Sean Juo). The protein was purified by sequential metal-chelate, ion-exchange, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. PCR was used to engineer EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites into the β3 gene. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the β3 gene from the original plasmid were the following: sense primer A, 5′-GCGCGGATCCTATGACGACTCCTACGTCCCC; antisense primer B, 5′-GCGCGGATCCTATGACGACTCCTACGTGCCC. PCR product was ligated into doubly digested (EcoRI and BamHI) pET21d vector. Positive clones were identified by restriction analysis and subsequently sequenced. Transformed Tuner cells were grown for 3–4 h at 37 °C in 10 liters of LB media, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Upon reaching an A600 of 0.3, the temperature was lowered to 16 °C, and growth continued until the culture reached an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 200 μm IPTG. Cells were harvested after 14 h by centrifugation, frozen, and suspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer, buffer L (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm βME, 10 mg of lysozyme, 1 mg of DNase). After lysis by French pressure cell (Aminco), cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated metal chelate “Talon” (Clontech) column (buffer A: 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7), at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer A, containing 5 mm imidazole, until a stable base line was achieved. After elution with buffer A, supplemented with 150 mm imidazole, the protein eluate was then diluted 3-fold with water and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Source-Q (Amersham Biosciences) column (buffer Q: 70 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7). The column was then washed with buffer Q, and fractions were eluted with a shallow linear gradient of buffer Q, containing 70–300 mm NaCl. VDCC β3-containing fractions were pooled (130–150 mm NaCl) and diluted 2-fold in 600 mm NaCl to buffer H concentrations (10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 300 mm NaCl) and subjected to TEV protease prepared in house according to a previous study (24Kapust R.B. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The proteolysis continued for 12 h. Subsequently, the sample was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (with H buffer) hydroxylapatite (Calbiochem) column and eluted with a linear gradient of H buffer 10–100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7 (eluted at 50 mm potassium phosphate). Pooled fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml using spin concentrators (Vivascience), divided into aliquots, and flash frozen in liquid N2. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of VDCC β2aSubunit— PCR was used to engineer EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites into the VDCC β2a (X64297) gene. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the new β2a gene from the original plasmid were the following: sense primer C, 5′-GCGCGGATCCCTTGACAGGCACCTCGCGGC-3′; antisense primer D, 5′-CGCCGAATTCTCATTGGCGGATGTA-3′. Subsequent subcloning was as described for VDCC β3. The VDCC β2a subunit was expressed as for β3. Purification was as follows. The soluble fraction of the crude extract was loaded on a pre-equilibrated Ni-CAM column (Sigma) (buffer B: 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8) and 300 mm NaCl) and washed with buffer B, containing 5 mm imidazole. The protein was then eluted with buffer B, containing 150 mm imidazole, and diluted 6-fold, followed by loading onto a pre-equilibrated Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia) column (buffer C: 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm βME). Fractions were eluted with a shallow linear gradient of buffer C containing 40–200 mm NaCl and subjected to TEV proteolysis for 12 h. VDCC β2a-containing fractions were pooled (80–100 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated gel filtration column (buffer G: 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mm βME, 200 mm NaCl). The protein was eluted with buffer G. The pooled fractions were further processed as for β3. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of VDCC β2aDomain I—PCR was used to engineer EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites into the β2a domain I construct. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the β2a domain I construct from the original β2a plasmid were the following: sense primer E, 5′-GCGCGGATCCAGCCGTCCATCCGATTCAGATGTG-3′; antisense primer F, 5′-GCGCGAATTCTCACTTTGCTCTCTGTTCATGCTGTAG-3′. Subsequent subcloning was as described for VDCC β3. The β2a domain I was expressed as for β3. Purification was as follows. The soluble fraction of the crude extract was loaded on a pre-equilibrated Talon column (buffer A) and washed with buffer A, containing 75 mm imidazole. The protein was then eluted with buffer A, containing 150 mm imidazole, pooled, and subjected to TEV proteolysis for 12 h. The protein was then diluted 3-fold with 300 mm NaCl, loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (buffer H) hydroxylapatite column, and eluted with a linear gradient of H buffer 10–140 mm potassium phosphate (eluted at 70 mm potassium phosphate). The pooled fractions, with the addition of 10 mm βME, were loaded onto a pre-equilibrated gel filtration column (buffer G) and eluted with buffer G. The pooled fractions were processed as above. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of VDCC β2aDomain II— PCR was used to engineer EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites into the β2a domain II construct. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the β2a domain II construct from the original β2a plasmid were the following: primer G, sense 5′-GCGCGGATCCCACTCCAAAGAGAAAAGAATGCCC-3′; antisense primer I, 5′-GCGCGAATTCTCAAAGGAGAGGGTTGGGGAGATTGCT-3′. PCR product was ligated into a doubly digested (EcoRI and BamHI) pET43.1a (Novagen) plasmid, thereby encoding a C-terminal fusion to the NusA protein with a His6 tag and thrombin site separating the two. A modified pET43 (His8 followed by a TEV cleavage sequence was inserted between the pET43 SpeI and BamHI sites) was also prepared to express domain II in the same way as with the commercial pET43. The β2a domain II was expressed as above. Purification of the NusA-domain II fusion proceeded as follows. The soluble fraction of the crude extract was loaded on a pre-equilibrated Ni-CAM column (buffer B) and washed with buffer B, containing 5 mm imidazole. The protein was then eluted with buffer B, containing 30 mm imidazole, loaded on a preequilibrated (H buffer) hydroxylapatite column and eluted with a linear gradient of buffer H 10–250 mm potassium phosphate (eluted at 100 mm potassium phosphate). The protein was then subjected to thrombin (Sigma) proteolysis (5 units/mg of fusion protein) for 14 h. The cleaved protein was diluted 2-fold and applied to a pre-equilibrated Q-Sepharose column with phosphate-buffered saline. The flowthrough fractions were pooled, divided into aliquots, and flash-frozen in liquid N2. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of VDCC β2aRemovable Linker Core—Subcloning was stepwise. First, pre-digested PCR product encoding domain I was ligated into EcoRI- and BamHI-digested pET21d plasmid. Next, pET21d-domain I plasmid was prepared and digested with EcoRI and NotI for ligation with a pre-digested PCR product encoding domain II. Finally, PCR product, encoding the linker between domains I and II and two TEV proteolysis sites at both ends, was singly digested with EcoRI and ligated into pre-digested EcoRI vector, now containing both domain I and domain II. Positive clones containing the insert in the correct orientation were identified using restriction analysis and sequencing. PCR was used to engineer EcoRI, BamHI, and NotI restriction sites into the β2a domain I and domain II encoding fragments. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the β2a domain I fragment from the original β2a plasmid were the following: sense primer E, 5′ listed above; antisense primer J, 5′-CGCGGAATTCCTTTGCTCTCTGTTCATGCTGTAG-3′.The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the β2a domain II fragment from the original β2a plasmid were the following: Sense primer K, 5′-CGGAATTCAAGCTTCACTCCAAAGAGAAAAGAATGCCC-3′; antisense primer L, 5′-TTATACTAGCGGCCGCTCAAAGGAGAGGGTTGGGGAGATT-3′. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the β2a linker fragment with the addition of two TEV sites from the original β2a plasmid were the following: sense primer M, 5′-CGCGGAATTCGAAAACCTGTACTTTCAGGGCCAAGGGAAATTCTACTCCA-3′; antisense primer N, 5′-CGCGGAATTCGCCCTGAAAGTACAGGTTTTCGGGTGACGTTACACTGTTT-3′. The VDCC β2a removable linker core was expressed as above. The soluble fraction of the crude extract was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Ni-CAM column (buffer B) and washed with buffer B, containing 5 mm imidazole. The protein was then eluted with buffer B, containing 150 mm imidazole, pooled and diluted 2-fold, followed by loading onto a pre-equilibrated hydroxylapatite column (H buffer). Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of H buffer (10–250 mm potassium phosphate) at about 120 mm potassium phosphate. Pooled fractions were diluted 4-fold and subjected for 12 h to TEV protease. 10 mm βME was added to the sample and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated gel filtration column (G buffer). Protein was eluted with buffer G. The pooled fractions were processed as above. Limited Proteolysis of VDCC β2aand β3Subunits—Papain (20 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) was activated for 30 min in activation buffer (1.25 mm EDTA, 6.25 mm cysteine, 62.5 mm βME, at pH 7) and added to 3 mg/ml VDCC β3 or β2a in a 1:20 dilution. The final ratio of papain to β protein was 1:3000. Trypsin (60 μg/ml) was added to 3 mg/ml β3 in a 1:20 dilution, giving a final ratio of protease to protein of 1:1000. Reactions were performed on ice. Proteolysis progress (at different time intervals) was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Proteolysis products were purified for further analysis by HPLC reverse phase chromatography using a C4 column (Vydac) with a shallow acetonitrile gradient 30–80% (both solvents were supplemented with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). AID Peptide Binding Assays—Fluorescence polarization was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction between a fluorescein-labeled AID peptide and various purified VDCC β constructs. The synthetic peptide was purified by HPLC reverse chromatography using a C18 column (Vydac) with a shallow acetonitrile gradient 20–80% (both solvents were supplemented with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Its sequence is derived from the AID motif of the CaV1.1 I–II linker and is as follows: fluorescein-GGQQLEEDLRGYNSWITQGE-COOH. A mutant peptide, fluorescein-GGQQLEEDLRG-SNSWITQGE-COOH was prepared, in addition. Increasing concentrations of protein were incubated with 0.5 nm labeled peptide for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. Polarization measurements were taken with an ISS K2 fluorescence spectrophotometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 and 520 nm, respectively, at 20 °C, maintained by a temperature-controlled water bath. Polarization measurements were made with integration times on the order of 20 s, achieving a standard deviation of 5% of signal. Binding isotherms for the various samples were measured three independent times. Binding data were analyzed in SigmaPlot (SPSS) by nonlinear regression used to fit a binding function as defined by the following equation,ΔP=BmaxXKD·X(Eq. 1) where X is the concentration of free ligand, ΔP is the change in fluorescence polarization of the fluorophore (the baseline polarization of the labeled peptide alone was subtracted), Bmax is the maximum change in polarization upon saturation, and KD is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding. CD Spectroscopy—All CD measurements were performed with an Aviv CD spectrometer model 202. Spectra were measured over the range of 280–180 nm at a scan rate of 1 nm/s. For all measurements, a cell with 0.1-mm path length was used. Each spectrum is an average of 4 scans. The raw data were corrected by subtracting the contribution of the buffer to the CD signal. Data were smoothed and converted to molar ellipticity units. The measurements were taken at a constant temperature of 20 °C, with an approximate protein concentration of 35 μm. More precise concentration of protein was obtained using the predicted extinction coefficient of the proteins and their 280-nm absorbance. The proteins' molar extinction coefficients (m-1cm-1) at 280 nm were: β3, 52,300; β2a, 39,760; and β2a-linkerless core, 24,870. The difference spectrum (full-length β2a-linkerless core) was calculated according to a previous study (25Ausio J. Toumadje A. McParland R. Becker R.R. Johnson Jr., W.C. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Deconvolution calculations were computed with CDNN (26Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) using the 33 data basis set. Electrophysiology—Preparation of Xenopus laevis oocytes, injection of mRNA of VDCC subunits, and electrophysiological recording and analysis were performed as described previously (27Kang M.G. Chen C.C. Felix R. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32917-32924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The negative control group consisted of oocytes expressing CaV1.2 (α1C) subunit only by mRNA injection followed by injection of protein buffer (PB). The positive control group consisted of oocytes expressing α1C and β3 subunits by mRNA injection, followed by injection of protein buffer (PB). The oocytes of experimental groups were injected with α1C mRNA followed by injection of VDCC β proteins, 2 days after the mRNA injection. Injection of protein (0.4 μg of protein per oocyte) was performed similarly as mRNA injection. Oocytes injected with VDCC β proteins were incubated one more day, and the expressed calcium channel currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Expression and Purification—Using a T7 expression system, an E. coli BL-21 derivative cell line that allows for fine tuning IPTG induction by better controlling IPTG concentration, and low temperature growths, we obtained overexpression of soluble, full-length rat VDCC β3. In addition, we subcloned and expressed the rabbit β2a isoform in the same system. The expression vectors encode a histidine tag on the N terminus, followed by a TEV protease site and the ensuing desired coding sequence. We have found that VDCC β2a manifests robust expression. β3 expression is not exceptional. Our purification schemes for the VDCC β isoforms vary. However, all utilize as a first step subsequent to lysis, metal chelate resin chromatography to isolate the His-tagged target proteins. This first step usually produces protein that is greater than 80–85% homogeneous. Histidine tags are removed by cleavage with TEV protease. The TEV protease is highly specific and does not cleave other sites on the protein. Full-length VDCC β3 is highly sensitive to proteolysis. Therefore, efficient and rapid chromatographic processing has proven essential and has been applied systematically. The full-length proteins are shown in Fig. 2. The bacterial expressed recombinant proteins are both electrophysiologically and biochemically active (see below). Limited Proteolysis—An important and classic method of probing protein structure is limited proteolysis (for a review see Ref. 28Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The goal here is determination of domain structure. The premise of the method assumes that flexible and exposed regions of the protein are available to the protease and thus subject to hydrolysis. We subjected both β2a and β3 recombinant full-length proteins to such an analysis using both papain, a highly nonspecific protease, and trypsin, a more specific protease. The time-course results for limited digestion by papain are shown in Fig. 3. Early in the time course, a stable polypeptide emerged that runs as a fragment of ∼40 kDa. Subsequently, this fragment is further digested such that after 16 h, two stable fragments remain, one of higher mobility and another of medium mobility. Both isoforms basically follow the same pattern (β2a seems to have an intermediate fragment). Having established a set of stable polypeptides, we sought to identify them. Preparative limited proteolyses of VDCC β3 were performed, and at the appropriate times the reaction was stopped by flash freezing with liquid N2. The samples were then applied to a reverse phase C4 HPLC column and separated by an acetonitrile gradient. The separated fragments were sent for mass spectrometric and N-terminal peptide sequencing analyses. Electrospray mass spectrometry gave masses of 13,198 and 23,938 Da for the two stable fragments. We note that both fragments migrate anomalously on SDS-PAGE gels, and this has been a consistent feature of β3 and β2a proteins to varying degrees. N-terminal sequencing of these fragments indicated that the smaller one primarily began at residue 23, whereas the larger fragment began at residue 158. Combining these data allowed us to demarcate the boundaries of these stable domains. The smaller fragment is defined from 23 to 138 of the β3 sequence and designated domain I, whereas the larger fragment is defined from 158 to 371 and designated domain II. The β2a domain definitions are 25–146 and 204–423 for domains I and II, respectively, as determined by sequence alignment to the β3 boundaries. The domain definitions conform well with earlier definitions based on homology alone. We then sought to identify the early proteolytic 40-kDa fragment, thinking that it may simply be composed of domains I and II with a linker. MALDI-MS analyses of this polypeptide gave a cluster of masses centered around 39,420 Da. This mass is consistent with a fragment extending from residue 21 to 370 and fits as well with the mass spectrometry a"

Each ts mutant protein may contain a temperature-dependent intramolecular mechanism such as ts conformational change. To identify key ts structural elements controlling the protein function, we screened ts p53 mutants from a comprehensive mutation library consisting of 2,314 p53 missense mutations for their sequence-specific transactivity through p53-binding sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We isolated 142 ts p53 mutants, including 131 unreported ts mutants. These mutants clustered in β-strands in the DNA-binding domain, particularly in one of the two β-sheets of the protein, and 15 residues (Thr155, Arg158, Met160, Ala161, Val172, His214, Ser215, Pro223, Thr231, Thr253, Ile254, Thr256, Ser269, Glu271, and Glu285) were ts hot spots. Among the 142 mutants, 54 were examined further in human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells, and it was confirmed that 89% of the mutants were also ts in mammalian cells. The ts mutants represented distinct ts transactivities for the p53 binding sequences and a distinct epitope expression pattern for conformation-specific anti-p53 antibodies. These results indicated that the intramolecular β-sheet in the core DNA-binding domain of p53 was a key structural element controlling the protein function and provided a clue for finding a molecular mechanism that enables the rescue of the mutant p53 function.

A growing number of p53 downstream genes have been isolated, and p53 has been structurally and functionally divided into three portions, namely the NH2-terminal portion containing the transactivation domain, the central core portion corresponding to the DNA-binding domain, and the COOH-terminal portion containing the oligomerization domain. The evolution of the DNA-binding domain is highly conserved in p53 orthologues (11.Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. May P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar) and also in the conserved human homologues p63 and p73 (12.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.

The structure of the DNA-binding domain (residues 94-312) was resolved by x-ray crystallography (14.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). The domain consists of two α-helixes (H1 and H2) and 11 β-strands (S1, S2, S2′, and S3-S10) that were interconnected by loops (long L1-L3 loops and other short loops). Two anti-parallel β-sheets containing four (S1, S3, S5, and S8) and five (S4, S6, S7, S9, and S10) β-strands make up a large β-sandwich that serves as a scaffold for a loop-sheet-helix (LSH) motif (L1, S2, S2′, S10, and H2) and two large loops (L2 and L3). The loop-sheet-helix consists of two separate regions as follows: (i) the L1 loop (residues 113-123) and the S2-S2′ β-hairpin (residues 124-135) that correspond to evolutionary conserved region II (residues 117-142) (11.Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. May P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar); and (ii) the end of the S10 strand (residues 264-274) and the H2 helix (residues 278-286) that correspond to conserved region V (residues 270-286). In the loop-sheethelix, the L1 loop and the H2 helix contact with a DNA major groove formed by the RRRC region of the consensus sequence. One of the large loops, the L2 (residues 164-194), is interrupted by a short helix (H1) and contains conserved region III (residues 171-181). Another large loop, L3 (residues 237-250), coincides with conserved region IV (residues 234-258) and makes contact with the DNA minor groove formed by the A/T rich region of the consensus sequence. The L2 loop stabilizes the L3 loop by packing through a side-chain interaction and a zinc atom tetrahedrally coordinated on residues Cys176, His179 of the L2 loop and Cys238 and Cys242 of the L3 loop. Mutations in the TP53 gene are the most frequent genetic alterations in the various human tumors (15.Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7479) Google Scholar). According to the latest TP53 mutation databases (16.Soussi T. Dehouche K. Beroud C. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17.Olivier M. Eeles R. Hollstein M. Khan M. Harris C. Hainaut P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), more than 15,000 somatic mutations have been reported to date. The mutations are clustered in the DNA-binding domain, and the majority (∼80%) are missense mutations. Among tumor-derived mutations, those at residues Arg175, Gly245, Arg248, Arg249, Arg273, and Arg282 have frequently been reported, and all missense mutations were unable to bind the specific p53 binding sequences and the inactive transactivation for downstream genes. These are structurally important residues, because they directly involve DNA binding or stabilization of the L2 and L3 loops of the protein. However, the majority of remaining missense mutations have not yet been examined. Recently, we constructed 2,314 missense mutations that covered almost all of the tumor derived missense mutations, as well as a number of previously unreported missense mutations, and examined their ability to transactivate marker genes through distinct p53 binding sites when the mutants were expressed in yeast. We determined the functional effect of each mutant p53 and found that the p53 function correlated well with the structure and mutations (18.Kato S. Han S. Liu W. Otsuka K. Shibata H. Kanamaru R. Ishioka C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8424-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive (ts) 1The abbreviations used are: ts, temperature-sensitive; SC, synthetic complete; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. p53 mutations have been reported and used as tools for conditional p53 expression in mammalian cells. We identified previously four distinct ts p53 mutations in eight of the 91 human tumor cell lines using a yeast-based transcription assay and predicted that 5-10% of the tumor-derived missense mutations should be ts mutations (19.Jia L.Q. Osada M. Ishioka C. Gamo M. Ikawa S. Suzuki T. Shimodaira H. Niitani T. Kudo T. Akiyama M. Kimura N. Matsuo M. Mizusawa H. Tanaka N. Koyama H. Namba M. Kanamaru R. Kuroki T. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To date, 61 p53 ts mutations have been isolated by using several different methods, including a yeast-based functional assay (Table I). Among these, the V272M ts mutant was reactivated by a small molecule, aminothiol WR1065 (20.North S. Pluquet O. Maurici D. El-Ghissassi F. Hainaut P. Mol. Carcinog. 2002; 33: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), at a non-permissive temperature, suggesting that ts mutants may be functionally rescued by small molecules.Table ISummary of the 61 reported p53 mutationsp53 mutantaThe meaning of the asterisk symbols used in this column is as follows: *, ts mutants not constructed in this study; **, ts mutants also isolated in this study; ***, distinct substitutions(s) at the same residue were ts mutants in this studyExperimental systembThe meaning of the numbers used in this column is as follows: 1, yeast system; 2, mammalian cell system; 3, cell-free systemp53BS or promotercAll but three of the gene names used in this column refer to those used in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM).

The three exceptions are: CON, p53-binding consensus sequence; GAL4, yeast GAL4-binding sequence; and RGC, human ribosomal gene cluster sequence. The study on the GAL4 was performed by GAL4-binding domain and p53 fusion protein Open table in a new tab The purpose of this study was the screening and isolation of a large number of ts mutations from a comprehensive missense mutation library, mapping them to the p53 structure, and considering the function-structure relationship through the ts mutants. To isolate a number of ts p53 mutations, we screened the p53 library containing 2,314 p53 missense mutations using a yeast-based p53 functional assay and found 142 ts p53 mutants, including previously unreported 131 mutants. We confirmed that most were also ts in p53-less mammalian cells. The ts mutants were preferentially mapped on one of the β-sheets, and there were hot spot sites for ts mutations. Because a fairly significant fraction of the p53 mutants in the TP53 mutation databases were ts mutants, these ts p53 mutant proteins may be novel molecular targets through the ts mechanism and structure-dependent restoration of p53 function. p53 Missense Mutation Library—2,314 p53 missense mutations were constructed recently through a 96-well, formatted, site-directed mutagenesis and stably expressed in a haploid yeast strain harboring a p53-responsive p21WAF1 reporter plasmid (pAS03G) (21.Shimada A.

Screening ts p53 Mutants Using a Yeast Assay—The 2,314 yeast clones expressing the mutant p53 were grown on 25 96-well formatted plates containing synthetic complete (SC) media lacking leucine and tryptophane (SC -Leu -Trp) in the case of the haploid strains, or SC media lacking leucine, tryptophane and histidine (SC -Leu -Trp -His) in the case of the diploid strains. Fluorescent Intensity—To evaluate the transactivity of each mutant p53 quantitatively, the yeast clones (haploid cells) were replicated on SC -Leu -Trp solid media using a 96-pin replicator and grown at 37 or 32 °C for 2 days. The plates were then directly processed in a 96-well formatted fluorometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Labsystems) to measure the fluorescent intensity (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 538 nm) of p53-dependent enhanced green fluorescent protein expression through a human p21WAF1-derived p53 binding sequence. The diploid cells, selected by mating reaction, were incubated on SC -Leu -Trp -His plates at 37 or 30 °C for 2 days, and the fluorescent intensity of Ds-Red was measured using the same fluorometer (excitation, 544 nm; emission, 590 nm) to evaluate the p53-dependent Ds-Red expression through other p53-binding sequences. At least two independent experiments were performed for each reporter, and the fluorescence intensities were averaged. The averaged values were standardized in each p53 binding sequence, clustered, and visualized using the CLUSTER and TREEVIEW programs. The standardized data were also spotted on a two-dimensional graph for 30 and 37 °C. We defined the following criteria to select ts mutants from the p53 mutant library, namely M30/W30 ≥ 0.7, M37/W37 ≤ 0.5, and M30/M37 ≥ 2, where M30 and M37 indicate the fluorescent intensities of the p53 mutants at 30 and 37 °C, respectively, and W30 and W37 indicate the fluorescent intensities of the wild-type p53 at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfection—A TP53-deficient human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C for 30 min) fetal calf serum (JRH Bioscience) in the presence of 5% CO2. For luciferase assays, the cells were grown to 60-90% confluence in 96-well tissue culture plates at 37 °C and then cultured at 32 or 37 °C for another 24 h. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were grown in 90 × 20-mm tissue culture plates at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 and further incubated at 32 or 37 °C for another 18 h. Transient transfections were performed using the Effectene (Qiagen) transfection reagent. For luciferase assays, the cells were cotransfected with 12.5-50 ng of the expression vector (pCR259-p53WT, pCR259-p53MT, or a p53-less control pCR259 vector) (18.Kato S. Han S. Liu W. Otsuka K.

https://openalex.org/W1594952503,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with mutations in TSC1, which codes for hamartin, or TSC2, which codes for tuberin. The brain is one of the most severely affected organs, and CNS lesions include cortical tubers and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, resulting in mental retardation and seizures. Tuberin and hamartin function together as a complex in mammals and Drosophila. We report here the association of Pam, a protein identified as an interactor of Myc, with the tuberin-hamartin complex in the brain. The C terminus of Pam containing the RING zinc finger motif binds to tuberin. Pam is expressed in embryonic and adult brain as well as in cultured neurons. Pam has two forms in the rat CNS, an ∼450-kDa form expressed in early embryonic stages and an ∼350-kDa form observed in the postnatal period. In cortical neurons, Pam co-localizes with tuberin and hamartin in neurites and growth cones. Although Pam function(s) are yet to be defined, the highly conserved Pam homologs, HIW (Drosophila) and RPM-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans), are neuron-specific proteins that regulate synaptic growth. Here we show that HIW can genetically interact with the Tsc1·Tsc2 complex in Drosophila and could negatively regulate Tsc1·Tsc2 activity. Based on genetic studies, HIW has been implicated in ubiquitination, possibly functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase through the RING zinc finger domain. Therefore, we hypothesize that Pam, through its interaction with tuberin, could regulate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the tuberin-hamartin complex particularly in the CNS.

Sampson J. Holtes-Whittemore V. Tuberous Sclerosi Complex. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1999Google Scholar).

Furthermore, it is evident from the most recent reports that the small GTPase Rheb is a direct target of tuberin and hamartin in both the Drosophila and mammalian systems (22.Stocker H. Radimerski T.

These studies demonstrate Rheb GTPase-activating protein activity for tuberin, and the loss of tuberin and/or hamartin lead to an increase in GTP-bound Rheb, which in turn leads to activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin/S6K/4E-binding protein signaling pathway. Thus, recent studies have placed tuberin and hamartin in growth signaling pathways; however, critical CNS functions of these proteins remain unknown. Our recent work demonstrates that unlike kidney lesions, CNS lesions such as cortical tubers do not display a second somatic mutation and other mechanisms might play a role during tumorigenesis in the CNS (25.Niida Y. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Logrip M. Tapon D. Perez R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Sims K. MacCollin M. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that the tuberin-hamartin complex exists with neurofilament light chain and ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins in the growth cone and could play a role in neuronal migration (26.Haddad L.A.

In our efforts to understand the tuberin-hamartin complex in the CNS, we have identified Pam (protein-associated with Myc) (27.Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as a physiologically relevant tuberin interactor and have shown that Pam exists in complex with tuberin-hamartin in the CNS. Our results also demonstrate that HIW, the Drosophila homolog of Pam, can genetically interact with dTsc1-dTsc2 in the fly. The evidence that the Pam homologs in worm (RPM-1) (28.Zhen M. Huang X.

Finley Jr, R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 663-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For domain mapping, tuberin deletion constructs were generated using the same strategy. Tuberin bait was also subcloned as a 5′-FLAG fusion protein into pcDNA3 vector. Pam spanning aa 4492-4641 in vector pJG4-5 was released and cloned into pGEX4T-1 (PF1). PF2 (Pam aa 4312-4641) in pGEX2TK was a kind gift from Dr. Q. Guo (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). PF2 was also cloned as a Myc fusion protein into pCMV3b vector (Stratagene). The integrity of all of the inserts was confirmed by sequencing. Interaction Trap Screening—Yeast strain Egy48 was sequentially transformed with the tuberin bait, and human fetal frontal cortex library was fused to the activation domain of GAL4 in the plasmid pJG4-5 and selected on Ura, His, Trp plates (32.Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Positive clones which showed β-galactosidase activity within 2 days on plates and within 60 min by filter assay were isolated, sequenced, and analyzed for homology with sequences in the NCBI data base. Antibodies—Primary antibodies utilized included: rabbit polyclonals tuberin antibody C20, and Mdm2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); hamartin antibodies HF6 and HF3 (33.Murthy V. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Haddad L.A. Roy J.E. Cutone A.N. Beauchamp R.L. Smith N. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 101: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); monoclonals FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma); c-Myc antibody 9E10 (Developmental Studies, Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa); ERM antibody 13H9 (a kind gift from Dr. F. Solomon, Massachusetts Institute of Technology); Vamp-2 (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany); and Neu-N (Chemicon). PP1, a polyclonal antibody against human Pam peptide (aa 4519-4534) was generated in rabbits (Research Genetics) and affinity-purified using the sulfolink affinity purification kit (Pierce Laboratories). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—PC12 and 293T cells were grown using standard conditions. Primary cortical neurons from embryonic day 19-old embryonic rat brain were cultured as described previously (26.Haddad L.A. Smith N. Bowser M. Niida Y. Murthy V. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44180-44186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cultured neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 or 30 min at RT and stored in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. FLAG fusion construct of tuberin bait in pcDNA3 and Myc-tagged PF2 was transfected into 293T cells with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) using standard protocols described with the reagent. PF1 and PF2 were expressed employing E. coli BL21pLysS and 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Immunoprecipitation, Pull-down Assays—For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Pam and tuberin, PC12 cells and embryonic rat brain were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitations were done with either anti-tuberin antibody or anti-tuberin plus anti-hamartin antibodies, resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were detected with affinity-purified anti-Pam PP1. Affinity pull-down assays were performed as described earlier (26.Haddad L.A. Smith N. Bowser M. Niida Y. Murthy V. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44180-44186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using GST-Pam (PF1 and PF2) and lysates from 293T cells followed by immunoblots using antibodies for FLAG, tuberin, and hamartin. Immunocytochemistry—Fixed neurons were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), blocked with 10% normal goat serum containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with 13H9, anti-Neu-N, or anti-Vamp2 followed by secondary antibody (26.Haddad L.A. Smith N. Bowser M. Niida Y. Murthy V. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44180-44186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Coverslips were then incubated with PP1, the respective secondary antibody, and then mounted in gelvatol-mounting media. For double staining with PP1 and C20 or HF3, PP1 was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probe). Cells were incubated with C20 or HF3 followed by donkey anti-rabbit Cy2 and then with conjugated PP1. Images were captured using the LSM5 Pascal software coupled to a Zeiss LSM Pascal Vario 2 RGB confocal system. Negative controls included omitting primary antibodies and blocking of PP1 or C20 with immunogenic peptide. Fly Stocks—The fly line with double (UAS-Tsc1 and UAS-Tsc2) transgenes and an eye-specific GAL4 line, eyGAL4, were described previously (12.Tapon N. Ito N. Dickson B.J. Treisman J.E. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 2001; 105: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The hiw mutant lines (ND8, EP1305, ND42, ND69, and EMS) (30.Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D. Bergstrom K. Strauss R. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 313-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Hong Wan and Dr. Corey Goodman. Identification of Pam as a Binding Partner of Tuberin—To identify proteins that associate with tuberin, we screened a fetal frontal cortex library with tuberin bait (aa 449-1000) using a LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system. Screening was performed on a total of 1 × 106 clones with two positive clones identified. Both clones matched the sequence of Pam, a large protein originally identified as a protein-associated with Myc, corresponding to aa 4492-4641 (27.Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The specificity of this interaction was verified in the two-hybrid assay by transcriptional activation of LacZ and Leu reporters with a panel of unrelated baits, which included Cdc2, bicoid, huntingtin, Fus3, and neurofibromin, none of which activated transcription. The region of Pam isolated included the extreme C-terminal 223 amino acids (PF1). The last 324 amino acids of Pam are highly conserved with its homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans (RPM-1) and Drosophila (HIW). These family members are characterized by the presence of a RING zinc finger (RZF) motif (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the RZF motif influenced the interaction with tuberin, we carried out affinity pull-down assays using the mammalian expressed FLAG-tagged tuberin bait and GST fusion proteins of Pam aa 4419-4641 (PF1) and aa 4312-4641 (PF2) encompassing the entire RZF. In addition to confirming the interaction, our results indicated that the interaction between tuberin and PF2 was more efficient than with PF1 (Fig. 1B). GST alone was employed as a negative control (Fig. 1B). We generated a peptide antibody PP1 against human Pam peptide (aa 4519-4534), which recognized the Myc-tagged Pam fusion protein PF2 expressed in cells confirming the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 1C). Pam Interacts with the Tuberin-Hamartin Complex—To examine the in vivo association of tuberin and Pam, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in PC12 cells and rat embryonic brain. Anti-Pam polyclonal antibody PP1 was employed in immunoblots to detect endogenous Pam, which migrates at ∼450 kDa. PAM cDNA has an open reading frame of 4,641 amino acids with a predicted mass of 510 kDa (27.Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of tuberin using an anti-tuberin antibody followed by immunoblot analysis showed that endogenous Pam co-immunoprecipitates with tuberin in PC12 cells and embryonic rat brain (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, in rat brain a higher amount of Pam was seen in co-immunoprecipitations when tuberin and hamartin antibodies were utilized together (Fig. 2B). Equivalent amounts of lysates were used in these experiments, and pre-immune serum was employed as a negative control. In addition, Mdm2, another RING finger-containing protein, was not co-immunoprecipitated under the same conditions (Fig. 2C), confirming further the specificity of the interaction. Collectively, these results indicate that Pam interacts with tuberin in vitro and in vivo and may exist with the tuberin-hamartin complex in brain. Mapping the Pam Binding Domain in Tuberin—To define the domain(s) responsible for the interaction of tuberin with Pam, deletion constructs within TSC2 were generated and employed in two-hybrid assays. The original tuberin bait (aa 449-1000) as well as a bait encompassing aa 895-1314 showed the strongest transcription activation, whereas tuberin spanning aa 795-1000 showed a lesser degree of transcription activation. Baits consisting of aa 449-914 and 394-549 were negative (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the tuberin domain encoding aa 914-1000 is necessary for the interaction between the two proteins. Pam is Expressed in Developing Nervous System—We examined Pam expression by immunoblotting in cultured primary cortical neurons and in the developing rat brain. Pam antibody PP1 recognizes a predominant band of ∼450 kDa in neurons cultured for 8-36 days in vitro (DIV). Pam expression was relatively unchanged in neurons from DIV8 until DIV22, after which it decreased gradually (Fig. 4A). In rat brain, Pam expression was abundant on embryonic day 16 but declined with increasing age. Interestingly, coupled with this decline in expression, the appearance of an ∼350-kDa protein with gradual increasing expression was consistently observed in the postnatal period (Fig. 4B), the nature of which remains to be characterized. Localization of Pam in Primary Cortical Neurons—We examined the localization of Pam in primary cortical neurons by indirect immunofluorescence. A strong nuclear localization of Pam was seen in the cell body, which is consistent with Myc binding. Additionally, punctate staining was observed along the neurites in axons and dendrites (Fig. 5, A, D, and G). No staining was detected when the PP1 antibody was preabsorbed with the corresponding peptide used as immunogen (Fig. 5B). Nuclear localization of Pam was further confirmed in neurons by double staining with Neu-N, a neuronal nuclear marker that completely co-localized with Pam (Fig. 5, D-F). The synaptic vesicle protein VAMP-2 revealed a partial co-localization with Pam in the cytoplasm of cell body and along the neurites (Fig. 5, G-I). Co-localization of Pam with the Tuberin-Hamartin Complex in Neurites and Growth Cones—We next examined whether Pam and the tuberin-hamartin complex were present in similar subcellular locations within cultured neurons. Tuberin is predominantly cytoplasmic with a strong perinuclear localization in the cell body (Fig. 5C). However, evidence for tuberin translocation to the nucleus has been reported earlier through its association with steroid receptor family members (34.Henry K.W. Yuan X. Koszewski N.J. Onda H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Noonan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20535-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 35.Noonan D. Lou D. Griffith N. Vanaman T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Tuberin also showed punctate localization along the neurites. Pam co-localized with tuberin and hamartin along the neurites and in the growth cones (Fig. 6, A-F). It is noteworthy that Pam co-localized with hamartin in one of the filopodial extensions at the tip of a growth cone (Fig. 6F, arrowhead). We have recently reported that hamartin exists together with the ERM family of actin-binding proteins in growth cones (26.Haddad L.A. Smith N. Bowser M. Niida Y. Murthy V. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44180-44186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, double labeling experiments revealed that Pam partially overlaps with the ERM proteins in the growth cone (Fig. 6, G-I). Pam Homolog HIW Modulates Tsc1·Tsc2 Activity in Drosophila—It has been established previously that co-expression of dTsc1 and dTsc2 genes in the eye using the eye-specific enhancer eyeless (eyGAL4) results in a smaller eye phenotype because of slower cell cycles and reduced cell size. This small eye phenotype was shown to be modulated by insulin receptor pathway genes, including S6K and PTEN (10.Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T. Cell. 2001; 105: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11.Gao X. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1383-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 12.Tapon N. Ito N. Dickson B.J. Treisman J.E. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 2001; 105: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We used this system to test whether hiw can genetically modulate dTsc1·dTsc2 activity in vivo (Fig. 7). Removal of hiw gene in male flies overexpressing Tsc1+Tsc2 results in further smaller eyes compared with controls overexpressing Tsc1+Tsc2 (Fig. 7C). All of the hiw mutant alleles tested (ND8, EP1305, ND42, ND69, and EMS) revealed enhanced eye phenotype, some of which are derived from different genetic screens and have different genetic background (Fig. 7, D-H), strongly suggesting a genetic interaction between hiw and the dTsc1·Tsc2 complex. The enhancement of Tsc1+Tsc2 phenotype by the removal of the hiw gene indicates that hiw negatively regulates Tsc1·Tsc2 activity in Drosophila eye. hiw mutant flies alone appear similar to the wild type control shown (Fig. 7, A and B). In this study, we have identified Pam as an interacting partner for tuberin and have demonstrated an association between the tuberin-hamartin complex and Pam in the CNS. Pam was identified as a binding partner for c-Myc (27.Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed Pam as a transcript of ∼15 kb in many tissues with predominant expression in brain (27.Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 2V. Murthy and V. Ramesh, unpublished observations. In situ hybridization in rodent brain showed high expression of Pam mRNA in pyramidal cells of hippocampus and granule cells of dentate gyrus and cerebellum (36.Yang H. Scholich K. Poser S. Storm D.R. Patel T.B. Goldowitz D. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2002; 136: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pam encodes a large protein with several interesting motifs (Fig. 1A). Among these motifs, the most notable include RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation) homology domains RHD1 (aa 498-740) and RHD2 (aa 874-1065), a Myc-binding region (aa 2413-2712), a RZF, and two zinc-finger motifs (Zn) at the extreme C-terminal domain (aa 4354-4583) (27.Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In another study, a small region of Pam (aa 1028-1231) was isolated as an interactor of type V adenylyl cyclase and the RHD domain of Pam was shown to be a potent inhibitor of type V adenylyl cyclase activity (37.Scholich K. Pierre S. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47583-47589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we show that the Pam domain encompassing the RZF and zinc motifs is necessary for its interaction with tuberin. Thus, it is evident that Pam, through different domains, could associate with a variety of proteins, ultimately participating in diverse cellular functions. Our results demonstrate that Pam may have at least two forms in the rat CNS, an ∼450-kDa form expressed in early embryonic stages and an ∼350-kDa form observed in the postnatal period. An antibody raised against the extreme C-terminal region of the protein detects both forms. The two forms may arise because of alternative splicing or specific cleavage at the N terminus. Further studies are needed to define the nature of the two forms. In rat brain, we have observed the expression of tuberin and hamartin to be relatively stable during development with both proteins widely expressed in the nervous system (33.Murthy V. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Haddad L.A. Roy J.E. Cutone A.N. Beauchamp R.L. Smith N. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 101: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although Pam is expressed abundantly in brain, its function in the mammalian CNS remains unknown. On the contrary, functions of Pam homologs in Drosophila and C. elegans are well understood employing the elegant genetic studies in these systems. HIW modulates synaptic growth at the larval neuromuscular junction. Presynaptic terminals in hiw mutants display large and more complex branches than in the wild type, and HIW is suggested to selectively affect the mechanism underlying synaptic growth (30.Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D. Bergstrom K. Strauss R. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 313-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). RPM-1, the worm homolog of Pam, is also shown to play a role during synaptogenesis. Loss of function mutations in the rpm-1 gene reveal abnormally structured presynaptic terminals in neuromuscular junctions (28.Zhen M. Huang X. Bamber B. Jin Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29.Schaefer A.M. Hadwiger G.D. Nonet M.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the function of these proteins as regulators of synapse formation and growth are conserved between fly and worm. Our results here demonstrate that HIW can genetically interact with and negatively regulate Tsc1·Tsc2 in Drosophila. Mammalian Pam, Drosophila HIW, and C. elegans RPM-1 define a new family of large proteins that might play an essential role in the nervous system. Although the homology among these three proteins is distributed throughout the coding sequence, one of the most conserved regions is in the C terminus containing the zinc finger motifs and a RING-H2-type finger, which we identified as the region of Pam that interacts with tuberin. Interestingly, the RING-H2 finger domain is present in a large family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (38.Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a genetic interaction has been identified between the deubiquitinating protease fat facets and hiw, demonstrating that synaptic development may be controlled by a balance between positive and negative regulators of ubiquitination. This study also implicates ubiquitin ligase activity to hiw (39.DiAntonio A. Haghighi A.P. Portman S.L. Lee J.D. Amaranto A.M. Goodman C.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), raising the intriguing possibility that Pam may indeed function as a ubiquitin ligase. A flurry of reports have appeared within the last year demonstrating that Akt phosphorylates and inactivates tuberin in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner in both mammals and fly (14.Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Molecular Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 16.Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Human TSC2 sequence has six potential Akt phosphorylation sites of which Ser-939 and Thr-1462 are conserved in dTsc2 (Ser-924 and Thr-1518). Mutations of these residues to non-phosphorylatable alanines in both systems show substantially reduced Akt-mediated phosphorylation (14.Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Molecular Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 21.Potter C.J. Pedraza L.G. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Akt-mediated phosphorylation was also shown to promote degradation of the tuberin-hamartin complex, and the mechanism for this remained unclear. However, a recent study (40.Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) proposes that activation of Akt triggers the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation of proteins containing phosphorylated Akt substrate motifs including tuberin. The precise mechanism by which Akt targets tuberin for uquitination is unknown. However, remarkably, Akt activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2, another RING finger-containing protein. Mdm2 activity is implicated in Akt-stimulated degradation of p53 and androgen receptor (41.Gottlieb T.M. Leal J.F. Seger R. Taya Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 42.Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Studies on phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of the androgen receptor suggest that phosphorylation of androgen receptor by Akt recruits Mdm2 to androgen receptor, resulting in its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (42.Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is believed to play a critical role in the initiation of protein ubiquitination by providing a recognition motif for an E3 ligase (44.Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 45.Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A key residue of tuberin phosphorylated by Akt (Ser-939) is located within the tuberin domain (aa 914-1000) that mediates the interaction with the Pam RING finger domain. Taken together, it is probable that Pam may function as an E3 ligase for tuberin and regulate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the tuberin-hamartin complex particularly in the CNS (Fig. 8, model). Although the large size of Pam poses a challenge for identifying its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, studies aimed at this aspect will aid in the understanding of how the tuberin-hamartin complex is regulated and how the complex is inactivated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation.

Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport factors of the karyopherin β family shuttle through nuclear pore complexes spanning the nuclear envelope and mediate the nuclear import and/or export of specific protein or RNA cargoes (for review, see Refs. 1.Mattaj I.W.

Directionality is imparted by Ran, a small GTPase present in its GTP-bound form at high concentrations in the nucleus and at low concentrations in the cytosol. RanGTP regulates cargo loading to nuclear export mediators (exportins) and unloading from nuclear import mediators (importins). Exportins bind their cargoes in the presence of RanGTP in the nucleus, traverse nuclear pore complexes as ternary cargo-exportin-RanGTP complexes, and disassemble in the cytoplasm upon hydrolysis of Ran-bound GTP. Conversely, importins bind their cargo at low RanGTP levels in the cytoplasm, traverse nuclear pore complexes as cargo-importin complexes, and dissociate from their cargo upon binding RanGTP in the nucleus. After delivering cargoes, components of the transport machinery shuttle back to the original compartment.The karyopherin β family includes 14 members in yeast and at least 22 in humans (for review, see Refs. 1.Mattaj I.W.

Importin β does not binds classical nuclear localization signals directly but requires the adaptor protein importin α to bridge the interaction. Despite being considered “classical,” this import pathway is unusual in that most karyopherins bind their cargoes directly rather than with an adaptor. Transportin, for example, recognizes multiple import cargoes, such as the M9 signal of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (7.Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and importin β itself, can also bind cargoes directly (8.Cingolani G. Bednenko J.

The transport machinery is remarkably versatile, with individual karyopherins recognizing multiple cargoes and with individual cargoes binding to multiple karyopherins (see reviews, Refs. 1.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 2.Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G.

Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar).Karyopherin β proteins are large molecules with molecular mass of 95-145 kDa sharing low sequence homology (sequence identity <20%). The similarity is higher in the N-terminal half, which mediates RanGTP binding (20.Görlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A similar repetitive pattern with a loose consensus of hydrophobic residues can be identified in all the sequences. Each repeating unit is on average 40 residues long and has the fingerprint of HEAT motifs (21.Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Muller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 22.Conti E. Izaurralde E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of full-length importin β locked in its interaction with a cargo, the IBB domain of importin α, has a spiral conformation built by the packing of 19 contiguous HEAT repeats (23.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The snail-like superhelix can be dissected into an N-terminal arch and a C-terminal arch, both characterized by a similar crescent shape. The structure of a different karyopherin, transportin, locked in its RanGTP-bound state reveals a twisted superhelix built by the repetitive stacking of 20 HEAT repeats (24.Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The transportin structure can also be dissected into two arches but has an open S-like rather than a closed snail-like conformation. The structure of RanGTP bound to the N-terminal arch of importin β (25.Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Görlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) is known, but it is not possible to extrapolate which conformation is adopted by the full-length protein. Furthermore, no structural information is available on other members of the family, exportins in particular.The crystallographic models of two full-length importins (importin β-IBB and transportin-RanGTP structures) display different overall tertiary conformations despite sharing a similar topological arrangement of secondary structure elements. Are the different conformations a result of the nature of the transport factors and/or of their interaction with different binding partners? Are there intrinsically different conformations between importins and exportins? What is the range of conformation a karyopherin can adopt, and is there variation between orthologs from different species? To address these questions, we studied a representative set of importins and exportins (Fig. 1) by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), a structural technique that allows visualization of the overall shape of macromolecules in solution in virtually any stable conformational state (for review, see Ref. 26.Svergun D.I. Koch M.H.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Recombinant Proteins—All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tag fusions. Cells were disrupted with a homogenizer (Avestin), and the resulting crude extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g to remove insoluble material. Soluble fractions were purified using a Talon resin and subsequently by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration.The complexes were formed by adding a 4-fold excess of the smaller components (Ran loaded with GTP, tRNA) and separated by gel filtration. Yeast Phe tRNA was purchased from Sigma. For the transportin-M9 complex, mass spectrometry was used to ascertain the presence of the corresponding 4333-Da peptide in the gel filtration peak containing transportin (data not shown). The samples were more than 90% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE. The concentration was estimated with Bradford assays.Small Angle Scattering Data Collection and Analysis—Synchrotron x-ray scattering data were collected at the EMBL X33 beamline (27.Boulin C.J. Kemof R. Gabriel A. Koch M.H.J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Sec A. 1988; 269: 312-320Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (DESY, Hamburg) at multiple protein concentrations between 3 and 20 mg/ml in 15 successive 1-min frames to check for radiation damage. The data were processed using the programs SAPOKO and PRIMUS (28.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). The overall parameters were computed using the Guinier and Porod approximations and the programs ORTOGNOM (29.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and GNOM (30.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). The latter program also permits diminishing of the effect of possible unspecific aggregation by discarding the scattering at very low angles, which is mostly influenced by the aggregation. The molecular mass of the solute was evaluated by comparison with the scattering from bovine serum albumin. Theoretical scattering curves and Rg from the coordinates of crystallographic structures and structure-based models were computed using the program CRYSOL (31.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2723) Google Scholar).SAXS ab Initio Reconstructions—Two ab initio approaches were employed to reconstruct low resolution shapes. The program DAMMIN (32.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar) represents the particle shape as an ensemble of densely packed beads inside a spherical search volume with diameter Dmax. Starting from a random distribution of beads, simulated annealing is employed to find a compact configuration minimizing the discrepancy χ between the experimental and calculated scattering curves. This shape analysis is performed using data in the range up to s = 2.5 nm-1, discarding the scattering at higher angles dominated by the internal structure of the particle. In a more versatile approach implemented in the program GASBOR (33.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), the protein is represented as an assembly of dummy residues (DR). Starting from randomly positioned residues, a chain-compatible spatial distribution of DRs inside the same search volume is found by simulated annealing. For the ternary complex Xpot-Ran-tRNA containing an RNA molecule only DAMMIN was used. Because the ab initio methods do not provide unique three-dimensional models, 10 independent reconstructions were performed for each protein or complex. The models were aligned using the program SUPCOMB (34.Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), which also provides a quantitative measure of dissimilarity of two (low or high) resolution models. After alignment, the program DAMAVER (35.Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) was used to construct the average model representing at a lower resolution the common structural features of all reconstructions and to select the most probable model (giving the smallest dissimilarity with the average).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Parameters and Benchmarking—All the samples were purified to homogeneity, their dilute solutions were exposed to synchrotron x-rays, and the data processed were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sample homogeneity was monitored by evaluating the apparent molecular mass of the solute and the excluded volume (V) of the hydrated particle. Most solutions were found to be monodisperse, which was a necessary prerequisite for the shape analysis. Table I presents the overall parameters computed directly from the scattering data for all the samples, including the radius of gyration (Rg) and maximum particle dimension (Dmax).Table IOverall parameters of karyopherin modelsMMthMMexpVolumeRgDmaxXcrystXab initiokDakDanm3nmnmTransportin-Ran *126130 ± 30300 ± 304.6 ± 0.215 ± 21.60.84Transportin102130 ± 40290 ± 204.3 ± 0.115 ± 11.81.1Transportin-M9105140 ± 30280 ± 204.4 ± 0.216 ± 11.60.81Importinβ9890 ± 20230 ± 204.6 ± 0.115 ± 11.80.77Importin β-RanGTP′123130 ± 20205 ± 153.6 ± 0.111 ± 11.40.80Xpo-t H.s. *110105 ± 20270 ± 304.8 ± 0.216 ± 2Xpo-t S.p.110100 ± 15260 ± 104.7 ± 0.115 ± 10.92LosI S.c.126110 ± 10260 ± 205.1 ± 0.117 ± 20.79Xpo-t S.p.-RanGTP-tRNA157220 ± 10190 ± 153.6 ± 0.111 ± 11.1Cse1 S.c.110110 ± 15190 ± 153.6 ± 0.112 ± 10.73Xpo1 S.c.125110 ± 15210 ± 103.9 ± 0.111 ± 11.1 Open table in a new tab We first benchmarked the feasibility of SAXS models for proteins of the karyopherin β family by analyzing the transportin-RanGTP complex, for which a crystallographic structure is available (24.Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Some aggregation effects observed in the scattering from transportin-RanGTP preparation (Fig. 2A) could be eliminated by discarding the innermost scattering points followed by data processing using the program GNOM (30.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). The particle shape was reconstructed by two ab initio simulated annealing methods, and several independent reconstructions were carried out starting from random initial approximations to compute the average and the most probable models (see “Experimental Procedures”). The bead models and the average of the DR models (Fig. 2B, blue and gray, respectively) display elongated shapes compatible with the crystallographic model of transportin-RanGTP, whereas the most probable DR model yields the best agreement with the high resolution structure (Fig. 2B, red). Below, the most probable DR models will be discussed for all the samples.Fig. 2Comparison of SAXS and crystallographic structural analysis of transportin bound to RanGTP. A, scattering curves of transportin-RanGTP. Shown are the experimental x-ray scattering curve (1) and calculated scattering from the corresponding crystallographic model (2) (24.Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Scattering was calculated from the ab initio model reconstructed by the program DAMMIN (32.Svergun D.I. Biophys.

The logarithm of scattering intensity is displayed as a function of momentum transfer (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 0.15 nm is the x-ray wavelength) up to s = 4 nm-1 (i.e. a resolution of 1.6 nm).

Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The scattering pattern of unbound transportin (Fig. 3A) displays a pronounced shoulder at s ≈ 1 nm-1, probably reflecting the pitch of the transportin superhelix (about 6 nm). This shoulder is absent in both experimental and calculated curves from the transportin-RanGTP complex (24.Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Removal of RanGTP from this crystallographic model makes the shoulder appear in the calculated pattern, albeit at a shifted position (Fig. 3A). The most probable ab initio model of free transportin shows an extended conformation similar to the S-like shape of the RanGTP-bound state (Fig. 4A). Superposition with the crystallographic model suggests that free transportin is somewhat more elongated along the superhelical axis.Fig. 3SAXS patterns of nuclear-import mediators. A, experimental x-ray scattering profiles of unbound transportin (1) and M9-bound transportin (2). Shown is the scattering pattern computed from the crystallographic coordinates of transportin in the S-like conformation as observed in the RanGTP-bound state (24.Chook Y.M. Blobel G.

In the center panel, the GASBOR model of transportin-RanGTP is superposed to the Cα trace of the transportin-RanGTP crystallographic structure (24.Chook Y.M. Blobel G.

B, Ab initio models of unbound importin β (left) and RanGTP-bound importin β (center) are displayed in cyan and show the karyopherin undergoes a large conformational change. Superposed in black on the left panel is the open S-like crystal structure of transportin (24.Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and on the center panel is the snail-like crystal structure of importin β (23.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W.

On the right is the Cα trace of the crystallographic importin β-IBB structure as a reference (23.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W.

Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) are superposable (Fig. 3A), and the Rg and Dmax values computed from the two curves coincide within experimental errors (Table I). Consistently, ab initio reconstructions of M9-bound transportin yield a similar extended shape (Fig. 4A). SAXS data, therefore, suggest that binding of an M9 cargo to free transportin or release of cargo by RanGTP binding does not involve a significant conformational rearrangement of its two arches (Fig. 4A). Although the transportin superhelix has a certain degree of structural flexibility, the karyopherin retains an overall S-like conformation in the import of M9 cargo, independently of its ligand bound/unbound state.Importin β Adopts Two Different Extended and Compact Conformations in Its Free and Bound States—The scattering pattern of unbound importin β displays a shoulder at s ≈ 1 nm-1 similar to that of unbound transportin and superposes reasonably well with the curve computed from the crystallographic model of the transportin-RanGTP complex (Fig. 3B, upper curves). The most probable ab initio model of free importin β has the S-like appearance similar to the ab initio model of free transportin (Fig. 4B). The overall shape of unbound importin β is much less compact than that observed in the crystal structure of importin β bound to the IBB cargo (23.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), in agreement with biochemical experiments showing an increased susceptibility of importin β to proteases when in the free rather than the IBB-bound state (36.Cingolani G. Lashuel H.A. Gerace L. Muller C.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The scattering pattern of the importin β-RanGTP complex differs significantly from that of unbound importin β (Fig. 3B, lower curves) and also from the scattering curve of the transportin-RanGTP complex. In comparison to transportin-RanGTP, the Rg of importin β-RanGTP is 1 nm smaller, and its Dmax is decreased by 4 nm (Table I), suggesting a rather compact shape. Ab initio reconstructions yield a compact model reminiscent of the closed importin β-IBB conformation (Fig. 4B). Indeed, the experimental data of importin β-RanGTP compare well with the scattering curve calculated from a model where the atomic coordinates of the importin β-IBB complex (23.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) have been modified to remove the IBB and to add RanGTP as observed in the complex with the N-terminal half of importin β (25.Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Görlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B, lower curves). In this model composite of two crystal structures, the C-terminal arch of importin β clashes against Ran. A model obtained by applying a relatively small rigid-body movement to the C-terminal arch to avoid steric clashes with the GTPase provides a very good fit to the experimental data (Table I).These results indicate that the conformation of importin β is ligand dependent (Fig. 4B). Association of the IBB cargo to free importin β involves a large global conformational change with considerable flexing of the two arches. Dissociation of the IBB cargo by RanGTP binding instead appears to involve only a limited deformation of the snail-like superhelix. The importin β superhelix thus adopts two globally different conformations dependently on its ligand bound/unbound state.The Export Mediator Xpo-t and the Import Mediator Importin β Have Similar Global Structural Features—To assess the overall shape and conformational changes of exportins, we targeted the tRNA export factor Xpo-t in its unbound state and export competent RanGTP- and tRNA-bound state. The scattering patterns were recorded on human Xpo-t (H.s. Xpo-t) and also on its orthologues from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S.p. Xpo-t) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Los1) (Fig. 5A). All proteins are monomeric in solution (Table I) with the exception of free H.s. Xpo-t, whose scattering pattern displays aggregation effects at low angles (Fig. 5A). At higher angles (beyond s = 0.5 nm-1, i.e. resolution of 10 nm), the scattering curve of H.s. Xpo-t virtually coincides with that of S.p.Xpo-t (Fig. 5A, upper curves), suggesting similar structures for the two orthologues. The ab initio model of S.p. Xpo-t reveals an extended superhelical shape similar to that of free transportin and importin β (Fig. 6). In contrast, yeast Los1 has a larger Rg and Dmax as compared with the S. pombe and human orthologues (Table I). The scattering curve of Los1 differs from that of H.s. and S.p. Xpo-t, lacking the characteristic shoulder at s = 1 nm-1 (Fig. 5A, center set of curves). The ab initio model of Los1 (Fig. 6) displays"

Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the apoptotic component of oxidized low density lipoprotein is one or more oxysterols, which have been shown to induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is regulated by members of the BCL family of proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that, in the murine macrophage-like cell line P388D1, oxysterols (25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol) induced the degradation of the prosurvival protein kinase AKT (protein kinase B). This led, in turn, to the activation of the BCL-2 homology-3 domain-only proteins BIM and BAD and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic multi-BCL homology domain protein BCL-xL. These responses would be expected to activate the pro-apoptotic multi-BCL homology domain proteins BAX and BAK, leading to the previously reported release of cytochrome c observed during oxysterol-induced apoptosis. Somewhat surprisingly, small interfering RNA knockdown of BAX resulted in a complete block of the induction of apoptosis by 25-hydroxycholesterol.

Med. 2001; 11: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) to be mediated by oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). 1The abbreviations used are: ox-LDL, oxidized low density lipoprotein; 25-OHC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; ETYA, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid; AACOCF3, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; myr, myristoylated; BH3, BCL-2 homology-3; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: ox-LDL, oxidized low density lipoprotein; 25-OHC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; ETYA, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid; AACOCF3, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; myr, myristoylated; BH3, BCL-2 homology-3; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. The constitutive uptake by macrophages of ox-LDL is through specialized scavenger receptors, resulting in these cells becoming lipid-laden foam cells (2.Steinbrecher U.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The formation of such cells is the hallmark of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, ox-LDL has been shown to be cytotoxic to macrophages (3.Hardwick S.J. Hegyi L. Clare K. Law N.S. Carpenter K.L. Mitchinson M.J. Skepper J.N. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) through a process requiring such receptors (4.Wintergerst E.S. Jelk J. Rahner C. Asmis R. Eur. J.

This cytotoxicity could be very important in the atherogenicity of ox-LDL through the lysis of foam cells and the concomitant deposition of lipids in the coronary vasculature. The cytotoxic effects of ox-LDL have been shown to proceed, at least in part, through apoptotic pathways, in general (reviewed in Refs. 6.Martinet W. Kockx M.M. Curr. Opin.

Prior studies have been consistent with the activation of the mitochondrial death pathway by oxysterols with its canonical cytochrome c release (19.Yang L. Sinensky M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20.Lizard G. Gueldry S. Sordet O. Monier S. Athias A. Miguet C. Bessede G. Lemaire S. Solary E. Gambert P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is regulated, in turn, through the activation of pro-apoptotic BCL family members, along with possible inactivation of anti-apoptotic BCL family members (21.Kaufmann S.H. Hengartner M.O. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 526-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the role of the AKT-regulated BAX/BAD pathway in oxysterol-induced apoptosis of murine macrophage cell lines. Materials—RAW 264.7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). P388D1 cells (MAB variant) were provided by Dr. Edward Dennis (University of California, San Diego, CA) (22.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RPMI 1640 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Invitrogen. NovaCell I fetal bovine serum was from Nova-Tech (Grand Island, NE). All other cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), Ac-DEVD-aldehyde, Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) were purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Oxysterols were purchased from STERALOIDS, Inc. (Wilton, NH). All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA), with the exception of anti-AKT1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Myc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Charlottesville, VA), and anti-HSP70 antibody (Stressgen Biotech Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Pierce. pEGFP-C3 was from Clontech. Proteasome inhibitor I was from Calbiochem. MitoTracker™ Red was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture—All cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. P388D1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Caspase-3 Assay—P388D1 cells were seeded at 2 × 106/well in 12-well culture plates, and RAW 264.7 cells at 2.5 × 106/well in 6-well culture plates. The medium was supplemented with 25-OHC dissolved in ethanol or an equivalent volume of ethanol alone (control treatments). Inhibitor (ETYA or AACOCF3) was added to the medium 2 h prior to the addition of 25-OHC. Following an 18-h incubation, the adherent and non-adherent cells were collected by scraping and centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium Pi, and 10 mm sodium PPi), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant or extract was assayed for protein using the micro-BCA kit (Pierce) and for caspase-3 activity as follows. Equivalent amounts of each sample were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in caspase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5 μm caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin) in the presence and absence of a caspase-3-specific inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-aldehyde) added at 100 nm 30 min prior to the addition of the substrate. Liberated 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin was measured using a spectrofluorometer (FluroMax 3 equipped with a microplate reader, Jobin-Yvon Inc.) with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. For each sample, the net caspase-3 activity was determined by subtracting the relative fluorescent light units obtained in the presence of the inhibitor from the relative fluorescent light units obtained in the absence of the inhibitor and normalizing to the protein content of the sample. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as the mean ± S.D. BAD-GFP Fusion Protein—The Bad open reading frame was excised from pEBG-mBAD (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) with HindIII and NotI and ligated in-frame into pEGFP-C3 after the creation of an appropriate NotI site using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The finished construct was confirmed by sequencing and transfected into RAW 264.7 cells using GeneJammer (Stratagene). Detection of BAD-GFP in RAW 264.7 Cells—Transiently transfected RAW 264.7 cells were incubated overnight on glass chambered coverslips. Cells were then washed and incubated with 25-OHC (10 μg/ml) for 6 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were observed live under a fluorescence microscope. In colocalization experiments, mitochondria were also stained with MitoTracker™ Red following the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal images were obtained by digital deconvolution of 10-slice stacks acquired on a Nikon Diaphot 200 equipped with a Photometrics Sensys cooled CCD digital camera or Nikon D100 Oncor Z-drive and Oncor Image software. Bax Gene Suppression—Bax gene suppression was achieved by stably transfecting cells with pSi-Bax, a plasmid that generates small interfering RNAs that target Bax mRNA for degradation. To produce pSi-Bax, the following complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into ApaI/EcoRI-digested pSilencer (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX): Bax 1, ACTGGTGCTCAGGCCCTGTTCAAGAGACAGGGCCTTGAGCACCAGTTTTTTT; and Bax 2, AATTAAAAAAACTGGTGCTCAAGGCCCTGTCTCTTGAACAGGGCCTTGAGCACCAGTGGCC. The negative control vector pSi-RandomBax was constructed by ligating the following annealed, custom-synthesized oligonucleotides of randomized Bax target sequence into ApaI/EcoRI-digested pSilencer: RandomBax 1, ACCGCTCGAGCGTGCTAGTTTCAAGAGAACTAGCACGCTCGAGCGGTTTTTTT; and RandomBax 2, AATTAAAAAAACCGCTCGAGCGTGCTAGTTCTCTGAAACTAGCACGCTCGAGCGGTGGCC. P388D1 cells (1 × 106) were cotransfected with a plasmid carrying the neomycin gene, pEGFP (Clontech), and either pSi-Bax or pSi-RandomBax using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Stable clones were first selected by infinite dilution in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 for 7 days, followed by 14 days in 0.25 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant clones were screened by PCR for integration of the pSilencer vector. The PCR positive G418-resistant clones were then subjected to selection in medium containing 10 μg/ml 25-OHC for 68 h. The surviving cells were expanded and maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. No 25-OHC-resistant clones were obtained from PCR positive G418-resistant pRandomBax clones. The suppression of BAX expression was determined by immunoblotting whole cell lysates prepared from the isolated clones, wild-type cells, and G418-resistant pRandomBax clones using anti-BAX antibody. Expression of Constitutively Active AKT—P388D1 cells were stably transfected with a vector expressing Myc-His-tagged mouse AKT1 (activated) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's directions. Stable clones were isolated by selection in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 for 6 days, followed by 10 days in 250 μg/ml G418. The G418-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and screened for expression of the Myc-AKT fusion protein by immunoblotting with anti-total AKT1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and anti-Myc antibody. Positive Myc-AKT clones were maintained in medium containing 250 μg/ml G418. For transient transfection experiments, P388D1 cells were seeded at 2 × 106/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, refed standard growth medium, and transfected with pUSEamp or with pUSEamp containing myristoylated (myr) Akt cDNA using Tojene™ transfection reagent (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Following transfection, expression of the transfected construct was allowed to proceed for 24 h prior to the addition of oxysterol and analysis of caspase-3 activity. Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—P388D1 cells were grown to a density of 2 × 106/ml in regular growth medium supplemented with either vehicle (ethanol) or increasing amounts of 25-OHC. After different periods of time, cells were spun and treated with lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Insoluble debris was removed from the extracts by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined by micro-BCA assay. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). The membranes were stained with SYPRO®Ruby protein stain (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to ascertain equivalent loading of the gel and efficient transfer of proteins to the membranes before immunoblotting. The blots were then processed using antibodies specific for the protein of interest and the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies following manufacturers' directions. The proteins of interest were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) as directed. Pulse-Chase Experiments—P388D1 cells were grown in methionine-deficient medium for 2 h and then pulsed with Tran35S-label (100 μCi/ml; ICN) for 3 h. Cells were then washed and chased for different time periods in regular growth medium containing 1 mm unlabeled methionine and either vehicle (ethanol) or 10 μg/ml 25-OHC. Cells were lysed as described above and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-AKT antibodies. Assays were performed using Seize™-coated plate immunoprecipitation kits (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After binding, washing, and elution, the presence of radiolabeled AKT in the precipitates was examined by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. AKT Kinase Assay—The active form of AKT was measured using a nonradioactive AKT kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Essentially, an antibody to AKT was used to selectively immunoprecipitate AKT from cell lysates. The immunoprecipitate was then incubated with glycogen synthase kinase-3β fusion protein in the presence of ATP and kinase buffer, allowing immunoprecipitated AKT to phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β was then measured by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Ser-21/9 glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β antibody and quantitated by phosphorimaging. 25-OHC Induces Apoptosis in P388D1 Cells through a Process Dependent on Arachidonate Metabolism—We have previously characterized oxysterol induction of apoptosis in both a fibroblast cell line (CHO-K1) and a monocyte-macrophage cell line (THP-1) as being dependent on arachidonate release and metabolism (9.Panini S.R. Yang L. Rusiñol A.E. Sinensky M.S. Bonventre J.V. Leslie C.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1678-1686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of difficulties we encountered in transfection of THP-1 cells and the well established use of the murine macrophage P388D1 cells in studies of arachidonate metabolism (22.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we determined whether P388D1 cells undergo apoptosis in response to oxysterols in a similar fashion. We confirmed a prior report (16.Harada K. Ishibashi S. Miyashita T. Osuga J.-I. Yagyu H. Ohashi K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that 25-OHC induces apoptosis in P388D1 cells and also demonstrated, as was observed for the other cell lines, that the induction of apoptosis was blocked both by the cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitor AACOCF3 and by ETYA, an inhibitor of arachidonate metabolism (Fig. 1). 25-OHC Down-regulates AKT in P388D1 Cells—AKT (protein kinase B) has been well characterized as an anti-apoptotic kinase (24.Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) that transduces cellular survival signals in many cell types (25.Nunez G. del Peso L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In particular, a critical role for AKT has been ascribed to the survival of macrophages (26.Liu H. Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Pope R.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of overnight treatment with 25-OHC on the activity of AKT in the murine macrophage cell line P388D1. Activity was assayed with glycogen synthase kinase-3β as substrate. The results clearly indicate that AKT activity was down-regulated in P388D1 cells in response to treatment with 25-OHC (Fig. 2A). The mechanism of down-regulation of AKT was explored by immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that oxysterol treatment produced a reduction in the level of total AKT in P388D1 cells (Fig. 2B). Pulse-chase radioimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that 25-OHC treatment greatly enhanced the rate of degradation of AKT (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the effect was observed with no time lag after 25-OHC addition, suggesting that this is an early signaling event. We also examined the effect of treatment with proteasome inhibitor I on the cellular levels and activity of AKT in 25-OHC-treated cells. This was done to determine whether this enhanced degradation rate was responsible for the decrease in its activity as well as to gain insight into the mechanism of regulated degradation. The results demonstrate that inhibition of the degradation of AKT significantly attenuated the loss of its activity in response to 25-OHC treatment (Fig. 2, A and D). Therefore, the primary mechanism by which 25-OHC down-regulates the activity of AKT appears to be through stimulation of its rate of degradation. This mechanism of degradation is also consistent with an early regulated event. We wanted to confirm this putative critical role for AKT signaling in 25-OHC-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the effect of expression of a constitutively active Myc-tagged form of AKT (myr-AKT) (27.Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) on the activation of caspase-3 by 25-OHC treatment. We isolated a clone (clone B) stably expressing transfected myr-AKT (Fig. 3A). AKT activity in clone B cells was shown to be elevated ∼2-fold relative to that in wild-type P388D1 cells as demonstrated in vitro by enzyme assay both in untreated and 25-OHC-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Clone B was also seen to be relatively resistant to induction of apoptosis by 25-OHC or 7-ketocholesterol as measured by caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3, B and C). To guard against the possibility that this result was due to another genetic variation in clone B, the ability of myr-AKT to protect cells from oxysterol-induced caspase-3 activation was also demonstrated by transient transfection with the same construct (Fig. 3D). Effect of 25-OHC Treatment on BH3 Domain-only Proteins: Activation of BAD and Increased Cellular Levels of BIM—A common mechanism by which AKT inactivation is coupled to apoptosis is through the regulation of BAD by AKT (25.Nunez G. del Peso L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). AKT phosphorylates BAD at two serine residues, resulting in its sequestration in the cytosol, bound to 14-3-3 (28.Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar, 29.del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G.

Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). In the absence of ongoing AKT-catalyzed phosphorylation, BAD becomes dephosphorylated by any of several phosphatases (31.Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This results in its relocalization to the mitochondria (32.Pastorino J.G. Tafani M. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19411-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33.Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T.

Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) with the anti-apoptotic BCL family members BCL-2 and BCL-xL (36.Yang G. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). These are critical signaling events in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway that result in canonical cytochrome c release (37.Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because we have previously demonstrated that oxysterols mediate cytochrome c release from mitochondria during apoptotic induction in other cell types (19.Yang L. Sinensky M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we anticipated that a consequence of the observed AKT degradation would be activation of BAD. BAD activation can be detected either through determination of its dephosphorylation or by its relocalization. We examined both processes. The immunoblot of BAD from 25-OHC-treated P388D1 cells with anti-phospho-BAD antibody is consistent with loss of phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In clone B, BAD was observed to be hyperphosphorylated both in untreated and 25-OHC-treated cells (Fig. 4), demonstrating the activity and, in particular, the anti-apoptotic activity of the myr-AKT construct in whole cells. The immunoblots of total mitochondrial BAD were consistent with an increase in the mitochondrial levels of BAD after 25-OHC treatment (data not shown). Relocalization of BAD was also demonstrated by transfection of murine RAW 264.7 macrophages with a BAD-GFP fusion protein. Such a reporter has previously been utilized to demonstrate BAD activation in another system (33.Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were used for this experiment because they grow attached and spread out on the surface of a plastic Petri dish, allowing better resolution of the cellular distribution of the fluorescent fusion protein. The results indicate a redistribution of BAD from a diffuse cytosolic localization to a punctate distribution largely colocalized with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker (Fig. 5). This is precisely the result to be expected for the relocalization of BAD associated with dephosphorylation (33.Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar).Fig. 525-OHC induces BAD translocation to the mitochondria. RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with BAD-GFP fusion protein. After 16 h, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml 25-OHC and incubated for 6 h. The localization of the BAD-GFP chimera was determined by fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The same cell is shown before and after treatment. MitoTracker is a fluorescent probe that specifically stains mitochondria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Korsmeyer and co-workers (38.Letai A. Bassik M.C.

The first category is exemplified by BAD, which functions through “sensitization” toward apoptosis by heterodimerization and inactivation of anti-apoptotic multi-BCL homology domain family members. BH3 domain-only proteins in the second category activate the pro-apoptotic multi-BCL homology domain family members by inducing their oligomerization to release cytochrome c. Expression of one of these proteins (BIM) has been shown to be down-regulated by AKT (39.Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2017099874,"The intricate production of ribosomal RNA is well defined in yeast, but its complexity in higher organisms is barely understood. We recently showed that down-regulation of nucleolar protein RNA helicase II/Guα (RH-II/Guα or DDX21) in Xenopus oocytes inhibited processing of 20 S rRNA to 18 S and contributed to degradation of 28 S rRNA (Yang, H., Zhou, J., Ochs, R. L., Henning, D., Jin, R., and Valdez, B. C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 38847–38859). Since no nucleolar RNA helicase has been functionally characterized in mammalian cells, we used short interfering RNA to search for functions for RH-II/Guα and its paralogue RH-II/Guβ in rRNA production. Silencing of RH-II/Guα by more than 80% in HeLa cells resulted in an almost 80% inhibition of 18 and 28 S rRNA production. This inhibition could be reversed by exogenous expression of wild type RH-II/Guα. A helicase-deficient mutant form having ATPase activity was able to rescue the production of 28 S but not 18 S rRNA. A phenotype exhibiting inhibition of 18 S and 28 S rRNA production was also observed when the paralogue RH-II/Guβ was overexpressed. Both down-regulation of RH-II/Guα and overexpression of RH-II/Guβ slowed cell proliferation. The opposite effects of the two paralogues suggest antagonistic functions.

Although our laboratory recently showed that antisense-mediated down-regulation of RNA helicase II/Guα in Xenopus laevis oocytes resulted in inhibition of production of 18 S rRNA and degradation of 28 S rRNA (18Yang H.

RNA helicase II/Guα (RH-II/Guα or DDX21) is a DEAD box nucleolar protein that we previously cloned and characterized (19Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21372-21383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Woods K. Flores-Rozas H Hurwitz J. Perlaky L. Busch H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence shows RNA helicase motifs at the middle region, which is responsible for its 5′ to 3′ RNA unwinding activity, and a functionally distinct domain at its C terminus that is able to introduce secondary structure to single-stranded RNA (21Valdez B.C. Henning D. Perumal K. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Its paralogue, RNA helicase II/Guβ, has a marginal RNA helicase activity in vitro, and it does not possess an RNA folding activity (22Valdez B.C. Perlaky L. Henning D. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The high homology in the structures of the two paralogues and close proximity of their genes on human chromosome 10 suggest evolution by gene duplication (23Valdez B.C. Yang H. Hong F. Sequitin A.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 284: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Their nucleolar localization suggests a functional relationship with the production of rRNA. To gain more information about the roles of RH-II/Guα and RH-II/Guβ in rRNA biosynthesis, we employed the use of siRNA and overexpression of their wild type or negative mutant forms. Down-regulation of RH-II/Guα slowed the production of 18 and 28 S rRNA. These effects were reversed when wild type RH-II/Guα was overexpressed, whereas inducible expression of a helicase-deficient mutant reversed the inhibitory effects on 28 S rRNA but not on 18 S rRNA production. siRNA-mediated silencing of RH-II/Guβ did not inhibit rRNA biosynthesis, but overexpression of its wild type form inhibited rRNA production. In addition to affecting rRNA production, silencing of RH-II/Guα or overexpression of RH-II/Guβ resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation. The results suggest antagonistic roles of the two paralogues in rRNA production and cell proliferation. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate.

Primers for internal control were also added in the reaction. β-Actin primers were initially used as internal control, but multiple bands were obtained. Better results were obtained using primers for U1 small nuclear RNP-specific C protein mRNA (U1RNPC; GenBank™ accession number X12517). PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc.) was used to do reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C heating for 15 min to denature reverse transcriptase and activate HotStarTaq DNA polymerase. The succeeding 20 cycles of PCR included denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension reaction was done at 72 °C for 10 min. The RT-PCR product was mixed with 2 μl of Bluejuice (Invitrogen), and 6 μl of the mixture was analyzed using 5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel.

Anti-actin (C-11) and anti-FLAG (M2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Sigma, respectively. After analysis of each membrane with anti-RH-II/Guα, it was stripped and probed with another antibody directed against C23, B23, or actin. Metabolic Labeling of Cells—Cells were transfected with 10 or 50 nm siRNA for 48 h as described above. Cells were then incubated in phosphate-free medium (Sigma) for 3.5 h. It was replaced with fresh phosphate-free medium containing 40 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). Incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 was continued for 1.5 h. Cells were then washed twice with a growth medium. The chase experiment was done by incubating the labeled cells in a growth medium containing 500 mm Na2HPO4 at 0, 2, and 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and the RNA concentration was determined at 260 nm. Equal weight of RNA was resolved on a formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was dried and placed in a PhosphorImager cassette for ∼4 h or overnight. After analysis, the RNA blot was stained with 0.2% methylene blue to visually check equal loading.

BV596, BV598, and BV777 encode a FLAG epitope. Transfection, selection, and IPTG induction of LAP3 cells were as previously described (27Strezoska Z. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5516-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Proliferation Assay—HeLa cells, which were transfected two times (24-h interval) with 10 nm siRNA for a total of 48 h, were trypsinized and counted. Equal cell numbers were replated into new 6-well plates for 72 h. Each well contained 50,000 or 100,000 cells after replating. Cells were again trypsinized, and all samples were diluted with equal volumes of medium for replating into 96-well plates, such that sample wells would have a total volume of 100 μl and 10,000 or fewer cells each. A standard curve was generated by serial dilution of untreated HeLa cells, wherein the maximum was 20,000 cells per well and the minimum was 625. Plated cells were allowed to recover and attach for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) was used to assay for living cells. After an incubation time of 30 min to 1 h at 37 °C, the plates were read on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 490 nm. siRNA-mediated Down-regulation of RH-II/Guα—This study involved the use of both human and mouse cell lines. We designed siRNA to target both human and mouse RH-II/Guα as well as siRNAs that were species-specific. Down-regulation was examined at the mRNA and protein levels. Preliminary experiments indicated that 20 cycles of RT-PCR correlated linearly with the levels of mRNAs, and the use of U1RNPC as a loading control was better than β-actin. Treatment of HeLa and LAP3 cells with 0–100 nm si-934 resulted in a decrease in the level of RH-II/Guα mRNA in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. When 10 nm si-934 was used, the human homologue decreased by 75%, whereas the mouse homologue decreased by 55% (Fig. 1, A and B). An siRNA that specifically targets mouse RH-II/Guα, si-935, silenced RH-II/Guα by 75% (Fig. 1B) without affecting the human orthologue (Fig. 1A). si-936, which was specific to human RH-II/Guα, decreased RH-II/Guα mRNA in HeLa cells by 45% with a minimal effect on the level of mRNA of the mouse enzyme. All three siRNAs did not significantly affect the level of RH-II/Guβ in HeLa and LAP3 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). A significant decrease in the protein level of mouse RH-II/Guα was observed using 100 nm si-934 and 100 nm si-935, which resulted in 76 and 89% silencing, respectively (Fig. 1C). This decrease in the protein level correlates with the decrease in the mRNA level (Fig. 1B). Because of the efficacies of si-934 and si-935, we decided to use these siRNAs in the succeeding experiments. To determine the kinetics of down-regulation of the human RH-II/Guα at the mRNA and protein levels, samples at different time points were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Fig. 2 shows a 50% decrease in the mRNA level within 4 h after transfection without any effect on the protein level. The mRNA level continued to decrease to 10% until 72 h, and a significant decrease in the protein level was not observed until 48 h after transfection (Fig. 2B). The delayed effect of si-934 on the protein level of RH-II/Guα is attributed to a longer half-life of the protein. Determination of the time when the protein level decreased was essential in the study of its physiological function as detailed below. Down-regulation of RH-II/Guα Inhibits Production of rRNA—We hypothesized that down-regulation of RH-II/Guα would result in an aberrant processing of rRNA. After 48 h of siRNA transfection, cells were pulse-labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then chased with unlabeled phosphate-enriched medium. As a negative control, an siRNA with scrambled si-934 sequence was included (si-934Scr). RT-PCR analysis of total RNAs taken 4 h after the chase began showed a 92% decrease in RH-II/Guα in HeLa cells treated with si-934. Mock transfection and si-934Scr did not affect the level of RH-II/Guα mRNA (Fig. 3A). Both mock-transfected and si-934Scr-treated cells showed normal progression in the processing of pre-rRNA within 4 h of chase (Fig. 3B). The low32P activity at 0 h of chase would indicate that little labeled phosphate taken up by the cells had been incorporated into rRNA. Within 2 h, the32P labeling of RNA increased, and the positions of 47 S/45 S pre-rRNA and 32 S, 28 S, and 18 S rRNA were visualized. Treatment of cells with si-934, which caused a dramatic decrease in RH-II/Guα mRNA (Fig. 3A), resulted in an inhibition of rRNA production (Fig. 3B). The decrease in the largest visible precursor, 47 S/45 S, was not as marked as the decrease in the final products, 28 and 18 S rRNA. We sometimes observed an accumulation of the 47 S/45 S rRNA. This inconsistency could be due to inefficient transfer from gel to the membrane. Compared with mock, the use of si-934 resulted in an 83 and 82% decrease in the level of 28 and 18 S rRNA, respectively, after a 2-h chase (Fig. 3B). The level of 32 S rRNA decreased to a lesser extent. For example, after a 2-h chase, the level of 32 S decreased by 45% (Fig. 3B, lane 5). After a 4-h chase, the level decreased by 28%, whereas 28 and 18 S rRNA decreased by 74 and 76%, respectively. The results suggest that the production of 28 and 18 S rRNA was affected by the down-regulation of RH-II/Guα compared with the production of 32 S rRNA. The observed inhibition of rRNA production mediated by down-regulation of RH-II/Guα is similar to the effects caused by inactivation of the DKC1 gene that encodes dyskerin, a putative pseudouridine synthase that is relevant in rRNA modification (17Ruggero D. Grisendi S. Piazza F. Rego E. Mari F. Rao P.H. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 2003; 299: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To prove equal loading of RNA, the membrane was stained with methylene blue. Only the final products, 28 and 18 S rRNA, which were present in greater proportion, were stained strongly (Fig. 3B, right panel).

To determine whether or not the helicase activity of RHII/Guα was critical for the production of rRNA, we constructed stable LAP3 clones (mouse cells) that expressed wild type and mutant forms of human RH-II/Guα upon IPTG induction. We previously showed that the RH-II/Guα SAT-M1 mutant, wherein the SAT motif was mutated to LET, did not exhibit RNA unwinding activity in vitro despite the presence of ATPase activity (21Valdez B.C.

Cells were first induced with IPTG for 48 h prior to treatment with si-935, a mouse RH-II/Guα-specific siRNA. Fig. 4A shows expression and nucleolar localization of the human RH-II/Guα wild type and SAT mutant upon IPTG induction. Our purpose was to knock down the endogenous mouse RHII/Guα while exogenously expressing the human orthologue and look for reversal of inhibition of rRNA production. We already showed in Fig. 1 that si-935 inhibits expression of mouse RH-II/Guα by 75% without a significant effect on human RH-II/Guα. Fig. 4B shows that treatment of a vector clone with si-935 resulted in 43% decrease in 28 and 18 S rRNA after a 4-h chase. This effect was reversed by exogenous expression of human wild type RH-II/Guα, suggesting that the human orthologue can functionally replace the mouse enzyme (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4). To our surprise expression of the human RHII/Guα SAT-M1 mutant rescued the inhibitory effects on 28 S rRNA but not on 18 S rRNA (compare lanes 2 and 6 in Fig. 4B). This result suggests that the unwinding activity of RH-II/Guα is critical for biosynthesis of 18 S rRNA. Other mechanisms might play a role in the involvement of RH-II/Guα in the production of 28 S rRNA. One can argue that the differences we observed might be due to unequal RNA loading on the gels, although methylene blue staining shows otherwise (Fig. 4B, right panel). To circumvent this argument, we compared the ratios of 28 to 18 S rRNA. Whereas these ratios are equal to 1.3 and 1.6 in the control and wild type human RH-II/Guα clones, the SAT-M1 mutant ratios were 2.0 and 2.4 in the absence or presence of siRNA, respectively, suggesting a decrease in 18 S rRNA in the mutant clone relative to 28 S rRNA. The same RNA samples were analyzed for the levels of mouse and human RH-II/Guα by RT-PCR (Fig. 4C). Treatment of the vector clone with si-935 resulted in 78% decrease in mouse RH-II/Guα mRNA (lane 2). However, the efficacy of si-935 decreased when human RH-II/Guα (wild type or SAT mutant) was ectopically expressed (compare mouse Guα (mGua) in lanes 2, 4, and 6 in Fig. 4C). It is possible that human and mouse RH-II/Guα mRNAs competed for si-935 in a mouse cell line, but Fig. 1A shows that si-935 does not have an effect on human RH-II/Guα mRNA in HeLa cells. It is more likely that the ectopically expressed human RH-II/Guα stimulated the expression of the endogenous mouse RH-II/Guα as shown in lanes 3 and 5 (Fig. 4C). Apparently, the helicase activity of human RH-II/Guα is not required for this stimulation, since both wild type (WT) and mutant (SAT-M1) RH-II/Guα have similar effects. Down-regulation of RH-II/Guα Blocks Cell Proliferation— After treatment of HeLa cells with si-934, we observed a slowed proliferation rate. We decided to examine the growth rate of the surviving cells. Fig. 5 shows a 55% reduction in relative growth rate of cells treated with si-934, whereas cells treated with si-934Scr showed only 10% reduction relative to the mock-transfected cells. Statistical analyses using Student's t test showed a significant difference (p < 0.001) between si-934 treatment and mock or si-934Scr transfection. Examination of the mRNA and protein levels of RH-II/Guα shows almost complete silencing (Fig. 5, B and C). The difference in magnitude between decreases in growth rate and the level of RH-II/Guα suggests a possible compensatory mechanism. Analysis by flow cytometry of cells treated with si-934 did not reveal any specific cell cycle arrest (data not shown). The results suggest a slowing down of cellular metabolisms. Overexpression of RH-II/Guβ Inhibits rRNA Production—It is possible that down-regulation of RH-II/Guα could result in stimulation of expression and/or enhancement of the enzymatic activity of RH-II/Guβ, compensating for the lost activity of RH-II/Guα. After treatment of HeLa cells with si-934, which specifically targets RH-II/Guα, the mRNA level of RH-II/Guβ increased 15% (Fig. 1A). We thought that this increase was significant enough to compensate for the decrease in RH-II/Guα, and our plan was to down-regulate expression of endogenous mouse RH-II/Guα with si-935 and look for rescue by expression of exogenous mouse RH-II/Guβ. To our surprise, overexpression of mouse RH-II/Guβ (Fig. 6A) inhibited the production of rRNA even without down-regulation of the α form (Fig. 6B, lane 6). The rRNA production in a clone overexpressing RH-II/Guα is similar to the vector clone treated with IPTG (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 4). This is consistent with the absence of effects on rRNA production when RH-II/Guβ is silenced to 20% with siRNA (data not shown). Another phenotype seen after overexpression of RH-II/Guβ is a decreased cell proliferation (data not shown), which would be expected when rRNA production is inhibited. Overall, up-regulation of the β form, or down-regulation of the α form, inhibits rRNA production and cell proliferation, suggesting an antagonistic relationship between the two paralogues. The general mechanisms of pre-rRNA processing in mammals and frog are similar. Both involve sequential cleavages of the primary and intermediate precursors leading to the production of 28, 18, and 5.8 S rRNA (37Savino R. Gerbi S.A.

Because of their ability to stably integrate into their host cell genomes, murine oncoretroviruses are among the most commonly used vectors for gene delivery into mammalian cells. Although retroviral vectors are used extensively for many applications including gene therapy, their utility remains limited by their sensitivity to transcriptional silencing by host cell-repressive mechanisms. Cytosine DNA methylation and deacetylation of nucleosomal histone proteins are two biochemical processes that are widely associated with transcriptional repression of both cellular genes and retroviruses (1.Lorincz M.C.

Cytosine methylation is directed by DNA methyltransferases primarily to CpG dinucleotides, although cytosine methylation in the context of CpNpG has been demonstrated in some cases (6.Clark S.J.

The common association of hypoacetylated histones with methylated DNA and the presence of HDACs as components of transcriptional co-repressor complexes that specifically associate with methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins suggest a mechanism for targeting histone deacetylation to methylated DNA (9.Jones P.L.

Although reactivation of silenced provirus by demethylation with the cytosine methylation inhibitors 5-azacytosine or 5-azadeoxycytidine (collectively 5-azadC) is perhaps the strongest evidence for a causal role of DNA methylation in retroviral silencing, the effects of these agents on silenced provirus are often minimal (3.Cherry S.R.

Furthermore, silencing of proviral expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells has been shown to occur prior to detection of methylated proviral DNA (13.Gautsch J.W. Wilson M.C. Nature. 1983; 301: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14.Niwa O. Yokota Y. Ishida H. Sugahara T.

Osborne C.S. Yao S. Sukonnik T. Pasceri P. Karaiskakis A. Okano M. Li E. Lipshitz H.D. Ellis J.

Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the general association between DNA methylation and retroviral silencing, their causal relationship has not been established. Distinct mechanisms have been suggested for establishment and maintenance of silenced provirus. In mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, silenced rather than expressed provirus was hypermethylated and specifically associated with hypoacetylated histone H3 and MeCP2 (1.Lorincz M.C. Schubeler D. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7913-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7.Lorincz M.C. Schubeler D. Goeke S.C. Walters M. Groudine M. Martin D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the latter being a MBD protein known to associate with HDAC-containing co-repressor complexes (10.Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). This finding suggests a methylation-dependent mechanism for retroviral silencing in MEL cells that involves specific recruitment of HDACs to methylated DNA through MBD proteins. Interestingly, at early times post-transduction, silenced provirus was sensitive to both 5-azaC and the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin-A (TSA), but sensitivity to both agents diminished over time concomitant with the accumulation of cytosine methylation in proviral DNA (7.Lorincz M.C. Schubeler D. Goeke S.C. Walters M. Groudine M. Martin D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This suggests a distinct mechanism for maintenance of the silenced proviral state in MEL cells that is associated with increased methylation density. Some trans-acting repressive factors are known to recruit HDACs to DNA independently of MBD proteins or DNA methylation (16.Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E.

Early studies with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) identified a number of repressive cis-acting elements in the LTR and untranslated region of the virus (19.Swindle C.S. Klug C.A. J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res. 2002; 11: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These include binding sites for the embryonal LTR-binding protein (20.Tsukiyama T. Niwa O. Yokoro K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4670-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the YY1 nuclear factor, the latter of which is known to associate with HDAC-containing transcriptional co-repressor complexes (18.Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Although the newer generation MSCV retroviral vector investigated in this study lacks many of the known cis-acting repressive elements present in MMLV (21.Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar), it remains sensitive to transcriptional silencing in ES cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (2.Pannell D. Osborne C.S. Yao S. Sukonnik T.

Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5506-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and has been shown to harbor repressive cis-acting sequences in the LTR and untranslated region (23.Osborne C.S. Pasceri P. Singal R. Sukonnik T. Ginder G.D. Ellis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5490-5496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repressive effects of DNA methylation have been reported to be most potent when located within or near promoter regions (24.Curradi M. Izzo A. Badaracco G. Landsberger N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3157-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25.Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2560-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the MSCV LTR, two major clusters of six and seven CpG dinucleotides are located within proximity of each other, one completely within the U3 region and the other directly overlapping the transcription initiation site in the R region. To directly determine the contribution of DNA methylation in the promoter region of the LTR to retroviral silencing, we mutated the CpGs in each of these clusters independently or in toto and assessed effects of the mutations on silencing of MSCV expression in murine ES cells. An analysis of numerous single copy proviral integrants showed that mutation of CpGs in both clusters eliminated proviral integrants that were completely silenced, thus defining the promoter region CpGs as a repressive element in ES cells. Irrespective of the presence of CpGs in the mutated promoter region, many of the integrants exhibited variegated expression, which is defined by expression (or silencing) of provirus in a fraction of cells within a clonal population. Unlike completely silenced integrants, the variegated phenotype was shown to reflect a reversible transient state of silencing. However, similar to completely silenced clones, the frequency of silencing within each variegated clonal population was stable over time and an apparent property of the genomic site of integration. Treatment with 5-azadC delayed the kinetics of establishing the silenced proviral state but resulted in only modest, if any, reactivation of completely silenced or variegated clones at late times post-transduction. These results are direct evidence for a causal contribution of DNA methylation in the LTR to retroviral silencing and suggest distinct mechanisms for establishment and maintenance of the silenced state. Retroviral Vectors—The green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence optimized for human codon usage (26.Anderson M.T. Tjioe I.M. Lorincz M.C. Parks D.R. Herzenberg L.A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8508-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was inserted into the MSCV retroviral vector (21.Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar) in place of the phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin cassette. For introducing the CpG mutations into the 3′-LTR, PCR was used to amplify the XbaI-SacI and XbaI-KpnI restriction fragments using a common 5′ primer spanning the XbaI site and 3′ primers containing the U3 and R region mutations spanning the SacI and KpnI sites, respectively. Amplified fragments containing the mutations were ligated in place of their corresponding wild-type restriction fragments in the 3′-LTR. Mutations in the R region were introduced into both 3′- and 5′-LTRs. During retroviral reverse transcription, the sequence of the 3′-U3 region is copied to the 5′-LTR, whereas the 5′-R region sequence may be derived from either 5′- or 3′-R regions or both. Confirmation of CpG mutations in the 5′-LTRs of integrated provirus was confirmed by DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified provirus (data not shown). Retroviral Transductions and Cell Sorting—The BOSC23 ecotropic packaging cell line was transiently transfected with each MSCV construct by calcium-phosphate co-precipitation, and viral supernatants were harvested after 48 h (27.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Murine ES cells (E14.1) were maintained on murine embryonic feeder cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). For retroviral transductions, ES cells were incubated with limiting amounts of retroviral supernatants for 6 h in the presence of polybrene (4 μg/ml) and cultured for an additional 18 h before sorting. Transduced ES cells were sorted for GFP expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) on a Becton Dickinson FAC-Star Plus cell sorter. For ES cell cloning, cells were sorted as single cells into separate wells of a 96-well plate. Integration Site Analysis—Genomic DNA purified from ES cell clones was digested with BamHI, which is present as a unique restriction site in MSCV located 3′ of the GFP-coding sequence, and analyzed for the presence of proviral DNA by Southern blotting using a radiolabeled GFP sequence probe. Statistical Analysis—Individual integrants were categorized based on expression frequency into one of three categories: silenced (0–5% GFP-positive cells); variegated (5–75% GFP-positive cells); and sustained (75–100% GFP-positive cells). At each time point, the distribution of integrants of each vector between the three categories was compared with that of the unmodified MSCV vector by χ-square analysis (28.Daniel W.W. Biostatistics. 6th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Confidence levels of difference (P) between distributions were determined based on the χ-square distribution and two degrees of freedom. 5-azadC and TSA Treatments—For treatments with 5-azadC and TSA, ES cells were cultured in complete media containing 5-azadC or TSA at concentrations of 50 and 10 nm, respectively. Media containing either agent were changed daily during treatments. SNARF-1 Labeling of Cells—For tracking cell divisions, transduced ES cells were sorted for proviral GFP expression as described above, incubated in PBS containing 5 μm seminaphthorhodafluor-1 at 37 °C for 15 min (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and re-introduced into culture following removal of free seminaphthorhodafluor-1. Bisulfite Sequencing—Genomic DNA was isolated from ES cells, and bisulfite-treated as described by Clark et al. (29.Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The LTR was amplified from bisulfite-treated DNA by nested PCR using the following primer sets: first round, 5′-GGTTAGGAATAGAGAGATAGTAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCAAATCTCRATAAAACCTCC-3′, and second round, 5′-GATGTTTTTAGGGTGTTTTAAGGATTTG-3′ and 5′-CCTCCCAAAAATCAACRAATCCAC-3′. Amplifed DNA was sequenced with the primer 5′-GGATTTGAAAATGATTTTGTG-3′ (r = A + G wobble). Mutation of CpG Clusters within the U3 and R Regions of MSCV—The promoter region of the MSCV LTR contains two clusters of six and seven CpGs in the U3 and R regions, respectively (Fig. 1A). These CpGs account for all but a few of the CpGs present in the MSCV LTR. To determine the contribution of these sequences to MSCV silencing, MSCV vectors were constructed with the CpGs mutated in either cluster (M-U3 or M-R) or both clusters (M-U3/R) (Fig. 1B). Mutations in the R region were introduced such that base pairing was maintained in a stem-loop structure previously shown important for retroviral expression (Fig. 1B) (30.Trubetskoy A.M. Okenquist S.A. Lenz J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a reporter for transcriptional activity, the coding sequence for GFP was placed under control of the LTR (Fig. 1C). Distinct Expression Patterns among Individual Proviral Integrants—The murine embryonic day 14.1 ES cell line was transduced with the unaltered MSCV vector and each of the three MSCV mutants (M-U3, M-R, and M-U3/R). The MMLV-based vector, MFG (31.Dranoff G. Jaffee E. Lazenby A. Golumbek P. Levitsky H. Brose K. Jackson V. Hamada H. Pardoll D. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3539-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar), which contains additional known repressive cis-acting sequences in the U3 region, was included as a benchmark for retroviral silencing in this study. ES cells were transduced with limiting amounts of viral supernatants to minimize transductants containing multiple copies of integrated provirus. At 24 h post-transduction, transduced ES cells were sorted for proviral GFP expression by FACS and deposited as single cells into separate wells of a 96-well plate. Clonogenic cultures derived from each transduced clone were monitored for GFP expression by flow cytometry at 2, 4, and 10 weeks post-transduction with some clones maintained for 16 weeks. The first time point at 2 weeks post-transduction was the minimal time required to obtain a sufficient number of cells in a single ES cell colony for flow cytometric analysis. Integration site analysis was performed on all of the clones by Southern blotting, and only clones containing a single proviral copy were included in the analysis (Fig. 2A). This allowed the transcriptional activity of each individual proviral integrant to be measured independently so that the absolute overall silencing frequency among individual integrants could be determined for each vector. The methylation status of the LTRs from nine MSCV integrants (17 total CpGs including those targeted for mutation) was determined by bisulfite sequence analysis (29.Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) of proviral DNA at 10 weeks post-transduction. Significant levels of cytosine methylation were observed at each of the CpGs analyzed for all nine integrants. At 2 weeks post-transduction, the frequency of GFP expression within each clonal population of cells varied among the integrants. Cells were considered GFP-positive if their GFP fluorescence intensity by FACS analysis was greater than that of non-transduced ES cells. Data for a representative set of MSCV integrants are shown in Fig. 2B where the expression pattern of each MSCV integrant over the course of the experiment is displayed. For some integrants, GFP expression was observed in either none or all of the cells within each clonal population, indicating complete silencing or maintenance of expression by those integrants, respectively (see Fig. 2B, MSCV clones 4 and 14). The remaining integrants (∼40% for all of the vectors excluding MFG) exhibited variegated expression in that GFP was observed in only a fraction of the cells within each clonal population (see Fig. 2B, MSCV clone 6). This result is similar to that previously observed for a MMLV-based vector in a murine fibroblast cell line when several transduced clones were analyzed for proviral expression (11.Hoeben R.C. Migchielsen A.A. van der Jagt R.C. van Ormondt H. van der Eb A.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 904-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all of the vectors, the expression pattern and mean fluorescence intensity of GFP observed for each clone at 2 weeks post-transduction were maintained through subsequent time points with limited variability and no trends of diminishing percentages of GFP-positive cells were evident among individual clones (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Thus, the small degree of variability observed between time points for many of the integrants does not represent progressive silencing following the 2-week time point. Contribution of CpGs in the LTR to Retroviral Silencing— The expression patterns of all of the integrants for each vector are displayed in Fig. 3, enabling comparison between vectors in their overall transcriptional activities. A difference was apparent between MSCV and the M-U3/R mutant in how individual integrants were distributed according to the percentage of GFP-positive cells within each clonal population. Individual integrants were categorized as silenced (0–5% GFP-positive cells), variegated (5–75% GFP-positive cells), or sustained (75–100% GFP-positive cells), and the overall silencing frequency of each vector was statistically compared with the unmodified MSCV vector at each time point as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Table I). The majority of MFG integrants were completely silenced with 24/32 MFG integrants (75%) completely silenced on at least two of the three time points. Only one MFG integrant (3%) exhibited a sustained pattern on two of the three points, and three (9%) displayed a variegated pattern on all three time points. For MSCV, 30 of 57 integrants (53%) displayed a sustained pattern on at least two time points. Nine integrants (16%) were completely silenced, and the remaining integrants were variegated. For the M-U3/R vector, 30 of 48 integrants (63%) exhibited a sustained expression pattern on at least two time points. Most importantly, no completely silenced integrants were observed for the M-U3/R vector at the 4- and 10-week time points and only two (4%) were observed at the 2-week time point. Statistical comparison between the M-U3/R and unmodified MSCV vectors by χ-squared analysis showed that the frequency of MSCV silencing was reduced significantly by mutation of CpG dinucleotides in both U3 and R regions combined (p ≤ 0.05 at 4 and 10 weeks). These data are direct evidence for a causal contribution of cytosine methylation in the LTR to MSCV silencing in murine ES cells. Furthermore, failure of CpG mutations in the U3 or R region alone to reduce the silencing frequency to a significant extent suggests that methylation density across the LTR is important in MSCV silencing.Table IThe silencing frequency among individual MSCV proviral integrants was significantly reduced by mutation of CpGs in the MSCV LTRVectorTimeNo. of silenced (%)No. of variegated (%)No. of sustained (%)P values (vs. WT)wksnMFG225 (78)6 (19)1 (3)320.000424 (75)8 (25)0 (0)320.0001019 (59)12 (38)1 (3)320.000MSCV27 (13)21 (38)27 (49)551.00047 (12)20 (35)30 (53)571.000109 (16)20 (35)28 (49)571.000M-U323 (5)30 (46)32 (49)650.24743 (5)24 (37)38 (58)650.303104 (6)19 (29)42 (65)650.120M-R29 (12)35 (45)33 (43)770.70447 (9)36 (47)33 (43)760.3601011 (14)34 (44)32 (42)770.567M-U3/R22 (4)18 (39)26 (57)460.32640 (0)20 (42)28 (58)480.042100 (0)18 (38)30 (63)480.015 Open table in a new tab Variegated Expression: a Reversible and Transient Silenced State—The variegated expression patterns observed for many of the integrants at 2 weeks post-transduction was stable through subsequent time points with limited variability between time points in the fraction of GFP-positive cells within each clonal population (Fig. 2B). The variegated phenotype could represent an early irreversible silencing event, loss of provirus in a fraction of cells within each clonal population, or a transient state of silencing in which transcriptional activity of the same proviral integrant varies stochastically between cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, GFP-positive and negative cells were sorted from six variegated MSCV clones, re-plated separately into culture, and monitored for GFP expression for 20 days. An irreversible silencing event or loss of provirus in a fraction of cells in a clonal population would be indicated by complete maintenance of the silenced state in the sorted GFP-negative population. Conversely, a reversible transient state of silencing would be indicated by re-establishment of the original variegated pattern in both GFP-negative and positive populations. For each MSCV clone tested, variegated expression patterns were re-established from both GFP-positive and GFP-negative sorted populations within 7 days of sorting and were stable through 20 days. The data for MSCV clone six are displayed in Fig. 4. At day 7 following the sort, GFP-positive and negative cells were again sorted from the variegated cultures that were re-established from the initial sort and re-plated separately as before. Again, variegated expression patterns were re-established in both GFP-positive and negative populations by 7 days and stable through 15 days (Fig. 4). Purity of the sorted populations was confirmed by FACS analysis immediately after the secondary sort (Fig. 4). These data show that the variegated expression patterns reflect a reversible transient state of silencing that is a property of the genomic site of integration. Furthermore, the large fraction of integrants exhibiting this pattern (∼40% for all of the vectors excluding MFG) identifies variegated expression as a significant component of silencing observed in nonclonal retroviral transductions in undifferentiated ES cells. Establishment and Maintenance of Retroviral Silencing: Dependence on DNA Methylation, Histone Deacetylation, and Replication—To determine the involvement of cytosine methylation or histone deacetylation in maintaining the completely silenced and variegated states, subsets of clones for each vector were treated at 10 weeks post-transduction with either 5-azadC or TSA for 4 days. Both 5-azadC and TSA were used at maximal concentrations, which in independent titration experiments (data not shown) resulted in greater than 75% cell viability and had no effect on the proliferation rate of ES cells for up to 8 days. For all of the vectors, only modest re-activation was observed for some integrants using either agent with changes in GFP expression that appeared within the small range of variability among time points. Data for the treated MSCV clones are displayed in Fig. 5 and are characteristic of data obtained for the other vectors. To confirm that proviral DNA was demethylated by the 5-azadC treatment, nine MSCV proviral integrants were analyzed for cytosine methylation in the LTRs before and after 5-azadC treatment by bisulfit"
https://openalex.org/W2040523542,"Nurr1 is a transcription factor essential for the development of ventral dopaminergic neurons. In search for regulatory mechanisms of Nurr1 function, we identified the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, PIASγ, as an interaction partner of Nurr1. Overexpressed PIASγ and Nurr1 co-localize in the nuclei of transfected cells, and their interaction is demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. Co-expression of PIASγ with Nurr1 results in a potent repression of Nurr1-dependent transcriptional activation of an artificial NGFI-B response element (NBRE) reporter as well as of a reporter driven by the native tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. We identified two consensus sumoylation sites in Nurr1. The substitution of lysine 91 by arginine in one SUMO site enhanced the transcriptional activity of Nurr1, whereas the substitution of lysine 577 by arginine in the second SUMO site decreased transcriptional activity of Nurr1. Interestingly, PIASγ-induced repression of Nurr1 activity does not require the two sumoylation sites, because each mutant is repressed as efficiently as the wild type Nurr1. In addition, the mutations do not alter Nurr1 nuclear localization. Finally, we provide evidence that Nurr1 and PIASγ co-exist in several nuclei of the rodent central nervous system by demonstrating the co-expression of Nurr1 protein and PIASγ mRNA in the same cells. In conclusion, our studies identified PIASγ as a transcriptional co-regulator of Nurr1 and suggest that this interaction may have a physiological role in regulating the expression of Nurr1 target genes.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) 1The abbreviations used are: NR, nuclear receptor; LBD, ligand-binding domain; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NBRE, NGFI-B (nerve growth factor-inducible B protein) response element; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; DAT, dopamine transporter; SRC, steroid receptor co-activator; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; PIAS, protein inhibitors of activated STAT; hPIAS, human PIAS; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; ISH, in situ hybridization; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. are a family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes essential for development, reproduction, and homeostasis. NRs can be divided into two major groups: classical steroid/thyroid receptors, which activate transcription in a ligand-dependent manner, and or- phan receptors, for which the corresponding ligands are either unknown or activate transcription in a ligand-independent manner. Nurr1 (NR4A2, RNR-1, TINUR, HZF-3) is an orphan NR with a close structural relationship to the orphan receptors Nur77 (NR4A1, NGFI-B, TR3, NAK-1) and NOR-1 (NR4A1, MINOR, TEC). Nurr1, Nur77, and NOR-1 form the Nur subfamily and, unlike most NRs, are products of immediate early genes (1.Law S.W. Conneely O.M. DeMayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and function as constitutively active transcription factors (2.Paulsen R.F. Granas K. Johnsen H. Rolseth V. Sterri S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Accordingly, recent crystal structure study has shown that the Nurr1 ligand-binding domain (LBD) lacks a ligand-binding cavity (3.Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Nurr1, as well as the other Nur family members, binds as a monomer to the DNA recognition element, NGFI-B response element (NBRE), which consists of the classical estrogen receptor half-site preceded by two adenines (AAAGGTCA) (4.Wilson T. Fahrner T. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In addition, Nur factors can bind as either homo- or heterodimers formed among subfamily members to NurRE (everted repeats of a related NBRE) elements (5.Maira M. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nurr1 and Nur77 (but not NOR-1) can heterodimerize with RXR and bind DR-5 elements (6.Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 7.Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Mitsiadis T. Olson L. Perlmann T. Mol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Nurr1 shares with other NRs the same structural/functional motifs, consisting of a DNA-binding domain (DBD), an LBD, and two transactivating domains. One transactivating domain (AF1) is located in the amino terminus and is structurally divergent among NRs, whereas the other transactivating domain (AF2) is evolutionary conserved among NRs and contains the LBD. Nurr1 acting as a monomer through the NBRE site promotes constitutive transcriptional activation that is dependent on the two transactivating functions, AF1 and AF2 (2.Paulsen R.F. Granas K. Johnsen H. Rolseth V. Sterri S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9.Castro D.S. Arvidsson M.B.M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nurr1 is essential for the genesis and differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (10.Zetterström R. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B. Olson L. Perlmann T. Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 11.Castillo S. Baffi J. Palkovits M. Goldstein D. Kopin I. Witta J. Magnuson M. Nikodem V. Mol. Cell.

A. 1998; 95: 4013-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Thus, mice lacking Nurr1 are devoid of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Based on this evidence, several investigators have suggested that the genes encoding tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, and the dopamine transporter (DAT), both of which are expressed in differentiated dopaminergic neurons, are Nurr1 target genes. Consistently, TH and DAT genes harbor NBRE elements in their promoters (13.Schimmel J.J. Crews L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Chikaraishi D.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 74: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14.Iwawaki T. Kohno K. Kobayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Brain Res. 1999; 10: 167-174Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and several reports show that Nurr1 regulates the expression of both genes in transcriptional assays performed in cell lines as well as in primary cultures (14.Iwawaki T. Kohno K. Kobayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16.Sacchetti P. Mitchell T.R. Granneman J.G. Bannon M.J. J.

The transcriptional activity of NRs relies not only on their ability to enter the nucleus and bind the DNA but also on their interaction with other transcription factors as well as with a number of co-regulator protein complexes (reviewed in Ref. 18.Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Co-factors that regulate Nur family member-dependent transactivation have recently begun to be elucidated. For instance, it has been shown that Nur77 transcriptional activity is regulated by ASC-2 and the co-repressor SMRT/NcoR (19.Sohn Y.C. Kwak E. Na Y. Lee J.W. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43734-43739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and by the steroid receptor co-activator 2 (SRC-2) (20.Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Less is known about how Nurr1 transcriptional activity is regulated. Recently, it was reported that the transcriptional activity induced by both Nurr1 and Nur77 homodimers on a Nur response element is enhanced by the recruitment of SRCs to the AF1 domain (21.Maira M. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between Nurr1 and co-regulators through the AF2 has been questioned by the crystal structure study showing that Nurr1 does not have a classical binding site for co-activators (3.Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). To gain more insight into the molecular mechanism that governs Nurr1 constitutive transcriptional activating function and to identify regulatory mechanism, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using part of the Nurr1 LBD as the bait. We found that Nurr1 interacts with PIASγ, a member of the family of protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS). In vertebrates, five PIAS proteins (PIAS1/GBP, PIAS3, ARIP3/PI-ASxα, Miz/PIASxβ, and PIASγ) have been identified. Biochemical studies indicate that PIAS proteins interact directly with several transcription factors, including STATs (22.Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 23.Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Silvennoinen O. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the mechanism by which PIAS proteins regulate the activity of transcription factors is by functioning as SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-E3 ligases (27.Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-E A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28.Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In this report, we show the in vivo and in vitro interaction between Nurr1 and PIASγ. Co-expression of PIASγ with Nurr1 results in a strong inhibition of Nurr1-dependent transcriptional activation of an artificial NBRE-driven reporter as well as of the rat TH-driven reporter. We identified two consensus sumoylation (ΦKXE (30.Rodríguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar)) domains in Nurr1. The point mutation of Lys91 in Nurr1 induces a significant increase in Nurr1-dependent transcriptional activation, whereas the point mutation of Lys577 in Nurr1 decreases transcriptional activation mediated by Nurr1. Finally, we give evidence showing the co-existence of these proteins in neurons in the adult central nervous system of rodents. Taken together, these results show that PIASγ is an interacting partner of Nurr1 and suggest that the sumoylation of Nurr1 may act as a regulatory mechanism in the control of Nurr1-mediated transcription over its target genes. Two-hybrid Screening—LexA-Nurr1-(363–488) was transformed into L-40 together with an 11-day embryonic mouse cDNA library fused to a Gal4 activation domain (Clontech). Library screening was carried out by using HIS3 and LacZ reporters as described previously (31.Andrés M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Clones interacting with Nurr1 were identified by growth on selective medium in the presence of 5 mm 3-aminotriazole and confirmed by assaying for β-galactosidase activity. Specificity of the interaction was examined by a mating assay between the positive L-40 transformants and an AMR-70 strain expressing either LexA-Nurr1-(363–488) or the unrelated LexA-laminin fusion protein. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (32.Dodou E. Treisman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1848-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Positively interacting clones were characterized by sequencing analysis. Plasmid Constructions—A full-length epitope-tagged hemagglutinin (HA)-Nurr1 was created by cloning a PCR product into the pCGN expression vector using a rat Nurr1 cDNA as a template (kindly donated by G. Xing). Point mutations K91R and K577R were generated in Nurr1 by overlapping PCR, and the mutated fragments were introduced into pCGN-Nurr1 by using XbaI/PstI to create the HA epitope-tagged Nurr1Nmut and into pCGN by using XbaI/SmaI sites to create the HA epitope-tagged Nurr1Cmut. For K91R mutant, the following oligonucleotides were used: sumo91-1F, 5′-gctctagaatgccttgtgttcaggcg-3′; sumo91-1R, 5′-gcatctgaatgtcttctaccctaatggaggactgctg-3′; sumo91-2F, 5′-cagcagtcctccattagggtagaagacattcagatgc-3′; sumo91-2R, 5′-cgatgcgtggccgatctgcaggccc-3′. Oligonucleotides used to generate K577R mutant were: sumo577-1F, 5′-gctctagaatgccttgtgttcaggcg-3′; sumo577-1R, 5′-ggtggtaccaagtcttccaatctcaggtagaaaatgc-3′; sumo577-2F, 5′-gcattttctacctgagattggaagacttggtaccacc-3′; and sumo577-2R, 5′-gacgtgcatgggagaaagtc-3′. The changed bases coding for the substitution of lysine by arginine are bolded. The cloning of a PCR product into the pCS2+MT expression vector created an in-frame Myc-tagged C-Nurr1-(363–598). Myc-N-Nurr1-(1–354) was generated by cloning a PCR fragment in-frame with Myc at the carboxyl end using the pcDNA3.1(–) MycHis vector (Clontech). Myc-Nurr1-(1–583) was created by subcloning a BamHI/KpnI Nurr1 fragment into Myc-N-Nurr1. LexA-Nurr1-(363–488) was generated by subcloning a PCR-generated fragment into pSST91 vector using standard cloning procedures. Generation of a human full-length HA-hPIASγ was performed by subcloning pcDNA3.1-PIASγ cDNA (kindly donated by F. White) into the pCGN expression vector. GST-PIASγ, was generated by subcloning the KpnI/HindIII of pcDNA3.1-PIASγ fragment (amino acids 1–158) in-frame into the BamHI-blunt site of pGEX4T3. All PCR products were generated using pfu DNA polymerase and fully sequenced to verify the frame and fidelity of the sequences. The NBRE-3X-tk-Luciferase reporter contains three NBRE elements (kindly donated by T. Perlmann). The pCAT1.0TH reporter vector was created by subcloning 1.0-kb fragment from 4.5THpaL (kindly donated by D. Chikaraishi) into pCATbasic (Promega). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Total extracts from transfected HEK293 cells were obtained by lysing cells in lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1mm Na3VO4). 1-mg protein aliquots of the extracts were pre-cleared by rotation at 4 °C for 5 h with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (KPL) plus 4 μg of preimmune rabbit IgG. The extracts were then recovered by centrifugation and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of the appropriate polyclonal antibodies. Samples were then added to 20 μl of fresh protein G-agarose beads and immunoprecipitated by rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. Finally, after extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in loading sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GST Pulldown Assays—COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-Nurr1 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, whole extracts were prepared as described in the previous paragraph. GST or GST-PIASγ-(1–158) proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 following induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h at 28 °C. Cells were sonicated, and proteins were clarified following the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). 200-μl aliquots of the bacterial lysates were then added to 80 μl of glutathione-agarose beads. For binding assays, GST-PIASγ fusion protein or GST alone (1.5 μg) bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with 50 μl of the COS-1 cell whole extracts (65 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the retained proteins were eluted with sample buffer and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were incubated with polyclonal anti-Nurr1 (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the reactive bands were visualized using anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by ECL chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence assays were performed as described (33.Grimes J.A. Nielsen S.J. Battaglioli E. Miska E.A. Speh J.C. Berry D.L. Atouf F. Holdener B.C. Mandel G. Kouzarides T. J.

In brief, HEK293 or COS-1 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and transfected with HA and Myc epitope-tagged expression constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 10 min, permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS (PBST), and incubated for 1 h in 5% nonfat powdered milk in PBST. Coverslips were then incubated overnight in a 1:500 dilution of polyclonal anti-Myc, monoclonal anti-HA or polyclonal anti-Nurr1 antibodies. After washing, cells were incubated in Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes). Cells were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence or confocal microscopy. Mammalian Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 and PC12 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.125 μg of the NBRE-3X-tk-Luciferase reporter gene, whereas PC12 cells were transfected with a chloramphenicol acethyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene driven by a 1.0-kb TH promoter. The reporters were transfected together with 0.5 μg of recombinant HA epitope-tagged Nurr1, Nurr1Nmut, or Nurr1Cmut or an equimolar amount of the empty pCGN vector plus either 0.5–2 μg of HA-hPIASγ (or pcDNA-PIASγ) or an equimolar amount of the empty vector (pCGN or pcDNA). A reporter gene expressing the β-galactosidase cDNA driven by cytomegalovirus promoter was cotransfected (20 ng) in all experiments as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding pBluescript SR (Stratagene). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Luciferase (34.Hagerty T. Morgan W. Elango N. Strong R. J.

Statistical analyses were performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. In Situ Hybridization (ISH) and Immunohistochemistry—Adult male mice were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate and then killed by perfusion through the left cardiac ventricle with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 9.5. Brains were removed from the skull, cut in blocks, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and finally maintained in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer containing 0.9% NaCl (PBS) for 48 h at 4 °C. Cryostat serial brain coronal sections (30 μm) were collected and washed three times in PBS to be processed for ISH and immunohistochemistry. An oligonucleotide probe of 40 nucleotides (5′-gctctgcactcttcttggcatagcgagtctcatacagctc-3′) complementary to nucleotides 389–428 of the mouse PIASγ cDNA was used for ISH studies of PIASγ mRNA expression in adult rodent brain. The probe was 3′ end-labeled with digoxygenin-dUTP by using terminal transferase. ISH was carried out essentially as described previously (36.Andrés M.E. Gysling K. Araneda S. Venegas A. Bustos G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following ISH, tissue sections were rinsed with SSC (2× and 1×) for 10 min each at 55 °C. The immunohistochemical detection of Nurr1-like epitopes was carried out as follows. After ISH was completed, tissue sections were blocked (3% goat normal serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) and then incubated with anti-Nurr1 antibody (1:1000) overnight at room temperature. Sections were rinsed twice for 10 min in PBS and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Then the slices were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:200, Molecular Probes) for 1 h in the dark to detect Nurr1 epitopes, together with the anti-digoxygenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) to detect the specific hybrids. Finally, ISH reactions were further revealed by incubating with Fast Red solution (one Fast Red tablet (Roche Applied Science) was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at room temperature. After additional rinsing, the slides were mounted in 90% glycerol diluted in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, cover-slipped, and examined by confocal microscope. A series of control experiments was performed using substrates for light microscopy, essentially as described previously by our group (36.Andrés M.E. Gysling K. Araneda S. Venegas A. Bustos G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37.Ojeda V. Fuentealba J.A. Galleguillos D Andrés M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 73: 686-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PIASγ Interacts with Nurr1—To identify proteins that might regulate Nurr1 transactivation activity, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening. The bait was selected after control experiments performed to determine the transcriptional activity of several segments of Nurr1 in yeast (data not shown). Because the full-length LBD (amino acids 363–598) of Nurr1 resulted transcriptionally active, a shorter fragment, LexA-Nurr1-(363–488), which is transcriptionally inactive in yeast (fig 1A), was used as the bait in the genetic screening, together with a mouse embryonic Gal4 activation domain cDNA library. A screening of 7.3 × 106 clones yielded 20 positive clones, from which 5 were sequenced. Four of the 5 clones sequenced represented the same cDNA, encoding a 162-amino acid open reading frame. A search of the GenBank™ data base revealed that the isolated cDNAs were identical to the cDNA encoding the mouse PIASγ protein from amino acids 2–144, plus a divergent 19-amino acid tail (Fig. 1B). A mouse expressed sequence tag sequence (GenBank™ accession number BB615867) was identical over all the open reading frame, suggesting that the clones found in the two-hybrid assay corresponded to a spliced variant of PIASγ. The specificity of the interaction between Nurr1 and PIASγ was examined, as shown in Fig. 1C, by re-transforming the 4 clones encoding PIASγ found in the screening along with the bait in yeast, which gave strong positive interaction. The bait did not interact with pGAD-HSP70 fusion protein in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1C). A mating assay in the AMR70 yeast line gave similar results; the bait interacted strongly with clone 32, whereas it did not show interaction with LexA-laminin (data not shown). Nurr1 and PIASγ Interact in Vitro and in Vivo—The interaction between Nurr1 and PIASγ observed in the yeast was confirmed in mammalian cells using two approaches. In the first approach, the interaction between Nurr1 and PIASγ was demonstrated by using a GST pulldown assay. Whole extracts from COS-1 cells transfected with HA-Nurr1 were incubated with GST-PIASγ (amino acids 1–158) or GST alone. Nurr1 protein associated specifically with GST-PIASγ as shown in Western blots performed with eluted proteins from the columns (Fig. 2A). In the second approach, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using extracts from HEK293 cells overexpressing HA-hPIASγ and Myc-C-Nurr1. HA epitopes were present in immunoprecipitates using the anti-Myc polyclonal antibody but not the preimmune IgG (Fig. 2B), indicating the specific interaction between Nurr1 and PIASγ in cells. Finally, immunofluorescent detection of HA and Nurr1 epitopes in COS-1 cells transfected with Myc-Nurr1 (1–583) and HA-hPIASγ showed that these two proteins co-localize in the nucleus (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results are consistent with the experiments performed in yeast demonstrating the interaction between Nurr1 and PIASγ. PIASγ Represses Nurr1-dependent Transactivation—The finding that PIASγ interacts with Nurr1 suggest that PIASγ could function as a co-regulator of Nurr1. To test this hypothesis, functional experiments were performed in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, co-expression of HA-hPIASγ inhibited significantly the transactivation of the NBRE-3X-tk-luciferase reporter induced by Nurr1 in HEK293 cells. The inhibitory effect induced by PIASγ was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3, A and B), and it was not due to a decrease of Nurr1 expression (Fig. 3B). The presence of PIASγ did not change the basal activity significantly. Several investigators have suggested that TH, the limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, is one of the target genes of Nurr1. To analyze the effect of PIASγ on a physiological target of Nurr1, a 1.0-kb TH promoter driving a CAT reporter was transfected in PC12 cells together with Nurr1 with or without PIASγ. As shown in Fig. 3C, Nurr1 induces the transcription of the TH-driven CAT reporter. This effect was significantly inhibited by PIASγ. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PIASγ represses the constitutive transactivation activity induced by Nurr1 and suggest that PIASγ may contribute to the regulation of Nurr1-mediated TH transcription. Mutation of Consensus SUMO Domains in Nurr1 Changes Its Transcriptional Activity—It has been demonstrated that PIASγ functions as a SUMO-E3 ligase. In Nurr1, two consensus sites for SUMO conjugation were identified, with critical lysines localized at positions 91 and 577. To test whether the Nurr1 SUMO consensus domains participate in Nurr1 transcriptional activity and/or cellular localization, we generated two mutant forms of Nurr1 (as shown in Fig. 4A), one in which the lysine 91 was replaced with an arginine (K91R) and another in which lysine 577 was replaced with an arginine (K577R). Using these constructs in co-transfection experiments, we observed that the Nurr1 mutants behave in opposite ways in transcriptional assays. Thus, although the K91R mutant increases the transcription activity significantly as compared with wild type Nurr1, K577R mutant loses about 50% of the Nurr1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4B). The ability of K91R mutant to increase transcriptional activation as compared with wild type Nurr1 suggests that sumoylation at Lys91 might normally repress"

These programs of gene expression are executed by activation of neuron-specific genes in neuronal cells and their repression in non-neuronal cells. Such co-ordinate regulation requires that individual activators and repressors regulate transcription from specific subsets of their potential target genes, yet we know little of the mechanisms that underlie this selective process. The RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is a repressor that is proposed to silence transcription of numerous neuron-specific genes in non-neuronal cells via recruitment of two independent histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing co-repressor complexes. However, in vivo, REST appears to be an obligate silencer for only a minority of RE-1-bearing genes. Here we examine the interaction of REST, Co-REST, Sin3A, HDAC1, and HDAC2 with two archetypical endogenous target genes, the M4 muscarinic receptor and the sodium type II channel (NaV1.2) genes. We find that these genes are present in distinct chromosomal domains. The NaV1.2 gene is actively transcribed but repressed by REST independently of histone deacetylation or DNA methylation and does not co-localize with epigenetic markers of silence, including dimethylation of H3K9 and HP1. In contrast, the M4 gene is maintained in a silent state independently of REST and co-localizes with dimethylated H3K9 and HP1α and HP1γ, characteristic of silenced or senescent euchromatic DNA. This contrasts with the coordinate REST-dependent regulation of this locus reported previously. Taken together, we infer that distinct repressor complexes and mechanisms are operative at particular loci even in cell lines derived from a common embryological origin.

Transcriptional repression is a principal means by which developmental programs of gene expression are established. This is manifestly clear in the differentiation of the vertebrate nervous system where repressive mechanisms are employed at all stages of neural development including neurogenesis (1.Ohtsuka T.

An emerging theme in transcriptional regulation is the diversity of co-repressor platforms that may be recruited by individual repressors. This diversity has the potential to expand the repertoire of transcriptional regulation directed by individual repressors and may be especially pertinent to phenotypically complex tissues exemplified by the vertebrate nervous system. In this study, we explore this notion using the RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) 1The abbreviations used are: REST, RE-1 silencing transcription factor; E, embryonic day; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; HA, hemagglutinin; ChIP, chromosomal immunoprecipitation; DBD, DNA binding domain; AdV, adenovirus; RT, reverse transcriptase.

Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). This transcription factor has been proposed to play an important role in establishing and maintaining expression of neuron-specific genes. This multizinc finger protein interacts with a 23-bp RE-1 cis-element, also known as the neuron-restrictive silencer element. The RE-1 was originally identified as a silencer element in the 5′-flanking regions of the SCG10 and NaV1.2 channel genes (6.Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 7.Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and was proposed to be responsible for restricting expression of these genes to the nervous system. Since then, REST has been shown to repress (and, in some cases, activate) expression of at least 30 genes (8.Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), including those encoding the SCG10 (7.Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies have shown that REST is expressed in most non-neural tissues throughout embryonic development and into adulthood. In contrast, in the developing nervous system, REST is transiently expressed by neuroepithelial cells but appears to be extinguished upon terminal differentiation (4.Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Arai J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 5.Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). All of these early observations were consistent with the role of REST as a global silencer of neuron-specific gene expression outside of the nervous system. However, several observations are inconsistent with this notion. First, mice lacking REST do not show widespread ectopic expression of all RE-1-containing genes but do show numerous malformations in both epithelial and mesenchymal tissue by E9.5 and die at E11.5 (16.Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Of several RE-1-bearing genes, including neuronal class III tubulin, SCG10, L1, synapsin, calbindin, and middle neurofilament (NF-M), only βIII tubulin was found to be de-repressed. Analysis was complicated by the fact that many RE-1-bearing genes were not expressed in the wild type at the point of embryonic lethality in the knockout mouse. Thus it was possible that continued silence in the homozygous knockout was due to absence of appropriate transcriptional activators. Infection of chick myotome with a viral vector carrying a dominative negative REST construct led to de-repression of two further RE-1-bearing genes, NgCAM and SCG10, each in a specific manner. However, no de-repression of middle neurofilament was observed (16.Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Although usually associated with repression, recruitment of REST can also lead to activation of gene expression. This can be seen from the repression of NaV1.2 expression in Xenopus neural stripes upon injection of a dominant-negative REST constructs into two-cell stage embryos (17.Armisen R. Fuentes R. Olguin P. Cabrejos M.E. Kukuljan M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8347-8351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that REST acts as a repressor but not silencer of neuronal gene expression (18.Wood I.C. Belyaev N.D. Bruce A.W. Jones C. Mistry M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations can be placed in a wider context when it is considered that mining of the human genome sequence reveals the full repertoire of RE-1-bearing genes in the human genome to be in excess of 800 (44.Lunyak V.V. Burgess R. Prefontaine G.G. Nelson C. Sze S.H. Chenoweth J. Schwartz P. Pevzner P.A. Glass C. Mandel G. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2002; 298: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). 2A. W. Bruce, I. J. Donaldson, I. C. Wood, S. A. Yerbury, A. Kel, M. Chapman, M. I. Sadowski, B. Cöttgens, and N. J. Buckley, manuscript submitted. Taken together, these observations all indicate that, in vivo, RE-1-bearing genes do not show a uniform response to REST. How does this selectivity arise? The ability to interact with and act upon a select subset of target genes must underpin the transcriptional programs driven by any individual transcription factor in any one cell at any one time, but little is known of how this selectivity is achieved. In principle, selectivity could be achieved at several distinct levels, including access of the transcription factor to its DNA recognition element, recruitment of co-factors and ancillary transcription factors, or response of the general transcription machinery. Several studies have examined the mechanism of REST-mediated repression. An N-terminal repression domain of REST interacts with a Sin3-containing co-repressor complex (19.Roopra A. Sharling L.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal recruits a distinct co-repressor complex that contains Co-REST (22.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and a high mobility group-containing component, BRAF35 (23.Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R.

Both co-repressor complexes contain histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 that are required for repression of transcription. In the present study we have used two prototypical RE-1 target genes, the M4 muscarinic receptor gene and the NaV1.2 gene, to examine the mechanism of REST-mediated repression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we show that these two targets differ in their ability to interact with REST, Sin3, Co-REST, and HDACs and that this difference is reflected in the epigenetic markers present at the chromatin of the target genes. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—JTC-19 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, streptomycin (10 g/liter), and penicillin (10 g/liter). TSA treatments were carried out by supplementing growth media with 100 nm TSA for 24 h. Transfections—All transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adenoviral delivery was affected by using high titer stocks (1011-1012 plaque-forming units/ml) at a dilution of 1:1,000 to 1:10,000. Infection was close to 100% as adjudged by green fluorescent protein fluorescence. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection or infection. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed according to established protocols (25.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 26.Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 8–10 min, after which fixation was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were suspended in IP lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by extensive shaking with acid-washed glass beads. Cell extracts were removed from the glass beads by puncturing the bottoms of the Eppendorf tubes containing both beads and extracts, and the extract was rapidly spun into a fresh Eppendorf tube. Sonication of the cell extract was performed four times at 15-s pulses with microprobe at 40–50% output and 70% duty cycle. To minimize foaming of the solution, sonications were performed in glass tubes in a total extract volume not less than 2 ml. Under these conditions DNA fragments with an average size of 500–700 bp were obtained. Sonicated extracts were precleared with blocked protein G-Sepharose and incubated by overnight rotation with 1 μg of primary antibodies at 4 °C followed by 1 h with Protein G-Sepharose. Beads were spun at 10,000 × g for 30 s and washed sequentially with increasing concentrations of salts and nonionic detergents. Finally, beads were eluted with 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3. Both unbound and bound fractions were de-cross-linked by incubation at 65 °C for 6–8 h. De-cross-linked samples were treated with RNase and Proteinase K, and DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and amplified using Taq polymerase. A rabbit antisera was generated against REST using C-terminal peptide as immunogen. Anti-HDAC1, anti-HDAC2, anti-Sin3A, and anti-HA were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-Co-REST antibody was a kind gift from Gail Mandel (Stony Brook, NY). Anti-HP1α and anti-HP1γ were obtained from Serotec and Upstate, respectively. RNA Analysis—RNA was extracted from cells using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was treated with RQ DNase (Promega) prior to reverse transcription with H-MMLV-RT (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified using Taq polymerase (Promega). REST, Sin3A, Co-REST, and HDAC1/2 Are Present at the RE-1s of Both the NaV1.2 and M4 Genes on Transiently Transfected Templates—RT/PCR analysis showed that the REST-expressing cell line, JTC-19, does not express the M4 gene but do express low, but clearly detectable levels of NaV1.2 (see Fig. 4 below). We first sought to verify that reporter genes, containing M4 and NaV1.2 RE-1s, were repressed by REST in JTC-19 cells. For this purpose, reporter genes containing RE-1 elements derived from the human M4 and NaV1.2 genes were cloned upstream of the minimal NaV1.2 promoter. Fig. 1 shows that luciferase activity is 2- to 3-fold lower in reporter gene constructs containing an RE-1 than in the empty vector. Furthermore, TSA relieved repression to a level similar to that seen with the minimal promoter and induced a higher incremental increase in luciferase activity in RE-1-containing reporter genes than those lacking a RE-1. This is a similar fold sensitivity as reported in other RE-1 reporter gene assays (19.Roopra A. Sharling L. Wood I.C. Briggs T. Bachfischer U. Paquette A.J. Buckley N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20.Naruse Y. Aoki T. Kojima T. Mori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13691-13696Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Hence REST interacts with the RE-1 of M4 and NaV1.2 reporter genes and represses transcription in a TSA-sensitive manner for both promoters. Interestingly, the NaV1.2 RE-1 was more effective at repressing transcription from the minimal NaV1.2 promoter than was the M4 RE-1. These data mirror earlier results obtained using Neuro2A cells (19.Roopra A. Sharling L. Wood I.C. Briggs T. Bachfischer U. Paquette A.J. Buckley N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data show that both promoters are capable of interacting with the general transcription apparatus in these cells and that the silence of the endogenous M4 promoter is not due to an inability to interact with components of the transcriptional machinery.Fig. 1The M4 and NaV1.2 promoters are regulated by TSA in transient transfection assays. JTC19 cells were transfected with M4 and NaV1.2 luciferase reporter gene constructs and treated with 100 nm TSA for 24 h. M4-RE-1 and NaV1.2RE-1 contain the RE-1 elements of the M4 and NaV1.2 genes cloned upstream of the minimal NaV1.2 promoter. Values represent the average of three independent transfections, each of which was carried out in triplicate and normalized to cotransfected cytomegalovirus-Renilla. Results are expressed as -fold activity of the minimal NaV1.2 promoter, and error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to see if REST was recruited to the RE-1 elements of the reporter genes. We distinguished signal specifically amplified from transient templates by using primer pairs derived from the pGL3 reporter vector. Fig. 2 shows that REST is recruited to the RE-1 of both M4 and NaV1.2 transient-transfected templates. Control immunoprecipitations were carried out by using an antibody directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Having established the presence of REST at the RE-1 of the transient template, we next sought to establish which members of the co-repressor apparatus were also present. Accordingly, a further series of ChIPs was carried out using antisera against Sin3A, Co-REST, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Fig. 2 shows that Sin3A, Co-REST, and HDAC1 and -2 are all recruited to both M4- and NaV1.2 RE-1-containing reporter genes, whereas at the empty vector, REST, Sin3A, and Co-REST were all absent and HDAC1 and HDAC2 were either absent or present at only very low levels. Hence, REST, Sin3A, Co-REST, and HDAC containing co-repressor platforms are all present at the RE-1 of transiently transfected templates containing the M4 and NaV1.2 promoters. The resolution of ChIP assays is clearly limited by the shear size of the DNA but, because the only difference between the reporter genes is the presence or absence of an RE-1, then it can be clearly concluded that Sin3A, Co-REST, HDAC1, and HDAC2 are all recruited by REST and not by adjacent sequence. The presence of HDAC at RE-1-containing reporter genes is entirely consistent with ability of TSA to de-repress the NaV1.2- and M4 RE-1-containing reporter genes. Furthermore, these data show that both RE-1s are capable of interacting with a complex or complexes that contains REST, Sin3A, Co-REST, HDAC1, and HDAC2. REST Is Present at the Endogenous NaV1.2 RE-1 but Not at the Endogenous M4 RE-1—Next, we carried out a further series of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to assess the interaction of REST with the RE-1 of the endogenous M4 and NaV1.2 genes. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitations were carried out in an identical manner to those used for assessing REST interaction with transient reporter templates, but PCR was carried out using primer pairs flanking the RE-1 of the chromosomal genes. In contrast to results obtained with the transiently transfected templates, these experiments showed a marked difference between the interaction of REST with the M4 gene and with the NaV1.2 gene. Whereas REST is present at the RE-1 of the NaV1.2 gene, it was not detectable at the RE-1 of the M4 gene (Fig. 3). Failure to detect a bound transcription factor by ChIP may mean that the factor needs ancillary co-factors to allow binding or that the epitope is occluded by bound co-factors. We consider that both of these explanations are unlikely, because the same sequence can be immunoprecipitated when present as a transient template in the same cells (see above). Furthermore, use of REST antibodies directed against a different epitope gave identical results (18.Wood I.C. Belyaev N.D. Bruce A.W. Jones C. Mistry M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All of these observations strongly suggest that REST is absent from the endogenous M4 locus. Sin3A and Co-REST Are Present at the Endogenous NaV1.2 RE-1 but Not at the M4 RE-1—Having shown that transiently transfected reporter genes and their chromosomal counterparts differ in their ability to bind REST, we then investigated whether there were any further differences with respect to their ability to recruit co-repressors. Again we used ChIP to detect the presence of Sin3A, Co-REST, and HDAC1/2 at these two chromosomal loci. At the M4 locus where REST is not detected, all co-repressor molecules were also not detected. However, at the NaV1.2 locus, where REST was present, Sin3A and Co-REST were also present, but surprisingly, HDAC1 and HDAC2 were absent (Fig. 3). Because HDACs were absent from both chromosomal loci, these results led us to propose that expression of both the endogenous NaV1.2 and M4 genes would be insensitive to attenuation of HDAC activity by TSA challenge. This indeed was the case. RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of neither gene was altered by 24-h treatment with 100 nm TSA (Fig. 4). This is in marked contrast to the observed activation of the corresponding reporter gene by the same treatment (see above) and demonstrates a clear difference between the co-repressor platforms recruited to transient and chromosomal templates of these two genes. REST Mediates Repression of the Endogenous NaV1.2 Gene in an HDAC-independent Manner—The presence of REST and absence of either HDAC1 and HDAC2 at the NaV1.2RE-1 combined with the lack of effect of TSA on NaV1.2 expression led us to investigate whether REST was required for NaV1.2 repression. Accordingly we infected JTC-19 cells with an adenoviral construct carrying a dominant-negative REST construct consisting of the REST DNA binding domain (AdVREST:DBD). 48 h later, RNA was harvested and analyzed. As can be seen from Fig. 5, infection led to activation of NaV1.2 expression but M4 expression was undetectable either in the absence or presence of TSA. Infection with empty adenovirus (AdV) had no effect. Clearly REST does repress NaV1.2 expression but in a manner that does not require histone deacetylase activity. The Endogenous M4 but Not the NaV1.2 Gene Is Associated with Heterochromatic Markers—Because the M4 gene appeared to be silenced in an REST-independent manner, and the NaV1.2 gene appeared to be active but repressed in an REST-dependent manner, we used ChIP to examine both genes for the presence of epigenetic makers of silenced chromatin, namely dimethylated K9H3 and HP1α and HP1γ (27.Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, H3K9 is dimethylated and HP1α and HP1γ are recruited at the M4 gene but not the NaV1.2 gene supporting the view that only the M4 gene is present in silent chromatin, whereas the NaV1.2 gene is present in open chromatin but is nevertheless repressed by REST Many studies have examined interaction of REST with its potential target genes using a combination of DNA-protein interaction assays (such as electromobility shift assays) and by monitoring expression of transiently transfected reporter genes (6.Kraner S.D.

Such studies invariably show that all bone fide RE-1s can interact with REST and that this recruitment results in repression or silencing of the reporter gene. However, it is probably more parsimonious to regard such studies as providing insight into the potential of a cis regulatory element to interact with its cognate transcription factor. Both techniques take advantage of DNA templates that are either devoid of nucleosomes or have a chromatin conformation that differs from that of their chromosomal counterparts. This difference in transcription factor accessibility between transient and chromosomal templates is well known and can be clearly seen in studies of the mouse mammary-tumor virus promoter where transiently transfected templates containing the mouse mammary-tumor virus promoter are assembled on unphased nucleosomes, and transactivation by the glucocorticoid receptor is independent of the human Brahma-related gene chromatin-remodeling complex (34.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast, the chromosomal template is packaged into a nucleosomal array and glucocorticoid receptor transactivation does require remodeling by the human Brahma-"

We show that one of these proteins (ACN-1), a unique multi-domain angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-like protein from Caenorhabditis elegans, is essential for larval development and adult morphogenesis. Green fluorescent protein-tagged ACN-1 is expressed in hypodermal cells, the developing vulva, and the ray papillae of the male tail. The hypodermal expression of acn-1 appears to be controlled by nhr-23 and nhr-25, two nuclear hormone receptors known to regulate molting in C. elegans. acn-1(RNAi) causes arrest of larval development because of a molting defect, a protruding vulva in adult hermaphrodites, severely disrupted alae, and an incomplete seam syncytium. Adult males also have multiple tail defects. The failure of the larval seam cells to undergo normal cell fusion is the likely reason for the severe disruption of the adult alae. We propose that alteration of the ancestral ACE during evolution, by loss of the metallopeptidase active site and the addition of new protein modules, has provided opportunities for novel molecular interactions important for post-embryonic development in nematodes.

The large number of protease genes in animal genomes reflects the widespread importance of proteolysis to animal physiology and development. The rich functional diversity of proteases can be attributed to the variety of catalytic mechanisms and protein structures, some of which are of a modular design, offering different levels of structural and functional complexity (1Puente X.S. Sanchez L.M. Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The MEROPS data base (merops.sanger.ac.uk; release 6.3) (2Rawlings N.D. O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) catalogs 551, 553, 563, 366, and 367 proteases for human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively. The majority of these enzymes have not been studied at the physiological and biochemical level, but it has been possible to classify most of them into families based on statistically significant similarities in primary protein structure (2Rawlings N.D. O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a significant proportion (12-25%) of the total number of the predicted protease-like genes in the human, mouse, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, and C. elegans genomes code for proteins that lack one or more catalytic residues and are therefore classified as “non-peptidase” family members. Some of these genes may be nonfunctional pseudogenes, but many have probably lost the catalytic activity of an ancestral protein while acquiring new functions. These non-peptidase proteins are structurally related to proteases distributed across all classes, but homologues of metallopeptidases are particularly well represented. One such protein is UNC-71, a C. elegans member of the ADAMs family, which lacks a zinc binding site and yet has acquired important roles in development (3Huang X. Huang P. Robinson M.K. Stern M.J. Jin Y. Development. 2003; 130: 3147-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our attention has recently been drawn to the fact that several invertebrate members of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 1The abbreviations used are: ACEangiotensin-converting enzymeGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositoldsRNAdouble-stranded RNARNAiRNA interferenceESTexpressed sequence tagGFPgreen fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: ACEangiotensin-converting enzymeGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositoldsRNAdouble-stranded RNARNAiRNA interferenceESTexpressed sequence tagGFPgreen fluorescent protein. (EC 3.4.15.1, peptidyl dipeptidase A) family from D. melanogaster and C. elegans lack crucial active site residues and are, therefore, predicted not to function as peptidases (4Isaac R.E. Siviter R.J. Stancombe P. Coates D. Shirras A.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 460-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian ACE is a cell surface zinc metallopeptidase that cleaves a C-terminal dipeptide from angiotensin I to generate the vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II (for reviews see Refs. 5Corvol P.

Bradykinin, a vasodilator, and the hemoregulatory peptide N-acetyl-SDKP are also substrates for mammalian ACE. Somatic ACE comprises two catalytic units in tandem, which are anchored to the cell surface by a transmembrane region and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. ACE knockout mice have, as expected, lower blood pressure but also have severe renal abnormalities and suffer from anemia (7Krege J.H. John S.W.M. Langenbach L.L. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R.

Bernstein K.E. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 953-965PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian testes, a single-domain ACE (germinal ACE, 100 kDa) is expressed in developing spermatids, and the lack of this isoform results in male infertility (7Krege J.H. John S.W.M.

Sperm from ACE (-/-) mice appear normal but fail to migrate beyond the extramural uterotubal junction of the oviduct of mated wild-type females, and in vitro experiments demonstrate that they have reduced binding to zonae pellucidae. The peptide substrate for the germinal enzyme has not been identified, and it has been suggested that the role of the gACE in reproduction might depend on direct molecular interactions at the cell surface rather than the hydrolysis of a peptide (7Krege J.H. John S.W.M. Langenbach L.L. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Bachman E.S. Jennette J.C. Obrien D.A. Smithies O. Nature. 1995; 375: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). A new member of the ACE family, ACE2, has recently been characterized (9Tipnis S.R. Hooper N.M. Hyde R. Karran E. Christie G. Turner A.J. J. Biol.

Although structurally similar to ACE, it is not a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, but a carboxypeptidase; it is expressed in cardiac cells, kidney, and the testes (6Turner A.J. Hooper N.M.

Four other ACE-like genes (Ance-2, -3, -4, -5) are present in the D. melanogaster genome, but all four conceptual proteins are missing one or more of the active site residues required for catalysis by human ACE (16Coates D. Isaac R.E. Cotton J. Siviter R. Williams T.A. Shirras A. Corvol P. Dive V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8963-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to flies and mammals, the nematode, C. elegans, has only one ACE-like gene (C42D8.5), which codes for an ACE-like protein lacking not only the HEXXH consensus metallopeptidase motif but also other active site residues found in the sequence HEA(I/V)XD of mammalian and insect ACEs (4Isaac R.E. Siviter R.J. Stancombe P. Coates D. Shirras A.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 460-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that the C. elegans ACE-like protein, termed ACN-1 (for ACE-like non-metallopeptidase), plays an essential role in larval molting and adult morphogenesis, probably through novel molecular interactions. ACN-1 is the first member of the ACE family of proteins to be assigned an essential role that is independent of a functional metallopeptidase active site. Nematode Culture and Transformation—The C. elegans Bristol strain (N2) was grown at 20 °C on NGM agar (1.7% (w/v) agar, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 μg ml-1 peptone, 5 μg ml-1 cholesterol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) supplemented with Escherichia coli OP50. cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis—cDNA clones yk115b3 and yk63f5, derived from a C. elegans embryonic library, and yk759d02, from an L2 stage hermaphrodite larval library, were obtained from the laboratory of Professor Y. Kohara, National Institute of Genetics, Japan. The clones were sequenced by primer walking using Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing and the data analyzed with respect to DNA sequence present in the C. elegans data base. BLAST® similarity searching was performed from the NCBI suite of programs (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The prediction of the signal peptide sequence and its cleavage site was performed using the SignalP V1.1 World Wide Web Prediction Server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ (17Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar)). The GPI Prediction Server (mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/gpi/gpi_server.html) was used to predict a potential GPI modification to the protein (18Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Glycosylation sites were predicted using NetOGlyc 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc) and NetNGlyc 1.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) prediction servers (19Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N.

Construction and Expression of the acn-1::gfp Transgene—Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene fusions were generated for ACN-1 using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique (20Hobert O. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The entire acn-1 gene and 4.9 kb of sequence immediately upstream was PCR-amplified using Expand High Fidelity Taq (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) from the cosmid C42D8 (obtained from the Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK) using oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) GATCAAGTGCATCTTCTTGTCG (C42D8, 23153-23132) and cgacctgcaggcatgcaagctCAAAGCAAAATAGATAATTAAC (C42D8, 13896-13917; the lowercase sequence is the reverse complement of GFP-5′). Following an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, the PCR comprised 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 9 min. The resultant 9.1-kb PCR product was mixed with a 1.8-kb PCR product encoding GFP, amplified from plasmid pPD95.75 (A. Fire Laboratory Vector Kit 1995, Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Baltimore, MD) using oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) GCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCG (GFP-5′) and AAGGGCCCGTACGGCCGACTAGTAGG (GFP-3′). This mixture was used as the template for PCR amplification with Expand High Fidelity Taq to generate the desired acn-1 reporter transgene. The oligonucleotides used were (5′ to 3′): a nested acn-1 promoter primer, AACGGGAAGAGTAGATGATGC (C42D8, 23058-23038), and a nested 3′ GFP primer, GGAAACAGTTATGTTTGGTATATTGGG. The PCR cycling parameters were as above with the extension time increased to 11 min. The products of this final PCR were directly microinjected into the syncytial gonad of young C. elegans adult hermaphrodites (Bristol strain, N2) together with the plasmid pRF4 (21Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar), which contains the dominant injection marker rol-6(su1006). Transformants were scored on the basis of the roller phenotype. The male expression pattern was generated by allowing hermaphrodite rollers to mate with wild-type Bristol strain (N2) males. Lines transmitting the acn-1::gfp construct were examined on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 475 nm. Images were captured using a CCD camera and Openlab 3.0.4 image capture software (Improvision Inc., Lexington MA). dsRNA Preparation and Delivery—Exon 5 of acn-1 was PCR-amplified (initial denaturation of 94 °C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) from cosmid C42D8 using Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) taatacgactcactataggGGATTCCATTTTCCGCAAC (lowercase represents T7 promoter sequence) and aattaaccctcactaaagGACAAACATCTTCTTGGTCGTGTAG (lowercase represents T3 promoter sequence). The resulting 524-bp PCR product was purified using QIA-quick PCR purification columns (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and used as the template to transcribe sense and antisense RNAs with T3 and T7 MEGAscript™ in vitro transcription kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was assembled by mixing equal amounts (5 μl) of sense and antisense RNAs followed by incubation at 68 °C for 10 min and then at 37 °C for 30 min. Annealed acn-1 dsRNA was directly injected into the syncytial gonad of young adult hermaphrodites (Bristol strain, N2). Injected animals were allowed to recover for 16 h at 20 °C in order to lay any eggs present in utero prior to injection and were then transferred onto fresh NGM agar plates. The resultant F1 progeny were assessed visually for changes in phenotype. For feeding acn-1 dsRNA, a 387-bp HindIII fragment, encompassing exon 7 to exon 9, was excised from the EST yk63f5 and subcloned into the corresponding site of plasmid pPD129.36 to generate pLS43. This construct was transformed into E. coli HT115(DE3), and expression of dsRNA was induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a mid-log phase culture (22Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). At 4 h post-induction a further 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture, and the bacteria were then seeded onto NGM agar plates containing 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The C. elegans RNAi-sensitive mutant rrf-3 (23Simmer F. Tijsterman M. Parrish S. Koushika S.P. Nonet M.L. Fire A. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1317-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) was allowed to feed at 20 °C on the dsRNA-induced bacteria, and phenotypic effects were observed. Controls were carried out in parallel using HT115(DE3) lacking pLS43 as the food source. The effect of RNAi on males was assessed by allowing rrf-3 adult males and hermaphrodites to mate on NGM agar plates containing OP50 bacteria and then transferring the L1/L2 progeny to dsRNA feeding plates as described above. To assess the effect of acn-1(RNAi)on seam cell adherens junctions, the strain SU93 (24Mohler W.A. Simske J.S. Williams-Masson E.M. Hardin J.D. White J.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1087-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was fed on bacteria expressing acn-1 dsRNA as described above. Bacterial strains used to express dsRNA targeting nhr-23 and nhr-25 were obtained from Dr. J. Ahringer (University of Oxford) (22Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Induction of dsRNA in these strains was as described above. To study the effect of silencing the nhr genes on acn-1 and ltd-1 expression in seam cells, six young adult hermaphrodites from acn-1::gfp and ltd-1::gfp transgenic lines (25Vargas J.D. Culetto E. Ponting C.P. Miguel-Aliaga I. Davies K.E. Sattelle D.B. Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were transferred to individual culture plates seeded with E. coli HT115 (DE3) either expressing nhr dsRNA or carrying no plasmid. After 3 days at 20 °C, larvae were scored for the defective cuticle phenotype and seam cell fluorescence. Because of mosaicism, not all seam cells of an individual necessarily expressed the GFP reporter. Therefore, larvae were scored even if GFP-induced fluorescence was observed in only one seam cell. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Nematodes were fixed for 2 h in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, and then washed twice with 0.1 m phosphate buffer prior to overnight fixation in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide, 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Nematodes were washed with distilled water and then dehydrated for 1 h in an ascending concentration of acetone (20-100%). Samples were critical point dried with a Polaron E3000 critical point drying apparatus using CO2 as the transition fluid and then mounted on 13-mm diameter pin stubs. Nematodes were coated with gold to a thickness of 50 nm using a Polaron freeze dryer sputter-coating unit and observed and imaged with a CamScan 3-30BM scanning electron microscope. The Primary Structure of C. elegans ACN-1—The sequencing of the full-length EST clone yk759d02 encoding ACN-1 (C42D8.5) confirmed the open reading frame predicted for this gene by the C. elegans sequencing consortium (GenBank™ accession number 25151554) (Fig. 1). The translated protein (CE30627) is 906 amino acids long with an N-terminal signal peptide that is predicted to be removed by cleavage between amino acids 19 and 20 (VFT↓QE). In comparison with human germinal ACE and Drosophila ANCE, it is evident that conserved residues (25% common identity and 46% similarity) extend along a central 600-amino acid region of ACN-1 (Fig. 1). However, the overall structure of the nematode protein differs from other single domain ACEs in several important respects. All enzymatically active ACE proteins possess the HEXXH and HEA(I/V)XD motifs. However, in ACN-1 the highly conserved amino acids within these motifs have been substituted with unrelated residues, apart from Glu-559, which is replaced with an Asp. The size of the conceptual ACN-1 is larger than the single domain human ACE and Drosophila ANCE, due in part to a N-terminal extension rich in Pro and Glu (24 residues across a region of 68 amino acids). There is also a C-terminal extension that contains a cysteine-rich region juxtaposed to a sequence rich in Pro and Thr/Ser (PTS). The PTS region has potential sites for four O-linked glycans in addition to five other predicted O-glycosylation sites distributed throughout the entire ACN-1 sequence and four potential N-glycosylation sites. The GPI Modification Site Prediction Server indicates that ACN-1 is probably attached to a GPI anchor at Ala-898 (18Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). acn-1 Is Expressed in Embryonic and Larval Hypodermis, in the Vulva during Organogenesis, and in the Ray Papillae of the Male Tail—The spatial and temporal expression pattern of acn-1 was studied by generating independent lines of transgenic C. elegans expressing a C-terminal reporter gene fusion (acn-1::gfp) under the control of the 4.9-kb promoter region immediately upstream of acn-1. Strong reporter gene expression was first observed in the hypodermal seam cells during embryogenesis and subsequently in the seam cells of all larval stages (Fig. 2, A-D). The main hypodermal syncytium, hyp7, of larvae and young adult nematodes also displayed reporter gene activity (Fig. 2B). The expression in individual seam cells was often highly punctate (Fig. 2C). Strong GFP expression was observed in the toroid cells that form the developing vulva in the L4 larval stage (Fig. 2, D and E), and expression persisted into early adulthood but was not present in the vulva of mature hermaphrodites. In addition to the hypodermal expression described above for hermaphrodites, intense reporter gene activity was also observed in the developing ray papillae of the L4 male tail (Fig. 2F). Young adult males exhibited weak expression, restricted to the hypodermis just anterior to the tail (not shown). No transgene expression was detected in the dauer larvae, but expression re-appeared ∼12 h after dauers had been transferred to a fresh lawn of E. coli. acn-1(RNAi) Causes Morphological Defects in Larvae and Adults—To investigate the physiological role of ACN-1, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to selectively silence expression of acn-1 (26Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11430) Google Scholar). The specificity of acn-1(RNAi) was confirmed by abrogation of reporter gene activity in larval hypodermal cells of the transgenic acn-1::gfp line. In initial experiments, dsRNA was injected into the gonads of young adult hermaphrodites, and the phenotype of F1 progeny was analyzed 16-40 h post-injection. Larvae arrested at the L2 stage (penetrance of around 85%) and were either trapped within the L1 cuticle or were carrying fragments of unshed cuticle at variable positions along the body of the nematode. This early lethality prevented the detection of any RNAi-induced phenotype in later larval stages and in adults. This was circumvented by feeding E. coli-expressing acn-1 dsRNA to L1/L2 larvae of an RNAi-sensitive C. elegans mutant (rrf-3) (23Simmer F. Tijsterman M. Parrish S. Koushika S.P. Nonet M.L. Fire A. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1317-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The cuticle defective phenotype was observed in L3/L4 larvae and adult nematodes with high penetrance (>95%) (Figs. 3 and 4). Nematodes fed E. coli lacking the acn-1 dsRNA plasmid showed no cuticle defects and developed normally. The failure to molt correctly resulted in larvae with two layers of cuticle, most visibly around the “neck” or tail regions (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. 4, A and C). Consistent with this observation, nematodes exhibited movement defects and apparent slower growth. Adults were generally smaller in length than wild-type nematodes, and several internal structures, particularly the pharynx, were displaced because of the constriction presumably caused by the attached L4 cuticle. The overlying unshed cuticle often sealed the anal pore, leading to severe constipation (Fig. 4B). Severe vulva defects were also observed, compromising egg laying and resulting in the “bagof-worms” phenotype. The protruding vulva, together with an ellipsoid area of adult cuticle, was exposed by the parting of the L4 cuticle around the vulva (Fig. 3C). In addition to entrapment within larval cuticle, adult males showed tail defects associated with malformation of the fan and sensory rays (Fig. 4, C and D). The adult cuticle of acn-1(RNAi) nematodes was characterized by severe deformation of the alae in sections along the lateral body wall (Fig. 3, D-F). The alae and circumferential annuli had a distinctive amorphous appearance.Fig. 4Light micrographs of adult C. elegans following acn-1(RNAi).A, old cuticle (arrow) that has not been shed remains attached to the nematode and appears as cuticular “horns.” The old and new cuticle appear to jointly form folds (arrowheads).

Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 81-122Google Scholar, 28Podbilewicz B. White J.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The integrity and fate of the L4 seam cells was studied by feeding acn-1 dsRNA to the transgenic C. elegans strain SU93. These nematodes express a GFP-tagged adherens junction protein (AJM-1), highlighting adherens junctions and thus marking the boundaries of the hypodermal cells (24Mohler W.A. Simske J.S. Williams-Masson E.M. Hardin J.D. White J.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1087-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adult SU93 nematodes displayed the same cuticle and alae defects as described above for the rrf-3 mutant strain but with reduced penetrance (around 50%). Nematodes unaffected by acn-1(RNAi) shed the L4 cuticle during the larval/adult molt to reveal alae of normal appearance. The seam cells of the unaffected adults had clearly fused to form the seam syncytium (Fig. 5). In contrast, those nematodes with defective alae had extensive regions of underlying unfused seam cells. This failure to form a complete seam syncytium in adults was more pronounced in animals showing more severe alae defects. nhr-23(RNAi) and nhr-25(RNAi) Silences Seam Cell Expression of acn-1::gfp—Both nhr-23 and nhr-25 are expressed in larval seam cells and are required for the completion of larval molts (29Kostrouchova M.

The similarity of the molting defect induced by acn-1 dsRNA to that recorded previously for nhr-23(RNAi) and nhr-25(RNAi) larvae led us to consider whether these nuclear hormone receptors are involved in regulating acn-1 expression. When nematodes carrying the acn-1::gfp transgene were fed on bacteria expressing either nhr-23 dsRNA or nhr-25 dsRNA, the frequency of larvae expressing GFP in the seam cells decreased by 56 and 44%, respectively (Table I). In these experiments, nhr-23(RNAi) and nhr-25(RNAi) larvae displayed cuticle defects with a penetrance of 40 and 29%, respectively. Control experiments were performed using ltd-1::gfp nematodes, which also express GFP in larval seam cells (25Vargas J.D. Culetto E. Ponting C.P. Mi"
https://openalex.org/W2031955371,"The human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1), confers resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer agents and transports a variety of organic anions. At present, essentially no structural data exists for MRP1 that might be used to elucidate its mechanism of transport. Consequently, we have applied a modeling strategy incorporating crystal and indirect structural data from other ABC transporters to construct a model of the transmembrane domains of the core region of MRP1 that includes the amino acid side chains. Three conserved Trp residues and one non-conserved Tyr residue, shown previously to be of functional importance (Koike, K., Oleschuk, C. J., Haimeur, A., Olsen, S. L., Deeley, R. G., and Cole, S. P. C. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 49495-49503), were found to line the ""pore"" in our model proximal to the membrane cytosol interface. A fifth aromatic residue (Phe594) was identified that, with the Trp and Tyr residues, completed a ring or ""basket"" of aromatic amino acids and, accordingly, we postulated that it would also be of functional importance. To test this idea, MRP1-Phe594 mutants were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and their properties were examined using membrane vesicles. Substitution of Phe594 with Ala substantially reduced or eliminated the transport of five organic anion substrates by MRP1 and abrogated the binding of leukotriene C4. On the other hand, the conservatively substituted F594W and F594Y mutants remained transport competent, although significant substrate- and substitution-specific changes were observed. These studies provide some structural insight into a possible substrate binding/transport site of MRP1 at the beginning of a putative substrate translocation pathway and demonstrate the usefulness of modeling for directing structure-function analyses of this transporter."

Hitherto, a plasma membrane Ca2+/H+ antiporter gene (chaA) has only been isolated from Escherichia coli (5Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In ChaA, neither an N-terminal autoinhibition domain nor a 9-amino-acid region was reported. ChaA has been shown to catalyze both Na+/H+ and Ca2+/H+ exchange reactions at alkaline pH (16Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 176: 4311-4315Crossref Google Scholar). Essentially nothing is known about molecular properties of Ca2+/H+ antiporters from other organisms, especially those on plasma membranes.Recent genome sequences of cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 suggest the presence of a single putative Ca2+/H+ antiporter gene (17Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E.

Cyanobacteria are oxygen-evolving photosynthetic prokaryotes that can acclimate to a wide range of environmental changes (20Marin K. Suzuki I. Yamaguchi K. Ribbeck K. Yamamoto H. Kanesaki Y. Hagemann M. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Waditee R. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. ..Proc. Natl.

Although the role of Ca2+ for stress responses in prokaryotic cells has not been clearly demonstrated, direct evidence of Ca2+ signaling in cyanobacteria has become available recently (22Torrecilla I. Leganes F. Bonilla I. Fernandez-Pinas F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was interesting to characterize the putative Ca2+/H+ antiporter of cyanobacteria. Here, we isolated the CAX genes from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (synCAX) and from a halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica (apCAX). It is shown that SynCAX and ApCAX are localized on plasma membranes and catalyze the efflux of Ca2+, but not of Na+. The exchange activity between Ca2+ and H+ is essential for salt tolerance at alkaline pH in which the acidic amino acid residues in TM segments are involved.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Culture Conditions—A. halophytica cells were grown photoautotropically in BG11 liquid medium plus 18 mm NaNO3 and Turk Island salt solution at 28 °C as described previously (23Ishitani M. Takabe T. Kojima K. Takabe T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 20: 693-703Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Hibino T. Kaku N. Yoshikawa H. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells were grown at 30 °C under continuous fluorescent white light (40 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) in BG11 liquid medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES-KOH and bubbled with 3% CO2. The cells with the disrupted synCAX gene were grown in the same conditions as the wild type except for supplementation with chloramphenicol (150 μg·ml-1). E. coli TO114 cells were grown at 37 °C in LBK medium or Tris-E medium (25Brockman R.W. Heppel L.A. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2554-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ampicillin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and chloramphenical were used at final concentrations of 50, 160, 30, and 30 μg ml-1, respectively.Construction of Expression Vectors for ApCAX and SynCAX—The apCAX gene was amplified from genomic DNA of A. halophytica by the primer set, ApCa/H-F1 and ApCa/H-R1. The sequences of all the primers are shown in Table I. The synCAX (slr1336) was amplified from genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by the primer set, SynCa/H-F1 and SynCa/H-R1. PCR products for apCAX and synCAX, were ligated into the EcoRV restriction site of pBSK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. The resulting plasmids were designated as pAp-CAX-SK and pSynCAX-SK, respectively. The plasmid pApCAX-SK was digested with NcoI and BamHI, whereas plasmid pSynCAX-SK was digested with BamHI. The resulting fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of pTrcHis2C (Invitrogen). The generated plasmids, pApCAX and pSynCAX, fused in-frame to six histidines at the C-terminal, were transformed first to E. coli DH5α cells and then to E. coli T0114 cells in which the nhaA, nhaB, and chaA genes were deleted (16Ohyama T.

PCC 6803 (SynNhaP1) was described previously (27Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T.

After checking the orientation of the promoter, the full length of ApCAX containing both the promoter and a His tag was amplified by the primer set, ApCa/HproF and HisBamHI, blunt-ended, and ligated into the BamHI-digested site of the E. coli/Synechococcus shuttle vector, pUC303-Bm (21Waditee R. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. ..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was used to transform Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 cells (21Waditee R. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. ..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Essentially, the same method was used for Syn-CAX. In this case, the promoter region was amplified using the primer set, SynCa/HProF and SynCa/HproR.Site-directed Mutagenesis of apCAX—Changes of amino acids, Glu-74 and Glu-324, in ApCAX to Asp, Gln, and His were carried out by the PCR method as described previously (28Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Hayakawa S. Futsuhara Y. Kawamitsu Y. Takabe T. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18373-18382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the case of Glu-74 mutants, two fragments were amplified by the primer sets, ApCa/H-F1 and E74DQH-R and E74DQH-F and ApCa/H-R, using the pApCAX-SK as the template. After removing the primer sets, two PCR-amplified fragments were mixed, heated, and annealed and were then used as the templates for amplification by the primer sets, ApCa/H-F1 and ApCa/H-R1. PCR products were ligated into the EcoRV restriction site of pBSK+ and sequenced. The mutants E74D, E74Q, and E74H were transferred to pTrcHis2C and used for the transformation of TO114. The mutants E324D, E324Q, and E324H were constructed essentially by the same method.Ca2+/H+ Antiporter Activity—TO114 cells were grown in LBK medium containing ampicillin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and chloramphenical. When the A620 reached 0.6–0.8, 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. Cells were allowed to grow for a further 3 h and then harvested by centrifugation. Everted membranes were prepared using a French press as described previously (27Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura T. Komano Y. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The antiporter activity was assayed based upon the establishment of ΔpH (TM pH gradient) by the addition of salt to the reaction mixture, which contained 10 mm Tris-Cl (titrated with HCl to the indicated pH), 140 mm choline chloride or 140 mm KCl, 1 μm acridine orange, and membrane vesicles (50–75 μg of protein) in a volume of 2 ml. The ΔpH was monitored with acridine orange fluorescence, which was obtained by excitation at 492 nm and emission at 525 nm. Before the addition of salt, Tris-dl-lactate (2 mm) was added to initiate fluorescence quenching (Q) due to respiration. Lactate energized the vesicles, which then accumulated H+ internally, causing the accumulation of dye whose fluorescence was thereby quenched. Upon the addition of salt, fluorescence increased due to the excretion of H+ by the antiporters and consequent leakage of the dye. The changes in fluorescence (ΔQ) were monitored. Then, NH4Cl was added to dissipate the ΔpH.Disruption of synCAX—The synCAX in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was disrupted by insertion of the chloramphenical resistance gene (cmlr). The DNA fragment, ∼0.8 kbp, covering cmlr was amplified by the primer set, pACYCcml-F and pACYCcml-R, using pACYC184 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as a template. The PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRV restriction site of pBSK+ and then digested with HincII and SmaI of pBSK+. The blunt-ended fragment of cmlr was ligated into the NcoI site at position 543 bp of synCAX in pSynCAXSK+, which was prepared by partial digestion with NcoI and blunting. Insertion of the cmlr cassette into the correct site was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cmlr-containing synCAX was transferred to Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 by electroporation (500 V, 48 ohms, and 125 microfarads) using an Electrocell Manipulator (model 600 M; BTX). The disrupted mutants were selected on BG11 medium containing 0.5% agar supplemented with chloramphenical at a final concentration of 150 μg/ml.Detection of Ca2+ Efflux and Membrane Potential—To prepare the Ca2+-loading cells, both the wild type and disrupted cells were incubated for 1 h with 50 mm Ca2+ in buffer A (20 mm HEPES and 140 mm KCl) at various pH values (30Tsujibo H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 154: 854-858Google Scholar, 31Nazarenko L.V. Andreev I.M. Lyukevich A.A. Pisareva T.V. Los D.A. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ca2+-loaded cells were diluted 10-fold in buffer A and then transferred to the assay medium containing Ca2+ indicator (2 ml) (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgSO4, 27 μm arsenazo III) (31Nazarenko L.V. Andreev I.M. Lyukevich A.A. Pisareva T.V. Los D.A. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ca2+ efflux from the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells was monitored by the absorbance change of arsenazo III with a Hitachi 557 spectrophotometer in double wavelength mode (650–720 nm). The plasma membrane potential of Synechocystis cells was assayed with the potential-sensitive cyanide dye diS-C3-(5) (31Nazarenko L.V. Andreev I.M. Lyukevich A.A. Pisareva T.V. Los D.A. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The assay medium (1 ml) had the same composition as that used for the detection of Ca2+ efflux, but it was supplemented with 1 μm diS-C3-(5). The fluorescence was measured by excitation at 620 nm and emission at 670 nm with a Shimadzu RF-5300PC spectrofluorophotometer.Other Methods—The nucleotide sequences were determined using an ABI310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cellular ions were determined by Shimadzu Personal Ion Analyzer PIA-1000. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis were carried out as described previously (27Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Hayakawa S. Futsuhara Y. Kawamitsu Y. Takabe T. Takabe T.

An antibody raised against His6 (His6-His tag) was obtained from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Protein was determined by Lowry's method as described (27Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll a was extracted by 90% methanol in dim light and calculated from the absorbance at 665 nm (21Waditee R.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 318-328Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For the preparation of phycobiliproteins, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cells were sonicated, streptomycin sulfate (1%) was added, and homogenate was centrifuged (32Tandeau de Marsac N. Houmard J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 318-328Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Using the resulting supernatant, the phycobiliprotein content was determined spectrophotometrically. Plasma membranes were prepared by a discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation method (33Murata N. Omata T. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 245-251Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Computer Analysis—The hydropathy profile of proteins was predicted by the computer-assisted procedure according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17009) Google Scholar). The possible TM structure of ApCAX was predicted by the computer program TopPredII (35Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 331-337PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSCloning of Putative Ca2+/H+ Antiporter Genes from A. halophytica and Synechocystis Cells—From the shotgun clones of A. halophytica, one open reading frame homologous to the syn-CAX was found. Its gene was isolated by a PCR method and sequenced as described under “Materials and Methods.” The predicted gene product ApCAX consists of 373 amino acids with a molecular mass of 39,710 Da (Fig. 1A). The ClustalW analysis of seven kinds of CAXs (Fig. 1B) showed highest homology to the CAX from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (SynCAX) (69%) and then to vacuolar antiporters from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScVCX1) (43%), Neurospora crassa (NcCAX) (40%), Vigna ra- diata (VrCAX) (39%), and Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCAX1) (38%), and lowest homology to E. coli ChaA (35%). These facts indicate that ApCAX shows high homology to the cyanobacterial antiporters and considerable homology to those from vacuolar CAXs and ChaA. It would be noted that ApCAX showed lower homology to E. coli ChaA than it showed to vacuolar CAXs. It is also evident that vacuolar CAXs have longer N-terminal sequences than those of prokaryotic CAXs (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the hydropathy plot and the TM prediction program predicted 11 putative TM-spanning segments in these CAXs (Fig. 1, A and C). All CAXs contain a central hydrophilic motif, rich in acidic amino acid residues (Fig. 1, A and C).Construction of Expression Vectors for apCAX and synCAX, and Their Expression in E. coli—Expression vectors for ApCAX and SynCAX were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 2A). Western blotting analysis indicated that ApCAX and SynCAX could be expressed in E. coli with reasonable size and similar expression levels, which would provide the basis for functional comparison of these CAXs (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Expression of ApCAX and SynCAX in E. coli. ApCAX and SynCAX were expressed in TO114, and everted membranes were prepared.

Therefore, we examined whether ApCAX and SynCAX could complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of E. coli mutant TO114 cells. Due to the absence of the nhaA, nhaB, and chaA genes, TO114 cells could not grow if the medium contained 100 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 3A), 200 mm NaCl (Fig. 3B), or 4 mm LiCl (Fig. 3C) (16Ohyama T. Igarashi K.

This study assesses the effect of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) on the activity of the regulatory enzyme PLA2. Caveolin-1 is a 22-kDa cholesterol-binding membrane protein known to inhibit the activity of most of its interacting partners. Our results show that the calcium-dependent cytosolic form of PLA2 (cPLA2) and caveolin-1 co-localized in mouse primary hippocampal neuron cultures and that they were co-immunoprecipitated from mouse hippocampal homogenates. A peptide corresponding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (Cav-(82-101)) dramatically inhibited cPLA2 activity in purified hippocampal synaptoneurosomes. Activation of endogenous PLA2 activity with KCl or melittin increased the binding of [3H]AMPA to its receptor. This effect was almost completely abolished by the addition of the CSD peptide to these preparations. Moreover, we demonstrated that the inhibitory action of the CSD peptide on AMPA receptor binding properties is specific (because a scrambled version of this peptide failed to have any effect) and that it is mediated by an inhibition of PLA2 enzymatic activity (because the CSD peptide failed to have an effect in membrane preparations lacking endogenous PLA2 activity). These results raised the possibility that caveolin-1, via the inhibition of cPLA2 enzymatic activity, may interfere with synaptic facilitation and long term potentiation formation in the hippocampus.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), there is a growing body of evidence suggesting a role in the modulation of neurotransmitter release and long term potentiation (LTP) (2.Dumuis A. Sebben M. Haynes L. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Nature. 1988; 336: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 3.Dumuis A. Sebben M. Fagni L. Prezeau L. Manzoni O. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Bockaert J. Mol.

Changes in synaptic function observed with LTP are thought to be the result of modifications of postsynaptic currents mediated by the 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptors (5.Davies S.N. Lester R.A. Reymann K.G. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1989; 338: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6.Kauer J.A. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1988; 1: 911-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). PLA2 activity was shown to be part of the molecular mechanisms regulating AMPA receptor function during long term changes in synaptic operation (7.Chabot C. Bernard J. Normandin M. Ohayon M. Baudry M. Massicotte G. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 93: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 8.Bernard J. Chabot C. Gagne J. Baudry M. Massicotte G.

Hippocampus. 1998; 8: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that during high frequency stimulation a large entry of calcium mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor activation might cause an increase in PLA2 activity. The enzyme would augment AMPA receptor affinity by changing the lipid environment of AMPA receptors, thereby producing LTP (10.Massicotte G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that detergent-insoluble caveolin-rich membrane domains are markedly enriched in AMPA-type glutamate receptors (11.Suzuki T. Ito J. Takagi H. Saitoh F. Nawa H. Shimizu H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 89: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), AA and PLA2 (12.Pike L.J. Han X. Chung K.N. Gross R.W.

Caveolae are small (50-100 nm) flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane (14.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

The main molecular features of caveolae are the presence of caveolin, an integral membrane protein (21-24 kDa) (16.Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.

Three caveolin family members have recently been cloned and were designated caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3 (16.Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.

Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Caveolin is thought to function as a scaffolding protein within these membrane microdomains where it interacts with several signaling proteins (14.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar amino acids residues 82-101) cytosolic N-terminal region of caveolin, termed the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD), is involved in the formation of caveolin oligomers and mediates the interaction with signaling molecules, which generally results in the inactivation of signaling (27.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Most caveolin-interacting proteins identified so far contain a caveolin-binding motif located within their enzymatically active catalytic domain (28.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). This caveolin-binding motif is also present within the catalytic domain of the cytosolic form of PLA2 (cPLA2); yet, virtually nothing is known about the potential relationship of caveolin with cPLA2. In this article, we report evidence demonstrating the presence of the cytosolic (85-kDa) PLA2 in caveolin-enriched membrane fractions isolated from hippocampal preparations. We also show that a CSD peptide can regulate the enzymatic activity of cPLA2 in these preparations. Finally, we explored the effect of the CSD fragment on PLA2-mediated modulation of AMPA receptor binding properties. Animals, Reagents, and Antibodies—Adult male, 3-month-old CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River (St-Constant, Quebec, Canada). The anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody (pAb N-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-mouse cPLA2 polyclonal antibody was from Oxford Biomedical Research (Oxford, MI), and the monoclonal anti-glutamate receptor (GluR2) antibody was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Goat anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse biotinylated antibodies were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Texas Red dye-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cell culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario). Peptides, corresponding to amino acids 82-101 of the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (Cav-(82-101)), were synthesized, purified, and analyzed by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectometry by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). A scrambled version of the caveolin-1 peptide (CSD-X) was also used as a negative control. Recombinant human cPLA2 was obtained from Roger L. Williams (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), melittin, KCl, and protein G-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma; [3H]arachidonate and [3H]AMPA were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Guidelines for Use and Care of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of McGill University. Isolation of Caveolae-enriched Fractions—Caveolae-enriched fractions were separated by using ultracentrifugation with a discontinuous sucrose gradient system as described previously (29.Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi from mice were homogenized (∼20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer) into sodium carbonate buffer (500 mm, pH 11) and sonicated (3 × 20-s bursts). The resulting suspension (1.5 mg of protein in 2 ml) was brought to 42.5% sucrose (w/v) by adding 2 ml of carbonate buffer containing 85% sucrose and placed at the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous gradient was formed above the 42.5% bed by adding 6 and 2 ml, respectively, of 30 and 5% sucrose solutions prepared in carbonate buffer. After centrifugation for 18 h at 35,000 rpm (4 °C), 12 × 1-ml fractions were collected starting at the top of each gradient. An equal volume of each fraction was used to precipitate proteins (20% trichloroacetic acid, 1 h) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration of each fraction was estimated using a BCA protein assay (Pierce) kit. Synaptoneurosome Preparation—Synaptoneurosomes were prepared according to the method of Hollingsworth et al. (30.Hollingsworth E.B. McNeal E.T. Burton J.L. Williams R.J. Daly J.W. Creveling C.R. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2240-2253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed, and the brains were rapidly removed and chilled in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer (124 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 3 mm CaCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose) pregassed with a mixture of O2/CO2 (95:5). The hippocampus was cut into small pieces and then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in Krebs-Ringer buffer. The homogenate was filtered and then centrifuged at 2000× g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in freshly oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer and recentrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min. The final pellet was resuspended and immediately used for binding assays, PLA2 activity measurement, or Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation of cPLA2with Caveolin-1—Mice hippocampi were homogenized (∼20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer) in octyl glucoside lysing buffer (60 mm n-octyl β-glucopyranoside, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) and sonicated three times (10-s bursts). The homogenate was rotated (4 °C) for 60 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant (1 μg/μl protein in octyl glucoside buffer) was used for the immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were then incubated with 4 μg of caveolin-1 or cPLA2 antibodies (rotation at 4 °C for 2 h). Cell lysates were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G beads were then extensively washed with octyl glucoside buffer. Proteins were eluted from beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Novex 12% Tris/glycine precast gels; Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose (30 V for 90 min on ice). Blots were probed with polyclonal anti-cPLA2 or anti-caveolin-1 antibodies diluted 1:2000 in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20), pH 7.6, then with goat anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody 1:5000 in TBS-T. After washing in TBS-T, membranes were detected via the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to XAR5 films (Kodak) for 1-3 min. Cell Culture—Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from 1-day-old CD-1 mice, essentially as described previously for embryonic rats (31.Mitchell J.B. Betito K. Rowe W. Boksa P. Meaney M.J. Neuroscience. 1992; 48: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were removed, and the hippocampus was dissected and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 15 mm HEPES. The tissue was incubated with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C and then rinsed several times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and fungizone. Neurons were seeded into 16-mm2 culture wells containing poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After 24 h, the medium was changed to serum-free and supplemented with neuronal growth supplement B-27. The neurons were used for immunofluorescence assays 7 days after plating. Immunofluorescence—Neurons were rinsed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% SDS for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h of incubation (37 °C) with specific antibody, the cells were washed and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution) for anti-GluR2 monoclonal antibody and Texas Red dye-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) for anti-caveolin-1 and anti-cPLA2 polyclonal antibodies. PLA2Activity Measurement—Determination of phospholipase activity using [3H]arachidonic acid was performed as described by Verity et al. (32.Verity M.A. Sarafian T. Pacifici E.H. Sevanian A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptoneurosomes were labeled for 1 h in a Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 200 nm [3H]arachidonate and 2 mm CaCl2. After [3H] incorporation, synaptoneurosomes were washed three times and resuspended in 500 μl of Krebs buffer, with or without 75 μg/ml melittin. Following incubation at 33 °C for 45 min and centrifugation, supernatants were removed. The pellets were resuspended and subjected to radioactivity measurement. All assays were performed in triplicate. [3H]AMPA Binding Assays—[3H]AMPA (specific activity of 60 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding assays were performed as described previously by Massicotte et al. (33.Massicotte G. Kessler M. Lynch G. Baudry M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 278-285PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptoneurosomes were preincubated in the presence or absence of different concentrations of the CSD peptide (fragment 82-101) or CSD-X for 15 min at room temperature. After preincubation, 20 μg/ml melittin or 50 mm KCl were added, and synaptoneurosomes were incubated at 33 °C for 45 min. Synaptoneurosomes were then washed twice with a Tris acetate solution (100 mm, pH 7), and [3H]AMPA was added, diluted in a Tris acetate solution containing 100 mm KSCN. The nonspecific binding was defined as that measured in the presence of 0.2 mm quisqualate. After a 45-min incubation on ice, the preparations were centrifuged (15 min, 14,000 rpm), and the supernatants were removed. The pellets were resuspended in a 0.2 m NaOH solution and subjected to radioactivity measurement. All assays were performed in triplicate. cPLA2Localization in Caveolin-rich Microdomains and Association with Caveolin-1—Homogenates from hippocampal tissue were fractionated by ultracentrifugation using a discontinuous sucrose gradient system that was previously shown to resolve caveolae-enriched subcellular fractions (29.Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, almost all the endogenously expressed caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is recovered in the caveolae fractions 2, 3, and 4, at the 5-30% sucrose interface. By contrast, most of the total cellular protein is distributed in the denser sucrose fractions (fractions 8-12) (not shown). Importantly, a fraction of the total endogenous cPLA2 protein (with the expected molecular mass of 110 kDa (34.Gronich J.H. Bonventre J.V. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16645-16651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was recovered in caveolae fractions (Fig. 1A), demonstrating the presence of the cPLA2 protein in caveolin-enriched fractions from mice hippocampi. To determine whether caveolin-1 forms a stable complex with cPLA2, hippocampal homogenates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain of caveolin-1 (residues 2-21) or cPLA2 protein. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis, with antibodies directed against either caveolin-1 or cPLA2. As shown in Fig. 1B, caveolin-1 protein was found in immunoprecipitates of cPLA2, and, conversely, a small amount of cPLA2 protein was detected in immunoprecipitates of caveolin-1. To further confirm these biochemical findings, the localization of cPLA2 and caveolin-1 in cultured hippocampal neurons was assessed. Although cPLA2 and caveolin-1 were located over the entire neuronal cell surface, both proteins localized more substantially to the cell body, and in many cells, high levels of expression were also focally enriched on growth cones (Fig. 2). These results strongly support an association between cPLA2 and caveolin-1. Inhibition of cPLA2Activity by the CSD Peptide—Caveolin-1 has been shown to down-regulate the activity of several signaling molecules (27.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). This observation, together with the results described above, led us to examine the possible reduction of cPLA2 activity in synaptoneurosomes treated with the CSD peptide. Synaptoneurosomes, obtained by low speed centrifugations and filtration of brain homogenates, are a suspension of synaptic plasma membranes that contains synaptosomes with attached postsynaptic densities. The presence of both caveolin-1 and cPLA2 has been confirmed by Western blots carried out on hippocampal synaptoneurosome preparations (Fig. 1A). Incubation of synaptoneurosomes for 1 h in the presence of [3H]arachidonate resulted in a significant lipid incorporation of AA (123 ± 15 × 103 dpm/mg of protein) and a basal release corresponding to approximately 2% of total [3H]arachidonate incorporation. Purified CSD peptide produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]arachidonate release on PLA2 stimulation by melittin (Fig. 3). A highly significant effect of CSD peptide treatment was observed at 5 nm, with a 38.9% reduction of arachidonate release when compared with non-treated controls. A 70.9% reduction was reached with a concentration of only 50 nm of the purified CSD peptide. To confirm specifically that the inhibition of AA release observed is cPLA2-dependent, the effect of the CSD peptide was tested on synaptoneurosomes pretreated with the cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3. Fig. 4A shows that the CSD peptide completely lost its effect on melittin-stimulated release of AA in the presence of the cPLA2 inhibitor. To further identify specifically the cPLA2 as a target of the CSD peptide, we also investigated the inhibitory action of the CSD peptide on recombinant cPLA2 activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, the CSD peptide completely abolished the effect of recombinant cPLA2 on AA release, whereas the CSD-X failed to show any effect on cPLA2 activity. Inhibition of the PLA2-induced Modulation of AMPA Binding by the CSD Peptide—Because several studies indicate that calcium-dependent PLA2 participates in selective changes in AMPA receptor properties (33.Massicotte G. Kessler M. Lynch G. Baudry M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 278-285PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Massicotte G. Vanderklish P. Lynch G. Baudry M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the previous results prompted us to examine the possibility that the inhibition of cPLA2 activity could interfere with AMPA receptor binding. Double immunofluorescence was first used to examine whether caveolin-1 and AMPA receptors are co-localized at the cellular level. Fig. 5 shows double labeling of cultured hippocampal neurons with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the GluR2 subunit of glutamate AMPA receptor and a rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antibody generated against caveolin-1. Note that GluR2 immunostaining appears primarily at the cell body and as puncta localized to areas of cellular outgrowth. Although caveolin-1 exhibited a more diffuse fluorescence on projections, the merged image shows a general co-localization of GluR2 and caveolin-1 in hippocampal neurons. It has been previously shown that potassium-induced depolarization of synaptoneurosomes increased [3H]AMPA binding to membrane fractions (36.Bernard J. Lahsaini A. Baudry M. Massicotte G. Brain Res. 1993; 628: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37.Bernard J. Massicotte G. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that treatment of synaptoneurosomes with melittin, a potent activator of endogenous phospholipases, increases [3H]AMPA binding (8.Bernard J. Chabot C. Gagne J. Baudry M. Massicotte G. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 illustrates the effect of melittin and KCl in the presence of different concentrations of CSD peptide. Preincubation of synaptoneurosomes with CSD peptide produced a marked reduction of the melittin- and KCl-induced increase in [3H]AMPA binding to membrane fractions. However, the inactive CSD-X peptide at the highest concentration (50 nm) did not affect AMPA binding in both situations (not shown). As shown in Fig. 7, the CSD peptide also reduced the basal [3H]AMPA binding to its receptor. To eliminate the possibility that the CSD peptide directly interacts with AMPA receptors, [3H]AMPA binding was evaluated on purified membranes, which, unlike synaptoneurosome preparations, do not contain PLA2 activity (not shown). Membrane preparations were obtained by a low speed centrifugation of hippocampal homogenates (3500 rpm) followed by two ultracentrifugations (18,000 rpm) of the supernatants. Our results showed no CSD-induced decrease of AMPA receptor binding in these membrane preparations (Fig. 7A). Similarly, the inhibitory effect of CSD peptide was completely abolished when the binding experiments with synaptoneurosomes were carried out at 0 °C instead of 33 °C (Fig. 7B). In these low temperature conditions, no phospholipase activity is detectable (not shown), indicating again that the CSD peptide modulation of [3H]AMPA binding on synaptoneurosomes reflects an inhibition of PLA2 enzymatic activity by the peptide rather than a direct action of the compound on AMPA receptors. In the present study, we confirm the presence of both caveolin-1 and cPLA2 in mouse hippocampal neurons. Moreover, subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that a significant fraction of cPLA2 is found in caveolin-rich membrane microdomains from hippocampal preparations. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also indicated that caveolin-1 and cPLA2 associate with each other, suggesting that caveolin-1 may functionally interfere with cPLA2 enzymatic activity. In support of this assumption, we found that the peptide corresponding to the CSD peptide dramatically inhibited cPLA2-mediated release of arachidonic acid. In addition, we showed that the inhibition of cPLA2 activity by the CSD peptide modified [3H]AMPA binding in synaptoneurosomes. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of cPLA2 by caveolin-1 may be an important and previously unrecognized mechanism for modulating neuronal AMPA receptor binding properties. Caveolin-1 is an integral membrane protein, and one of its proposed roles is to regulate the activity of signaling proteins that reside in caveolae. Numerous signaling molecules such as Ha-RAS, c-Src, and eNOS (28.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) have been shown to be functionally associated with caveolin-1. It was recently reported that caveolae are enriched in AA (12.Pike L.J. Han X. Chung K.N. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2075-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), the release of which is regulated by PLA2. There are four major types of PLA2, including cPLA2 (cytosolic), sPLA2 (secretory), iPLA2 (Ca2+-independent) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (38.Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kuwata H. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although there are a number of types of PLA2 in the brain, the 85-kDa cPLA2 (type IV) is unique because it selectively releases AA from phospholipids (39.Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In resting cells, cPLA2 is localized to the cytoplasm, but in response to increases in cytosolic free calcium, the enzyme translocates to the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (40.Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Based on our findings, cPLA2 appears to be, in part, localized in the caveolae. However, final confirmation of this localization must await detailed electron microscopy studies. Moreover, although our data do not establish a direct protein-protein interaction between caveolin-1 and cPLA2, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that caveolin-1 and cPLA2 proteins interact somehow with one another. In this regard, the large number of proteins known to associate with caveolin-1 might explain the small amount of caveolin-1 detectable in cPLA2 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). Among the proteins that functionally associate with caveolin-1, a common denominator seems to be the presence of a motif that interacts with the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (CSD) (amino acids 82-101), which is a juxtamembrane region in caveolin-1 containing numerous aromatic residues. In our study, a peptide derived from the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 was used to examine the putative functional relationship between caveolin-1 and the activity of the regulatory enzyme cPLA2. Synaptoneurosomes, which are pinched-off nerve terminals associated with released post-synaptic structures, are useful tools to study mechanisms of transmitter release, regulation of transmitter receptors and second messenger pathways. We found that the CSD peptide dramatically inhibits melittin-induced AA release from synaptoneurosome preparations. Melittin is a strong activator of endogenous PLA2s. With the use of the cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3, we showed that the major proportion of melittin-induced AA release is cPLA2-dependent. The absence of any CSD peptide effect on synaptoneurosomes pretreated with the cPLA2 inhibitor and the complete inhibition of the recombinant cPLA2 activity by the CSD peptide specifically identified cPLA2 as a target of the CSD peptide. Moreover, the scrambled version of the CSD peptide (CSD-X) did not affect melittin-induced AA release, showing the specificity of the observed effect of the CSD fragment on endogenous cPLA2. It should be noted here that in synaptoneurosome preparations, 50% of the formed vesicles are likely to be inside-out, the remaining being right-side-out. This explains how the CSD peptide we used, which is a cell-impermeable peptide, can interact with intracellular cPLA2. How might caveolin-1 inhibit the activity of cPLA2? One possible physiological mechanism for the CSD inhibition of cPLA2 activity is that, following the enzyme activation, cPLA2 translocation to the cell membrane (40.Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) may promote its physical interaction with caveolin-1. Another hypothesis is that cPLA2 clustering with other signaling molecules inside caveolae may indirectly inactivate cPLA2 activity. For instance, cPLA2 can be stimulated by protein kinases such as protein kinase C (41.Farooqui A.A. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (42.Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), which are known to be inhibited by caveolin-1 (43.Oka N. Yamamoto M. Schwencke C. Kawabe J. Ebina T. Ohno S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism for the putative inhibition of cPLA2 activity by caveolin-1 is still unknown, the modulatory effect observed may have an important homeostatic role in brain cells. For example, it has recently become apparent that activation of the calcium-dependent PLA2 could be part of the molecular mechanisms involved in alterations of AMPA receptor properties during long term changes in synaptic operation (LTP) (7.Chabot C. Bernard J. Normandin M. Ohayon M. Baudry M. Massicotte G. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 93: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 8.Bernard J. Chabot C. Gagne J. Baudry M. Massicotte G. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9.Chabot C. Gagne J. Giguere C. Bernard J. Baudry M. Massicotte G. Hippocampus. 1998; 8: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In accordance with a recent study providing biochemical evidence for a localization of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to caveolae-like structures (11.Suzuki T. Ito J. Takagi H. Saitoh F. Nawa H. Shimizu H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 89: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), our study shows the co-immunolocalization of the GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors with caveolin-1 in primary hippocampal neuron cultures. Increased PLA2 activity has previously been shown to upregulate [3H]AMPA binding to AMPA receptor (44.Cruickshank A.M. Henley J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 45.Catania M.V. Hollingsworth Z. Penney J.B. Young A.B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, the activation of endogenous PLA2 activity with KCl or melittin increased AMPA binding to its receptor. This effect was almost completely abolished by the addition of the CSD peptide to synaptoneurosome preparations. It is not excluded that a small fraction of the effect of CSD peptide on AMPA binding might have been mediated by the inhibition of PLA2s other than the cPLA2. However, as we showed previously with the cPLA2 inhibitor, the effect of melittin on synaptoneurosomes is mostly cPLA2-dependent. This indicates that the inhibition of the cPLA2 isoform of the enzyme might be principally involved in the reduction of AMPA binding, which is consistent with our experiments showing the highly potent and efficient inhibition of the purified recombinant cPLA2 by the CSD peptide. We also demonstrated that the inhibitory action of the CSD peptide on AMPA binding depends on its modulation of PLA2 activity by carrying out experiments in conditions where PLA2 enzymatic activity is absent. Interestingly, biochemical evidence has shown that [3H]AMPA binding is augmented after LTP induction (46.Maren S. Tocco G. Standley S. Baudry M. Thompson R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9654-9658Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 47.Nayak A. Zastrow D.J. Lickteig R. Zahniser N.R.

Moreover, several reports suggest that different compounds that inhibit PLA2 activity interfere with LTP (4.Lynch M.A. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 49.Williams J.H. Bliss T.V. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 107: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 50.Massicotte G. Oliver M.W. Lynch G. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1990; 537: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, we could hypothesize that an up-regulated physiological level of caveolin-1 expression in the brain, such as that seen in aging (51.Kawabe J.I. Grant B.S. Yamamoto M. Schwencke C. Okumura S. Ishikawa Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 176: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 52.Park W.Y. Park J.S. Cho K.A. Kim D.I. Ko Y.G. Seo J.S. Park S.C. J. Biol.

Aging, 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2003.07.004Google Scholar), might negatively interfere with synaptic function. In conclusion, we show for the first time the regulation of cPLA2 activity and the resulting modulation of AMPA receptor binding properties by the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1. These results raise the possibility that caveolin-1 may interfere with phospholipid-derived metabolite production, synaptic facilitation, and LTP formation. In this regard, future investigations into this area should include experiments dedicated to evaluating the potential involvement of the caveolin scaffolding domain in regulating changes of AMPA receptor properties in synaptic plasticity and LTP formation in vivo.

Target promoters have been identified primarily through the use of differential expression strategies and candidate gene approaches but not biochemical screens. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation screen, we identified protein kinase Cβ as a direct RUNX1 target gene and demonstrate that endogenous RUNX1 binds the chromatinized protein kinase Cβ promoter of U937 cells. A phylogenetically conserved RUNX1-binding site within the PKCβ promoter binds RUNX1 in electrophoretic mobility shift analyses and confers RUNX1 responsiveness on a heterologous promoter. Changes in RUNX1 activity affect endogenous protein kinase Cβ expression, and a dominant-negative form of RUNX1 protects U937 cells from apoptotic stimuli previously shown to be dependent on protein kinase Cβ. This protection can be reversed by the ectopic expression of protein kinase Cβ. Together these findings demonstrate that protein kinase Cβ is a direct, downstream target of RUNX1 and links RUNX1 to a myeloid apoptotic pathway.

Three RUNX transcription factors make up the mammalian family named for homology with the Drosophila pair-rule gene, RUNT (1.Lund A.H. van Lohuizen M. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 213-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).

Gain of function also appears to have oncogenic effects, because aberrant activation of any of the RUNX genes contributes to dysregulated proliferation (8.Cameron E.R. Blyth K. Hanlon L. Kilbey A.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7181-7185PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the transcription factor family has complex roles in growth and development, and either loss or gain of activity can predispose a cell to maturation defects or transformation. Identification of RUNX target genes is essential for understanding the cellular effects of the transcription factors. RUNX1 has been the most extensively analyzed family member, and numerous target pathways have been identified (13.Otto F. Lubbert M. Stock M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14.Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Lutterbach B. Hiebert S.W. Gene. 2000; 245: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Most RUNX1 target genes have been revealed by identifying consensus motifs within candidate target promoters or by performing differential expression screens (13.Otto F. Lubbert M. Stock M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15.Lutterbach B. Hiebert S.W. Gene. 2000; 245: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These approaches have been invaluable for identifying RUNX1 target pathways. However, candidate gene approaches may overlook targets with one or more base deviations from the perfect TG(T/C)GGT consensus or uncharacterized regulatory elements distant from promoters regions (16.Halle J.P. Haus-Seuffert P. Woltering C. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Differential expression strategies likely omit target genes that undergo small changes in expression or genes that change only under select culture conditions. It is, therefore, likely that many RUNX1 target genes important for cellular function remain undefined. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 1The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PKCβ, protein kinase Cβ; DN, dominant-negative; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. is a revolutionary biochemical technique for demonstrating direct interactions between transcription factors and their target promoters (18.Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The assay allows for the biochemical enrichment of chromatin fragments associated with endogenous factors and is commonly used for candidate target gene validation (18.Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recently, ChIP was shown to be a potent method for identifying novel target promoters (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments were cloned and sequenced to reveal transcription factor targets (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The unbiased ChIP screen is distinct from other target identification strategies because it does not rely on changes in gene expression or the disproportionate presence of transcription factor consensus sites within known regulatory regions. The assay, thus, promises to identify a unique subset of target genes that would be missed by conventional strategies. Additionally, because ChIP exclusively identifies direct biochemical targets, the screen is insulated from the indirect and often confusing cellular effects that result from alterations of transcriptional pathways. Using a RUNX1 ChIP screen, we identified protein kinase (PKCβ) as a direct RUNX1 target. Changes in RUNX1 activity affect PKCβ expression and a well characterized, PKCβ-dependent apoptotic pathway of myeloid cells. Thus, RUNX1 regulation of PKCβ is an important aspect of normal and pathological biology of myeloid cells. Cell Culture—U937 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transductions were performed by spinoculation (centrifugal inoculation) as described previously (23.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells transduced with MigR1-based retroviral vectors were sorted to purity using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences) 24 h after transduction. Constructs—A sequence-encoding FLAG sequence was added to the 5′ end of RUNX genes by PCR. RUNX1, RUNX1 DN (i.e. AML1a (25.Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ogawa S. Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Shibata Y.

The FLAG-RUNX DNA-binding domain construct encodes the first 177 amino acids of RUNX1 and was cloned into LXIN. The PKCβ promoter construct encompassing bases –17 to –1003, with respect to the translational start site, was cloned into PGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using PCR. Complementary oligomers containing tandem repeats of the bases –562 to –532 were annealed and cloned into the PGL2-promoter vector (Promega). Mutant oligomers contain the sequence GCTAGC in place of the RUNX1 consensus site, TGTGGT. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Screen—The Chromatin immunoprecipitation screen was modified from the previously described strategy (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20.Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Chromatin was prepared from 108 control U937 cells transduced with LXIN or cells transduced with LXIN expressing the FLAG-tagged RUNX1 DNA-binding domain. The fixation was performed using 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature on a rocker platform. Fixation was terminated by adding glycine to 0.125 m and washing twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Lysis and sonication to 500-bp fragments were performed as described previously (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20.Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Chromatin samples were diluted 20-fold in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.1 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C, on an end-over-end platform, overnight. After extensive washing with immunoprecipitation buffer, complexes were eluted from beads using 100 μg/ml of FLAG peptide (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were de-cross-linked at 65 °C, treated with proteinase K, and end-repaired as described previously (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20.Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were purified with a QIAquick spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cloned into TOPO blunt vectors (Invitrogen) (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell.

Equal volumes of TOPO ligation samples were transformed into DH5α and plated on LB agar containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Sequence from clones was obtained using a T7 primer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Aliquots of chromatin samples prepared as described above were immunoprecipitated using FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma) or anti-AML1 (Calbiochem) as appropriate. Immunoprecipitated samples were prepared for PCR as described and analyzed using primers for the PKC promoter (forward primer, ATCCCATTGGTCATTCTGCA; reverse primer, TATTGATCTACTGAAATCCTTCCTC) or actin promoter (forward primer, GAGCACAGAGCCTCGCCTTT; reverse primer, AGACAAAGACCCCGCCGGTT) (18.Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Amplification was performed using titanium Taq polymerase (Clontech) at thermocycler settings of: one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min. Aliquots were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analyses—Complementary oligomers, including the putative RUNX1-binding motif (CCAAGAATCTTCTC TGTGGT GGAGTTAGAGACATA), were annealed and labeled with digoxigenin dUTP (Roche). The probe was incubated with U937 cell extracts for 15 min at room temperature and loaded onto a 6% non-reducing mobility shift gel (Invitrogen). Probe was transferred to Nylon membrane, positively charged (Roche), cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and developed using a digoxigenin wash and buffer chemiluminescence (Roche). Competitor analyses were performed using 50× unlabeled double-stranded oligomers. Wild-type oligomers were identical to the probe. GCTAGC replaced the RUNX1 consensus TGTGGT in mutant oligomers. Quantitative RT-PCR—Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PKCβ primers (forward, GACCATGGACCGCCTGTACTTTG; reverse, GAAGAACAGACCGATGGCAATTTCT), probe (CCTTGAACCGGCCGACTTGCTGGA), actin primers (forward, AGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCTT; reverse, GGACTCCATGCCCAGGAAGGAA), and probe (CACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCCGC) were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were prepared using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Relative transcript levels represent 2–ΔΔCt calculations. Western Blot—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol). Immunoblots were probed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.15% Tween 20 and 3% milk, using anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-RUNX1 (Ab-1; Calbiochem), anti-PKCβ (sc-210; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bands were visualized using Supersignal Femto (Pierce). Luciferase Assays—U937 cells (106) from LXIN, RUNX1, or RUNX1 DN lines were electroporated (200 V, 1000 microfarads) with firefly luciferase reporter vectors and SV40-Renilla luciferase expression vectors to control for transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Apoptosis Assays—Pure cell line populations expressing the appropriate genes were obtained by selection on 1 mg/ml G418 (for LXIN or PKC LXIN) and cell sorting (for MigR1 or RUNX1 DN MigR1) was performed using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). U937 cells (106) were plated on six-well plates. Samples were treated with 10 nm PMA for 12 h and analyzed for annexin binding using Apop-TACS flow cytometry kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and streptavidin-allophycocyanin antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Histograms of annexin-positive cells represent the propidium iodide-negative population. TNFα was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Screen—To identify novel, direct RUNX1 gene targets, we modified a recently described, unbiased ChIP screen (Fig. 1A) (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20.Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We stably expressed a FLAG-tagged version of the RUNX1 DNA-binding domain in U937 myeloid cells using a bicistronic LXIN retroviral vector. The system of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and FLAG peptide elution allows for the gentle isolation of protein complexes in a single precipitation (26.Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Control LXIN cells and FLAG-RUNX1 LXIN cells were fixed with formaldehyde, and chromatin was prepared. Samples were sonicated to equivalent sizes of ∼500 bp (Fig. 1B). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG agarose beads, and RUNX1-chromatin complexes were eluted using FLAG peptide. This allowed for effective pull-down and elution of FLAG-RUNX1 from formaldehyde-fixed and sonicated samples (Fig. 1C). RUNX1-chromatin complexes were then processed to allow DNA fragments to be cloned. Transformation of DH5α with cloned fragments demonstrated a 10-fold enrichment in clones from cells expressing FLAG-RUNX1 compared with controls (Fig. 1D). This is consistent with enrichment for RUNX1 target-DNA fragments by the FLAG immunopurification. PKCβ Is a Direct RUNX1 Target—We sequenced 10 clones derived from the FLAG-RUNX1 cell line and five clones from the control cell line. Three clones from the FLAG-RUNX1 line appeared to be from promoter regions, a frequency comparable with that of previously described cloning strategies (19.Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, eight of the 10 clones from the FLAG-RUNX1 cell line represented unique genomic loci, whereas only one of five control clones was unique (data not shown). We pursued in more detail the most intriguing clone, which corresponded to bases –265 to –1003 of the promoter for the PKCβ gene (27.Obeid L.M. Blobe G.C. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20804-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCβ is expressed in myeloid cells and is associated with a well characterized apoptotic pathway, making it a potentially important leukemogenic target. To validate the FLAG-RUNX association with the PKCβ promoter, we performed conventional ChIP-PCR analyses. First, we repeated the ChIP using anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and FLAG peptide elution, using primers designed from the cloned PKCβ promoter fragment. PKCβ promoter sequences were amplified specifically from the FLAG-RUNX1 samples, confirming the enrichment for these sequences by the FLAG immunopurification strategy (Fig. 2A). No enrichment of the control β-actin promoter was observed. To rule out differences in chromatin preparations as a cause of the positive ChIP results, we performed immunoprecipitations on a single chromatin sample from the cell line expressing FLAG-RUNX1. Anti-FLAG antibodies enriched for PKCβ promoter sequences significantly more than control rabbit IgG (data not shown). These PCR results indicate that FLAG-RUNX1 associates with the chromatinized PKCβ promoter in U937 cells. We next performed immunoprecipitations on chromatin samples from wild-type U937 cells using anti-RUNX1 antibodies to identify an association between endogenous RUNX1 and the endogenous PKCβ gene. PCR analysis confirmed that immunoprecipitation of endogenous RUNX1 enriches chromatin fragments from the PKCβ promoter, in comparison to a control immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B). This demonstrates that endogenous RUNX1 associates with the chromatinized PKCβ promoter of wild-type U937 cells. Localization of the RUNX1 Binding Site in the PKCβ Promoter—The observed association of RUNX1 with sequences upstream of PKCβ suggested that the promoter might be RUNX1-responsive. We, therefore, cloned the PKCβ promoter upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected control U937 cells and cells overexpressing RUNX1 or dominant-negative RUNX1 (Fig. 3C). RUNX1 increased luciferase expression by greater than 3-fold (Fig. 3A). Conversely, transfection of cells expressing dominant-negative RUNX1 resulted in reduced luciferase expression (Fig. 3B). These changes demonstrate that the PKCβ promoter confers RUNX1 responsiveness on a heterologous reporter gene and are consistent with the observed association between RUNX1 and the PKCβ promoter in the ChIP assay. The cloned PKCβ promoter fragment has one motif (positioned at –549 to –544 with respect to the transcriptional start site) that perfectly matches the RUNX1 consensus-binding site (TG(T/C)GGT) (27.Obeid L.M. Blobe G.C. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20804-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, five sites deviating by 1 bp are scattered throughout the cloned region. To identify sequences potentially bound by RUNX1, we aligned the human and mouse sequences (Fig. 4A). Of the six potential regulatory regions, only the TGTGGT consensus is conserved between species, suggesting that it is potentially a transcription factor-binding site. To test this hypothesis, a 35-bp probe including the conserved TGTGGT motif was incubated with U937 cell nuclear extract and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). The extract resulted in a shift of the probe, demonstrating an interaction of a factor in U937 cells with this region (Fig. 4B). The shifted probe could be competed by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide but not by an oligonucleotide carrying a mutation of the TGTGGT motif to GCTAGC. Incubation of the probe with extracts plus anti-RUNX1 antibody supershifted the probe, confirming that RUNX1 is, indeed, able to interact with the TGTGGT motif (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, a tandem repeat of the wild-type oligomer placed upstream of a heterologous promoter-reporter construct is sufficient to confer RUNX1 responsiveness in transfected cells (Fig. 4D). The mutant oligomer that failed to bind RUNX1 in the EMSA lacks this activity in the transfection assay. These findings confirm the ChIP results by demonstrating that RUNX1 interacts with and activates a binding site from the PKCβ promoter. PKCβ Expression Studies—The validation of RUNX1 interactions with the PKCβ promoter suggested that the expression of endogenous PKCβ should be affected by changes in RUNX1 activity. We used the MigR1 retrovirus to overexpress wild-type RUNX1 or a DN protein (RUNX1 DN) consisting of the DNA-binding domain without the co-regulator interaction domains (25.Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ogawa S. Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Shibata Y. Hirai H. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 299-302PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ogawa S. Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Nishida J. Shibata Y. Yazaki Y.

The retroviruses express the RUNX genes and green fluorescent protein from a bicistronic message allowing for the production of unselected, multiclonal populations of transduced cells by sorting. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that DN RUNX1 reduced PKCβ expression by 50% with respect to controls expressing green fluorescent protein alone (Fig. 5A). These findings are consistent with the protein levels observed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5B, left). Conversely, overexpression of wild-type RUNX1 increased the endogenous PKCβ message by greater than 3-fold (Fig. 5A). PKCβ protein levels, accordingly, increased in these cells (Fig. 5B, right). These findings indicate that changes in RUNX1 activity affect PKCβ expression and are consistent with RUNX1 regulating the PKCβ promoter. Inhibition of Apoptosis—The regulation of PKCβ levels by RUNX1 suggests that RUNX1 function should influence the activity of the PKCβ pathway. Numerous studies in myeloid cells have shown that PKCβ functions in the apoptotic response to PMA (31.Meinhardt G. Roth J. Totok G. Eur. J.

Cell lines deficient in PKCβ are resistant to PMA-induced apoptosis, but the phenotype can be restored by ectopic expression of PKCβ (31.Meinhardt G. Roth J. Totok G. Eur. J.

Events downstream of PKCβ may include production of TNFα, stimulation of ceramide synthesis, and activation of caspases (33.Laouar A. Glesne D. Huberman E. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 32: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36.Takada Y. Hachiya M. Osawa Y. Hasegawa Y. Ando K. Kobayashi Y. Akashi M. J. Biol.

Thus, a previously characterized PMA-PKCβ-apoptosis pathway is available for functional analysis of RUNX1. We expressed DN RUNX1 in U937 cells by retroviral transduction with the MigR1 vector and obtained pure populations by cell sorting. We hypothesized that these cells would have defective PKCβ pathways and would be resistant to PMA-induced apoptosis. In agreement with previous studies, we found that control cells treated with PMA readily underwent apoptosis (Fig. 6A) (31.Meinhardt G. Roth J. Totok G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32.Laouar A. Glesne D. Huberman E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28286-28292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By contrast, we found that cells expressing DN RUNX1 were protected from apoptosis (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar results were obtained with stable U937 cell lines produced using LXIN and RUNX DN LXIN retroviral vectors and selected on G418-containing media (data not shown). Resistance to apoptosis was correlated with a significant reduction in TNFα (from 4.04 ± 1.35 to 1.55 ± 0.35 ng/ml, p < 0.02), consistent with TNFα functioning downstream of PKCβ (data not shown). Additionally, treatment of either control cells or cells expressing RUNX DN with TNFα induced apoptosis (data not shown). This demonstrates that cells expressing the RUNX DN protein retain an intact apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, this finding suggests that the blunted apoptotic phenotype results from altered PMA signaling. These findings are consistent with a defective PKCβ pathway in cells expressing DN RUNX1. Rescue of Apoptosis—The correlation between the expression of dominant-negative RUNX1 and a defect in the PKCβ apoptotic pathway suggests that reduced PKCβ expression could be the direct cause of this defect. To determine whether the reductions in PKCβ produced the resistance to PMA, we stably expressed PKCβ in U937 cells and transduced these cells with MigR1 control retrovirus or the dominant-negative RUNX1 retrovirus. We hypothesized that the apoptotic phenotype of cells expressing dominant-negative RUNX1 would be restored by PKCβ expression. Indeed, following PMA treatment, we observed wild-type levels of apoptosis in the DN RUNX1 cells ectopically expressing PKCβ (Fig. 6, A and B). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that PKCβ protein levels reflect the sensitivity to PMA (Fig. 6C). This indicates that the reduction in apoptosis resulting from expression of dominant-negative RUNX1 is a direct result of reduced PKCβ expression. Our ChIP screen revealed that RUNX1 binds the PKCβ promoter in myeloid cells. Candidate gene approaches and differential expression screens have not previously identified PKCβ as a RUNX1 target gene in myeloid cells. ChIP is especially well suited to target identification because it is an unbiased biochemical technique. Targets are revealed without a prior need to identify affected pathways. Furthermore, the indirect effects of transcription factors are filtered because ChIP is based on DNA-binding properties instead of an ability to disrupt cellular biology. Additionally, prior knowledge of regulatory elements is not required, and elements are not assumed to fall within convenient proximal promoter regions. Regulatory regions are potentially revealed whether they are positioned at promoters, within distant enhancer elements, or even within introns. In support of the identification of PKCβ as a novel RUNX target gene, we have shown that the PKCβ gene promoter is activated by RUNX1 and contains a canonical binding site to which RUNX1 specifically binds. This binding site is sufficient for RUNX1 activation of a heterologous promoter. Mutation of the RUNX1-binding site in the context of the full-length PKCβ promoter does not fully eliminate RUNX1 responsiveness of the promoter (data not shown), indicating that additional RUNX1-binding sites likely contribute to the regulation of this gene. Nevertheless, it is clear that endogenous RUNX1 binds to the endogenous PKCβ gene and that PKCβ gene activity is regulated by RUNX1. Interestingly, microarray analysis of lymphoid leukemia specimens recently revealed PKCβ as a marker in samples from patients with the TEL-AML1 (i.e. TEL-RUNX1) translocation but not other forms of acute lymphoid leukemia (37.Yeoh E.J. Ross M.E. Shurtleff S.A. Williams W.K. Patel D. Mahfouz R. Behm F.G. Raimondi S.C. Relling M.V. Patel A. Cheng C. Campana D. Wilkins D. Zhou X. Li J. Liu H. Pui C.H. Evans W.E. Naeve C. Wong L.

Several myeloid lines, including a U937-derived line, express reduced levels of PKCβ (38.Hass R. Hirano M. Kharbanda S. Rubin E. Meinhardt G. Kufe D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Macfarlane D.E. Manzel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4327-4331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Homma Y.

PKCβ is the only deficient member of the PKC family identified in these cells, and the apoptotic phenotype can be restored by ectopic expression of PKCβ (31.Meinhardt G. Roth J. Totok G. Eur. J.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that RUNX1 regulates PKCβ provides a plausible and novel mechanism to explain previous observations linking RUNX1 to apoptosis. For example, the RUNX1-opposing fusion core-binding factor β-smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain inhibits apoptosis in myeloid cells (41.Britos-Bray M. Ramirez M. Cao W. Wang X. Liu P.P. Civin C.I. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 4344-4352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, reduction in the RUNX1-interfering AML1-ETO oncoprotein in Kasumi cells results in apoptosis, suggesting that the oncoprotein protects cells from death-inducing background genes present in these lines (42.Matsushita H. Kizaki M. Kobayashi H. Muto A. Ikeda Y. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present finding that cells expressing DN RUNX1 essentially recapitulate the phenotype of PKCβ-deficient U937 cells and that this can be rescued by PKCβ supports the hypothesis that PKCβ regulation underlies at least some of the effects of RUNX1 on apoptosis The link between RUNX factors and apoptosis may not be limited to RUNX1 in myeloid cells, because loss of RUNX3 function produces gastric carcinoma, possibly by inhibiting the apoptotic response to transforming growth factor β (3.Li Q.L. Ito K. Sakakura C. Fukamachi H. Inoue K. Chi X.Z. Lee K.Y. Nomura S. Lee C.W. Han S.B. Kim H.M. Kim W.J. Yamamoto H. Yamashita N. Yano T. Ikeda T. Itohara S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Hagiwara A.

The link is complicated, however, because in some settings interference with RUNX activity has been associated with increased apoptosis (43.Burel S.A. Harakawa N. Zhou L. Pabst T. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5577-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and for unknown reasons dominant-negative RUNX1 in the form of the RUNX DNA-binding domain sometimes behaves differently than AML1-ETO (29.Shimada H. Ichikawa H. Nakamura S. Katsu R. Iwasa M. Kitabayashi I. Ohki M. Blood. 2000; 96: 655-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these settings, the role of PKCβ regulation may be overshadowed by competing phenotypic effects of other RUNX target genes."

Cholesterol is an essential lipid constituent in the membranes of mammalian cells and has a profound effect on the physical properties of these membranes. By interacting with the acyl-chain of other (phospho)lipids, cholesterol increases lipid packing in the membranes, thereby causing thickening of the membrane. Increased packing of the membrane affects the fluidity of the membrane and makes it less permeable for the transbilayer passage of small water-soluble molecules like glucose (1Levine Y.K.

Biol. 1998; 9: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum methyl-β-cyclodextrin nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detergent-resistant membrane guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) vesicular stomatitis virus G Chinese hamster ovary endoglycosidase H room temperature cholesterol sphingomyelin glucosylceramide phosphatidylcholine coat protein complex I NEM-sensitive protein soluble NSF attachment protein receptor. The tight regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and subcellular distribution suggests a critical role of this lipid in biological processes. Due to the cholesterol gradient along the secretory pathway and its implication on lipid bilayer thickness, cholesterol has been postulated to be involved in the targeting of Golgi resident proteins to this organelle (3Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is also involved in the stabilization and function of lipid-enriched microdomains (lipid rafts) within a membrane. The scaffold of these microdomains is built by sphingolipids and cholesterol (13Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 14Brown D.A.

Cholesterol tightly interacts with sphingolipids that contain predominantly long-chain saturated fatty acids. This results in the segregation of these lipids from other membrane lipids into microdomains. Due to the physical properties of these microdomains, distinct classes of membrane proteins are incorporated, causing their segregation as well (13Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Recent advances suggest that cholesterol exerts many of its actions mainly by maintaining sphingolipid rafts in a functional state (16Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). Microdomains were postulated to exist at the trans-Golgi network, to explain the observed sorting of sphingolipids to the apical surface in polarized cells (17Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 18van Meer G. Simons K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Functionally, sorting is explained by the transport of microdomain-associated proteins such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and influenza virus hemagglutinin to the apical surface (19Hannan L.A. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Keller P. Simons K. J.

Likewise, microdomains have been implicated in sorting processes along the endocytic pathway (23Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane, the most important role of microdomains may be their function in signal transduction (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 15Simons K. Ikonen E.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Activation of signaling cascades can cause raft clustering into patches as well as change the partitioning of signaling molecules in lipid rafts. For example, in T-cell antigen receptor signaling, clustering of rafts is an essential feature in the formation of an immunological synapse between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (27Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 28Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Drevot P. He H.T. Curr. Opin.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Here we report that small changes in cholesterol content of Golgi membranes specifically inhibit the fusion reaction of intra-Golgi protein transport. Thus, cholesterol levels at the Golgi complex must be precisely balanced to allow protein transport to occur. We considered the possibility that a change in cholesterol levels might affect the function of microdomains at the Golgi complex. Recently we obtained evidence for the existence of such microdomains at the early Golgi complex (30Gkantiragas I. Brugger B. Stuven E. Kaloyanova D. Li X.Y. Lohr K. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. Helms J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1819-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We now show that changing the cholesterol content of membranes specifically affects the phase partitioning of heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting a possible involvement of microdomains in the regulation of protein transport through the Golgi apparatus. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (average degree of substitution of 10.5-14.7), α-cyclodextrin, and brefeldin A were from Sigma. Stock solutions of cyclodextrins were freshly prepared at 50 mm in water. [3,4-13C2]Cholesterol was kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang D. Lehmann (German Cancer Research Center, Germany). 2,2,3,4,4,6-D6-cholesterol was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). Cholesterol was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Triton X-100 (purchased as a 10% solution) and GTPγS were from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Intra-Golgi Transport Assay—The standard intra-Golgi transport was performed as described previously (31Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A standard intra-Golgi transport assay (25 μl) contained 2.5 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 15 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Mg(AcO)2, 0.4 μCi of UDP-N-[3H]acetylglucosamine, 5 μl of 1:1 mixture of donor and acceptor Golgi membranes (2-3 μg of protein), 10 μm palmitoyl-coenzyme A, ATP- and UTP-regenerating systems, and 16.5-17.5 μg of rat or 16 μg of bovine brain cytosol. The transport reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The incorporation of N-[3H]acetylglucosamine into the VSV-G protein was determined as described previously (32Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Glycosylation Assay—This assay is based on a method described by Taylor et al. (33Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melancon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Prior to isolation of Golgi membranes, CHO wild type cells were infected with the vesicular stomatitis virus. Isolated membranes were treated with 1 mmN-ethylmaleimide for 15 min on ice to inhibit transport. Subsequently, excessive N-ethylmaleimide was quenched with 2 mm dithiothreitol. The glycosylation assay was performed under standard transport conditions without the addition of cytosol (for details, see Ref. 32Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Endoglycosidase H Digestion—CHO cells infected with VSV-G (2 × 106 cells for each time point) were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine-methionine and chased as previously described (34Neumann D. Wikstrom L. Watowich S.S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13639-13649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with serum-free medium in the absence or presence of 10 mm MβCD·Chol (4:1) or 10 mm MβCD during the 1-h period of methionine and cysteine starvation and were present throughout the experiment. In case cells were depleted of cholesterol with 10 mm MβCD, lovastatin (5 μm) was added to the preincubation (1 h) as well as during the subsequent experiment. Cells were collected in 300 μl of ice-cold water and 30 μl of ×10 Endo H buffer (3% SDS, 1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6, 200 μl/ml 2-mercaptoethanol) were then added to the samples prior to incubation at 95 °C for 2 min. Aliquots (45 μl) were incubated in the presence or absence of 3 milliunits of Endo H (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37 °C, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. Lipid Analysis—Cholesterol was measured with nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) as described by Sandhoff et al. (35Sandhoff R. Brugger B. Jeckel D. Lehmann W.D. Wieland F.T. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Golgi membranes were diluted 5-fold in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2) and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with or without methyl-β-cyclodextrin prior to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C) through a 15% (w/v) sucrose cushion. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume with 1,4-dioxane. For quantitation, an internal standard was added to the samples, and after sulfatation of the cholesterol, cholesterol was measured with ESI-MS/MS by scanning in the negative mode for the parent ions of m/z = 97 (HSO4-) or 80 (SO3-), depending on the internal standard ([3,4-13C2]cholesterol and 2,2,3,4,4,6-D6-cholesterol, respectively). Phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and glucosylceramide analysis by ESI-MS/MS was performed as described previously (36Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Preparation of Methyl-β-cyclodextrin·Cholesterol Complex—Initially, cyclodextrin was pre-loaded with cholesterol according to Ref. 37Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar. By using ESI-MS/MS, it was determined that the efficiency of loading was 1:12 (cholesterol:MβCD; mol:mol). This method was then modified to allow for maximal loading of MβCD. To this end, 12.5 mg of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (average molecular weight of 1,309) was dissolved in 250 μl of H2O and heated to 80 °C. To this solution, 150 μl of 10 mg/ml cholesterol in methanol/chloroform (2:1) was added dropwise during continuous vortexing and incubated for 4 h at 80 °C. Non-solubilized cholesterol was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at RT for 14,000 rpm. The clear supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized. The cyclodextrin·cholesterol complex was dissolved in 322.5 μl of water (29.4 mm). Under these conditions, the efficiency of preloading was increased to 1:4 (cholesterol: MβCD; mol:mol). The concentration mentioned for MβCD·cholesterol complexes throughout this report is based on the MβCD concentration (unless mentioned otherwise, the cholesterol concentration is 4-fold lower). Preparation of DRMs—Isolated Golgi membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in ice-cold PEN (25 mm Pipes, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the detergent-insoluble material (DRM) was separated from the detergent-soluble material by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Transfection with a ts-O45-VSV-G-GFP—CHO WT cells were cultured in α minimal essential medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum on 11-mm diameter coverslips in 24-multiwell plates (Corning B.V., Life Sciences, The Netherlands) for 12 h. Cells were transfected with a plasmid (0.4 μg) containing a GFP-tagged temperature-sensitive mutant of VSV-G (ts-G-GFP) (38Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then incubated at 40 °C for 4 h to accumulate the VSV-G protein in the ER. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 40 °C in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of 10 mm MβCD·Chol (4:1) or 10 mm MβCD. In case cells were depleted of cholesterol with 10 mm MβCD, lovastatin (5 μm) was added to the preincubation (1 h) as well as during the release (45 min at 32 °C). Secretion of VSV-G protein was induced by replacement of the medium with fresh prewarmed medium (serum-free) at 32 °C for 45 min, cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, and images were taken with the use of a Leica confocal laser scan microscope. Cholesterol Affects Transport within the Golgi Complex—Cholesterol (Chol) can be incorporated into cellular membranes by the addition methyl-β-cyclodextrin·cholesterol complexes (MβCD·Chol) to intact cells. To study the effect of cholesterol on the secretory pathway, CHO cells were incubated with MβCD·Chol. Such treatment resulted in a significant change in the subcellular distribution of the Golgi complex. In these experiments, the Golgi apparatus was visualized by using several Golgi markers, including p115, GM130, and GFP-tagged N-acetylglucosamine transferase (39Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 40Shima D.T. Haldar K. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1211-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In control cells, the Golgi complex exhibits a typical perinuclear localization (Fig. 1). However, upon loading of the cells with cholesterol the Golgi complex dissociated into small punctuated structures throughout the cells (Fig. 1A). When cells were depleted of cholesterol by incubation with MβCD (confirmed by determination of total cellular cholesterol levels, data not shown), the Golgi localization did not change as significantly, but a more condensed perinuclear localization was consistently observed. The morphology of the Golgi apparatus is dynamically regulated by membrane flow processes at the cis-(incoming) and trans-site (outgoing) of the complex. This is dramatically visualized by the addition of Brefeldin A to intact cells. Brefeldin A inhibits anterograde transport to the Golgi complex and causes a complete disruption of the perinuclear Golgi structure (41Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Concomitant with changes in cholesterol content and Golgi morphology, protein transport through was the Golgi apparatus was also inhibited. As shown in Fig. 1B, loading of cells with cholesterol resulted in a strong inhibition of transport of GFP-tagged VSV-G protein (a secretory protein), as illustrated by its accumulation at the Golgi complex (Fig. 1B, middle panel) and sensitivity to Endo H (Fig. 1C). Under normal conditions, this protein accumulates at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, left panel) and is processed normally in the Golgi apparatus as shown by its resistance to Endo H (Fig. 1C). We could not observe inhibition intra-Golgi protein transport by extraction of cholesterol using MβCD alone. At high concentrations of MβCD, it becomes toxic to the cells resulting in cell death (data not shown). To determine the effect of cholesterol extraction on intra-Golgi protein transport, cells were pretreated with for 1 h with lovastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis (42Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R. Currie S. Stapley E. Albers-Schonberg G. Hensens O. Hirshfield J. Hoogsteen K. Liesch J. Springer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). After treatment of the cells with lovastatin and MβCD, protein transport through the Golgi complex was inhibited (Fig. 1, B (right panel) and C). Upon prolonged incubation with Lovastatin (24 h), addition of MβCD was not required to inhibit protein transport at the Golgi complex, further indicating the specificity of cholesterol extraction with MβCD (data not shown). To study an effect of cholesterol on transport processes related to the Golgi complex in more detail, we made use of a well characterized cell-free system that reconstitutes intra-Golgi protein transport (31Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, addition of increasing amounts of MβCD·Chol complexes to the transport reaction causes a strong inhibition of intra-Golgi protein transport, with half-maximal inhibition at 0.17 mm MβCD·Chol. To exclude the possibility that the inhibition of the assay signal by MβCD·Chol resulted from decreased glycosylation activity of GlcNAc transferase rather than from inhibition of transport, we used a glycosylation assay that determines GlcNAc activity under conditions that block fusion (32Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MβCD·Chol, however, did not inhibit the glycosylation of VSV-G protein under these assay conditions (Fig. 2B), indicating that MβCD·Chol specifically inhibits the transport process. Another criterion for specificity of inhibition is the existence of transport intermediates, resistant to the inhibitor. In the experiment described in Fig. 2C, the transport reaction was either terminated by placing the reaction on ice, or at these time points the inhibitor MβCD·Chol was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h (see, e.g. Refs. 32Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 43Melancon P. Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Weidman P.J. Serafini T. Gleason M.L.

Control samples treated with buffer only were incubated likewise at 30 °C until the end of the 2-h incubation period and served to represent the maximal transport signal. When MβCD·Chol was added 20-30 min after initiation of the reaction, a significant portion of the transport reaction became resistant to MβCD·Chol. Furthermore, 80 min (60-80 min in different experiments) after the beginning of the reaction, the full assay signal was obtained. Taken together, these data indicate that MβCD·Chol acts within the time frame of the transport process and that MβCD·Chol inhibits the transport reaction in a specific manner. Cholesterol Distribution in Golgi Membranes—The loading of Golgi membranes with cholesterol by the MβCD·CD complex was quantitated by nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) as described by Sandhoff et al. (35Sandhoff R. Brugger B. Jeckel D. Lehmann W.D. Wieland F.T. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, isolated CHO Golgi membranes (0.6 μg of protein) contain 320 pmol of cholesterol, in agreement with previously reported values (35Sandhoff R. Brugger B. Jeckel D. Lehmann W.D. Wieland F.T. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-loaded MβCD dramatically changes the cholesterol content of Golgi membranes. As shown in Fig. 3, with increasing concentrations of pre-loaded MβCD, we found an increased association of cholesterol with Golgi membranes, up to a 4.5-fold increase (at 2 mm MβCD) over the endogenous pool of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a major lipid in CHO Golgi membranes (0.57 mol of cholesterol/mol of phospholipid) (36Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the formation of microdomains (13Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Golgi-derived microdomains can be isolated as detergent-resistant membranes, enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (30Gkantiragas I. Brugger B. Stuven E. Kaloyanova D. Li X.Y. Lohr K. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. Helms J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1819-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine the amount of cholesterol that partitions in microdomains, Triton X-100 was added to solubilize Golgi membranes. After centrifugation, a detergent-soluble (soluble) and detergent-insoluble (DRM) fraction was obtained and their cholesterol contents quantified. Under these conditions, 62 ± 7% of the cholesterol partitions in DRMs (Fig. 3). This partitioning changes significantly in the presence of exogenously incorporated cholesterol. At 2 mm MβCD·Chol, 89% of the cholesterol is present in the detergent-insoluble phase (resulting in a 5.4-fold increase of this pool). 11% of the cholesterol is present in the detergent-soluble phase (resulting in a 2.5-fold increase of this pool). These results show that most of the exogenous cholesterol is incorporated in the detergent-insoluble phase. The capacity of Golgi membranes to absorb severalfold its endogenous cholesterol content suggests that under these conditions the general membrane fluidity might also be affected. We therefore determined the partitioning of other known microdomain-enriched lipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and of a bulk lipid (phosphatidylcholine (PC)) upon addition of exogenous cholesterol. In Golgi membranes, 85% of SM and GlcCer were present in DRMs. In contrast, most of the PC was detergent-soluble and only 28% partitioned to the detergent-insoluble phase (Table I). When Golgi membranes were loaded with cholesterol prior to detergent solubilization, the detergent insolubility of SM and GlcCer did not change significantly. Surprisingly, the pool of PC in the detergent-insoluble fraction was increased 1.5-fold to 42%. Because PC is a major membrane lipid (representing 37% of all phospholipids in Golgi membranes (36Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W. Nickel W.

https://openalex.org/W2060781560,"There is strong evidence that a functionally important cluster of amino acids is located on the COOH-terminal portion of the heavy chain of factor Va, between amino acid residues 680 and 709. To ascertain the importance of this region for cofactor activity, we have synthesized five overlapping peptides representing this amino acid stretch (10 amino acids each, HC1-HC5) and tested them for inhibition of prothrombinase assembly and function. Two peptides, HC3 (spanning amino acid region 690-699) and HC4 (containing amino acid residues 695-704), were found to be potent inhibitors of prothrombinase activity with IC50 values of ∼12 and ∼10 μm, respectively. The two peptides were unable to interfere with the binding of factor Va to active site fluorescently labeled Glu-Gly-Arg human factor Xa, and kinetic analyses showed that HC3 and HC4 are competitive inhibitors of prothrombinase with respect to prothrombin with Ki values of ∼6.3 and ∼5.3 μm, respectively. These data suggest that the peptides inhibit prothrombinase because they interfere with the incorporation of prothrombin into prothrombinase. The shared amino acid motif between HC3 and HC4 is composed of Asp695-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Gln699 (DYDYQ). A pentapeptide with this sequence inhibited both prothrombinase function with an IC50 of 1.6 μm (with a KD for prothrombin of 850 nm), and activation of factor V by thrombin. Peptides HC3, HC4, and DYDYQ were also found to interact with immobilized thrombin. A recombinant factor V molecule with the mutations Asp695 → Lys, Tyr696 → Phe, Asp697 → Lys, and Tyr698 → Phe (factor V2K2F) was partially resistant to activation by thrombin but could be readily activated by RVV-V activator (factor VaRVV2K2F) and factor Xa (factor VaXa2K2F). Factor VaRVV2K2F and factor VaXa2K2F had impaired cofactor activity within prothrombinase in a system using purified reagents. Our data demonstrate for the first time that amino acid sequence 695-698 of factor Va heavy chain is important for procofactor activation and is required for optimum prothrombinase function. These data provide functional evidence for an essential and productive contribution of factor Va to the activity of prothrombinase. There is strong evidence that a functionally important cluster of amino acids is located on the COOH-terminal portion of the heavy chain of factor Va, between amino acid residues 680 and 709. To ascertain the importance of this region for cofactor activity, we have synthesized five overlapping peptides representing this amino acid stretch (10 amino acids each, HC1-HC5) and tested them for inhibition of prothrombinase assembly and function. Two peptides, HC3 (spanning amino acid region 690-699) and HC4 (containing amino acid residues 695-704), were found to be potent inhibitors of prothrombinase activity with IC50 values of ∼12 and ∼10 μm, respectively. The two peptides were unable to interfere with the binding of factor Va to active site fluorescently labeled Glu-Gly-Arg human factor Xa, and kinetic analyses showed that HC3 and HC4 are competitive inhibitors of prothrombinase with respect to prothrombin with Ki values of ∼6.3 and ∼5.3 μm, respectively. These data suggest that the peptides inhibit prothrombinase because they interfere with the incorporation of prothrombin into prothrombinase. The shared amino acid motif between HC3 and HC4 is composed of Asp695-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Gln699 (DYDYQ). A pentapeptide with this sequence inhibited both prothrombinase function with an IC50 of 1.6 μm (with a KD for prothrombin of 850 nm), and activation of factor V by thrombin. Peptides HC3, HC4, and DYDYQ were also found to interact with immobilized thrombin. A recombinant factor V molecule with the mutations Asp695 → Lys, Tyr696 → Phe, Asp697 → Lys, and Tyr698 → Phe (factor V2K2F) was partially resistant to activation by thrombin but could be readily activated by RVV-V activator (factor VaRVV2K2F) and factor Xa (factor VaXa2K2F). Factor VaRVV2K2F and factor VaXa2K2F had impaired cofactor activity within prothrombinase in a system using purified reagents. Our data demonstrate for the first time that amino acid sequence 695-698 of factor Va heavy chain is important for procofactor activation and is required for optimum prothrombinase function. These data provide functional evidence for an essential and productive contribution of factor Va to the activity of prothrombinase. The prothrombinase complex, which is composed of the nonenzymatic cofactor factor Va, the enzyme, factor Xa, and the substrate, prothrombin, associated on a cell membrane-surface in the presence of Ca2+ ions, is responsible for α-thrombin formation during blood coagulation (1.Mann K.G.

The prothrombinase complex catalyzes the activation of prothrombin ∼300,000 times more efficiently than factor Xa alone (3.Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in the catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase as compared with factor Xa alone arises from a decrease in the Km and an increase in the kcat of the enzyme (4.Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Proteolytic processing of factor V by thrombin at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545, resulting in the production of the active cofactor, factor Va, which consists of a heavy chain (Mr 105,000) and a light chain (Mr 74,000), is required for the interaction of the cofactor with the members of prothrombinase (8.Nesheim M.E.

Proexosite I of prothrombin, which is present in a low affinity state on the molecule, is fully exposed following activation and formation of thrombin, and the affinity for its ligands increases by ∼100-fold (21.Anderson P.J.

As a consequence, there has been no interaction between prothrombin and factor V reported because the binding sites involved in the interaction between the two molecules are most likely hidden within their core and at least one of the two molecules must be activated and expose a portion or an entire exosite for the binary interaction to occur. Factor Va is required for the presentation of the substrate (prothrombin) to the enzyme (factor Xa). There is evidence suggesting that incorporation of factor Va into prothrombinase and its interaction with factor Xa and prothrombin, does not significantly alters the catalytic triad of the enzyme (35.Krishnaswamy S.

Additionally, mGluR5 stimulation elicited cyclical translocations of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate, which were opposite to that of γPKC (i.e. from plasma membrane to cytosol) and dependent on PKC activity, indicating that myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate is repetitively phosphorylated by oscillating γPKC on the plasma membrane. Mutation of mGluR5 Thr840 to aspartate abolished the oscillation of γPKC, but the mutation to alanine (T840A) did not. Cotransfection of γPKC with βIIPKC, another Ca2+-dependent PKC, resulted in synchronous oscillatory translocation of both classical PKCs. In contrast, cotransfection of δPKC, a Ca2+-independent PKC, abolished the oscillations of both γPKC and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Regulation of the oscillations was dependent on δPKC kinase activity but not on γPKC. Furthermore, the T840A-mGluR5-mediated oscillations were not blocked by the δPKC overexpression. These results revealed that activation of mGluR5 causes translocation of both γPKC and δPKC to the plasma membrane. δPKC, but not γPKC, phosphorylates mGluR5 Thr840, leading to the blockade of both Ca2+ oscillations and γPKC cycling.

This subtype-specific targeting proposes the molecular basis of the multiple functions of PKC. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; cPKC, classical PKC; nPKC, novel PKC; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphotidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PHD, pleckstrin homology domain; PLC, phospholipase C; PLA2, phospholipase A2; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DsRED, DiscoSoma red protein; KN, kinase-negative; siRNA, short interfering RNA; BAPTA-AM, O,O′-bis(2-aminophenyl)ethylene glycol-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester. are the most abundant receptors in the brain and are involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity (1.Nakanishi S. Masu M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2.Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). mGluRs are coupled to G proteins and exert their effects via various signal transduction pathways. Among the eight different subtypes of mGluRs, activation of mGluR1 and mGluR5 causes an increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol through activation of phospholipase C, which leads to mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (3.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar, 4.Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). Although both mGluR1 and mGluR5 are coupled to the IP3/Ca2+ cascade, the patterns of Ca2+ mobilization by these two mGluRs are distinctly different (5.Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6.Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Stimulation of mGluR1 induces transient and low frequency Ca2+ oscillations, whereas high frequency oscillations are stimulated by mGluR5 (5.Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activation of mGluR5 also induces the repetitive translocation of PKC between the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, which is synchronized with the Ca2+ oscillations. It has been suggested that feedback phosphorylation of mGluR5, but not of mGluR1, by PKC results in Ca2+ oscillation through Ca2+ mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum (5.Kawabata S. Kohara A.

However, subsequent studies provided controversial results regarding the involvement of PKC in the Ca2+ oscillation induced by mGluRs (7.Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R.

PKC plays a pivotal role in many signaling pathways, and the existence of multiple subtypes suggests that different isoforms have varied functions. The PKC superfamily consists of at least 10 subtypes and is divided into three groups, classical PKC (cPKC; α, βI, βII, γ), novel PKC (nPKC; δ, ϵ, η, θ), and atypical PKC (ζ, ι/λ), based on their structures (10.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar, 11.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 12.Osada S. Mizuno K. Saido T.C.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6927-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each PKC subtype has differential sensitivity to activators and shows tissue-specific and cell-specific expression, suggesting that each subtype plays a subtype-specific role in various signal transduction pathways and in the regulation of numerous cellular processes (10.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar, 11.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 14.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). The subtype-specific function of PKC, however, has not been clarified by conventional biochemical techniques due to the low substrate specificity among family members. Recent technical developments enabled us to monitor the movement of PKC in living cells using PKC fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (15.Oancea E. Teruel M. Quest A. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 16.Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Reports using GFP-tagged PKC subtypes have demonstrated that PKC translocation varies, depending on the PKC subtype and on stimulation (16.Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17.Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J.

These results suggest that correct spatial and temporal translocation of each subtype is necessary for its PKC activation and phosphorylation of the specific substrates. Analysis of subtype- and stimulus-specific PKC translocation provides a way to study their individual role in cell signaling pathways. In the present study, we explore the modulation of mGluR5a-induced Ca2+ oscillation by different PKC subtypes in living cells. We find that fast Ca2+ oscillations and γPKC translocation by mGluR5 are blocked by the nPKC-dependent phosphorylation of Thr840 in the C-terminal intracellular loop of mGluR5a. Materials—l-Glutamate, thapsigargin, O,O′-bis(2-aminophenyl)ethylene glycol-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), cytochalasin D, and colchicine were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Aristolochic acid, compound 48/80, and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone were obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Bromoenol lactone and D609 were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI) and Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA), respectively. Methylphenylethynylpyridine hydrochloride was from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Rottlerin, Gö6983, and Gö6976 were from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were obtained from the Riken cell bank (Tukuba, Japan). The HEK293 cells, stably expressing metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (HEK/mGluR5), were a gift from Dr. Nakanishi (Department of Biological Science, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All media were supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and the fetal bovine serum used was not heat-inactivated. Preparation of Plasmids to Express GFP- or DsRed-tagged PKC Subtypes and Their Mutants—The expression plasmids bearing cDNA of αPKC-GFP, βIPKC-GFP, βIIPKC-GFP, γPKC, γPKC lacking the C1 domain (γPKC ΔC1-GFP) or C2 domain (γPKC ΔC2-GFP), δPKC-GFP, δPKC-KN-GFP, ϵPKC-GFP, and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)-GFP were prepared as described previously (16.Sakai N.

An expression plasmid encoding γPKC-DsRed or MARCKS-DsRed was constructed according to the method previously described (16.Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding DsRed with a 5′ HindIII and 3′ EcoRI site was obtained by PCR using pDsRed1-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as a template. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-TTAAGCTTATGGTGCGCTCCTCCAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-TTGAATTCCTACAGGAACAGGTGGTGGCG-3′, respectively. cDNAs for γPKC or MARCKS were obtained from BS186 (16.Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or BS555 (21.Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26449-26457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), respectively. cDNAs of γPKC or MARCKS were subcloned into pTB701 together with PCR products for DsRed. We also constructed a plasmid encoding the C1 and C2 domains of γPKC fused with GFP (C1C2-GFP) by PCR using BS354 (17.Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense primers used for PCR were 5′-TTGAATTCGCCATGGTGAAGAGCCACAAGTTCACC-3′ and 5′-TTAGATCTCGGTACATTGTAATACTCGC-3′, respectively. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. The expression plasmids encoding the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of PLC-δ1 fused with GFP (GFP-PHD) and the mGluRs were constructed as described previously (22.Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 23.Nakahara K. Okada M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transfection of Plasmids into Cultured Cells—Transfection of plasmids was performed by lipofection using Fugene™ 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. For co-expression of plasmids, the same amount of each plasmid was mixed and transfected. Experiments were performed 24-48 h after the transfection. Observation of Translocation and Oscillation of GFP- or DsRed-fused Protein—Transfected cells were spread onto the glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and cultured at 37 °C for at least 24 h before the observation. The culture medium was replaced with normal HEPES buffer composed of 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3. Translocation of fusion proteins was triggered by a direct application of various stimulants at a 10 times higher concentration into the buffer to obtain the appropriate final concentration. The fluorescence of the fusion proteins was monitored by confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy (model LSM 510 invert; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). GFP-fused protein was monitored at 488-nm argon excitation using a 510-535-nm band pass barrier filter. DsRed-fused protein was monitored at 543-nm HeNe1 excitation using a 590-nm band pass barrier filter. DsRed and GFP were monitored simultaneously using multitracking software, which alternately detects each fluorescence by switching the laser and filter system quickly. Images were collected sequentially every 3 s. Data Analysis—The time course of translocation was recorded as a time series of 100-200 images for each experiment. Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss LSM 510 software, and the membrane fluorescence ratio was calculated. This was defined as the plasma membrane fluorescence intensity/cytoplasm fluorescence intensity in a 1-7-μm2 region of interest. Regions of interest were circles for cytoplasm and rectangles for the plasma membrane (see Fig. 1A). For each time point, the membrane fluorescence was calculated from at least five different regions of interest. These values were averaged and plotted to generate a time course of translocation. Knockdown of Endogenous δPKC by Short Interfering RNA—Knockdown of endogenous δPKC in HEK293 cells by using short interfering RNAs (siRNA) was performed as described previously (24.Irie N. Sakai N. Ueyama T. Kajimoto T. Shirai Y. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 21-nucleotide RNAs with 3′ overhangs of 2′-deoxythymidine were chemically synthesized by Nihon Bio Service Co. (Asaka, Japan). The siRNA sequences of human δsiRNA corresponded to the coding region 603-621 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. To generate a duplex of siRNAs, 20 μm sense and antisense single-strand siRNAs were annealed by incubating the mixed siRNAs in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 1 min at 90 °C followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. Transfection of duplex siRNA was performed by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the method described by Elbashir et al. (25.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8184) Google Scholar). Annealed siRNA was transfected at a final concentration of 250 nm into 90-100% confluent HEK/mGluR5 by lipofection, and the efficacy of knockdown was assessed by immunoblotting. l-Glutamate Induced Translocation and Oscillation of γPKC DsRed and GFP-PHD—The high frequency oscillatory translocation of Ca2+-dependent PKC, βII-PKC, in mGluR5a-expressing HEK293 (HEK/mGluR5) cells was reported by Dale et al. (8.Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We here focused on the neuron-specific γ isoform of PKC, γPKC, and examined its translocation upon activation of mGluR5. Fig. 1 shows that the application of l-glutamate (100 μm final concentration) to HEK/mGluR5 cells induced repetitive translocation of γPKC-DsRed between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. Simultaneously, we examined the translocation of GFP-fused pleckstrin homology domain (GFP-PHD) of PLC-δ1, which is released from the plasma membrane into cytoplasm when PIP2 is hydrolyzed and the amount of cytoplasmic IP3 is increased, perhaps due to its higher affinity for IP3 than PIP2 (22.Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 23.Nakahara K. Okada M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). During continuous stimulation of mGluR5, GFP-PHD also showed an oscillatory translocation from the plasma membrane to cytoplasm. The oppositely directed oscillations for GFP-PHD and γPKC-DsRed were synchronized with a frequency of 3-5 times/min (43-90 mHz, mean = 72.3 ± 5.3 mHz, n = 21) and lasted at least 10 min. Application of (1S,3R)-trans-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, an agonist of type I mGluRs, also induced the same oscillation of γPKC-DsRed (data not shown). Glutamate-induced oscillation of γPKC-DsRed via mGluR5a is also shown in Video 1 (Supplemental Material). The frequency of oscillation in Video 1 was 66.7 mHz. Characteristics of mGluR5-mediated Oscillations of γPKCDsRed—Activation of mGluR5 leads to the hydrolysis of PIP2 and the subsequent increase in two second messengers, DAG and Ca2+. DAG and Ca2+ translocate cPKCs to the plasma membrane by binding to their C1 and C2 domains, respectively (10.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar, 26.Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To investigate the source of these two second messengers, we first examined the effects of inhibitors for phospholipases on the oscillation of γPKC through mGluR5. PLC inhibitors (Compound 48/80) but not inhibitors for PLA2 (aristilochic acid, bromoenol lactone, and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone) or phospholipase D (ethanol) completely blocked the translocation of γPKC, indicating that DAG from PIP2 through PLC is indispensable for the mGluR5-mediated translocation of γPKC and that fatty acids or lysophosphates metabolized by PLA2 or DAG produced from phosphatidyl choline by phospholipase D are not involved in the generation of γPKC oscillations. The dependence of mGluR5-induced γPKC oscillation on intracellular or extracellular free Ca2+ was further studied by treating with EGTA alone, BAPTA-AM, and thapsigargin. Chelating extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA during the continuous stimulation of mGluR5 did not block the γPKC oscillation but slightly decreased the frequency of γPKC oscillation from 76.0 ± 4.0 to 61.0 ± 1.0 mHz. (Table I). In contrast, blocking the intracellular Ca2+ rise with 5 μm thapsigargin (Table I) by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase or by chelating both extra- and intracellular Ca2+ with 2.5 mm EGTA, 15 μm BAPTA-AM (data not shown) completely abolished the oscillation. Oscillations were not altered by the deletion of the C1/DAG binding domain of γPKC but were abolished by deletion of the C2/Ca2+-binding domain (data not shown). These observations strongly suggested that the mGluR5-mediated oscillations of γPKC are dependent on the activation of PLC and Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+-stores and do not require DAG production. However, the repetitive oscillations required the continuous stimulation of mGluR5, as the glutamate-induced oscillation of γPKC-DsRed was quickly abolished by the application of 50 μm methylphenylethynylpyridine, a selective antagonist of mGluR5. Neither inhibition of microtubule polymerization (colchicine) nor actin polymerization (cytochalasin D) altered the repetitive distribution of PKC (Table I).Table IEffects of various inhibitors on oscillation frequencies of γPKC-GFP or its mutants by mGluR5 stimulationWild or mutant γPKC and inhibitorsTreatmentFrequencymHzγPKC-GFP + glutamateWithout inhibitor72.3 ± 5.3With compound 48/80 (100 μm)Pretreatment 10With aristolochic acid (100 μm)Pretreatment74.2 ± 15.1With bromoerol lactone (100 μm)Pretreatment70.0 ± 3.3With arachidonyl fluoramethyl ketone (100 μm)Pretreatment61.1 ± 16.4With 0.03% ethanolPretreatment65.6 ± 6.9With methylphenylethynyl pyridine (50 μm)Pretreatment0Post-treatment 20With EGTA (2.5 mm)Pretreatment70.0 ± 10.0Post-treatment61.0 ± 1.0With thapsigargin (5 μm)Pretreatment0Post-treatment0With colchichine (100 μm)Pretreatment76.7 ± 15.3With cytochalasin D (10 μm)Pretreatment62.2 ± 10.7Deletion of C1 domain of γPKC-GFP + glutamate71.3 ± 8.2Deletion of C2 domain of γPKC-GFP + glutamate0 Open table in a new tab nPKC but Not cPKC Inhibits the mGluR5-mediated Oscillation—It is still controversial whether or not the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Thr840 in the G protein-interacting domain of mGluR5 is necessary for the mGluR5-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations (5.Kawabata S.

Thr840 of mGluR5 can be phosphorylated by PKC in vivo and in vitro, and phosphorylation of mGluR5 at Thr840 abolishes the fast oscillation (30-60 mHz) but not the slower oscillation (10 mHz) through mGluR1a or mGluR5a (8.Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine which isoform of PKC is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ and PKC oscillation in our system, we investigated the effects of overexpression of other PKC isoforms on glutamate-induced oscillation of γPKC. As shown in Fig. 2, when βIIPKC-GFP, which is also a member of DAG- and Ca2+-dependent PKC (cPKC), and γPKC-DsRed were co-transfected into HEK/mGluR5 cells, synchronous oscillation of γPKC-DsRed and βIIPKC-GFP was observed (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Material, Video 2). The same result was obtained when either αPKC-GFP or βIPKC-GFP was co-transfected with γPKC (Table II). However, as shown in Fig. 2B, when δPKC-GFP, which is a member of DAG-dependent and Ca2+-independent PKC (nPKC), was co-expressed, mGluR5 stimulated a single translocation of γPKC-DsRed and δPKC-GFP to the plasma membrane, but subsequent oscillatory translocations were not observed. Overexpression of ϵPKC-GFP also blocked the oscillation; however, ζPKC, an atypical PKC, did not respond to mGluR5 activation and did not influence γPKC oscillation (Table II). The inhibitory effect of δPKC-GFP was due to the kinase activity of δPKC-GFP, because the treatment with rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of δPKC, restored the γPKC oscillation even in the HEK/mGluR5 cells overexpressing δPKC-GFP (Table II). Furthermore, overexpression of the kinase-dead mutant of δPKC (δPKC-KN-GFP) with γPKC-DsRed did not alter the oscillation of γPKC, and δPKC-KN-GFP itself showed a synchronous oscillation to γPKC-DsRed (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table II). These results suggest that DAG is repetitively produced by the hydrolysis of PIP2 and translocates δPKC to the plasma membrane and that the DAG production is synchronous to IP3 and Ca2+ mobilization.Table IIOscillatory translocation of various PKC subtypes and their mutants induced by mGluR5 stimulationExpressed PKCsFrequencyγPKC DsREDCo-expressed PKC-GFPmHzγPKC DsREDAlone72.3 ± 5.3With αPKC-GFP71.3 ± 10.571.3 ± 10.5With βIPKC-GFP74.1 ± 3.674.1 ± 3.6With βIIPKC-GFP73.2 ± 7.973.2 ± 7.9With δPKC-GFP3.3 ± 0aTranslocated once throughout the observation for 300 s.3.3 ± 0aTranslocated once throughout the observation for 300 s.With δPKC-KN-GFP70.4 ± 6.770.4 ± 6.7With δPKC-GFP (rottlerin)69.4 ± 11.369.4 ± 11.3With ϵPKC-GFP3.3 ± 0aTranslocated once throughout the observation for 300 s.3.3 ± 0aTranslocated once throughout the observation for 300 s.With ζPKC-GFP72.2 ± 5.23.5 ± 0aTranslocated once throughout the observation for 300 s.C1C2 domain GFP alone70.2 ± 13.2γPKC KN GFP alone69.5 ± 5.6a Translocated once throughout the observation for 300 s. Open table in a new tab γPKC Activation Is Not Necessary for the Ca2+ or γPKC Oscillation—Previous reports demonstrated that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of a single amino acid of mGluR5 is critical for Ca2+ oscillations. It was suggested that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of mGluR5 interferes with signal transduction between receptor and G protein, but subsequent dephosphorylation of the receptors restores signal transduction by hydrolyzing PIP2 (5.Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). If this model is true, it is possible that a Ca2+-dependent PKC such as γPKC repetitively interferes with signal transduction by phosphorylating Thr840 of mGluR5. Thus, to examine whether kinase activity of γPKC is necessary for the generation of mGluR5-mediated Ca2+ oscillation, we tested the translocation of γPKC lacking its kinase domain. After stimulation of mGluR5, the GFP-tagged C1C2 domain of γPKC showed oscillatory translocation, which was synchronous to that of full-length γPKC (Fig. 3A). The oscillation of C1C2 domain was also observed in the presence of Gö6983, a broad PKC inhibitor (Fig. 3B), indicating that kinase activity of γPKC is not necessary for the generation of mGluR5-mediated oscillation of Ca2+. Both δPKC and γPKC Are Translocated/Activated by mGluR5 Stimulation, but Only δPKC Is Responsible for Phosphorylating Thr840 of mGluR5—The inhibitory effect of δPKC-GFP on γPKC-translocation is in good agreement with previous findings that phosphorylation of Thr840 of mGluR5 inhibits the fast oscillation of Ca2+ (6.Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This putative PKC phosphorylation site is not conserved in mGluR1a. Rather, the acidic amino acid Asp is present in the analogous position. The substitution of the Asp in mGluR1a with Thr restored the PKC oscillation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, mutation of mGluR5 (Thr840 → Asp) abolished the oscillation, consistent with the previous reports (6.Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, substitution of Thr840 to Ala, an unphosphorylatable amino acid, protected mGluR5-mediated oscillation from the inhibitory effects of δPKC, consistent with a model in which δPKC is translocated to the plasma membrane and phosphorylates Thr840, which abolishes the oscillatory activation of PLC and γPKC. It is still unclear why δPKC, but not γPKC, is responsible for Thr840 phosphorylation, although both are translocated to the plasma membrane by mGluR5 stimulation. All cPKCs translocated to the plasma membrane as δPKC does, but only δPKC altered signaling (Table II). One possibility is that cPKCs cannot phosphorylate Thr840 because the translocation is not accompanied by activation. To investigate whether γPKC is active at the plasma membrane during the oscillation, we used MARCKS-GFP. MARCKS, a major PKC substrate, is constitutively present on the plasma membrane and translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation by PKC. We reasoned that, if membrane-associated PKC was active, PKC translocation would be accompanied by the reverse (i.e. plasma membrane to cytosol) translocation of MARCKS-GFP. After the application of glutamate to the HEK-mGluR5 cells expressing both MARCKS-GFP and γPKC-DsRed,"

Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Sialic acid is also important for different viruses and bacteria to infect host cells (3Alexander D.A.

Mutations in sialic acid biosynthesis cause sialuria, hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), and Nonaka myopathy in humans (see OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), accession number 603824). Therefore, it is important to identify the genes involved in sialic acid synthesis to understand the biological functions of sialic acids.Sialic acid synthesis begins with the generation of ManNAc in the cytosol following the epimerization of UDP-GlcNAc at the C-2 position and hydrolysis. Released ManNAc is subsequently phosphorylated to become ManNAc-6-phosphate. These two steps are catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase:ManNAc kinase, encoded by the human GNE gene (10Hinderlich S. Stasche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal halves of the protein encode the epimerase and kinase domains, respectively. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerization is regulated by strong feedback inhibition by downstream products including CMP-Neu5Ac (11Keppler O.T. Hinderlich S. Langner J. Schwartz-Albiez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M.

Lec3 mutants are slightly resistant to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and hypersensitive to ricin. They have reduced sialic acid on their cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids, although neuraminidase treatment releases significant amounts of sialic acid from Lec3 glycoproteins. They have no apparent defect in sialyltransferase activity. Here we show that two independent Lec3 isolates are mutated in the CHO Gne gene that encodes UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase:ManNAc kinase. Both mutants lack UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity because of different single nucleotide changes in the epimerase domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The 735 mouse monoclonal anti-α-2,8-polysialic acid IgG2a antibody was a gift from Dr. Rita Gerardy-Schahn (Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany) (22Frosch M.

Solution A containing 2 μg of cDNA and 50 μl of Opti-MEM I and solution B containing 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 50 μl of Opti-MEM I were prepared and left at room temperature for 5 min. Solutions A and B were then mixed and left at room temperature for 20 min. 100 μl of mixed solution were added to each well. The cells were cultured for 1 day and detached with 200 μl of trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen). The detached cells were additionally cultured in suspension for 1-2 days before FACS analysis.To obtain Lec3 cells stably transfected with a rat Gne cDNA or vector control, the cells were cultured on a 24-well plate and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) after 1 day as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were replated on a 10-cm dish after 2 days and cultured for 2 weeks in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1.5 mg/ml G418 (active weight). Colonies were detached and cloned by limiting dilution in a 96-well plate in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 1.5 mg/ml active G418.Flow Cytometry Analysis—To detect PSA or N-CAM on the cell surface, cells (1 × 106) from suspension culture were washed in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 1:200-diluted anti-PSA mAb 735 (29Hayrinen J.

After washing once with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were stained with 1:200-diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG+M for 15 min on ice. After washing twice with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were analyzed in a FACScan (BD Biosciences). To detect fucosylated antigens, CHO and mutant cells were transfected with cgFut6B cDNA encoding CHO α-(1, 3)fucosyltransferase-VIB (30Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10439-10450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000. After 1 day in culture, cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and cultured for 1-2 days in suspension. For FACS analysis, the cells were washed by PBS/1% bovine serum albumin, incubated with 1:100-diluted anti-SSEA-1, anti-CSLEX-1, or anti-VIM-2 antibodies as described in Ref. 30Zhang A. Potvin B.

When the control wells lacking lectin were confluent, the medium was removed and the attached cells were stained with 0.2% methylene blue in 50% methanol.Cloning of a Chinese Hamster Gne cDNA—To clone a cDNA derived from the Chinese hamster Gne gene, subpools of 20,000 clones each were made from a CHO-K1 cell cDNA library (31Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (a gift from Drs. Osamu Kuge and Masahiro Nishijima, Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) and screened by PCR with primers DGGNE1F (5′-CTCTCACCTGATMGAYGACTAYGGAAA-3′, forward) and DGGNE2R (5′-TTGRTARTGAGCCAGTTTTGTTATGGC-3′, reverse) designed from the mouse Gne cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_015828). From a subpool showing positive bands by PCR, a 5′ fragment of the hamster Gne gene coding region was amplified with an upstream vector primer and DGGNE2R. A 3′ fragment was amplified with DGGNE1F and a downstream vector primer, and the amplified bands were sequenced. A full-length hamster Gne cDNA was amplified with primers CHO-GNE7F(SalI) (5′-AAGCAAGTCGACGAGAAGAATGGGAATAAC-3′, forward) and CHO-GNE5R (5′-AACCTGGTTCCACTAAGTAGCTCTT-3′, reverse) using the positive cDNA pool as a template. To clone the Gne gene coding region from wild type CHO (Pro-5), the cDNA generated using the primers described above was cloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). To obtain FLAG-tagged CHO Gne protein, PCR fragments generated from cDNA were cut with SalI and NotI and cloned into SalI- and NotI-digested pME-3FLAG (32Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F.G. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to generate pME-3FLAG-CHO-GNE. The cloned full-length cDNA and the 3FLAG-tagged construct were sequenced and shown to be active following transfection and FACS analysis. cDNAs amplified from CHO total RNA were identical in sequence to the CHO-K1 cDNA library Gne sequence except for a change from Gly at position 568 in CHO to Asp in CHO-K1. The CHO-K1 Gne cDNA was not active in transfectants.Reverse Transcriptase PCR—For reverse transcription, the Superscript 1st Strand system (Invitrogen) was used. Briefly, 2 μl of total RNA (1 × 106 cell equivalents) from CHO or Lec3 cells were mixed with 1 μl of 500 μg/ml oligo dT12-18 primer, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and 8 μl of water and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. After cooling on ice, 4 μl of 5× first strand buffer, 4 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNA OUT were mixed and incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. Subsequently 1 μl (200 units) of SuperscriptII was added. The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min followed by incubation at 70 °C for 15 min and then stored at -20 °C. Reverse transcriptase products were amplified using the Long Template PCR kit (Roche Applied Science). In a 50-μl reaction, 5 μl of cDNA, 5 μl of 10× buffer1, 5 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP, 23 μl of water, 2 μl of 10 μm primers each, and 0.75 μl of polymerase were mixed. Reactions were treated at 94 °C (for 30 s), 62 °C (for 30 s), and 68 °C (for 1 min). Amplified PCR fragments were eluted from an agarose gel and directly sequenced.Site-directed Mutagenesis of CHO Gne cDNA—To generate mutations in the CHO Gne cDNA, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and pME-3FLAG-CHO-Gne plasmid DNA. The H132A-, G135E-, and D413K-point mutants were constructed with CHO-GNEMut1F (5′-ATCCTTCACATTGAAGAAGGAGAGGTCAGTGGG-3′) and CHO-GNEM-ut1R (5′-CCCACTGACCTCTCCTTCTTCAATGTGAAGGAT-3′), CHOGNE2F (5′-AACATCCGAATCCTTGCAATTGAAGGAGGAGAG-3′) and CHO-GNE2R (5′-CTCTCCTCCTTCAATTGCAAGGATTCGGATGTT-3′), or CHO-GNEMut3F (5′-AGTGCCTTGGCTGTTAACCTTGGAGGAACAAAC-3′) and CHO-GNEMut3R (5′-GTTTGTTCCTCCAAGGTTAACAGCCAAGGCACT-3′), respectively. After mutagenesis, all constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (40 μg) purified by TriZol (Invitrogen) was separated in a 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a Hi-bond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The probe to detect CHO Gne transcripts was obtained from a 2.5-kb SalI-NotI fragment of pME-3FLAG-CHO-Gne and radiolabeled using a Random-it priming kit (Stratagene). All procedures were followed as described in Ref. 30Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10439-10450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. After blotting, the membrane was incubated in prehybridization solution (0.05 m PIPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m NaPO4, pH7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 60 °C for 2 h. After adding radiolabeled probe, the membrane was incubated at 60 °C overnight. Washing was done in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (2×), and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (2×), and the membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 3 days at -80 °C. The membrane was reblotted using a radiolabeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe after stripping.Western Blot Analysis—To detect FLAG-tagged Gne, cells (5 × 106) were dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40 in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times with ice-cold TNE buffer at reverse transcription. One volume of 4% SDS in the sample buffer was added, the beads were boiled for 5 min and then cooled on ice, and the proteins were then separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were performed with biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin. To detect N-CAM or PSA/N-CAM, cells (5 × 106) were dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. Anti-N-CAM (N-CAM13) or anti-PSA (735) antibodies were added to the supernatants followed by protein A/G-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins were eluted in 4% SDS sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, Western blotted with anti-N-CAM (N-CAM13) or PSA (735) antibodies, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse IgG antibodies.UDP-GlcNAc:2-Epimerase Assay—An in vitro assay for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase was performed essentially as described in Ref. 33Horstkorte R. Nohring S. Danker K. Effertz K. Reutter W. Lucka L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. To prepare cell lysates, cells (1 × 107) were resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. Cells were passed through a 22-gauge syringe using 20 strokes and centrifuged for 20 min in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed. Supernatant protein was quantitated using the Bradford method. 100 μl of supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of reaction buffer (45 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc) and 25 nCi of 14C-UDP-GlcNAc and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After the reaction, 10-μl samples were spotted on a TLC plate (Merck) and separated in 1-propanol:water:1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (7:3:1). Unlabeled ManNAc stained with orcinol was a control. Dried TLC plates were exposed to a phosphorimaging plate for 3 days. After scanning for radioactivity, the TLC plate was stained by orcinol (34Kniep B. Muhlradt P.F. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). New spots different from UDP-GlcNAc migrated to the same position as nonradiolabeled ManNAc.Sialic Acid Assay—Cells growing in complete or serum-free medium were washed with PBS containing cations and extracted with 1.5% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Glycoproteins were ethanol-precipitated from ∼500 μg of extract protein determined by the Bio-Rad assay. Sialic acid was released by treating pelleted glycoproteins with 1 n HCl (Pierce) at 80 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation for 5 min in a microfuge, the supernatant was dried, resuspended in 60 μl of water, and 30 μl were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection on a PA 100 column (Dionex) eluted with a gradient of 7-40 mm NaAc in 100 mm NaOH over 15 min. Sialic acid was detected with the ED40 electrochemical detector. The area under the sialic acid peak was determined compared with a 2-nmol control.RESULTSLec3 Cells Have a Subtle Reduction in Sialylated Glycans on Cell Surface Glycoconjugates—Lec3 cells grown in complete medium with 10% serum exhibited small but significant changes in sensitivity to toxic lectins compared with parental CHO cells, being slightly hypersensitive to concanavalin A and slightly resistant to WGA and leukoagglutinin from P. vulgaris, respectively (Fig. 1A, Ref. 21Stanley P. Sudo T. Carver J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, FACS analyses using these and other fluorescence-tagged lectins at various concentrations did not detect significant binding differences between CHO and Lec3 cells (data not shown). We, therefore, investigated the expression of terminal glycan epitopes that contain sialic acid and fucose using monoclonal antibodies. Lec3 cells were transiently transfected with a CHO cgFut6B cDNA encoding α-(1,3)fucosyltransferase VIB (30Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol.

For comparison, parent CHO transfectants (capable of making all antigens) and the Lec2 transfectants (capable of making only Lex) were transiently transfected with cgFut6B and analyzed by FACS. In Fig. 1B it can be seen that Lec2 cells that lacked CMP-Neu5Ac transport into the Golgi compartment (17Eckhardt M. Muhlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By contrast, Lec3 mutants bound CSLEX-1 and VIM-2 antibodies, although both profiles were slightly reduced in intensity compared with parent CHO cells.A much more significant differenc"

These processes depend in part on force transmission through β1 integrins and actin filaments, but the role of microtubules in regulating mechanotranscriptional responses is not well defined. We assessed the involvement of microtubules in the mechanotranscriptional regulation of filamin A, an actin-cross-linking protein that protects cells against force-induced apoptosis by stabilizing cell membranes. Collagen-coated magnetite beads and magnetic fields were used to apply tensile forces to cultured fibroblasts at focal adhesions. Force enhanced recruitment of α-tubulin and the plus end microtubule-binding protein cytoplasmic linker protein-170 (CLIP-170) at focal adhesions. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated no direct binding of tubulin to actin or filamin A, but CLIP-170 interacted with tubulin, filamin A, and β-actin. The association of CLIP-170 with β-actin was enhanced by force. Force activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, increased filamin A expression, and induced the relocation of p38 and filamin A to focal adhesions. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole, independent of force application, enhanced filamin A expression and Sp1-mediated filamin A promoter activity, while stabilization of microtubules with Taxol inhibited force induction of both filamin A mRNA and protein. We conclude that in response to tensile forces applied through β1 integrins and actin the microtubule network modulates mechanotranscriptional coupling of filamin A.

We conclude that in response to tensile forces applied through β1 integrins and actin the microtubule network modulates mechanotranscriptional coupling of filamin A. During application of mechanical loads to connective tissues, the extracellular matrix distributes forces to cellular adhesive structures including integrins; these forces are in turn directed to structural components including the cytoskeleton (for reviews, see Refs. 1Critchley D.R.

Although the mechanotranscriptional regulation of these genes has not been analyzed in depth, force-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases can mediate increased binding of transcription factors to regulatory sites on the promoters of some of these genes (7D'Addario M.

Filamins are actin-binding proteins that organize actin filaments into orthogonal networks and enhance the rigidity of the actin cytoskeleton (10Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H.

Microtubules can modulate contraction and can also affect cell attachment to the extracellular matrix through regulation of turnover at adhesion sites (12Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E.

Thus microtubules may be involved in modulating mechanotransduction.Recent studies have established functional links between actin filaments and microtubules in a broad array of cellular processes including vesicle and organelle movement, cytokinesis, nuclear migration, contractile ring formation, and mitotic spindle alignment (17Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). An important element of actin-microtubule interactions that has not been characterized in detail is the interaction of these two networks in integrin-dependent mechanotransduction. We have previously shown that mechanical forces applied through β1 integrins activate the filamin A gene (9D'Addario M. Arora P. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol.

Here we describe the involvement of microtubules in regulating the activation of the filamin A gene after application of mechanical forces.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—Human gingival fibroblasts were derived from primary explant cultures as described previously (18Pender N. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from passages 6-10 were grown as monolayer cultures in α-modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Experiments involving promoter analyses used Rat-2 fibroblasts as surrogates for gingival fibroblasts as described previously (19Hui M.Z. Tenenbaum H.C. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell.

In brief, magnetite microparticles (Fe3O4, Sigma) were incubated with purified type I bovine collagen (Vitrogen 100, Celltrix, Palo Alto, CA; 1 mg/ml); following 30-min incubations, excess non-adherent microparticles were removed by vigorous washing, and cells were supplemented with fresh α-minimum Eagle's medium. A ceramic permanent magnet (Jobmaster, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was placed on top of the dish to generate a perpendicular tensile force of ∼0.48 piconewtons/μm2 cell area; this force level is comparable to that applied to cells in vivo during normal function (20Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation times were specific for each individual experiment as indicated.RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription (RT), and PCR Analysis—RNA isolation was performed with RNeasy reagents (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). All RNA preparations were treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for 30 min. The RT-PCR protocol and the oligonucleotides used in the procedure have been described in detail in previous studies (7D'Addario M. Arora P. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In each experiment, a non-RT control demonstrated the lack of DNA contamination.Immunoblotting, Immunofluorescence, and Immunoprecipitation— Cells were lysed, and cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (20Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on individual lanes, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed as described previously (22Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20516-20523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescent detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences), and radiographic films were exposed for standardized lengths of time using conventional protocols.For immunofluorescence, gingival fibroblasts were grown on 10-mm glass coverslips, incubated with collagen-coated microbeads, and subjected to magnetic force application as described above. Samples were collected at standardized time points and stained as described previously (7D'Addario M. Arora P. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The protocol used to detect protein-protein interactions by immunoprecipitation of target proteins with β-actin, filamin A, CLIP-170, and α-tubulin has been described previously (22Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20516-20523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were treated with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing sodium vanadate (1 mm) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Isolated proteins were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) that had been preincubated with antibodies to CLIP-170 or α-tubulin overnight at 4 °C. Samples were resolved by 5-20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with the specific antibody indicated in each figure, and ECL was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Genomic DNA Isolation and Filamin A Promoter Construction—To generate the 3224-bp filamin A luciferase promoter construct, we isolated intact fibroblast genomic DNA using the protocol of Goelz et al. (23Goelz S. Hamilton S. Vogelstein B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The construction of the amplified promoter has been described in detail elsewhere (7D'Addario M. Arora P. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47541-47550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The construct was verified through restriction enzyme cleavage and ligated into the pGL2 Basic vector between HindIII and BglII, and its correct orientation was verified through diagnostic restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing performed at the DNA Sequencing Facility, Center for Applied Genomics (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada).To generate the final wild type 75-bp filamin A luciferase construct (pFil75wtluc), the original 3.2-kbp filamin A promoter component was cut out, blunt-ended, and isolated from an agarose gel, and the portion containing the 75-bp Sp1 fragment was fused to the luciferase reporter construct. To synthesize the final 75-bp promoter construct containing mutations at the Sp1 binding sites (pFil75mutluc), two complementary oligonucleotides (MWG Biotech, described in Refs. 7D'Addario M.

Promoter scanning was used to determine the location of potentially important transcription factor binding sites, and these locations were specifically mutated (24Prestridge D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The hybridized oligonucleotides were ligated into the pGL2 Basic luciferase vector (Promega Corp.), and the correctly ligated vector was verified through restriction enzyme digestion.Bead and Protein Isolation—Cells in normal growth medium that had reached 80-90% confluence on 60-mm tissue culture dishes were incubated with collagen-coated or bovine serum albumin-coated magnetite beads. Beads were isolated from dishes as described previously (25Plopper G. Ingber D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cells were gently washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound beads and scraped into ice-cold cytoskeleton extraction buffer (CSKB; 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8). The cell bead suspension was sonicated for 10 s, and the beads were isolated from the lysate using a magnetic separation stand. The beads were resuspended in fresh, ice-cold CKSB and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), and the magnetic isolation was repeated. The beads were washed thoroughly in CSKB, sedimented with a microcentrifuge, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min to allow the collagen-associated complexes to dissociate from the beads. The beads were pelleted, and the lysate was collected for immunoblot analysis.Cell Transfections—Rat-2 cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described previously (7D'Addario M. Arora P. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2776-H2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following titration experiments to determine the optimal concentration of vector needed, cells were transfected, incubated for 18-24 h, and then subjected to specific treatments (described for each individual experiment). Following each treatment, cells were processed for luciferase activity as recommended by the manufacturer (luciferase assay system, Promega Corp.). The luciferase vectors pFil3.2luc, pFil75wtluc, and pFil75mutluc are described above. To establish transfection efficiency and to provide experimental controls, a green fluorescent protein vector (pEGFPluc) was used (Clontech).Statistical Analysis—For continuous variables, means and S.E. were computed. Unpaired Student's t tests were used for comparing means between two experimental groups. Analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons followed by Tukey's test for posthoc comparisons. Significance was set at p < 0.05. In each assay, n = 3, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.RESULTSForce-induced Recruitment of CLIP-170, α-Tubulin, and Filamin to Focal Adhesions—As force-induced increases of filamin A rely on transmission of force through focal adhesions to actin (7D'Addario M. Arora P. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9D'Addario M. Arora P. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47541-47550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we determined whether the plus ends of growing microtubules are targeted to focal adhesions in response to force applied at these sites by collagen-coated magnetite beads. We examined CLIP-170, which is implicated in the targeting of the plus ends of growing microtubules to focal adhesions (27Krylyshkina O. Anderson K.I. Kaverina I. Upmann I. Manstein D.J. Small J.V. Toomre D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Gundersen G.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R645-R647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The relative enrichment of CLIP-170 and α-tubulin was quantified after force application. Immunoblotting of proteins isolated from collagen beads was evaluated by densitometry and normalized to vinculin, an actin-binding protein that is a marker for focal adhesions. The relative amounts of bead-associated CLIP-170 and tubulin were increased substantially after force (>5-fold, p < 0.01; Fig. 1Ai). These data indicated that CLIP-170 and tubulin are recruited to focal adhesions by force, and they implicate microtubules in the global cytoskeletal response to tensile forces.We have shown previously that when force is applied to bovine serum albumin- or poly-l-lysine-coated magnetite beads there was no increase of filamin A transcription or enhanced filamin A protein production. In contrast, fibronectin-coated beads exhibited increased filamin RNA and protein by 4- and 3-fold, respectively, after force application (7D'Addario M. Arora P. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The participation of β1 integrins was confirmed by preincubating fibroblasts with a monoclonal antibody (4B4) that blocks ligand-β1 integrin interactions without inhibiting cell attachment (22Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20516-20523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells with monoclonal antibody 4B4 (at 1:30 dilution) for 30 min followed by application of force blocked the force-induced production of filamin A protein (-fold increase of filamin A by immunoblotting and analysis by densitometry: no force controls with irrelevant antibody, 1.1 × 106 units; force-treated cells with irrelevant antibody, 4.4 × 106 units; force-treated cells with 4B4, 1.25 × 106 units). Further, in experiments utilizing bovine serum albumin- or poly-l-lysine-covered beads in which bead attachment was equivalent, there was no induction of filamin A protein following force application (no force-treated cells with collagen beads, 1.5 × 106 units; force-treated cells with bovine serum albumin-coated beads, 1.55 × 106 units; force-treated cells with poly-l-lysine-coated beads, 1.6 × 106 units).These results showed the involvement of β1 integrins but did not assess the potential participation of other integrins such as αvβ3 and did not assess the possible increase in bead-associated β1 integrin. Accordingly we isolated bead-associated proteins from untreated (no force) and force-treated fibroblasts and analyzed this material for β1 and αvβ3 integrins (Fig. 1Aii). We detected a 2-2.5-fold increase in the level of β1 integrin associated with collagen-coated magnetite beads following force application. We found very little detectable αvβ3 integrin with or without force application in bead-associated protein. Confirmation of the ability of the monoclonal antibody to detect αvβ3 integrin in these cells was confirmed by immunoblotting whole cell lysates (Fig. 1Aii, lane c).We assessed whether the collagen beads remained on the cell surface or were potentially internalized over time. Cells were incubated with magnetite beads coated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled collagen for up to 4 h. Trypan blue quenching of the cell surface fluorescence showed that the difference in the pre- and postquench fluorescence (an estimate of the amount of cell surface fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled collagen) at 30 min compared with 4 h of force was not significantly different (7.14 ± 1.66 fluorescence units at 30 min and 8.69 ± 2.31 fluorescence units at 4 h, p > 0.2). Therefore the collagen beads remained largely on the cell surface during force application.As tensile force is applied to cells through focal adhesions formed adjacent to the collagen beads, we assessed whether there was force-induced recruitment of filamin A protein to the bead complexes. Collagen bead-associated proteins were examined by immunoblotting and quantified by densitometry following adjustment for bead numbers. Application of tensile force caused a 3-fold increase of filamin A to the bead within 4 h (p < 0.01, Fig. 1B). Taxol treatment exerted no effect on force-induced recruitment of filamin A. Nocodazole strongly enhanced filamin A recruitment to beads independent of force application.The results described above demonstrate that force application recruits CLIP-170, α-tubulin, and filamin A to sites of force application, but they do not show whether α-tubulin or CLIP-170 is associated with actin/filamin A and whether this association is affected by force. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to CLIP-170 or α-tubulin, and the immunoprecipitates were blotted for filamin A and β-actin (Fig. 1C). The specificity of the monoclonal antibody to CLIP-170 for immunoprecipitation has been described previously (29Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C. Drabek K. Stepanova T. Verkerk T. Vermeulen W. Burgering B. De Zeeuw I. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Cell. 2001; 104: 923-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). CLIP-170 interacted with both filamin A and β-actin, while, as expected, α-tubulin interacted with only CLIP-170 (Fig. 1C). Force had no effect on the association of CLIP-170 with filamin A, but force increased the amount of β-actin co-precipitated by CLIP-170 by >3-fold, suggesting that interactions of actin filaments with CLIP-170 were increased during periods of applied force. As regulation of filamin A by force may be mediated by Sp1 and pp38 (9D'Addario M. Arora P. Ellen R. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47541-47550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we also immunoblotted immunoprecipitates of α-tubulin for Sp1, pp38, and p38 but found no detectable interactions.Effect of Microtubule Disruption—We assessed the involvement of microtubules in regulating the distribution and expression of filamin A after application of tensile forces through collagen receptors. Preliminary experiments with nocodazole (1 μm) and the microtubule stabilization agent paclitaxel (Taxol, 0.5 μm) were conducted, and cells were immunostained with antibodies to α-tubulin to verify that the microtubule network was depolymerized (nocodazole) or was stabilized (Taxol). When cells were incubated with these agents for 2-8 h (the duration of the force application experiments), microtubules were either poorly stained (after nocodazole) or were largely unaffected (Taxol, data not shown). Immunohistochemical examination of filamin A in force-treated cells showed increased overall staining intensity within 4 h of force application (Fig. 2). Pretreatment with nocodazole caused redistribution of filamin A to the cell periphery, an effect that was enhanced by force application. Taxol blocked force-induced redistribution of filamin A.Fig. 2Force application causes redistribution of filamin A. Cells were grown on glass slides, incubated with collagen-coated magnetite beads, and either untreated (A, C, and E) or subjected to a vertically directed force (B, D, and F) (0.48 piconewtons/μm2, 4 h) with a magnet. Cells were fixed with methanol, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and immunostained for filamin A. Force application increases total filamin A staining. Pretreatment with nocodazole (C and D) increases filamin staining in the cell periphery that is further enhanced by force application. There is little increase of s"

Mouse T-cell hybridomas specific for these epitopes were generated to study the mechanisms of proteolytic processing of recombinant protective antigen for antigen presentation by bone marrow-derived macrophages. Overall, epitopes differed considerably in their processing requirements. In particular, the kinetics of presentation, ranging from 15 (fast) to 120 min (slow), suggested sequential liberation of epitopes during proteolytic processing of the intact PA molecule. Pretreatment of macrophages with ammonium chloride or inhibitors of the major enzyme families showed that T-cell responses to an epitope presented with fast kinetics were unaffected by raising endosomal pH or inhibiting cysteine or aspartic proteinases, suggesting presentation independent of lysosomal processing. In contrast, responses to epitopes presented with slower kinetics were dependent on low pH and the activity of cysteine or aspartic proteinases indicating a requirement for lysosomal processing. In addition, responses to all epitopes, whether their presentation was dependent on low pH or not, were prevented by treatment of macrophages with broad spectrum serine proteinase inhibitors. Thus, our data are consistent with a model of sequential antigen processing within the endosomal system, beginning with a pre-processing step mediated by serine or metalloproteinases prior to further processing by lysosomal enzymes. Rapidly presented epitopes seemed to require only limited proteolysis at earlier stages of endocytosis, whereas the majority of epitopes required more extensive processing by neutral proteinases followed by lysosomal enzymes.

Peptide epitopes liberated during processing usually bind newly synthesized MHC class II molecules optimally at low pH under the control of chaperones DM and DO following degradation of the invariant chain. Alternatively, epitopes in structurally flexible regions of protein antigens may bind mature MHC class II recycled from the APC surface in neutral or mildly acidic endosomal compartments (24Robinson J.H. Delvig A.A. Immunology. 2002; 105: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Sinnathamby G. Eisenlohr L.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3504-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further processing or “trimming” of exposed amino acids of the peptides already bound to MHC molecules can occur (38Sercarz E.E. Maverakis E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), mediated by enzymes such as the metalloproteinase aminopeptidase N (39Amoscato A.A. Prenovitz D.A. Lotze M.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4023-4032PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide-MHC complexes are transported to the APC surface where they can bind T-cell antigen receptors in the formation or an immunological synapse leading to T-cell activation of anergy (40van der Merwe P.A. Davis S.J. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 659-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We investigated how recombinant PA is processed by macrophages for presentation to CD4+ T-cell hybridomas and conclude that T-cell epitopes of PA may be sequentially released for presentation at different stages of endosomal processing. Recombinant Protective Antigen and Synthetic Peptides—Recombinant PA protein (rPA) of B. anthracis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (16Flick-Smith H.C. Walker N.J. Gibson P. Bullifent H. Hayward S. Miller J. Titball R.W. Williamson E.D. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1653-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides representing 20 amino acid stretches of the PA sequence were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Unit, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. The diagrams of PA structure shown in Fig. 1 were created by DS ViewerPro 5.0 software (Accelerys Inc., San Diego, CA) using the Protein Data Bank file AccI obtained from the NCBI website www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi. Cells and Chemicals—Culture media, chemicals, and metabolic inhibitors (Table I) were purchased from Sigma. All cells were grown in culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 3 mml-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 30 μg/ml gentamycin). T-cell hybridomas were generated by polyethylene-glycol fusion of BW5147 (TCRα-β-) cells (provided by Dr. P. Marrack, Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, and Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver) with CD4+ T-cell lines from rPA-immunized BALB/c (H2d haplotype) and BALB.K (H2k) mice. The specificity of T-cell hybridomas was determined from their response to overlapping synthetic peptides representing the complete PA sequence. T-cell hybridomas, each specific for one of the 5 major epitopes distributed in domains 1, 3, and 4 of PA, recognized rPA as well as synthetic peptides including the sequence of the relevant epitope (Table II) when presented by histocompatible APC.Table IInhibitors of antigen processingInhibitorEffect onSolventDose rangeRefs.NH4ClpHH2O100 mm57Conte M.P.

Macrophages were grown from femoral bone marrow cells of BALB/c and BALB.K mice by culture for 6 days in culture medium supplemented with 5% of a supernatant from the L929 cell line as a source of macrophage colony stimulating factor, as described previously (41Fischer H.G. Opel B. Reske K. Reske-Kunz A.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Macrophages were activated by treatment overnight with 1 ng/ml interferon-γ (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) before use in antigen presentation assays. Antigen Presentation Assay—Macrophages (4 × 104/well) were allowed to adhere to flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Macrophages were pretreated with metabolic inhibitors (Table I) for 30 min before adding antigen in the form of rPA or synthetic peptides for up to 5 h, and were then washed to remove inhibitors, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 4 min, and fixation was stopped with 0.05% Gly-Gly followed by washing three times. The viability of macrophages was confirmed by light microscopy in all experiments showing the inhibitors were not toxic for cells in the dose ranges used. T-cell hybridoma cells (4 × 104/well) were added to the fixed antigen-pulsed macrophages, and plates were incubated for 24 h before collecting culture supernatants. Fixed non-antigen-pulsed macrophages were used as controls. The response of T-cell hybridomas was measured as the amount of interleukin-2 released in a subsequent bioassay as proliferation of CTLL-2 cells (3 × 104/well) in the presence of T-cell hybridoma culture supernatants diluted 1:2 and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in triplicate wells of flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates. The wells containing CTLL-2 cells were pulse-labeled with 38.4 KBq of 3H-thymidine (TRA310, specific activity 74 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 18 h and harvested onto glass fiber membranes. Radioactivity was quantitated using a direct beta counter (Matrix 9600, Packard Instrument Company, Meridan, CT), and results are plotted as mean cpm of triplicate wells ± S.D. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and the data for representative experiments are shown. Kinetics of Presentation of PA Epitopes by Macrophages—We mapped 5 epitopes distributed in domains 1, 3, and 4 of PA and generated T-cell hybridomas specific for each epitope (Fig. 1 and Table II). T-cell hybridomas were assayed for their response to rPA presented by bone marrow macrophages to study the mechanisms of antigen processing of rPA. Macrophages fixed before addition of rPA failed to induce responses in any of the T-cell hybridomas (data not shown), showing that all epitopes required uptake and/or processing of the intact rPA molecule for presentation to occur. Macrophages were treated with rPA for different times before fixation, washing, and addition of T-cell hybridomas to determine the kinetics of presentation of each epitope (Fig. 2). The domain 3 epitope PA541-560 was already presented optimally after only 15 min of exposure to rPA before fixation of macrophages. The responses to epitopes PA64-77, PA154-167, PA659-672, and PA717-730 emerged more slowly and were maximal by 1 to 2 h (Fig. 2a). Presentation of synthetic peptides representing each epitope occurred early and was more uniform in kinetics compared with rPA (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the pattern of responses to rPA was not primarily a result of differences in the affinity of peptide epitopes for MHC class II or the T-cell receptor of the hybridomas. Thus, the data suggest that PA epitopes were processed and presented to T-cells at different rates. Role of Endosome Acidification in Antigen Presentation of rPA—Progress of endocytosed antigens from early endosomes to the low pH environment of late endosomes or lysosomes is required for presentation of many (17Nakagawa T.Y. Rudensky A.Y. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) but not all (24Robinson J.H. Delvig A.A.

Macrophages were treated with NH4Cl, a weak base that raises endosomal pH (44Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine whether a low pH is required for presentation of each of the PA epitopes. Presentation of epitopes PA547-560 and PA659-672 was unaffected by treatment of APC with ammonium chloride (Fig. 3, c and d), tk'1whereas presentation of PA64-77, PA154-167, and PA717-730 was profoundly blocked, independent of antigen dose (Fig. 3, a, b, and e). Ammonium chloride did not affect the ability of macrophages to present synthetic peptides representing each epitope (Fig. 3). The data suggest that presentation of T-cell epitopes of rPA showed a differential dependence on low pH characteristic of late endosomes. Effect of Cysteine and Aspartic Proteinase Inhibitors on Presentation of rPA—To determine which families of enzymes are involved in processing of T-cell epitopes from rPA, we investigated the effect of treatment of macrophages with broad spectrum proteinase inhibitors. The principal enzymes shown to be required for antigen presentation are lysosomal cathepsins of the cysteine and aspartic proteinase families that mediate proteolytic processing of either the protein antigen or the MHC class II chaperone invariant chain (21Watts C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Lennon-Duménil A.-M. Bakker A.H. Wolf-Bryant P. Ploegh H.L. Lagaudrière-Gesbert C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We used broad spectrum inhibitors of these families to determine whether enzymes largely localized to lysosomes were required for presentation of PA epitopes. E-64d ((2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester) is a membrane-permeable inhibitor that selectively inactivates most cysteine proteinases, including cathepsins L, S, and B (45Bond J.S. Butler P.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 46Tamai M. Matsumoto K. Omura S. Koyama I. Ozawa Y. Hanada K. J. Pharmacobio-Dynamics. 1986; 9: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). E-64d profoundly inhibited presentation of PA64-77 and PA154-167 at all doses studied. However, presentation of PA659-672 was more resistant, whereas epitopes PA547-560 and PA717-730 were completely unaffected by E-64d treatment (Fig. 4). Pepstatin is an acylated pentapeptide used to irreversibly block aspartic proteinases including cathepsins D and E (35Puri J. Factorovich Y. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3313-3317PubMed Google Scholar). Presentation of PA717-730 was particularly sensitive to treatment of macrophages with pepstatin (Fig. 5), whereas the remaining epitopes were relatively resistant to this inhibitor. Thus, the most rapidly presented epitope PA547-560 appeared to be relatively independent of processing by lysosomal cysteine and aspartic proteinases. Furthermore, among the more slowly presented epitopes the two from domain 1 of PA PA64-77 and PA154-167 showed a greater dependence on cysteine proteinase activity, whereas the carboxy-terminal epitope of domain 4 (PA717-730) was the most profoundly affected by inactivation of aspartic proteinases. Effect of Serine and Metalloproteinase Inhibitors on Presentation of rPA—We first investigated the role of serine proteinases to determine whether they were required for processing and presentation of PA epitopes. Macrophages were treated with the broad spectrum serine proteinase inhibitor 3,4-dichloro-isocoumarin (DCI), before their use in antigen presentation assays. DCI profoundly inhibited presentation of all epitopes under study from rPA over a range of antigen doses without affecting the responses to synthetic peptides (Fig. 6, a-e). Essentially the same results were seen using macrophages treated with another broad spectrum serine proteinase inhibitor, phenyl-methyl sulfonyl fluoride (data not shown). The more selective serine proteinase inhibitors TPCK and TLCK were used to inactivate chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like serine proteinases, respectively. TPCK profoundly inhibited presentation of all 5 epitopes to approximately the same degree over a range of inhibitor doses (Fig. 7a). TLCK had a differential effect, with PA64-77 and PA154-167 showing a greater sensitivity, PA659-672 intermediate, and PA547-560 and PA717-730 showing at least a 10-fold decreased sensitivity (Fig. 7b). TPCK and TLCK had no effect on peptide presentation. The data suggest that presentation of rPA required serine proteinase activity but that epitopes showed distinct patterns of dependence on chymotrypsin-like and/or trypsin-like serine proteinase activity. Treatment of macrophages with the broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline had a modest inhibitory effect on presentation of PA64-77, PA154-167, and PA659-672, whereas presentation of PA717-730 was unaffected and a degree of enhancement of presentation of PA547-560 was seen (Fig. 8), suggesting that metalloproteinases are active during processing of rPA, contributing to presentation of some epitopes, but destruction of others. We mapped 5 epitopes distributed in 3 of the 4 domains of the anthrax protective antigen to study proteolytic processing for MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation by macrophages. We used macrophages as APC and treated them with metabolic inhibitors to probe the mechanisms of proteolytic processing for presentation to T-cell hybridomas specific for each of the 5 epitopes (Fig. 1). Two epitopes located in domain 1 (PA64-77 and PA154-167) showed a similar pattern of processing reflected in the greatest sensitivity to inhibitors of both cysteine and trypsin-like serine proteinases, as well as dependence on metalloproteinase activity and sensitivity to raising endosomal pH. PA64-77 is not accessible on the surface of rPA, whereas PA154-167 is located on a loop adjacent to the furin cleavage site (Fig. 1). However, both epitopes seem to require a similar degree of processing for presentation. Of the two epitopes in domain 4, presentation of PA659-672 also showed a dependence on serine, cysteine, and metalloproteinase activity, but was resistant to raising endosomal pH, the latter suggesting processing by members of these enzyme families active at near neutral or intermediate pH (47Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, presentation of PA717-730, located in domain 4 close to the carboxyl terminus of PA, was pH-sensitive but unaffected by inhibitors of both cysteine and metalloproteinases, showing instead the most pronounced dependence on aspartic proteinase activity. Thus, these four epitopes of PA showed differential requirements for proteolytic processing. In particular, PA659-672 and PA717-730 showed significant differences despite the fact that these epitopes are located in close proximity in domain 4, suggesting the local structural context of an epitope is a major factor in the way it is liberated for MHC binding and presentation. Epitope PA547-560 from domain 3 showed the most distinct pattern of processing based on the rapid kinetics, independence on low pH, and resistance to treatment of macrophages with inhibitors of cysteine, aspartic, and metalloproteinases, strongly suggesting that lysosomal processing was not involved. In fact, the enhanced presentation of PA547-560 by macrophages treated with phenanthroline (Fig. 6) suggests that metalloproteinases destroyed this epitope. PA547-560 was not presented from the intact rPA molecule by pre-fixed macrophages (data not shown), and presentation was dependent on the activity of serine proteinases, suggesting that following uptake, limited proteolytic cleavage of rPA occurred rapidly at an early stage before transport along the endosomal pathway. Presentation of PA547-560 and PA659-672 share the common feature of resistance to raising endosomal pH. We have demonstrated that both epitopes were presented by mature MHC class II molecules, 2J. A. Musson and J. H. Robinson, unpublished observations. suggesting presentation of PA547-560 and PA659-672 in early endosomes by recycling MHC class II in the so-called recycling pathway. In contrast, presentation of PA64-77, PA154-167, and PA717-730 was dependent on low pH, and we have shown that these epitopes were largely presented by newly synthesized MHC class II molecules,2 presumably after targeting of rPA to acidic intracellular compartments for presentation by the so called classical pathway. Lysosomal enzymes such as the cysteine proteinase cathepsin S have a role in degradation of invariant chain which is required for optimal peptide loading of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules (48Villadangos J.A. Riese R.J. Peters C. Chapman H.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Sensitivity of PA epitopes, particularly PA717-730, to cysteine proteinase inhibitors may not indicate a direct role for enzymes such as cathepsin S in cleavage of rPA, but is still compatible with processing for the classical pathway. Macrophages (49Friedlander A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7123-7126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dendritic cells (50Agrawal A. Lingappa J. Leppla S.H. Agrawal S. Jabbar A. Quinn C. Pulendran B. Nature. 2003; 424: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) are the principal targets of anthrax lethal toxin. During toxin assembly, PA binds to a cell surface receptor (8Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A.T. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) followed by cleavage into 20 and 63 kDa fragments by cell surface-associated serine proteinases, particularly furin (51Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. G. T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furin cleavage of PA leads to heptamerization of the larger PA63 fragment to form a pore, although the smaller PA20 fragment remains associated by non-covalent interactions (52Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. Dekker, New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar). The epitopes in domain 1 are both located within the PA20 fragment, and their presentation was dependent on serine proteinase activity consistent with a requirement for furin cleavage. Indeed, in a separate study of the mechanisms of uptake of rPA for presentation to CD4+ T-cells, a specific furin inhibitor blocked presentation of PA64-77 and PA154-167, but not those in other domains of PA. 3J. A. Musson, N. Walker, H. Flicks-Smith, E. D. Williamson, and J. H. Robinson, manuscript submitted for publication. Thus, furin cleavage may be required to unlock domain 1 for presentation of epitopes PA64-77 and PA154-167, but not for efficient uptake of PA for presentation of the remaining PA epitopes. The rapid kinetics of presentation of PA547-560 from domain 3 compared with the other 4 epitopes of PA studied here, provides strong evidence that epitopes are liberated from rPA at different rates. The requirement for serine proteinase activity independent of low pH for presentation of PA547-560 suggests processing of rPA by neutral proteinases present in early endosomes or at the cell surface during uptake of rPA. The majority of serine proteinases have near-neutral pH optima, and those active at low pH, such as members of the carboxypeptidase C family (53Tan F. Morris P.W. Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16631-16638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), largely lack the endopeptidase activity for initial cleavage within protein antigens required for antigen presentation. Presentation of the remaining 4 epitopes of PA also required serine proteinase activity, but in these cases this was in addition to the activity of cysteine, aspartic, or metalloproteinases. The cysteine and aspartic proteinase activity is very likely to be of lysosomal origin, but this is not necessarily the case for the metalloproteinase activity, as some members of this enzyme family have near-neutral pH optima, such as aminopeptidase N located at the plasma membrane (39Amoscato A.A. Prenovitz D.A. Lotze M.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4023-4032PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, metalloproteinases could participate in events prior to lysosomal processing during antigen presentation. Collectively, the data suggest that processing of rPA occurs sequentially in a series of steps beginning with cleavage by neutral proteinases before rPA-containing endosomes make contact with lysosomal enzymes. For epitopes such as PA547-560 this initial step is sufficient for presentation to occur which is consistent with the exposed location of PA547-560 on the surface of domain 3 of PA. However, for the majority of epitopes processing may be initiated by neutral proteinases followed by further cleavage during subsequent lysosomal processing and loading of MHC class II. Serine proteinases have been implicated in cell-free or extracellular antigen processing for loading MHC class II molecules at the cell surface (32Accapezzato D. Nisini R. Paroli M. Bruno G. Bonino F. Houghton M. Barnaba V. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5262-5266PubMed Google Scholar, 33Santambrogio N. Sato A.K. Carven G.J. Belyanskaya S.L. Strominger J.L. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15056-15061Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 54Shimonkevitz R. Colon S. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2067-2074PubMed Google Scholar), but their involvement in endosomal processing within APC has not been studied in detail. Treatment of APC with some inhibitors of serine proteinase activity was shown to have a limited effect on presentation of epitopes of sperm whale myoglobin (34Takahashi H. Cease K.B. Berzofsky J.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2221-2229PubMed Google Scholar) or hen egg lysozyme (35Puri J. Factorovich Y. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3313-3317PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated sensitivity of presentation of T-cell epitopes of the surface M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes to the chloromethyl ketones TLCK and TPCK (36Delvig A.A. Robinson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3291-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and here we have used the more effective and inclusive broad spectrum serine proteinase inhibitor DCI to implicate this enzyme family in antigen processing. Pre-processing events to unlock proteins before further digestion to liberate epitopes for presentation have been proposed previously, but the examples are confined to lysosomal enzymes. For example, mice lacking the enzyme IFNγ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase show defective antigen presentation of MHC class II-restricted T-cell responses to a number of protein antigens (30Maric M. Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Dong C. Garrett W.S. Cannon K.S. Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Flavell R.A. Cresswell P. Science. 2001; 294: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Cleavage of disulfide bonds during antigen processing was also shown to be a crucial step in determining the availability of several T-cell epitopes within the merozoite surface protein-1 of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi (29Quin S.J. Seixas E.M.G. Cross C.A. Berg M. Lindo V. Stockinger B. Langhorne J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the participation of this particular enzyme may not be an invariable feature of antigen presentation, given that the amino acid sequence of PA does not include any cysteine residues. A pre-processing role has also been proposed for the lysosomal cysteine proteinase asparaginyl endopeptidase. This enzyme was shown to cleave after an asparagine in the carboxyl terminal domain of tetanus toxin essential to liberate a number of CD4+ T-cell epitopes regardless of their proximity to the cleavage site (31Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.-L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that a single cleavage of the intact protein led to extensive unfolding and exposure of cleavage sites for additional processing enzymes. We suggest that pre-processing begins at an earlier stage in the endocytic pathway mediated by serine proteinases, an enzyme family that hardly features in the extensive antigen presentation literature. We are currently investigating the nature of the serine proteinase activity involved in antigen processing by digesting rPA with subcellular compartments of macrophages fractionated by Percoll density centrifugation (55Griffin J.P. Chu R. Harding C.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1523-1532PubMed Google Scholar, 56von Delwig A.A. Ramachandra L. Robinson J.H. Harding C.V. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have shown that PA digested with Percoll gradient fractions corresponding to plasma membrane and early endosomes liberates PA547-560 that can be presented to a T-cell hybridoma by fixed macrophages. This activity is sensitive to inclusion of the serine proteinase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride during digestion, suggesting direct cleavage of rPA by serine proteinases is sufficient for presentation of this epitope. A clearer understanding of the sequence of events that lead to optimal processing and presentation of protective microbial antigens such as PA may be an essential step toward targeting vaccine antigens to induce optimal immune responses upon vaccination against infectious diseases that still pose a threat to humans.

We previously demonstrated that removing residues 594–606/614–645 resulted in an enzyme (Δ45) containing an intrinsic calmodulin (CaM) purified from an Sf9/baculovirus expression system (Chen, P.-F., and Wu, K.K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 13155–13163). Here we have further elucidated the differential requirement of Ca2+/CaM for enzyme activation between eNOS and iNOS by either deletion of residues 1165–1178 (Δ14) or combined deletions of residues 594–606/614–645 and 1165–1178 (Δ45/ Δ14) from eNOS to mimic iNOS. We measured the catalytic rates using purified proteins completely free of CaM. Steady-state analysis indicated that the Δ45 supported NO synthesis in the absence of CaM at 60% of the rate in its presence, consistent with our prior result that CaM-bound Δ45 retained 60% of its activity in the presence of 10 mm EGTA. Mutant Δ14 displayed a 1.5-fold reduction of EC50 for Ca2+/CaM-dependence in l-citrulline formation, and a 2–4-fold increase in the rates of NO synthesis, NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c reduction relative to the wild type. The basal rates of double mutant Δ45/Δ14 in NO production, NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c reduction were 3-fold greater than those of CaM-stimulated wild-type eNOS. Interestingly, all three activities of Δ45/ Δ14 were suppressed rather than enhanced by Ca2+/CaM, indicating a complete Ca2+/CaM independence for those reactions. The results suggest that the Ca2+/CaM-dependent catalytic activity of eNOS appears to be conferred mainly by these two structural elements, and the interdomain electron transfer from reductase to oxygenase domain does not require Ca2+/CaM when eNOS lacks these two segments.

An electron generated by NADPH is transferred in tandem to FAD and FMN and then to the heme, which has been proposed to be facilitated by CaM bound to a site situated between these two domains (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The NOS family comprises three isoforms that share domain structures, sequence homology, and catalytic properties (10Pollock J.S. Förstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Harald H.H.

Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, there are considerable differences among the NOS isoforms with respect to their cellular expressions, Ca2+-dependent CaM activation, and rate of electron transfer. Two isoforms, i.e. nNOS and eNOS, are constitutively expressed NOSs (cNOSs), but their expressed enzymes are latent until CaM binding is elicited by an elevated intracellular calcium level (13Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). In contrast, iNOS is absent or expressed in low abundance at the resting state, and its expression is induced by cytokines and endotoxins. The expressed iNOS is catalytically active, thought to be due to its high affinity for CaM binding even at a basal level of intracellular calcium (14Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Among the three isoforms, eNOS has lower electron transfer rate and catalytic activity than nNOS and iNOS (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

The results from studies of chimeric enzymes in which the oxygenase domain was swapped to the reductase domain of another isoform suggested that divergence in the reductase domain rather than in the oxygenase domain accounted for the differences in Ca2+ sensitivity and the rate of electron transfer between the cNOSs and the iNOS (15Nishida C.R.

An ∼50-amino acid fragment (Fig. 1) present in the FMN-subdomain of human eNOS (residues 594–645) and nNOS (residues 834–882), but absent in the corresponding part of iNOS, was proposed as an autoinhibitory element that impedes the electron transfer of cNOSs in the absence of CaM (19Ruan J.

Deletion of this region rendered the mutant enzymes less dependent on Ca2+ concentration, with a faster rate of electron flow (21Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13155-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in which residues 594–606 and 614–645 were deleted (Δ45eNOS) with preservation of residues 607–613 because it was conserved between the sequences of cNOSs and iNOS (Fig. 1). The Δ45eNOS contained an endogenous CaM bound to the protein isolated from an Sf9/baculoviral expression system. This mutant was completely CaM-independent as well as significantly Ca2+-independent in l-citrulline formation and exhibited a higher rate of cytochrome c reduction in a CaM-independent manner (24Chen P.-F. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13155-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results confirm that residues at 594–606 and 614–645 in eNOS control calcium sensitivity for CaM-dependent enzyme activation. However, because this mutant still requires Ca2+ to achieve a maximal catalytic activity, the calcium requirement for electron transfer and NO production may be controlled by other intramolecular mechanisms. Recent studies have implicated the C-terminal region of all NOS isoforms as an additional regulatory element in modulating electron transfer. The C terminus of cNOS contains a conserved serine (Ser1178 in human eNOS and Ser1417 in nNOS) with a kinase-dependent phosphorylation motif (RSRXX(S/T)) that has been noted in eNOS to be phosphorylated in response to a number of stimuli (25Fulton D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which mimics phosphorylation by introducing a negative charge, also causes a faster electron flow through enzymes. By sequence comparison with cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), Roman et al. (35Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de La Garza M.A. Kim J.J. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Roman L.J. Martasek P. Miller R.T. Harris D.E. de La Garza M.A. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. J. Biol.

Their experimental data demonstrated that deletion of the entire C-tail from rat nNOS (33 residues) or bovine eNOS (42 residues) greatly increased electron transfer into and between flavins in the absence of CaM. Paradoxically, their cytochrome c reductase activities were suppressed rather than enhanced by exogenously added CaM, and their CaM-induced NO synthesis activities were only 50% that of CaM-bound wild-type enzymes (36Roman L.J. Martasek P. Miller R.T. Harris D.E. de La Garza M.A. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29225-29232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, Lane and Gross (37Lane P. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19087-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) did not delete the entire C-terminal tail but instead partially removed the Ser1179 and the subsequent 26 C-terminal amino acids from bovine eNOS (Δ27). This mutant exhibited a 5-fold reduction in EC50 for calcium and a 2–4-fold increase in maximal catalytic activities. Both reductase and oxygenase activities of Δ27 were enhanced 3-fold by exogenously added CaM (37Lane P. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19087-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These findings underscore a complex control process of the C-terminal tail, especially with respect to the influence of CaM on electron transfer. Sequence alignment reveals that a segment at the proximal C-terminal tail is conserved in the sequences of human eNOS (residues 1165–1178) and nNOS (residues 1404–1417) but absent in iNOS. Besides the autoinhibitory loop of residues 594–606/614–645, this segment indicates another, more obvious dissimilarity between cNOSs and iNOS. We postulated that this conserved region in conjunction with the autoinhibitory loop might confer the dramatic differences in Ca+2 sensitivity and the rate of electron flux between eNOS and iNOS. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the changes in electron transfer and NO synthesis caused by deletion of eNOS sequence (residues 1165–1178, Δ14eNOS). We were particularly interested in learning whether combined deletions of Δ594–606/Δ614–645 and Δ1165–1178 would yield an eNOS mutant protein resembling iNOS in terms of the CaM requirement for reductase and oxygenase activities. Wild-type and mutant eNOSs expressed in an Sf9/baculovirus system were purified by adding an adequate amount of chelators to remove calcium, and the reductase and NO synthesis activities were measured. All of the purified proteins were free of the endogenous CaM. The results showed that a combined Δ45/Δ14 deletion mutant had a significant increase in the rates of cytochrome c reduction, NADPH oxidation, and NO synthesis in a completely Ca2+/CaM-independent manner.

A mutant (Δ45) with deletion of residues 594–606/614–645 from human eNOS (highlighted by a bold font) was previously characterized (24Chen P.-F. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13155-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A 14-amino acid insert near the C terminus of human eNOS (residues 1165–1178) represents another notable difference between eNOS and iNOS. Two mutants with either deletion of residues 1165–1178 (Δ14) or a combined deletion of residues 594–606/614–645 and 1165–1178 (Δ45/Δ14) were generated by PCR. Two pairs of primers were used for the generation of Δ14 and Δ45/Δ14: 5′-3385CTGCGGCGATGTTACCATGGCAA-3′ and 5′-3578GACATTTTCGGGTTAACGCTGCGCACC-3′; 5′-3560CGCATACGCACGTTAACCTTTTCCTTGCAG-3′, and 5′-3757GCACCACCTCTAGAGGGGAGG-3′. The wild-type eNOS (WTeNOS) cDNA was used as the template for Δ14 construct, and the Δ45 cDNA was used as the template for Δ45/Δ14 construct. All primers were synthesized by Genosys Inc. (Woodlands, TX). Sequences of mutant cDNAs at junctional regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the core facility of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. Expression and Determination of Nitrate/Nitrite in Sf9 Culture Medium—The cDNAs of WTeNOS and deletion mutants (Δ45, Δ14, and Δ45/Δ14) were inserted into the EcoRI site of pVL1392 transfer vector, which was used to generate recombinant viruses in an Sf9/baculovirus system. The nitrate/nitrite accumulation in culture medium was measured using a colorimetric assay kit from Cayman Chemical Co. Ten million Sf9 cells were seeded in each T75 culture flask, which was individually infected with 2 multiplicities of infection of recombinant viruses of WTeNOS and each mutant. Because of naturally low heme biosynthetic capability in the Sf9 cells, heme chloride (4 μg/ml) was added into the culture medium at 48 h postinfection to enrich heme content for the expressed protein. The amount of nitrite/nitrate in the culture medium was determined at 72 h postinfection by adding Griess reagent. The absorbance at 540 nm was recorded by using a Dynatech MR5000 microplate reader, and NO2-/NO3- was quantified using NaNO3 as standard. Purification of CaM-free Proteins of WTeNOS and Deletion Mutants—To generate the CaM-free mutant proteins, cells were harvested at 72 h postinfection, washed twice with calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and resuspended in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol). Cells were sonicated four times for 30 s and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column (1.5 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of Buffer A, and then with 10 column volumes of Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 M NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The protein was eluted with Buffer B containing 20 mm 2′-AMP and concentrated by Centriprep-30 (Amicon). The concentrated protein was applied onto a gel filtration chromatography (1 × 120 cm, Ultrogel AcA34) and eluted with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Protein concentration was estimated using an extinction coefficient of Soret absorption peak = 100 mm-1 cm-1 for the NOS proteins (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and also was determined by the method of Bradford (42Bradford M.M Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on a 7.5% slab gel according to the Laemmli procedure (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and stained by Coomassie Blue R250. For CaM immunoblot, the purified protein (15 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel under reducing condition and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blotted by monoclonal antibody raised against CaM (Sigma, catalog no. C-7055). Goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used as secondary antibody detected by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Ca2+-dependent Measurement—To measure NOS activity at different free Ca2+ concentrations, a 100 mm stock of Ca2+-EGTA (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used to obtain the desired free Ca2+ solution as calculated according to manufacturer's procedure using the Kd value of (Ca2+-EGTA) = 107.9 nm at 37 °Cin10mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and 100 mm KCl. The conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline was measured as described by Bredt and Snyder (13Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCL, 0.3 μm calmodulin, 100 μm β-NADPH, 100 μm H4B, 50 μml-arginine, 1 μCi of l-[3H]arginine, 10% glycerol, and various concentrations of free Ca2+ was incubated with 50–100 nm enzyme at 37 °C for 5 min. CaM-dependent Measurement—CaM-dependent NOS activity was tested at 37 °C for 5 min by measuring l-[3H]citrulline formation in a mixture containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 39 μm free Ca2+ (prepared from 100 mm stock of Ca2+-EGTA, Molecular Probes, Inc.), 100 μm β-NADPH, 100 μm H4B, 50 μml-arginine, 1 μCi of l-[3H]arginine, 10% glycerol, 50–100 nm enzyme, and various concentrations of CaM. Steady-state Catalysis—NO synthesis, NADPH oxidation, cytochrome c reduction, and ferricyanide oxidation were determined by measuring the optical absorbance change using a Shimadzu-2501 PC equipped with a temperature controller. A 10-mm light path cuvette was used unless indicated otherwise. The rate of NO formation was quantified from the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin by monitoring the absorbance increase at 401 nm using an extinction coefficient of 38 mm-1 cm-1 (44Murphy M.E. Noack E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 37 °C in the absence and presence of 0.5 μm calmodulin and 300 μm CaCl2 with a mixture (500 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm oxyhemoglobin, 100 μm β-NADPH, 100 μm H4B,1mml-arginine, 10% glycerol, and 50–100 nm enzymes. NADPH oxidation was measured as the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1. Assays were performed at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 0.5 μm calmodulin and 300 μm CaCl2 with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 μm NADPH, 1 mml-arginine, and 50–100 nm enzymes. Cytochrome c reductase activity was determined at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (500 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 μm cytochrome c, 100 μm NADPH, and 30 nm enzyme with or without 0.5 μm calmodulin and 100 μm CaCl2. The reduced cytochrome c was monitored with the absorbance increase at 550 nm and quantified using Δξ of 21 mm-1 cm-1. Ferricyanide reduction was carried out in a reaction mixture similar to that described for the cytochrome c assay except that 3.2 mm ferricyanide and a 5-mm-light path cuvette were used. The amount of reduced ferricyanide was quantified using Δξ of 1.02 mm-1 cm-1 at 420 nm. Nitrite/Nitrate Accumulation in Sf9 Culture Medium— Studies have shown that cells expressing iNOS spontaneously produce a large quantity of NO· measured as NO2-/NO3- in their culture medium at a resting state of Ca2+, whereas cells expressing cNOSs produces only a trace amount of nitrate in the absence of agonists (19Ruan J. Xie Q.-w. Hutchinson N. Cho H. Wolfe G.C. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22679-22686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether the deletion mutants behaved like iNOS, the constructs of wild-type and mutant eNOSs were expressed in Sf9 cells under identical conditions for 72 h. Western blot with anti-eNOS antibody was used to estimate the amount of protein expressed and showed that both Δ45 and Δ45/Δ14 were expressed at a level approximately half that of wild-type and Δ14eNOS (data not shown). Even with this constraint, the total amount of NO2-/NO3- from cells expressing Δ45 and Δ45/Δ14 was higher than that from cells expressing Δ14 (81, 37, and 62 μm for Δ45, Δ14, and Δ45/Δ14, respectively), whereas that from cells expressing wild-type eNOS was barely detectable (Fig. 2). The results suggest that all mutants with either a single deletion or a combined deletion of residues 594–606/614–645 and 1165–1178 are active at the basal level of intracellular Ca2+ but that Δ45 and Δ45/Δ14 are more sensitive to Ca2+ than Δ14. Purification of CaM-free Proteins—To obtain a CaM-free protein, the wild-type and mutant eNOSs were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by the presence of an adequate amount of EGTA and EDTA. The purified enzymes were shown to be near homogeneity with an appropriate molecular mass in Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A.). All mutants displayed the absorbance spectra identical to that of WTeNOS (45Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that the deletions did not perturb enzyme structure (data not shown). To further determine whether the WTeNOS and mutant enzymes contained an endogenous CaM, the purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-CaM monoclonal antibody. None of the proteins purified in the presence of EGTA and EDTA contained an intrinsic CaM (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4), whereas a Δ45 protein prepared in the absence of chelators and run parallel in SDS-PAGE had a detectable CaM (Fig. 3B, lane 5). Requirement for Ca2+ and CaM in l-Citrulline Formation— Dependence of l-citrulline formation on CaM was titrated by adding increasing concentrations of CaM (Sigma, catalog no. P-1431) along with 39 μm free Ca2+ and other cofactors in the reaction mixtures. CaM concentration response curves for wild-type and mutant eNOS are shown in Fig. 4A. The CaM-free Δ45 exhibited a constitutive activity in the absence of CaM, which was increased by increasing CaM concentration, whereas WTeNOS and Δ14 had a very low basal activity and required about 85 and 58 nm CaM, respectively, to reach half-maximal activity (EC50). Interestingly, Δ45/Δ14 was active in the absence of CaM, and its activity was reduced by about 25% in the presence of saturating Ca2+/CaM. Dependence on [Ca2+] was similarly titrated in the presence of 300 nm CaM, and the response curves are shown in Fig. 4B. The desired concentration of free Ca2+ was obtained by adding varied ratios of K-EGTA and Ca2+-EGTA as described previously (24Chen P.-F. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13155-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, Δ45eNOS had a considerable level of activity, which"

Although able to metabolize soluble inositol phosphates in vitro, the question of their significance as physiological substrates is unresolved. We show that inositol phosphates are not regulated by wild type PTEN, but that a synthetic mutant, PTEN M-CBR3, previously thought to be inactive toward inositides, can selectively regulate inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5). Transfection of U87-MG cells with PTEN M-CBR3 lowered Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 levels by 60% without detectable effect on PtdInsP3. Although PTEN M-CBR3 is a 3-phosphatase, levels of myo-inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate were not increased, whereas myo-inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphospate levels increased by 80%. We have used PTEN M-CBR3 to study the physiological function of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and have found that Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 does not modulate PKB phosphorylation, nor does it regulate clathrin-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor internalization. By contrast, PTEN M-CBR3 expression, and the subsequent lowering of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, are associated with reduced anchorage-independent colony formation and anchorage-dependent proliferation in U87-MG cells.

Downes C.P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The PTEN gene encodes a 403-amino acid protein, which is a member of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family. However, there have been no good phosphoprotein substrates identified to date. The tumor suppressor function of PTEN relies on its ability to metabolize acidic nonprotein substrates (2.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar, 3.Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P.

Indeed, PTEN dephosphorylates the signaling molecules, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) in vitro by removal of the phosphate at the 3-position of these substrates. The preferred substrate was found to be PtdInsP3 by a factor of some 200-fold (4.McConnachie G. Pass I. Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this respect, PTEN acts as a functional antagonist of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting cell-cycle progression (5.Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2318-2323PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for this includes a naturally occurring mutation (PTEN G129E), identified in sufferers of Cowden disease, in which patients encounter multiple hamartomatous lesions, especially of the skin, mucous membranes, breast, and thyroid. The PTEN G129E mutant has comparable activity to PTEN against the synthetic phosphoprotein substrate, polyGluTyrP, but is unable to dephosphorylate inositol lipids, indicating that the lipid phosphatase activity and not protein phosphatase activity is required for tumor suppressor function (3.Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). PTEN has several structural features, including an N-terminal phosphatase domain requiring a reduced cysteine (Cys124), a calcium-independent C2 domain, that has been shown to bind lipid vesicles in vitro, and a sequence shown to bind PDZ domains (see Ref. 1.Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In cells, PTEN exists as a phosphoprotein, with phosphorylation occurring at a region to the C terminus of the C2 domain (8.Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 9.Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the C2 domain, and not the PDZ-binding sequence, plays a crucial role in membrane targeting and substrate specificity (10.Lee J.O. Yang H.J. Georgescu M.M.

J. 2001; 357: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Functional interference with this C2 domain, exemplified by the artificially modified PTEN M-CBR3 protein first described by Lee et al. (10.Lee J.O. Yang H.J. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y.G. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), causes a reduction in the ability to interact with lipid membranes but marginally increases phosphatase activity toward inositol phosphate substrates (4.McConnachie G.

Expression of GFP-tagged PTEN suggests that it is predominantly cytoplasmic, in agreement with most studies utilizing PTEN-selective antibodies (11.Leslie N.R. Gray A. Pass I. Orchiston E.A.

Its role as a lipid phosphatase, however, requires interaction with membranes, such that PTEN M-CBR3 is unable to regulate PtdInsP3 levels, whereas myristoylated PTEN, which is anchored to the membrane, is more effective than PTEN in altering effects downstream of PtdInsP3 (12.Leslie N.R. Bennett D. Gray A. Pass I. Hoang-Xuan K. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15.Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Kaloudis P. Yang H.J. Pavletich N.P. Hanafusa H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7033-7038PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that the cellular substrates of PTEN may include inositol phosphates, particularly Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (16.Caffrey J.J. Darden T. Wenk M.R. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of PTEN could be mediated by regulation of these inositol phosphates. In this study we have clarified the effects of PTEN expression on inositol lipid and inositol phosphate levels in cells. PTEN expression lowered PtdInsP3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. We found no suggestion that PTEN could be a physiological regulator of inositol phosphates. The PTEN M-CBR3 mutant, however, selectively affected inositol phosphate levels, especially Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, without altering the levels of 3-phosphoinositide lipids. With this new insight into the effects of PTEN M-CBR3 we have re-evaluated previously published data in determining the roles played by Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and suggest that Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 is a proliferative agent, because lowering its levels correlated with decreased cell growth and anchorage-independent colony formation. Cell Culture—Tissue culture media and additives were provided by Invitrogen. U87-MG cells, obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, were maintained in minimal essential medium, plus 2 mm glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Expression vectors were introduced into the U87-MG cells using a previously described baculoviral delivery system adapted for mammalian expression (12.Leslie N.R. Bennett D. Gray A. Pass I. Hoang-Xuan K. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Assays were performed 24 h following DNA delivery for all experiments except FACS analysis, where cells were analyzed after 36 or 60 h. Levels of expressed protein were determined using fluorescence, as well as Western blotting of extracts from U87-MG cells expressing GFP-tagged protein. Transfection of U87-MG cells for proliferation assays was performed as described below. Vectors were prepared as previously described, except PTEN M-CBR3/G129E, which was prepared by cleaving PTEN G129E and PTEN M-CBR3 with PpuMI and BamHI in FastBacMam-EGFP, and replacing the wild type C-terminal region of the protein (from PTEN G129E) with that containing the M-CBR3 mutation. The sequence was verified, and virus was prepared as above. Analysis of Inositol Phosphate and Lipid Levels—Cells were labeled with 50 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) in inositolfree medium (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 96 h, prior to lysis in 0.6 m HClO4. The supernatant was neutralized with 1 m K2CO3 containing 5 mm EDTA, and the inositol phosphates were resolved on an anion-exchange column (125-mm Partisphere SAX, 5 μm; Whatman) using a gradient generated by mixing buffer A (1 mm Na2EDTA) and buffer B (1.3 m (NH4)2HPO4, pH 4.8, with H3PO4) as follows: 0-10 min, 0% B; 10-20 min, 0-10% B; 20-75 min, 10-35% B; 75-110 min, 35-70% B; 111-115 min, 100% B; 116-126 min, 0% B. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Inositol lipids were extracted from the HClO4 pellet, prepared, and analyzed as previously described (17.Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Peaks were ascribed by co-elution of standards in parallel runs. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm benzamidine. Lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. PAGE was performed using gels and reagents purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA) with 20 μg of cellular protein loaded per well. Western blotting, using Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) followed standard protocols and the manufacturers' instructions. Antibodies against the PH domain of PKBα and phosphoserine-473 PKBα were prepared as previously described (18.Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). PTEN antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphotyrosine-308 PKBα antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling. Internalization of 125I-EGF—We performed 125I-human EGF (Amersham Biosciences) internalization assays as described by Sorkina et al. (19.Sorkina T. Huang F. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27433-27441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 24-well dishes. Unless otherwise stated, 125I-EGF was added to cells in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for up to 10 min. At the end of the incubation, the medium was aspirated and the monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold minimum essential medium with Earle's salts to remove unbound ligand. The cells were then incubated for 5 min with 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 2.8) containing 0.5 m NaCl at 4 °C. The acid wash was combined with another short rinse in the same buffer and used to determine the amount of surface-bound 125I-EGF. The cells were then lysed in 1 m NaOH to determine the intracellular (internalized) radioactivity. The ratio of internalized to surface radioactivity was plotted against time. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 200 ng/ml unlabeled EGF. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Distribution—Adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once in PBS, and re-suspended in ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol in water. Cells were washed twice in PBS plus 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and stained for 20 min in PBS plus 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A. The DNA content of cells was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. Red fluorescence (585 ± 42 nm) was acquired on a linear scale, and pulse width analysis was used to exclude doublets. Cell cycle distribution was determined using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Proliferation Assays—Anchorage-independent colony assays were adapted from those described previously (20.Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, U87-MG cells were transiently transfected (FuGENE 6, Roche Applied Science) with pCDNA3.1+ alone, or PTEN expression constructs. 24 h after transfection, cells were suspended in 15% serum-containing media with 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 0.3% agar and layered in triplicate onto 0.6% agar medium in 6-well plates. Plates were then incubated for 3 weeks, with the addition of 0.5 ml of fresh medium after 10 days. To test anchorage-dependent growth, a similar method was employed to that used by Furnari et al. (21.Furnari F.B. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5002-5008PubMed Google Scholar). U87-MG cells were transfected and changed to fresh medium with 1 mg/ml G418 24 h post-transfection. Five days after transfection, nontransfected controls had very little viability. Cell numbers were determined at days 5, 7, and 9 using CellTitre96 reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As previously described, expression of PTEN in U87-MG cells caused a decrease in PtdInsP3 levels. Greater expression of PTEN (far above the levels of endogenous expression in PTEN-positive cells) caused a significant decline in PtdIns(3,4)P2 but not of PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. 1). We have attempted to express lower levels of wild type and mutant PTEN to study the cellular consequences of such protein expression. A comparison with extracts obtained from cells with normal PTEN status showed that levels of expression of GFP-PTEN were comparable with the range of PTEN expression found in a variety of cell types (Fig. 2). We were surprised to see that 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were either PTEN-null or expressed levels of protein below the detection limit of these assays, because this had not previously been reported and these cells have normally low basal levels of PtdInsP3 and PKB phosphorylation. Under the conditions used, levels of PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,5)P2 were not significantly decreased (Table I). Expression of similar levels of the catalytically dead mutant, PTEN C124S, and the lipid phosphatasedead mutant, PTEN G129E (which retains phosphoprotein phosphatase activity), slightly raised PtdInsP3 levels. It has been suggested that this is due to “substrate trapping,” resulting in a stable lipid-enzyme complex, protecting the PtdInsP3 from metabolism by other phosphatases (3.Myers M.P. Pass I.

PTEN M-CBR3, PTEN G129E/M-CBR3, and EGFP did not alter inositol lipid levels (Table I).Table IEffects of protein expression on inositol lipid levels in U87-MG cells Cells cultured in 6-well multiplates were labeled with [3H]inositol (50 μCi/ml) for 4 days. 24 h after DNA was introduced using a viral delivery system, cells were washed and quenched in 0.6 m PCA.

Under the conditions used, PTEN lowered Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 levels 30% below ExCell and EGFP controls. However, because PTEN C124S, PTEN G129E, and PTEN G129E/M-CBR3 mimicked the effects of PTEN expression, this appears, surprisingly, to be unrelated to the catalytic activity of PTEN. In contrast PTEN M-CBR3 significantly lowered Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 levels by 60% below ExCell control levels, and raised the levels of an inositol tetrakisphosphate by 80%. To our surprise the latter was not the direct product of the 3-phosphatase activity of PTEN M-CBR3, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, but was inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,6)P4), the metabolic precursor to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (Table II and Fig. 3). Dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 by PTEN M-CBR3 in vitro yielded solely Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, which was stable to further metabolism, indicating that, like PTEN, PTEN M-CBR3 was acting as a 3-phosphatase (data not shown). The lack of effect of PTEN G129E/M-CBR3 implies that these effects are related to the “lipid phosphatase” activity of PTEN and not mediated by any phosphoprotein phosphatase activity of PTEN M-CBR3.Table IIEffects of protein expression on inositol phosphate levels in U87-MG cells Cells cultured in 6-well multiplates were labeled with [3H]inositol (50 μCi/ml) for 4 days. 24 h after DNA was introduced using a viral delivery system, cells were washed and quenched in 0.6 m PCA.

Specifically, we tested whether Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 can regulate PKB phosphorylation, anchorage-independent colony formation, proliferation, cell cycle progression, or clathrin-mediated EGFR internalization. Expression of PTEN M-CBR3 in U87-MG cells was unable to alter the phosphorylation state of PKB. Expression of similar levels of wild type PTEN, which lowers PtdInsP3 levels, caused a marked decrease in phospho-T308 and S473-PKB, whereas PDGF receptor activation increased phosphorylation at both sites (Fig. 4). These results suggest that Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 does not affect PKB phosphorylation directly or interfere with PtdInsP3 dependent phosphorylation of PKB. In this respect, PKB appears to have a higher selectivity toward inositol lipids than previously suggested (22.Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Sakane F. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Watanabe Y. Katan M.

These results reiterate our recent findings with the substrate specificity of PTEN, in that short-chain inositol lipid analogues, or deacylated lipids can yield misleading data with respect to ligand affinities, because such studies fail to replicate binding in the context of a complete biological membrane surface. Inositol phosphates, including Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, have been implicated in inhibition of clathrin-mediated internalization, by means of preventing triskelion formation (24.Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E.

Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 380-385PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR internalization was monitored by means of incubating 125IEGF with U87-MG cells. Rates of internalization were identical whether PTEN M-CBR3 was expressed or not. Incubating U87-MG cells with 125I-EGF at 4 °C prevented any internalization (Fig. 5). Similarly, PD158780, an EGFR kinase inhibitor previously shown to block receptor phosphorylation, and hence internalization, was found to behave as expected, significantly inhibiting internalization (data not shown). Several complex cellular processes have been identified that rely to some degree on phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling and can be inhibited by PTEN, including colony formation in soft agar (10.Lee J.O.

J. 2001; 357: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of PTEN M-CBR3 to inhibit anchorage-independent colony formation was compared with that of wild type PTEN. U87-MG cells were transfected with expression vectors for untagged PTEN proteins carrying a Neomycin/G418 resistance gene and after 24 h seeded into soft agar with G418 selection. Cells transfected with vector alone or phosphatase-dead PTEN formed large numbers of colonies within 3 weeks (Fig. 6a). PTEN greatly inhibited colony formation, but this was not mimicked by the PTEN C124S, PTEN G129E, or PTEN G129E/M-CBR3 mutants. PTEN M-CBR3 had a small, but significant effect in reducing colony number (Fig. 6a), confirming its effects on anchorage-independent growth. Similarly, expression of PTEN lowered cellular proliferation under adherent conditions, as determined using an MTS assay (Fig. 6b). These effects were not mimicked by the PTEN C124S, PTEN G129E, or PTEN G129E/M-CBR3 mutants. PTEN M-CBR3, again, had a small, but significant effect in reducing proliferation (Fig. 6b), showing that Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 plays a role in proliferation. The effects of PTEN on anchorage-independent growth and cellular proliferation appear to be mediated by its ability to cause G1 arrest. The effects of PTEN M-CBR3 on cell-cycle distribution were also monitored. Cells treated with baculoviral expression vectors for 36 or 60 h were analyzed by FACS. As previously shown, (27.Cheney I.W. Johnson D.E. Vaillancourt M.T. Avanzini J. Morimoto A. Demers G.W. Wills K.N. Shabram P.W. Bolen J.B. Tavtigian S.V. Bookstein R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2331-2334PubMed Google Scholar) PTEN caused an accumulation of cells in G1, and a decline in the cells in S phase. Profiles of all other mutants tested showed no difference to GFP controls (Fig. 7), suggesting that Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 is not required to pass through any particular part of the cell cycle. The biological roles of PTEN have generally been attributed to its ability to metabolize the lipid second messenger, PtdInsP3. More recently, it has been shown that PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3)P are also substrates in vitro (28.Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Pisabarro M.T. Dillard-Telm L. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 360: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We show clearly that the primary substrate for PTEN is PtdInsP3 and that the inositol lipid bisphosphates are not lowered following PTEN expression at close to physiological levels in U87-MG cells. Higher levels of expression can regulate PtdIns(3,4)P2 but not PtdIns(3,5)P2. This may reflect the differences in rate of hydrolysis observed previously (4.McConnachie G. Pass I. Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or the relative rates of turnover of these molecules in vivo. Alternatively, this may merely reflect the product-precursor relationship existing between PtdInsP3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 via 5-phosphatases, such as SHIP and SHIP2 (30.Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis is likely to be independent of PtdInsP3. It has"
https://openalex.org/W2059277241,"The cleavage of C3 by the C3 convertases (C3bBb and C4b2a) determines whether complement activation proceeds. Dissociation (decay acceleration) of these central enzymes by the regulators decay-accelerating factor (DAF), complement receptor 1 (CR1), factor H, and C4-binding protein (C4BP) controls their function. In a previous investigation, we obtained evidence implicating the α4/5 region of the type A domain of Bb (especially Tyr<sup>338</sup>) in decay acceleration of C3bBb and proposed this site as a potential interaction point with DAF and long homologous repeat A of CR1. Because portions of only two DAF complement control protein domains (CCPs), CCP2 and CCP3, are necessary to mediate its decay of the CP C3 convertase (as opposed to portions of at least three CCPs in all other cases, <i>e.g.</i> CCPs 1–3 of CR1), DAF/C4b2a provides the simplest structural model for this reaction. Therefore, we examined the importance of the C2 α4/5 site on decay acceleration of C4b2a. Functional C4b2a complexes made with the C2 Y327A mutant, the C2 homolog to factor B Y338A, were highly resistant to DAF, C4BP, and long homologous repeat A of CR1, whereas C2 substitutions in two nearby residues (N324A and L328A) resulted in partial resistance. Our new findings indicate that the α4/5 region of C2a is critical to decay acceleration mediated by DAF, C4BP, and CR1 and suggest that decay acceleration of C4b2a and C3bBb requires interaction of the convertase α4/5 region with a CCP2/CCP3 site of DAF or structurally homologous sites of CR1 and C4BP."

Interactions between cells and components of the ECM are primarily mediated by integrins, which in turn leads to recruitment of a variety of other cellular proteins to focal adhesions, thereby providing a structural link between the ECM and actin cytoskeleton and serving as a signal transducer for temporal and spatial regulation of cellular events (3Gumbiner B.M.

Among these, Nck, which contains three SH3 domains and one SH2 domain, is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cell types, mediating receptor tyrosine signaling affecting growth factor signaling cascades, integrin-mediated cell adhesion signaling, and the organization of actin cytoskeleton (12Li W.

SPIN90 is known to participate in sarcomere assembly during cardiac myocyte differentiation, to function as an important regulator of actin dynamics (22Lim C.S. Park E.S. Kim D.J. Song Y.H. Eom S.H.

Lim C.S. Song Y.H. Ahnn J.H. Park D. Song W.K. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, the SH3 domain of SPIN90 is completely conserved among Fyn, Yes, and c-Src, suggesting SPIN90 may interact with a variety of proteins containing Pro-rich motifs, including signaling molecules, enzymes, and structural proteins. The SH3 domain of SPIN90 is also very similar to that of WISH, which has been identified as a WASP-binding protein (24Fukuoka M. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Fukami K. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that is able to strongly enhance N-WASP-induced Arp2/3 complex activation, resulting in rapid actin polymerization. Thus, SPIN90 may play a key role not only in signal pathway from cell adhesion but also in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. But to date few in vivo ligands for the SH3 domain or Pro-rich region of SPIN90 have been identified.With the aim of understanding better the function of SPIN90, we set out to identify proteins that interact with SPIN90 using in vitro binding assays and yeast two-hybrid screening. We found that SPIN90 has the capacity to mediate formation of protein complexes containing βPIX, WASP, and Nck and that this effect is highly dependent on cell adhesion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotic/antimycotics, complete Freund's adjuvant, incomplete Freund's adjuvant, and trypsin-EDTA were all obtained from Invitrogen.

Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory. Protein A-Sepharose and glutathione-agarose 4B fast flow were from Amersham Biosciences. Spectra/Por (molecularporous membrane tubing) was from Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc.

PDGF-BB was from Sigma.HeLa Cell Culture—HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml antibiotic/antimycotic and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. For suspension cultures, cells were detached from plates using trypsin-EDTA and collected in DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The collected cells were resuspended in DMEM-BSA, and incubated at 37 °C in suspension with gentle rotation for the indicated times. For replating after 2 h in suspension, cells were placed onto dishes coated with 20 μg/ml FN for the indicated times. In some cases, cells were serum-starved for 18 h in serum-free DMEM and then exposed to 20 ng/ml PDGF for indicated times.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with some previously described modification (25Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). The full-length SPIN90 cDNA (amino acids 1-722) was amplified using PCR and subcloned into pGBKT7 (a bait vector containing a GAL4 DNA-binding domain; GAL4 BD), after which a rat brain cDNA library in pACT2 (GAL4 activating domain-containing vector; GAL4 AD) was screened. Briefly, cells cotransfected with pGBKT7/SPIN90 bait vector and pACT2/GAL4 AD library were plated on Trp-, Leu- plates and Trp-, Leu-, Ade-, His--plates, and colonies were allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3-5 day. Positive colonies were selected based on their large size on Trp-, Leu-, Ade-, His- plates. To confirm the real interaction between SPIN90 and ERK1, pGBKT7/SPIN90 bait vector was co-transfected into yeast cells with pACT2/ERK1 vector. The transfectants were then plated as described above and analyzed.GST Pull-down Assays—To assess in vitro binding, full-length inserts of SPIN90, βPIX, or WASP were subcloned into pRSET, a bacterial expression vector, and translated in vitro using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system. The radiolabeled products were incubated with purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST fusion proteins (GST-Nck, β1 integrin, or SPIN90) bound to glutathione beads. All incubations were carried out in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin) for 6 h at 4 °C. The glutathione beads were then washed four times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and the radiolabeled proteins bound to the beads were solubilized by addition of an SDS sample buffer in the presence of reducing agent and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE.Purification GST Fusion Proteins and Generation of Anti-Nck and Anti-βPIX Antibodies—To generate antibodies, the cDNA corresponding to the three SH3 domains of Nck (amino acids 1-251) or the SH3 domain of βPIX (amino acids 1-63) were amplified by PCR and subcloned, in-frame, into pGEX4T-1 vector for GST fusion protein expression. GST-Nck three SH3 or GST-βPIX SH3 fusion proteins were then overexpressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-agarose 4B beads, after which the purified proteins were used as an immunogen for antibody production. After the fourth injection into rabbits, the serum specificity was tested by immunoblot analysis, after which it was further purified by affinity chromatography.Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed by boiling in a lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm leupeptin, 1.5 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm aprotinin), after which detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations in the soluble fraction were measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). Constant amounts of protein were then separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% BSA (for phospho-Ser or phospho-ERK1 antibodies) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, after which they were incubated first with the respective primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. The antigen·antibody complexes were detected with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, blots were stripped by heating to 60 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and reprobed.Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and extracted for 1 h at 4 °C in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The extracts were then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using BCA. Samples containing 1 mg of total protein were then taken for subsequent immunoprecipitation overnight, followed by an additional 4-h incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with the same extraction buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Immunokinase Assay for Active ERK1—To assay ERK1 kinase activity (26Seger R. Ahn N.G. Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Panayotatos N. Radziejewska E. Ericsson L. Bratlien R.L. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6142-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), HeLa cells were washed with cold PBS and extracted by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF), after which the cell lysates were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein content was determined with BCA. Phospho-ERK1 was then immunoprecipitated from samples containing 400 μg of protein by incubation with 2 μg of monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1 antibody overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C, after which 30 μl of 50% protein A beads were added to the immunocomplexes and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifuging the mixture for 1 min at 1000 × g, the beads were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer, and then twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm vanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF). After centrifuging again for 1 min at 1000 × g, immunocomplexes were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer contained 5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of substrate proteins (GST, myelin basic protein (MBP), or GST-SPIN90) for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were then boiled and centrifuged, and the supernatants were mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (8-12%). The gels were then dried and exposed in a MAC BAS (Fuji) as indirect autoradiography to check band intensity for 6 h or on x-ray film (Kodak) overnight.In Vivo Labeling—HeLa cells were metabolically labeled under exponential growth conditions. After washing the cells in PBS, they were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in 6 ml of phosphate-free DMEM containing 5% FBS. Thereafter, 1 mCi of 32Pi (10 mCi/ml) was added to the medium (200 μCi/ml), and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C to metabolically label the proteins. In some experiments, labeled cells were washed in PBS, harvested, placed in suspension for 2 h, and then replated onto FN-coated dishes in the same 32P-labeling medium and allowed to attach for 2 h. Cells were extracted in extraction buffer and further analyzed as described above.Transfection and Cell Adhesion Assays—cDNAs encoding the SPIN90 SH3 domain (HA-SPIN90 SH3; amino acids 1-61), Pro-rich motifs containing the Ser/Thr-rich region (HA-SPIN90 PR; amino acids 146-279), or C-terminal region (HA-SPIN90 C-term; amino acids 280-722) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3-HA vector for HA-tagged mammalian expression. Each construct was transfected into HeLa cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). For cell adhesion assays, transfected cells were detached, incubated in suspension for 2 h, and replated onto FN-coated dishes and allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing twice with PBS, after which the adherent cells were fixed for 5 min in methanol and counted under a microscope.RESULTSIdentification of Proteins Associating with SPIN90 in Vitro and in Vivo—Using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we have identified several proteins that interact with SPIN90. GST pull-down analysis carried out with in vitro-translated proteins showed that SPIN90 co-precipitated with GST-Nck,-βPIX, and -WASP, but not GST-β1 integrin (Fig. 1, A-D). Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that SPIN90 does indeed associate with Nck, β1 integrin, βPIX, and WASP (Fig. 1, E-H), suggesting that SPIN90 participates in β1 integrin-mediated signaling via protein-protein interactions. SPIN90 is unlikely to bind to β1 integrin directly, however, because amino acid sequence analysis revealed these proteins each to contain multiple Pro-rich motifs and SH3 domains (Fig. 1I).Interaction between SPIN90 and Nck Is Adhesion-dependent—To test the dependence of the SPIN90·Nck interaction on cell adhesion, lysates from adherent or detached cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assays. SPIN90 immunoprecipitates from stably adherent cells contained readily detectable levels of Nck, but no Nck associated with SPIN90 was detected in suspended or cytochalasin D-treated cells (Fig. 2A). Moreover, when lysates from cells placed in suspension for various times were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation, dissociation of SPIN90 from Nck was found to be more than 90% complete within 30 min after cell detachment, and their association was undetectable within 60 min. Notably, this effect was rapidly reversed by replating the cells on FN-coated dishes (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Cell adhesion-dependent interaction of SPIN90 with Nck.A, SPIN90 immunoprecipitates from adherent, suspended, and adherent cells pretreated for 30 min with 5 μm cytochalasin D were immunoblotted with anti-SPIN90 or anti-Nck antibody. B, SPIN90 immunoprecipitates from adherent and suspended cells and cells replated on FN-coated dishes for the indicated times were immunoblotted anti-SPIN90, anti-Nck, anti-βPIX, or anti-WASP antibody. C and D, WASP (C) or Nck (D) immunoprecipitates from suspended or replated cells were immunoblotted with anti-βPIX or anti-Nck antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By contrast, SPIN90, βPIX, and WASP remained associated in suspended cells. Likewise, the interaction between βPIX and WASP was apparent in both suspended and replated cells. The interaction between Nck and WASP was not detected in suspended cells and only weakly detected in replated cells (Fig. 2C); the interaction between βPIX and Nck was also absent in suspended cells, but was strongly detected in replated cells (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that SPIN90, βPIX, and WASP make up a molecular complex that interacts with Nck in a manner dependent on cell adhesion.SPIN90·Nck Interaction Is Dynamically Regulated by ERK1 Activation—Among the proteins isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening using a rat brain cDNA library and full-length SPIN90 as bait was ERK1, which was identified as binding to SPIN90 (Fig. 3A). GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that ERK1 does indeed bind to SPIN90 both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, consistent with earlier reports that ERK activity is regulated by cell adhesion (27Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we found that phospho-ERK1/2 was undetectable in suspended cells but that levels of phospho-ERK1/2 increased for up to 120 min after replating the cells on FN (Fig. 4A). Pre-treating the cells with PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, before replating blocked the increases in ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4B).Fig. 3Interaction of SPIN90 with ERK1.A, ERK1 was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening using a rat brain cDNA library with SPIN90 as bait. B, [35S]Met-labeled,invitro-translatedERK1 was incubated with purified GST-SPIN90 or GST protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, after which GST pull-down assays were carried out. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. C, to confirm the association of SPIN90 and ERK1, in vivo, HeLa cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SPIN90 antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-SPIN90 or anti-ERK antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Interaction of SPIN90 and Nck is dependent on SPIN90 phosphorylation by ERK.A, adherent HeLa cells were detached, incubated in suspension for 2 h, and replated on FN-coated dishes for the indicated times, after which the lysates were immunoblotted with anti-ERK1/2 or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. B, treatment with PD98059 (10 or 30 μm), a specific MEK inhibitor, suppressed ERK activation by cell adhesion. C, the lysates from adherent, suspended, and replated cells, with or without 30 μm PD98059 pretreatment, were immunoprecipitated with anti-SPIN90 antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Ser antibody. For in vivo labeling, HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated as described above. 32P-Labeled SPIN90 was immunoprecipitated with anti-SPIN90 antibody, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. D, cells treated as described above were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Nck antibody, and the precipitants were immunoblotted with anti-Nck or SPIN90 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined SPIN90 phosphorylation in adherent, detached, and replated cells in the absence and presence of 30 μm PD98059. Using in vivo labeling, we detected SPIN90 phosphorylation in both adherent and replated cells, but weak phosphorylation of SPIN90 was detected in detached or PD98059-treated cells. In addition, Ser-phosphorylation of SPIN90 was routinely detected in SPIN90 precipitants from adherent cells, but was abolished by cell detachment or PD98059 treatment (Fig. 4C). We were not able to test for the presence of Thrphosphorylation because of the absence of available antibodies. In parallel experiments, a strong interaction between SPIN90 and Nck was detected in adherent and replated cells, whereas their interaction almost disappeared in detached and PD98059-treated cells (Fig. 4D).That ERK1 phosphorylated SPIN90 was confirmed by in vitro kinase assays showing that immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-phospho-ERK1 antibody in adherent or replated cells were able to phosphorylate purified GST-SPIN90 protein and MBP, and this effect was blocked by detaching the cells or pretreating them with PD98059 (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, the interaction of SPIN90 and Nck apparently coincides with an ERK1-catalyzed change in the phosphorylation state of SPIN90 during cell adhesion.Fig. 5SPIN90 is phosphorylated by ERK1-immuncomplex in vitro.A, adherent, suspended, and replated cells, with or without PD98059 (10 or 30 μm) pretreatment, were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-ERK1 antibody. Immunoprecipitants were then incubated in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of substrate protein (GST-SPIN90, GST, or MBP). Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. B, relative band intensities (GST-SPIN90 and MBP) were determined by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Relationship between SPIN90·Nck Interaction and ERK1 Activation by PDGF—It is known that ERK1 can be activated by a variety of growth factors, including PDGF (28Leopoldt D. Yee Jr., H.F. Saab S. Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We found that activation of ERK1 by 20 ng/ml PDGF reached to the maximum within 10 min and decreased thereafter (Fig. 6A) and that the interaction of SPIN90 and Nck followed the same time course (Fig. 6B). AG1295 is a specific PDGF receptor antagonist that reversibly inhibits PDGF by competitively binding it its receptor. We found that AG1295 inhibited ERK1 activation by PDGF, as well as the interaction of SPIN90 and Nck (Fig. 6C). Likewise, 30 μm PD98059 specifically inhibited both PDGF-induced ERK1 activation and SPIN90·Nck interaction (Fig. 6D). By contrast, AG1478, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor antagonist, was less able to inhibit the interaction of SPIN90 and Nck (Fig. 6C). These findings clearly indicate that SPIN90 can be a substrate for ERK1 and that its phosphorylation by ERK1 likely modulates SPIN90·Nck interaction.Fig. 6Modulation of SPIN90·Nck interaction by ERK1 activated by PDGF.A, serum-starved HeLa cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml PDGF for the indicated times, after which the lysates were immunoblotted with anti-ERK1, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, or anti-SPIN90 antibody. B, lysates from cells treated with PDGF for the indicated times were immunoprecipitated with anti-Nck antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Nck or SPIN90 antibody. C, PDGF-treated cells were incubated with AG1478, an EGF receptor inhibitor, or AG1295, a PDGF receptor inhibitor, after which the lysates were immunoblotted with anti-ERK1 or phospho-ERK1 antibody.

Here we describe a novel effect of Gαq that is independent of the PLCβ pathway. Expression of the constitutively active Gαq mutant Gαq(Q209L) promoted an increase in glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity that was associated with increased phosphorylation of Tyr216 on GSK-3β. Gαq(Q209L)-AA, a mutant that cannot activate PLCβ, also induced GSK-3β activation and phosphorylation of Tyr216. We speculate that the protein-tyrosine kinase Csk (C-terminal Src kinase), which is also activated by Gαq(Q209L) and Gαq(Q209L)-AA, acts upstream of GSK-3β. Expression of Csk accentuated the activation of GSK-3β by Gαq(Q209L), whereas catalytically inactive Csk blocked GSK-3β activation by Gαq(Q209L). Recombinant Csk phosphorylated and activated GSK-3β in vitro, and GSK-3β coprecipitated with Csk from cell lysates. These results suggest that activation of Csk and GSK-3β by Gαq may contribute to the physiological and pathological effects of Gq-coupled receptors.

These results suggest that activation of Csk and GSK-3β by Gαq may contribute to the physiological and pathological effects of Gq-coupled receptors. The Gαq protein transduces signals from cell surface receptors that are activated by hormones such as angiotensin II, endothelin 1, catecholamines, and prostaglandin F2α to regulate diverse physiological functions. Activation of certain Gq-coupled receptors appears to induce insulin resistance, because treatment of patients with receptor antagonists can improve insulin sensitivity (1Lithell H.O. Am. J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is one of the most common causes of death in humans. The most well characterized effector of Gαq is phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), 1The abbreviations used are: PLCβphospholipase CβGSK-3glycogen synthase kinase-3CskC-terminal Src kinaseCsk-KDkinase-dead CskHAhemagglutininHEKhuman embryonic kidneyLPAlysophosphatidic acidPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePYK2proline-rich protein kinase 2BtkBruton's tyrosine kinase. the activation of which leads to increased hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and activation of protein kinase C (4Rhee S.G.

It is generally thought that activation of this canonical PLCβ pathway by Gαq accounts for most of the pleiotropic effects of Gq-coupled receptors (5Ross E.M. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) was discovered as a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase, but it is now known to regulate a diverse array of cellular processes (6Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 7Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of GSK-3 signaling is thought to play a role in the development of type II diabetes mellitus (8Kaidanovich O. Eldar-Finkelman H. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2002; 6: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), neuronal cell loss in Alzheimer disease (9Bhat R.V. Budd S.L. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and cancer (10Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two major isoforms of GSK-3 in mammalian tissues (GSK-3α and -3β) are structurally similar but not functionally equivalent. This was demonstrated upon deletion of the GSK-3β gene in mice, which resulted in embryonic lethality due to liver degeneration, even though GSK-3α was still presumably expressed at the normal level (11Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). GSK-3β activity is relatively high in resting cells, and it can be positively or negatively regulated by various stimuli. For example, insulin activation of the protein kinase Akt results in phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9, thus reducing its enzymatic activity (12Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar). Several reports indicated that agonist stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors antagonizes the signaling events initiated by insulin and other growth factors that lead to Akt activation (13Batty I.H.

To directly investigate how Gαq affects Akt activity, we used Gαq(Q209L), a mutant that cannot hydrolyze GTP and therefore constitutively activates PLCβ. We found that Gαq(Q209L) blocks insulin and platelet-derived growth factor activation of Akt by inhibiting its upstream regulator phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (20Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Active Gαq still inhibited PI3K/Akt in cells treated with U73122, a PLC inhibitor, suggesting that the inhibitory mechanism is independent of the canonical PLCβ pathway (20Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling by activated Gαq results in increased GSK-3β activity. We show here that Gαq(Q209L) does induce the activation of GSK-3β, and use of a Gαq(Q209L) mutant that cannot activate PLC indicates that this response is independent of the canonical PLCβ pathway. Surprisingly, GSK-3β activation is not a consequence of decreased Akt activity but is instead because of activation of a tyrosine kinase. Finally, we identify Csk (C-terminal Src kinase), which has been shown to be activated by Gαq(Q209L) (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev.

(The mouse Gαq sequence we isolated shows two differences when compared with the published sequence for Gαq from mouse brain (22Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Amino acids 28 and 29 in the mouse Gαq used here are thus Gln and Leu instead of His and Val. Others have reported a sequence identical to ours (23Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R.

Gαq(Q209L)-AA was constructed using Pfu DNA polymerase and the forward primer 5′-CATGGAGGAGAGCAAAGCACTCTTTGCAGCAATTATCACCTACCCCTGGTTC to change Arg256 and Thr257 to Ala. The GSK-3β, Gαq, and Akt constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNA for human Csk in pcDNA3.1/GS (tagged at the C terminus with the V5 epitope and His6) was obtained from Invitrogen. Csk-KD was constructed using Pfu DNA polymerase and the forward primer 5′-CCGAGGGAACAAAGTCGCCGTCCGGTGCATTAAGAACGACGCCACTGC to mutate Lys222 to Arg. The fidelity of all cDNA constructs was verified by sequencing. Kinase Assays—GSK-3β activity was assayed using phospho-GS2 substrate peptide (Upstate Biotechnology) as described elsewhere (19Ballou L.M. Tian P.Y. Lin H.Y. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40910-40916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To assay Csk, equal amounts of protein in lysis buffer containing Triton X-100 (20Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were immunoprecipitated with His6 antibody and protein G-agarose at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Csk activity was measured in 20 μl of buffer A containing 0.25 μl/assay of [γ-32P]ATP, 40 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/assay of poly(Glu, Tyr) (Sigma). After incubating the reactions at 30 °C for 30 min, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Radioactive poly(Glu, Tyr) was cut out of the gel and counted in a scintillation counter. Gαq(Q209L) Effects on Akt and GSK-3β Are PLC-independent—In an earlier study we suggested that inhibition of PI3K/Akt by activated Gαq is independent of the canonical PLCβ pathway, based on its resistance to U73122 (20Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because U73122 is a relatively poor PLC inhibitor in our experimental systems, we decided to re-examine this issue using Gαq(Q209L)-AA, a Gαq(Q209L) mutant that still binds to GTP but does not activate PLC (mutant 10 cited in Ref. 24Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Gαq(Q209L)-AA with HA-tagged Akt in HEK 293 cells caused a decrease in Akt activity that was comparable to that seen using Gαq(Q209L) (Fig. 1A). These results support our hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of active Gαq on Akt is independent of PLC activation. GSK-3β activity is negatively regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Ser9 (12Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar, 25Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We therefore expected that suppression of PI3K/Akt by Gαq(Q209L) would result in an increase in GSK-3β activity. This hypothesis was first tested using a stable cell line that expresses Gαq(Q209L) under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (Flp-In T-REx/293 cells) (20Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged GSK-3β and then treated overnight with or without 1 μm doxycycline to induce expression of Gαq(Q209L). As expected, GSK-3β activity from cells treated with doxycycline was 1.8 times higher than the activity from vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01, t test, n = 4). Doxycycline treatment of Flp-In T-REx/293 cells that do not express Gαq(Q209L) did not affect GSK-3β activity. 2G. Fan, L. M. Ballou, and R. Z. Lin, unpublished data. Similarly, cotransfection of HEK 293 cells with HA-GSK-3β and Gαq(Q209L) caused a 2.7-fold increase in GSK-3β activity as compared with the control cells (Fig. 1B). Gαq(Q209L)-AA stimulated GSK-3β to a comparable extent (Fig. 1B), indicating that activation of GSK-3β by Gαq(Q209L) is independent of the canonical PLCβ pathway. Control experiments confirmed that Gαq(Q209L)-AA does not activate PLC, as measured by accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas Gαq(Q209L) causes a robust activation (Fig. 1C). Gαq(Q209L) Activates GSK-3β via Phosphorylation of Tyr216—Using a phosphospecific antibody, we tested whether Gαq(Q209L) activates GSK-3β by causing a decrease in phosphorylation of Ser9. Cells were cotransfected with HA-GSK-3β and the Gαq constructs, and the phosphorylation state of GSK-3β was examined after precipitation with HA antibody. To our surprise, the phosphorylation state of Ser9 did not change in the presence of either of the Gαq constructs (Fig. 2A, top panel). Although many agonists, including insulin, regulate GSK-3β via changes in phosphorylation of Ser9 (12Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar, 19Ballou L.M. Tian P.Y. Lin H.Y. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40910-40916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), other stimuli have been shown to activate the enzyme by causing an increase in phosphorylation of Tyr216 (26Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Sayas C.L. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6863-6875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes the latter site, we found that the basal phosphorylation of Tyr216 in control cells was increased upon expression of either Gαq(Q209L) or Gαq(Q209L)-AA (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Expression of the Gαq proteins did not affect the amount of HA-GSK-3β, as demonstrated by Western blotting of cell lysates using the HA antibody (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). To further examine the relationship between increased phosphorylation of Tyr216 and GSK-3β activation, we tested whether Gαq(Q209L) can still activate a GSK-3β mutant in which Tyr216 is changed to Phe (HA-GSK-3β Y216F). The enzymatic activity of HA-GSK-3β Y216F was ∼20% that of wild type HA-GSK-3β (28Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and cotransfection with Gαq(Q209L) did not increase its activity (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a GSK-3β mutant with Ala substituted for Ser9 (HA-GSK-3β S9A) had high basal activity as compared with wild type HA-GSK-3β (19Ballou L.M. Tian P.Y. Lin H.Y. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40910-40916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the presence of Gαq(Q209L) caused an additional 20% increase in its activity (Fig. 2B). These results support the hypothesis that Gαq(Q209L)-dependent activation of GSK-3β is mediated by phosphorylation of Tyr216. Csk Activates GSK-3β in Vivo—It was recently reported that expression of Gαq(Q209L) causes an increase in the activity of Csk (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates Src family members to negatively regulate their activity (29Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered if Csk might mediate Gαq(Q209L)-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β. We confirmed that Csk is activated in HEK 293 cells upon coexpression of Gαq(Q209L) (Fig. 3). Gαq(Q209L)-AA was as effective as Gαq(Q209L) in activating Csk (3.3-fold stimulation), indicating that this response is also independent of PLC activation (Fig. 3). Next, we tested whether Gαq(Q209L) activation of Csk leads to increased GSK-3β activity in vivo. Coexpression of HAGSK-3β with either Csk or Gαq(Q209L) alone increased GSK-3β activity 2- and 2.8-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A). However, GSK-3β activation increased to 4.9-fold in the presence of both Csk and Gαq(Q209L) (Fig. 4A). By contrast, expression of catalytically inactive Csk-KD did not increase GSK-3β activity (Fig. 4B). More importantly, overexpression of Csk-KD blocked the Gαq(Q209L)-induced activation of GSK-3β (Fig. 4B). Csk-KD most likely acts as a dominant-negative suppressor of endogenous Csk, which activates GSK-3β in the presence of Gαq(Q209L). Csk Phosphorylates and Activates GSK-3β in Vitro—The results above raised the possibility that Csk might directly activate GSK-3β by phosphorylating Tyr216. To test whether Csk can phosphorylate GSK-3β in vitro, purified recombinant Csk was incubated with purified recombinant GSK-3β in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and LiCl to inhibit GSK-3β autophosphorylation. We found that GSK-3β was phosphorylated by Csk (Fig. 5A). To determine whether phosphorylation by Csk changes GSK-3β activity, the two enzymes were incubated separately or together in the presence of ATP prior to assaying GSK-3β activity. GSK-3β activity was increased 3-fold after incubation with Csk (Fig. 5B). Finally, we tested whether GSK-3β and Csk interact in vivo. HA-GSK-3β and His6-tagged Csk were expressed in cells, and Csk was pulled down using a Ni2+ affinity resin. HA-GSK-3β coprecipitated with Csk from lysates of cells expressing both proteins (Fig. 5C). These data support the hypothesis that GSK-3β is an in vivo substrate of Csk. Accumulating evidence indicates that PLCβ is not the only effector of Gαq. Direct binding of Gαq to Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) has been shown to increase Btk kinase activity (31Ma Y.C. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12197-121201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that activated Gαq inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling via a mechanism that is independent of PLC activation and that might involve an inhibitory interaction between Gαq and p110α PI3K (Fig. 1A and Ref. 20Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that the activation of Csk and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3β represents another novel effector pathway for Gαq that functions independently of PLC. An effector pathway with similar characteristics was described in 3T3L1 adipocytes, where Gαq(Q209L) stimulated the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in a manner that was independent of PLC activation but blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (32Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Artemyev N.O. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7167-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Gαq(Q209L)-AA, in which Arg256 and Thr257 are changed to Ala, was originally made to identify residues in Gαq that are required for interaction with PLC (24Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We show here that although Gαq(Q209L)-AA is almost completely defective in the ability to activate PLC, it is indistinguishable from Gαq(Q209L) in the ability to inhibit Akt and activate GSK-3β and Csk. The simplest interpretation of these results is that these effects of Gαq(Q209L) are independent of PLC activation. In contrast to our results, it was recently reported that the ability of Gαq(Q209L) to depress PI3K/Akt activity in cardiomyocytes requires PLC activation (33Howes A.L. Arthur J.F. Zhang T. Miyamoto S. Adams J.W. Dorn II, G.W. Woodcock E.A. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40343-40351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the use of a Gαq(Q209L) mutant with three Ala substitutions that cannot activate PLC (mutant 7 cited in Ref. 24Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the inability of this mutant to inhibit Akt is that it lacks the ability to bind to and inhibit p110α PI3K. In light of the inhibitory effect of Gαq(Q209L) on Akt, we were surprised to find that Gαq(Q209L) activates GSK-3β by causing an increase in Tyr216 phosphorylation, instead of a decrease in Ser9 phosphorylation. Indeed, treatment of cells with LY 294002, a PI3K inhibitor, did not activate HA-GSK-3β or HA-GSK-3β S9A, indicating that GSK-3β activation by Gαq(Q209L) is not simply a consequence of reduced PI3K/Akt signaling.2 GSK-3β from unstimulated cells is phosphorylated on Tyr216, which is located in the activation loop of the catalytic domain, and mutation of Tyr216 to Phe or dephosphorylation with a protein-tyrosine phosphatase in vitro reduces the kinase activity (28Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Some stimuli such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) activate the enzyme by causing an increase in Tyr216 phosphorylation (27Sayas C.L. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6863-6875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sayas C.L. Moreno-Flores M.T. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37046-37052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). LPA signals through G protein-coupled receptors that can couple to Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13. Sayas et al. (27Sayas C.L. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6863-6875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that expression of activated mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 mimicked the effect of LPA by inducing GSK-3 activation. Gαq was not tested because treatment of cells with a PLC inhibitor did not block LPA activation of the kinase, apparently ruling out Gαq as a possible mediator of LPA-induced GSK-3 activation (27Sayas C.L. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6863-6875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that Gαq(Q209L) activates GSK-3β independently of PLC raises the possibility that Gαq might contribute to the activating effect of LPA on GSK-3. We considered several candidate tyrosine kinases that might activate GSK-3β in response to Gαq(Q209L). The most well characterized GSK-3 tyrosine kinase is Zak1, which controls cell fate specification in Dictyostelium (35Kim L. Liu J. Kimmel A.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 36Kim L. Harwood A. Kimmel A.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Binding of cAMP to the CAR3 receptor activates Zak1, which phosphorylates GSK-3 on tyrosine residues (including the Tyr216 equivalent) to increase its activity. A mammalian homolog of Zak1 has not been identified. The Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn has been shown to phosphorylate recombinant GSK-3β in vitro (37Lesort M. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, we found that treatment of cells with PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases, did not block the activation of GSK-3β by Gαq(Q209L).2 The Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase PYK2 (proline-rich protein kinase 2) has also been shown to phosphorylate GSK-3β in vitro and has been proposed to mediate increased tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3β in response to transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ (38Hartigan J.A. Xiong W.C. Johnson G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our finding that Gαq(Q209L)-AA activates GSK-3β without activating PLC implies that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and PYK2 activation are not required for this response. Finally, as mentioned above, active Gαq binds to Btk and stimulates its kinase activity (31Ma Y.C. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12197-121201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because Btk expression is limited to a subset of hematopoietic cells, we did not consider this kinase as a likely candidate to activate GSK-3β in HEK 293 cells. It was reported that Csk activity is increased upon expression of Gβγ heterodimers and activated forms of Gαq, Gα12, and Gα13 (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as mentioned above, activated mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 also activate GSK-3 (27Sayas C.L. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6863-6875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to explore whether Gαq(Q209L), Csk, and GSK-3β act within the same signaling pathway. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Csk acts between Gαq(Q209L) and GSK-3β. Both kinases are activated by Gαq(Q209L)-AA as well as by Gαq(Q209L), expression of Csk activates GSK-3β, expression of Gαq(Q209L) augments the activation of GSK-3β by Csk, and Csk-KD inhibits Gαq(Q209L)-mediated GSK-3β activation. In addition, our results showing that Csk phosphorylates and activates GSK-3β in vitro and that the two kinases interact with each other in cell lysates suggest that GSK-3β is a direct target of Csk. We speculate that activation of GSK-3 by Gα12 and Gα13 is also mediated by Csk (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Sayas C.L. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6863-6875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism for Csk activation by Gαq(Q209L) is not understood. Gβγ, but not the activated mutants of Gαq, Gα12, or Gα13, bound directly to Csk and increased its tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Expression of Gβγ and the activated Gα subunits caused Csk to translocate from the cytoplasm to the membrane, but it is not known how this might result in Csk activation (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that activation of GSK-3β by tyrosine phosphorylation is an important mechanism by which apoptotic stimuli can lead to cell death. Nerve growth factor withdrawal or staurosporine treatment of cultured neuronal cells caused an increase in GSK-3β activity, Tyr216 phosphorylation, and cell death (26Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made using in vivo models of neuronal apoptosis induced by ischemia or blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (26Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 39Elyaman W. Terro F. Wong N.S. Hugon J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Activated Gαq also causes apoptosis in some cell types (40Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing Gαq die of heart failure, and cardiomyocytes from these animals show an increased rate of apoptosis (41Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. 2nd. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The apoptotic effect of Gαq might be mediated in part by activation of GSK-3β. It is also well established that GSK-3 affects glucose metabolism by phosphorylating and inactivating glycogen synthase (6Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the liver, hormone stimulation of some Gq-coupled receptors also inhibits glycogen synthase (42Bouscarel B. Meurer K. Decker C. Exton J.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This phenomenon could be partly because of activation of GSK-3β by Gαq. Further studies are needed to elucidate how Gαq activation of Csk and GSK-3β might contribute to the regulation of apoptosis, glucose metabolism, and other cellular effects of Gq-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2148138985,"Three homologous acidic peptides have been isolated from the venom of three different Parabuthus scorpion species, P. transvaalicus, P. villosus, and P. granulatus. Analysis of the primary sequences reveals that they structurally belong to subfamily 11 of short chain α-K+-blocking peptides (Tytgat, J., Chandy, K. G., Garcia, M. L., Gutman, G. A., Martin-Eauclaire, M. F., van der Walt, J. J., and Possani, L. D. (1999) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 20, 444–447). These toxins are 36–37 amino acids in length and have six aligned cysteine residues, but they differ substantially from the other α-K+ toxins because of the absence of the critical Lys27 and their total overall negative charge. Parabutoxin 1 (PBTx1), which has been expressed by recombinant methods, has been submitted to functional characterization. Despite the lack of the Lys27, this toxin blocks several Kv1-type channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes but with low affinities (micromolar range). Because a relationship between the biological activity and the acidic residue substitutions may exist, we set out to elucidate the relative impact of the acidic character of the toxin and the lack of the critical Lys27 on the weak activity of PBTx1 toward Kv1 channels. To achieve this, a specific mutant named rPBTx1 T24F/V26K was made recombinantly and fully characterized on Kv1-type channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Analysis of rPBTx1 T24F/V26K displaying an affinity toward Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels in the nanomolar range shows the importance of the functional dyad above the acidic character of this toxin. Three homologous acidic peptides have been isolated from the venom of three different Parabuthus scorpion species, P. transvaalicus, P. villosus, and P. granulatus. Analysis of the primary sequences reveals that they structurally belong to subfamily 11 of short chain α-K+-blocking peptides (Tytgat, J., Chandy, K. G., Garcia, M. L., Gutman, G. A., Martin-Eauclaire, M. F., van der Walt, J. J., and Possani, L. D. (1999) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 20, 444–447). These toxins are 36–37 amino acids in length and have six aligned cysteine residues, but they differ substantially from the other α-K+ toxins because of the absence of the critical Lys27 and their total overall negative charge. Parabutoxin 1 (PBTx1), which has been expressed by recombinant methods, has been submitted to functional characterization. Despite the lack of the Lys27, this toxin blocks several Kv1-type channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes but with low affinities (micromolar range). Because a relationship between the biological activity and the acidic residue substitutions may exist, we set out to elucidate the relative impact of the acidic character of the toxin and the lack of the critical Lys27 on the weak activity of PBTx1 toward Kv1 channels. To achieve this, a specific mutant named rPBTx1 T24F/V26K was made recombinantly and fully characterized on Kv1-type channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Analysis of rPBTx1 T24F/V26K displaying an affinity toward Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels in the nanomolar range shows the importance of the functional dyad above the acidic character of this toxin. Scorpion neurotoxins are known to inhibit several types of K+ channels (2.Gimenez-Gallego G. Navia M.A. Reuben J.P. Katz G.M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) where they are involved in the fundamental physiological processes.Extensive progress in neurobiology and more specific study of the physiology of these large membrane-bound Kv channels was achieved by the use of specific peptide toxins produced by a variety of venomous species like snakes (Chordata) (5.Tsetlin V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), sea anemones (Coelenterata), spiders (6.Grishin E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), scorpions (Arthropoda) (7.Possani L.D. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), honey bees (8.Garcia M.L. Hanner M. Knaus H.G. Koch R. Schmalhofer W. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 425-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and snails of the genus Conus (Mollusca). Scorpion toxins that target K+ channels share a common globular scaffold, a cysteine-stabilized α-helix-β-sheet structure (CSαβ), corresponding to the consensus sequence C... CXXXC... C... CXC in the primary structure of these toxins (9.Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Menez A. Toma F. Science. 1991; 254: 1521-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). More interestingly, most of the α-KTxs have a common functional dyad. The most critical residue of this dyad is the conserved positively charged lysine residue (Lys27, charybdotoxin numbering). Site-directed mutagenesis studies for several scorpion toxins have demonstrated that this lysine is indeed crucial for the interaction with the K+ channels (10.Park C.S. Miller C. Neuron. 1992; 9: 307-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) by inserting its side chain into the pore of the K+ channel (11.Goldstein S.A. Pheasant D.J. Miller C.

The second residue of the dyad is a hydrophobic residue (mostly Phe or Tyr) that is fully exposed from a flat surface (17.Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C.

Only a few scorpion toxins have been reported to be neutral (pI = 7.2), like AaHIV (19.Martin M.F. Rochat H. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20.Mansuelle P. Martin M.F. Rochat H. Granier C. Nat. Toxins. 1992; 1: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and BmK M4 (21.Luo M.J. Xiong Y.M. Wang M. Wang D.C. Chi C.W. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or acidic (pI = 5.3), like the first identified α-neurotoxin, BmK M8 (22.Li H. Jin L. Zeng Z. Wang M. Zhang Y. Wang D. Sci. China Ser. C Life Sci. 1996; 39: 373-384PubMed Google Scholar). These toxins show an extremely weak toxicity in mice.Based on the alignment of the cysteine residues and other highly related amino acids, K+ toxins have been classified into the three subfamilies α-KTx, β-KTx, and γ-KTx peptides, and a general nomenclature for the α-KTx has been proposed (1.Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The α-KTx subfamilies are the best studied toxins and usually are small (up to 4 kDa) basic “short chain toxins.” To date, more than 50 different α-KTx peptides have been reported and listed into 17 subfamilies (1.Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 23.Goudet C. Chi C.W. Tytgat J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Very recently, a new subfamily (α-KTx18) has been reported (24.Pimenta A.M. Legros C. Marco Almeida F. Mansuelle P. De Lima M.E. Bougis P.E. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this paper, a subfamily of unusually acidic α-KTx short chain scorpion toxins is described. These toxins, named parabutoxin 1 (PBTx1), parabutoxin 2 (PBTx2), and parabutoxin 10 (PBTx10), have extremely low pI values of 3.82 (for PBTx1 and PBTx2) and 3.88 (for PBTx10). Interestingly, PBTx1, PBTx2, and PBTx10 lack the crucial pore-plugging Lys27 (charybdotoxin numbering). In addition, the second important residue of the dyad, the hydrophobic residue (Phe or Tyr) (17.Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C.L. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Menez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4302-4309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 18.Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Menez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is also missing in these new toxins. At the equivalent positions, Val (PBTx1, PBTx2) and Ala (PBTx10) residues occur. Tytgat et al. (1.Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) previously classified two of these toxins as members of the subfamilies α-KTx11, α-KTx11.1 (PBTx1), and α-KTx11.2 (PBTx2), respectively, but a full characterization of the toxins was still lacking. Meanwhile, another similar toxin, PBTx10, has been isolated and cloned from the venom of Parabuthus granulatus. It is proposed to represent a third member called α-KTx11.3. To investigate the effect of this group of toxins, recombinant PBTx1 (rPBTx1) was produced as a part of a fusion protein in Escherichia coli bacterial cells. Although the dyad is absent, rPBTx1 blocks Kv1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but with weak activity as has been reported for other long chain acidic scorpion toxins (25.Li H.M. Wang D.C. Zeng Z.H. Jin L. Hu R.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26.Wang D.C. J. Nat. Toxins. 1999; 8: 309-325PubMed Google Scholar), for which the in vivo toxicity changes inversely proportional to the pI values (21.Luo M.J. Xiong Y.M. Wang M. Wang D.C. Chi C.W. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To elucidate the relative impact of the acidic character of PBTx1 over and above the lack of the functional dyad, a specific mutant named PBTx1 N24F/V26K has been recombinantly expressed and further characterized on Kv1-type channels, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVenom Fractionation and BioassaysVenom obtained by electrical stimulation of scorpions of the species P. granulatus was dissolved in twice-distilled water and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was freeze-dried and kept at –20 °C until use. The first step of separation consisted of gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 (medium) column equilibrated and run in the presence of 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.7, under the conditions described in Ref. 27.Olamendi-Portugal T. Garcia B.I. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Van Der Walt J. Dyason K. Ulens C. Tytgat J. Felix R. Darszon A. Possani L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. This chromatographic step resulted in at least four independent subfractions of which only fraction II was toxic to mice. This subfraction was further separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 reverse column (Vydac, Hisperia, CA) eluted with a linear gradient composed of solution A (0.12% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to solution B (0.10% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The gradient was run up to 45% solution B during 60 min. At least 16 components were separated and assayed for mice lethality and for specific effects in various electrophysiological systems (27.Olamendi-Portugal T. Garcia B.I. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Van Der Walt J. Dyason K. Ulens C. Tytgat J. Felix R. Darszon A. Possani L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subfraction 5 of the HPLC chromatogram was found to be a K+ channel blocker (see below) and was further characterized.Primary Structure DeterminationThree independent strategies/procedures were used to fully determine the amino acid sequence of HPLC component 5: (i) direct amino acid sequence analysis using a Beckman LF 3000 protein sequencer (Palo Alto, CA) of the native product and/or of the reduced and alkylated derivative, as described earlier (27.Olamendi-Portugal T. Garcia B.I. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Van Der Walt J. Dyason K. Ulens C. Tytgat J. Felix R. Darszon A. Possani L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), (ii) sequence analysis of the fragments obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of the toxin in conjunction with amino acid composition analysis of the C-terminal region by means of an automatic amino acid analyzer (Beckman, model 6300E) following protocols also described earlier (28.Becerril B. Corona M. Coronas F.I. Zamudio F. Calderon-Aranda E.S. Fletcher Jr., P.L. Martin B.M. Possani L.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and (iii) mass spectrometric analysis using a Finnigan LCQDuo ion-trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA).The enzymatic hydrolysis was performed using 50 μg of component 5 supplemented with 4 μg of Staphylococcus aureus endopeptidase V8 (Roche Applied Science) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.2, for 4 h at 37 °C. The product was separated by HPLC under the same conditions described in the previous section resulting in several subpeptides of which the one eluting at 23 min and 39 s corresponded to the C-terminal peptide.Gene CloningCloning of the PBTx10 Gene—RNA was isolated from the venomous gland (telson) of one scorpion of the species P. granulatus according to the specifications of the Promega Total RNA isolation system. Total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using a polyT22NN oligonucleotide, a 22-mer of Ts having two terminal degenerate nucleotides (N), essentially following the experimental procedure described previously by our group (29.Corona M. Valdez-Cruz N.A. Merino E. Zurita M. Possani L.D. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1893-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To perform the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 25 °C, a sample of the first reaction (2 μl) was added to 1× Vent DNA polymerase buffer (composed of 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100), 200 μm dNTPs, a 25-mer forward degenerated primer (GAY GAR GAR CCN AAR GAR ACN TGY) (0.25 μm), the 25-mer (T)22NN primer (0.25 μm), and 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was performed using a PerkinElmer 9600 thermocycler according to the protocol described earlier. Plasmid DNA was sequenced from both strands using fluorescent nucleotides in an automatic apparatus (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer.Production of PBTx1 and PBTx1 T24F/V26K by Recombinant Methods—A PBTx1 gene was synthesized in a way similar to that described in Ref. 30.Huys I. Dyason K. Waelkens E. Verdonck F. van Zyl J. du Plessis J. Muller G.J. van der Walt J. Clynen E. Schoofs L. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1854-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar using two oligonucleotide duplexes ligated into pMAL-p2X (New England Biolabs) using XmnI (5′) and BamHI (3′) restriction sites. The sense strand reads as follows: 5′-GACGAGGAGCCGAAGGAGTCGTGCTCGGACGAGATGTGCGTGATCTACTGCAAGGGCGAGGAGTACTCGACGGGCGTGTGCGACGGCCCGCAGAAGTGCAAGTGCTCGGACTGAG-3′. For the production of the mutant PBTx1 T24F/V-26K, the template used for PCR was the gene of PBTx1 inserted into the pMAL-p2X vector. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems device, purified by PAGE, and phosphorylated at the 5′ end. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-AAGGGCGAGGAGTAC(A/C)GTTTCGGCAAGTGCGACGGC-3′, corresponding to positions 18–29 of the rPBTx1 amino acid sequence, and that of the reverse primer was 5′-TTCCCGCTCCTCATG(T/G)CAAAGCCGTTCACGCTGCCG-3′, corresponding to the same positions in PBTx1 (codon and complementary codon of the mutation are in bold). PCR was performed using the guidelines of the manufacturer, and PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were transformed into DH5α competent cells. DNA was purified using the Wizard MiniPrep System (Promega) and analyzed with restriction enzymes (BseRI and XmnI, New England Biolabs) using standard techniques. Transformants containing the correctly constructed gene fusions were grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. For both wild-type (WT) and mutant PBTx1, protein expression was carried out in a DH5α strain of E. coli in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) at 37 °C. Periplasmic protein was harvested by osmotic shock and purified as described previously (30.Huys I. Dyason K. Waelkens E. Verdonck F. van Zyl J. du Plessis J. Muller G.J. van der Walt J. Clynen E. Schoofs L. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1854-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Electrophysiological CharacterizationIsolation and micro-injection of the oocytes were performed as described previously (30.Huys I. Dyason K. Waelkens E. Verdonck F. van Zyl J. du Plessis J. Muller G.J. van der Walt J. Clynen E. Schoofs L. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1854-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whole-cell measurements were carried out 1 or 2 days after injection using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (GeneClamp 500, Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). Current and voltage electrodes had resistances as low as possible (∼100–500 kilohms) and were filled with 3 m KCl. A pulse frequency of 0.2 Hz was chosen to maximize the recovery from inactivation of the channels. The solution was exchanged at a flow rate of 5 ml/min, and the volume of the recording chamber was 100 μl. All experiments were performed at room temperature (19–23 °C). Current records were sampled at 0.5-ms intervals and filtered at 1 kHz, respectively, using a 4-pole Bessel filter. To eliminate the effect of voltage drop across the bath-grounding electrode, the bath potential was actively controlled. Voltage records were carefully monitored on an oscilloscope (Hameg). Leak currents were subtracted using a P/4 protocol (31.Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 533-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The bath solution (ND-96 solution) was composed of (in mm): 2 KCl, 96 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.5 with KOH). For incubation, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate was added to the ND-96 solution. Off-line analysis was performed on a Pentium® III processor computer. For data acquisition, we used the pCLAMP program (version 5.5.1). Data files (Axon Instruments, Inc.) were directly imported, analyzed, and visualized with a custom-made add-in program for Microsoft Excel.Modeling and Electrostatic Surface DisplayA model was generated by an automated homology modeling server (Expert Protein Analysis System proteomics server using SWISS-MODEL-ProModII) running at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Geneva. Target (PBTx1) and template (scyllatoxin) sequences were automatically aligned by Multiple Sequence Alignment software (ClustalW), which subsequently generated the coordinates of both models. Energy minimization (Gromos96) and simulated annealing cycles were run. SWISS-MODEL computes a confidence factor for each atom in the model structure taking into account the deviation of the model from the template structure and the distance trap value used for framework building. The electrostatic surfaces for PBTx1 and charybdotoxin (ChTx) could be displayed by using the Chimera program.RESULTSPurification and Sequencing of Novel ToxinsThe purification of the α-KTx scorpion toxins is exemplified by one member of this family of acidic peptides from the venom of the South African scorpion P. granulatus following the same strategy as used earlier for two novel toxins targeted to voltage-dependent Ca2+ and Na+ channels (27.Olamendi-Portugal T. Garcia B.I. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Van Der Walt J. Dyason K. Ulens C. Tytgat J. Felix R. Darszon A. Possani L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).By this procedure, the peptide indicated as number 5 in Fig. 1A was homogeneous based on the unique symmetry of the HPLC peak and on the mass spectrometric amino acid sequence analysis. This peptide was given the name PBTx10 from Parabuthus toxin 10.The first 35 amino acids were all unequivocally identified by direct sequencing (labeled by -d-underneath the sequence) as shown in Fig. 1B. The last residue, serine at position 36, was obtained by two independent methods. The C-terminal peptide obtained from endopeptidase hydrolysis with S. aureus V8, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” had the same amino acid composition as follows: (expected:found) Asp (1:1), Thr (1:0.90), Ser (1:1.90), Glu (1:1.30), Pro (1:0.77), Gly (2:2.30), Phe (l:0.88), Ala (1:1.00), Lys (2:1.77), Cys (not determined). Thus, by this method, one serine residue was missing compared with the sequence (labeled by... V8... underneath it) in Fig. 1B. To verify the complete sequence, a mass spectrometric analysis of the native peptide was performed giving a value of 3,931.3 Da, identical to the expected theoretical value. Thus, we concluded that the peptide has 36 amino acid residues including six cysteines that form three disulfide bridges (confirmed by the molecular mass found). The full sequence was further confirmed by the nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for this peptide as will be discussed below. The peptide corresponds to 3.9% of the total protein of soluble venom. PBTx1 and PBTx2 were purified from venoms of the scorpions Parabuthus transvaalicus and Parabuthus villosus, respectively (30.Huys I. Dyason K. Waelkens E. Verdonck F. van Zyl J. du Plessis J.

This fragment was inserted in the EcoRV site of pBlue-script KS+. Six clones were sequenced, and in all of them the PCR inserted included the N-terminal part of the mature PBTx10 toxin up to the poly(A) tail. In the 3′-untranslated region, a putative polyadenylation site, AATAAA, was identified 28 bp upstream from the poly(A) sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature toxin was consistent with the sequence obtained previously by Edman degradation. Fig. 2A shows the alignment of the amino acid sequences for the three acidic peptides, and Fig. 2B shows the representative examples of amino acid sequences of each of the 18 subfamilies described thus far. The arrows above the sequences indicate approximate positions for the β-sheet structure, whereas the rectangle shows the segments of primary structure involved in the α-helix formation of the three-dimensional structure of these toxins.Fig. 2Amino acid sequence alignments.

(2003) Eur. J. Neurosci.Google Scholar (Fig. 3B). The plasmids containing the fusion constructs were transformed in E. coli DH5α cells, and expression was successfully induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Longer incubation periods did not increase the yield of fusion proteins. As a part of the control, cells only containing the pMAL-p2X vector were simultaneously induced. Fusion proteins were directed to the periplasmic space of the E. coli cells. The yields of affinity-purified fusion proteins were 40–60 mg/liter of culture estimated by the absorbance at 280 nm, which after cleavage with factor Xa resulted in the production of 2–4 mg of recombinant (mutant) toxin (rPBTx1 or rPBTx1 T24F/V26K) per liter of culture. The periplasmic extract of the control cells contained the expected maltose-binding product molecule as was verified by mass spectrometry. The recombinant synthesis resulted in the production of rPBTx1 and rPBTx1 T24F/V26K with the expected molecular masses of 4,090 and 4,166 Da, respectively, taking into account the three disulfide bridges present in the polypeptide chain.Fig. 3Gene cloning and vector design for recombinant biosynthesis.

The Kv1 channel blockage induced by rPBTx1 was largely reversible at concentrations of <1 μm; at higher concentrations, however, relatively longer wash-out periods up to several minutes were required, and full recovery was usually not obtained. The affinity toward the Kv1.1 channel was very low (Kd = 21.1 μm). Therefore, two other Kv1-type channels (Kv1.2 and Kv1.3) were tested. The addition of 10 μm of rPBTx1 produced an almost complete reduction of the current through both channels at all voltages. Using lower concentrations of rPBTx1 (1 μm and 800 nm for Kv1.2 and Kv1.3, respectively), Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 currents were reduced by about 50% (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Current traces of Kv 1-type channels.

https://openalex.org/W2039717152,"The mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP) has been investigated by mutating 28 consecutive residues within transmembrane domain III (TMDIII), one at a time, to cysteine. A cysteine-less CTP that retains wild-type functional properties, served as the starting template. The single Cys CTP mutants were abundantly expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated, and functionally reconstituted in a liposomal system. The accessibility of each single Cys mutant to two methanethiosulfonate reagents was evaluated by determining the rate constants for inhibition of CTP function. These rate constants varied by over five orders of magnitude. With two independent data sets we observed peaks and troughs in the rate constant data at identical amino acid positions and a periodicity of 4 was observed from residues 123-137. Based on the pattern of accessibility we conclude that residues 123-137 exist as an α-helix. Although less certain, a combination of the rate constant data and the specific activity data with the single Cys mutants suggests that the α-helical secondary structure may extend to residue 113. Furthermore, the rate constant data define water-accessible and water-inaccessible faces of the helix. We infer that the water-accessible face comprises a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP, whereas the water-inaccessible surface faces the lipid bilayer.

The mitochondrial citrate transport protein (i.e. CTP) 1The abbreviations used are: CTP, citrate transport protein; BTC, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate bromide; TMD, transmembrane domain. from higher eukaryotic cells catalyzes an electroneutral exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane of a tricarboxylate (i.e. citrate, isocitrate, and cis-aconitate) plus a proton, for either another tricarboxylate-H+, a dicarboxylate (i.e. malate or succinate), or phosphoenolpyruvate (1.Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The CTP occupies a critical position in intermediary metabolism, because the resulting cytoplasmic citrate serves as a carbon source, which fuels both the fatty acid and the sterol biosynthetic pathways, and provides a source of NAD+ (via the concerted actions of ATP-citrate lyase and malate dehydrogenase) for the glycolytic pathway (2.Watson J.A.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 88-89Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Due to its prominent role, the CTP has been intensively studied. Thus, it has been purified (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bisaccia F. De Palma A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13682-13690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpressed (10.Xu Y. Mayor J.A. Gremse D. Wood D.O. Kaplan R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, our investigations of this transporter have focused on the yeast homologue of the higher eukaryotic protein (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An advantage provided by the yeast mitochondrial CTP is that, following overexpression and subsequent purification, CTP function can be reconstituted in liposomal vesicles with high specific activity. Thus, the yeast CTP represents ideal material with which to carry out detailed structure/function studies. Accordingly, we have developed a Cys-less CTP construct that displays near-native functional properties (12.Xu Y. Kakhniashvili D.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and have demonstrated that, upon isolation, both the wild-type and Cys-less CTPs exist as functional dimers (13.Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on hydropathy analysis, each monomer of the homodimer is predicted to contain six membrane-spanning domains (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). With this background in mind, we have begun to investigate each of the CTP transmembrane domains with the goal of elucidating their secondary structure and identifying their water-accessible and -inaccessible surfaces. To date, we have carried out this type of analysis with TMDIV (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Within the CTP, transmembrane domain III (TMDIII) appears to be of particular importance to CTP structure and function for several reasons. First, two negatively charged residues exist within this TMD (Glu122 and Glu131), as well as one or possibly two positively charged residues (Arg110 and Lys134) depending on the exact location of the membrane/aqueous compartment interface. Interestingly, with the exception of Arg110, each of these charged residues is conserved among CTPs of widely divergent origin (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Second, the amino-terminal segment of TMDIII contains the dimerization consensus sequence 115GXXXG119, which is thought to be involved in formation of a high affinity association between transmembrane domains (15.MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 16.Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol.

(2002) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/10/research/0054Google Scholar) and is conserved among CTPs (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have demonstrated by two different approaches that the CTP exists as a homodimer in solution (13.Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, our molecular modeling studies suggest the possibility that TMDIII of each CTP monomer may not only form part of the dimer interface, but might also contribute residues to the translocation pathway present in each CTP monomer (20.Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Mol. Model. 2000; 6: 587-594Crossref Google Scholar). In combination, the above findings point to the importance of this transmembrane domain in CTP function. Here, we report findings from experiments designed to investigate the topology of TMDIII. Utilizing the Cys-less CTP as the starting template, we mutated one at a time, 28 consecutive residues within TMDIII to cysteine. We then overexpressed, solubilized, and functionally reconstituted each single-Cys mutant in liposomal vesicles and measured the accessibility of each mutant to the hydrophilic, cysteine-specific reagents MTSES and MTSET by determining the rate constant for inhibition of citrate transport. Depending upon the location of a given Cys in the primary structure, these rate constants differed by over five orders of magnitude. Based on the periodicity of the accessibility of residues 112-137 to both MTS derivatives, our results clearly show that TMDIII exists as an α-helix from residues 123-137. Furthermore, our data suggest that this secondary structure may extend to residue 113. Importantly, both the water-accessible and -inaccessible faces of this helix have been clearly delineated. We infer from these investigations that the water-accessible face represents a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP, and the water-inaccessible surface faces the membranous lipid bilayer. Finally, a model for a putative TMDIII-TMDIII′ dimer interface has been proposed. Construction, Overexpression, and Isolation of Single-Cys CTP Variants—Single-Cys CTP variants were prepared employing the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers containing the desired mutation were analyzed with Oligo 5.0 software and were purchased commercially. PCR amplifications were conducted utilizing the Cys-less CTP gene in pET-21a(+) (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as the starting template. Amplification reactions and the subsequent cloning steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were screened for the presence of inserts via restriction digestion of purified plasmid DNA with NdeI and BamHI. The DNA from positive clones was then partially sequenced to ensure the presence of the desired mutation. Plasmids scoring positively for the appropriate mutation were subcloned into the storage (NovaBlue) and expression (BL21(DE3)) hosts as previously described (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of the entire CTP open reading frame using plasmid, purified from the expression strain, as the template. DNA sequencing was performed by the fee-for-service Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility. High level expression of single-Cys CTPs in Escherichia coli, isolation of the inclusion body fraction, and solubilization of the CTP mutants from inclusion bodies with 1.2% Sarkosyl were performed as previously discussed (10.Xu Y. Mayor J.A. Gremse D. Wood D.O. Kaplan R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Incorporation of Single-Cys CTP Variants into Phospholipid Vesicles and Determination of the Quantity of Incorporated Protein—Overexpressed, Sarkosyl-solubilized, single-cys CTP mutants were incorporated into phospholipid vesicles via the freeze-thaw-sonication procedure as previously described (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to the transport assay, a given sample was thawed, sonicated on ice (30 sonic bursts; 0.7 s/burst), and extraliposomal citrate was removed on small Dowex columns. The sample was then immediately assayed for transport. Where indicated, the quantity of protein that actually incorporated into phospholipid vesicles was determined via the method of Kaplan and Pedersen (21.Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) as previously detailed (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Effects of MTSES and MTSET on Reconstituted Citrate Transport—The effects of the MTS reagents on BTC-sensitive reconstituted citrate transport was determined as previously described (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteoliposomes (45 μl) were preincubated with buffer (3.5 μl) (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 s followed by the addition of freshly prepared MTS reagent (3.5 μl). The concentration of MTS reagent utilized was determined by an initial series of experiments with each CTP variant, in which the MTSET concentration was varied by several orders of magnitude to determine both the maximal inhibition that could be obtained, as well as the levels of reagent needed to obtain varying extents of inhibition at rates that could be measured (i.e. in the range of 5 s to 5 h). Following preincubation with a given concentration of MTS reagent, transport was subsequently triggered via the addition of 21.5 μl of [1,5-14C]citrate (Amersham Biosciences; specific radioactivity approximately 2.4 × 104 dpm/nmol; concentration in reaction mix = 1.04 mm). The incubation time was determined based on the intrinsic activity of a given mutant. These reaction times were empirically determined such that in the absence of MTS reagent less than ∼2500 cpm were transported into the liposomes in a BTC-sensitive manner. We have previously demonstrated that these conditions approximate initial rate conditions (12.Xu Y. Kakhniashvili D.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transport incubations, which were carried out at 21 °C, were quenched via the addition of 3.5 μl of BTC (final concentration in reaction mix = 9.0 mm). Employing the above reaction sequence, multiple reactions were carried out in which the length of the preincubation with the MTS reagent prior to the citrate addition was varied, thereby generating a time course for the extent of inactivation. Experimental and control incubations were carried out during each time course experiment. With these incubations, water was added instead of the MTS reagent. Otherwise the experimental transport reaction was carried out exactly as described above, except only a single time interval between the water addition and the addition of [14C]citrate was utilized. For the control incubation the order of addition of buffer and BTC was reversed. Thus the control received 3.5 μl of BTC at the beginning of the preincubation sequence and buffer instead of BTC at the end of the reaction sequence. Therefore, the experimental and control tubes received the identical concentrations of each component, albeit with the order of additions being altered. Finally, it should be noted that with the Gly115 → Cys and Ala118 → Cys mutations, incomplete inhibition of the CTP by BTC was observed. Therefore, mersalyl was substituted for BTC in the MTSET studies. Following all incubations, intraliposomal radiolabeled citrate was separated by chromatography on small Dowex columns (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and was quantified via liquid scintillation counting. The proportion of activity remaining after incubation with a given MTS reagent was determined by: (i) subtracting the control transport rate from the rate observed in the presence of MTS reagent and (ii) determining the ratio of this difference to the uninhibited BTC-sensitive transport rate (i.e. the experimental rate - control rate measured in the presence of water instead of MTS reagent). Finally, control studies, using liposomes reconstituted with the Cys-less CTP, indicated that the observed effects of MTSES and MTSET were not due to a nonspecific effect on either the liposomal bilayer or the CTP. Calculation of the Rate Constants for MTS Inactivation of CTP Function—Time-course data for inactivation of the CTP by MTSES and MTSET were fitted to a simple exponential function by unweighted Marquardt nonlinear least squares according to the following equation: rt = (r0 - r∞)·e-m·c·t + r∞, where rt is the observed activity remaining at time t (seconds), r0 is the initial activity, r∞ is the asymptotic activity at t = ∞, c is reagent concentration (μm-1), and m is the rate constant for inactivation (s-1 μm-1) (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Plots of the log10 transformed estimates of m against residue number revealed simple linear trends in the data that were fitted by least squares. The superimposed sinusoids were manually fitted to the data. Overall Strategy—Based on the reasons articulated in the introduction, TMDIII appears to play one or more particularly important roles in the structure and function of the CTP. Accordingly, we utilized the following approach to investigate its topology. First, we mutated residues 110-137 one at a time to cysteine, using a Cys-less CTP as the starting template. As shown in Fig. 1, these residues are thought to comprise TMDIII. Second, we overexpressed each of the 28 single-Cys CTP mutants, as well as the starting Cys-less CTP, in E. coli. Each CTP variant was extracted from isolated inclusion bodies with the anionic detergent Sarkosyl and then functionally reconstituted in liposomes. We have previously demonstrated that this strategy (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12.Xu Y. Kakhniashvili D.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) yields abundant quantities of the wild-type and the Cys-less CTPs, which are highly functional when incorporated into phospholipid vesicles (i.e. they display native kinetic properties and substrate specificity). Third, we characterized the ability of the reagents MTSES and MTSET to inhibit the function of each CTP mutant. Thus, with each single-Cys CTP mutant the rate constant for inhibition by each MTS reagent was determined. There are several suppositions implicit to this approach, which have been previously discussed in detail (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and thus will be mentioned here only briefly. First, it is postulated that if, following mutation of a given wild-type residue to Cys, significant citrate transport is retained, then the structure of the mutated transporter, including the location of the introduced Cys in the transporter's three-dimensional structure, is not substantively changed from that of the wild-type carrier. Second, it is postulated that, within a transmembrane domain, only those amino acids that reside on a water-accessible surface of the transporter will rapidly react with MTSES and MTSET. This idea is founded on the observations that: (i) these two polar reagents are impermeable to a lipid bilayer in the absence of a protein-mediated channel or translocation pathway (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M.

Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and thus will not readily access residues facing the hydrophobic bilayer and (ii) MTS derivatives react >109 more rapidly with the thiolate anion (formed only upon exposure of the sulfhydryl group to water) compared with the unionized thiol group (27.Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29.Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Third, it is assumed that the covalent addition of -SCH2CH2X to a cysteine will be sufficiently disruptive to inhibit transport. Thus, rapid inhibition of transport is interpreted as evidence that the modified Cys side chain is located within the aqueous transport pathway in a domain with sufficiently narrow dimensions such that the modification blocks substrate transport. Lastly, because citrate is hydrophilic, of similar size and occupies a volume similar to that of the MTS reagents (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we postulate that both substrate and the MTS reagents will access similar domains and thus the MTS-accessible surface of a transmembrane domain constitutes a portion of the citrate translocation pathway through the CTP. Functional Characterization of CTP Single-cysteine Replacement Mutants—Fig. 2A depicts the reconstituted citrate transport specific activity values observed with the Cys-less CTP and the 28 single-Cys CTP variants. It is noteworthy that, although all of the single Cys mutants displayed measurable BTC-sensitive citrate transport activity, they could be divided into three categories, based on their sensitivity to Cys replacement. The first category consists of five mutants (G119C, E122C, S123C, E131C, and K134C) that displayed severe functional defects such that they retained less than 4% of the starting Cys-less function, thereby suggesting that the wild-type residues at these positions are extremely intolerant of Cys substitution and may be essential to CTP function. The second category consists of three mutants (G115C, V127C, and I133C) that displayed significant, but nonetheless substantially impaired function, such that >4% and ≥16% of the initial Cys-less function was retained. The third category consists of the remaining 20 mutants that were either functionally unaffected or were only mildly impaired. These mutants displayed specific activity values that ranged from 32 to 135% of the starting Cys-less CTP, with a mean value of 74%. Interestingly, the 8 residues that are extremely sensitive to mutation (i.e. Categories 1 and 2; a mean of 5.8% of the starting Cys-less activity was retained) occur with an average periodicity of 3.4 residues and therefore likely reside on one face of an α-helix. These residues are colored red in Fig. 2B. Mutation of the remaining 20 residues on other surfaces of the helix are considerably less disruptive of CTP function, as evidenced by the fact that a mean specific activity value of 74% of the initial Cys-less activity was retained. These residues are denoted in blue in Fig. 2B. Finally, because the results presented in Fig. 2A indicate that, with only a few exceptions, most of the single-Cys CTP variants displayed significant citrate transport activity, we conclude that the overall structural and functional integrity of the CTP has been preserved with this panel of mutants. Thus, an important prerequisite for initiation of the strategy of probing single Cys accessibilities to MTS reagents has been met, and this approach is likely to yield important structural information (25.Kurz L.L. Zuhlke R.D. Zhang H.-J. Joho R.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two further points should be noted. First, with each single Cys CTP mutant, we directly measured the proportion of added protein that actually incorporated into the liposomal vesicles (14.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We observed with the 28 single Cys mutants that 69.3% ± 5.9% (mean ± S.D. for the 28 mutants) of added protein incorporated into the liposomes. Thus we conclude that each of the mutated CTPs incorporated into phospholipid vesicles to a similar degree and that the alterations observed in reconstituted citrate transport activity (i.e. Fig. 2) are not a consequence of preferential incorporation of one mutant versus another. Second, a high degree of bacterial overexpression was achieved with each of the single Cys CTP mutants. Thus, upon solubilization of inclusion body protein with the detergent Sarkosyl, we obtained a mean value of 60 mg of each single-Cys CTP variant per liter of E. coli culture (range = 25-88 mg/liter) at a purity of ∼70%. Accessibility of Single Cys CTP Mutants to MTSES- and MTSET+—We measured the accessibility of each single Cys CTP mutant to MTSES and MTSET. These reagents are small, water-soluble, cysteine-specific, and display opposite charges (22.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). They form a mixed disulfide via addition of -SCH2CH2X to the reduced sulfhydryl of cysteine, where X is either SO3- or N(CH3)3+ for MTSES and MTSET, respectively (22.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M.

In contrast, several reports indicate N-cadherin does not suppress but, rather, promotes cell motility and invasion. Here, by characterizing a series of chimeric cadherins we defined a previously uncharacterized region consisting of the transmembrane domain and an adjacent portion of the cytoplasmic segment that is responsible for the difference in ability of E- and N-cadherin to suppress movement of mammary carcinoma cells, as quantified from time-lapse video recordings. A mutation in this region enabled N-cadherin to suppress motility, indicating that both E- and N-cadherin can suppress, but the activity of N-cadherin is latent, presumably repressed by binding of a specific inhibitor. To define regions common to E- and N-cadherin that are required for suppression, we analyzed a series of deletion mutants. We found that suppression of movement requires E-cadherin amino acids 699–710. Strikingly, β-catenin binding is not sufficient for and p120ctn is not involved in suppression of these mammary carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the comparable region of N-cadherin can substitute for this required region in E-cadherin and is required for suppression by the mutant form of N-cadherin that is capable of suppressing. Variations in expression of factors that bind to the two regions we have identified may explain previously observed differences in response of tumor cells to cadherins.

The cadherin family of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules plays important roles in differentiation and morphogenesis (1Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). Alterations in cadherin expression also have been found to be an important determinant of tumor behavior (2Van Aken E. De Wever O. Correia da Rocha A.S. Mareel M. Virchows Arch. 2001; 439: 725-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). E-cadherin suppresses cell movement (3Chen W.C. Obrink B. J.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar), whereas loss of E-cadherin correlates with acquisition of invasive capacity in vitro (5Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. van Roy F.

Nature. 1998; 392: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). For these reasons, E-cadherin has been termed an invasion suppressor, but the mechanisms mediating these effects are poorly understood. In contrast, N-cadherin promotes rather than suppresses cell motility and invasion (9Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 10Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), apparently by triggering or enhancing activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (9Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 11Suyama K. Shapiro I. Guttman M. Hazan R.B. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Because cadherins might suppress invasion through mechanical restraint or through alterations in cell behavior induced by signaling, the roles of adhesion and signaling in suppression of invasion have been the subject of substantial investigation.These investigations have focused upon the cytoplasmic domain, which is highly conserved among classic cadherins and crucial for mediating cadherin function. Proteins that bind to the cadherin cytoplasmic domain in roughly stoichiometric amounts were termed catenins (12Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). β-Catenin binds to a C-terminal region of cadherins referred to as the catenin binding domain (13Lilien J. Balsamo J. Arregui C. Xu G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and also to α-catenin, which interacts with the actin cytoskeleton (14Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A related molecule, p120ctn, binds to a second region close to the plasma membrane (15Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 16Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Both regions contribute to adhesion, although there is substantial cell type variation in precise roles (see (14Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar)). The catenin binding and p120ctn binding domains are highly conserved between E- and N-cadherin.We investigated the role of these cytoplasmic domains in suppression of motility and found that the p120ctn binding domain was essential for E-cadherin to suppress motility of a rat astrocyte-like cell line (4Chen H. Paradies N.E. Fedor-Chaiken M. Brackenbury R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar). Three groups found that cytoplasmic p120ctn induced changes in cell morphology and small GTPase activity and suggested that E-cadherin may suppress motility by sequestering p120ctn (18Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 19Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Wong and Gumbiner (21Wong A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1191-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) recently reported that p120ctn is not involved and instead suggest that modulation of β-catenin association is responsible for control of cell invasion by E-cadherin. Activated β-catenin stimulates motility of epithelial cells (22Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There are apparent inconsistencies in these findings, and none of these studies offers an obvious explanation for the difference in suppressing capacity of E- and N-cadherin.To explore the basis for this difference and to investigate the mechanisms by which E-cadherin suppresses cell movement, we have analyzed the effects of a series of E/N chimeric cadherins and deletion mutants on the motility of mammary carcinoma cells. This work revealed a region common to both E- and N-cadherin that is essential for suppression of the movement of these cells and a second region responsible for the difference in suppression capacity of E- and N-cadherin. Surprisingly, we found that N-cadherin is capable of suppressing motility, but this capacity is normally repressed or latent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—MDA-MB-435 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from Michael Kinch (MedImmune) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 60 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cadherin constructs were co-transfected with pCMV-puro, and selection was performed using 1 μg/ml puromycin. Expression of cadherins at the cell surface was verified by immunofluorescent labeling and aggregation assays.Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (795) specific for the E-cadherin extracellular domain were produced as described (23Meigs T.E.

This fragment was cloned into the EcoRV and NsiI sites of pBATMNC, replacing the wild type N-cadherin sequences, and the resulting clone was verified by sequencing. A similar PCR approach was used to make a fragment encoding the NHA Δ720–731 deletion. This fragment was cloned into the unique EcoRV and NsiI sites of pBATMNC.Eight chimeric cadherin constructs, NEE, ENN, EEN, NNE, NEN, ENE, E657N, and E618N, were made using a two-step PCR approach and subsequent cloning into either the BstEII and Bsu36I sites of pBATEM2 or the EcoRV and NsiI sites of pBATMNC.

Briefly, monolayers of cells at 60–90% confluence were trypsinized under conditions that preserve cadherins (29Brackenbury R. Thiery J.P. Rutishauser U. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brackenbury R. Rutishauser U. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 cells were placed in vials and rotated at 90 rpm, 37 °C. Aggregates were photographed after 60 min.Wound-filling Assays—Wound filling assays were done in two ways. For quantitative time-lapse analysis cells were grown to confluence on coverslips coated with laminin (Sigma), and a wound was made. The coverslip was placed in a Sykes Moore chamber, which was then filled with fresh medium containing 10 μg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma) to inhibit cell division. The chamber was placed on a heated stage on an Olympus IMT-2 microscope, and images were captured every 15 min for a total of 15 h using Scion Image. Movement of selected cells at the wound edge was tracked using Metamorph software, and distance moved in the x axis, the y axis, and in total was determined. For quick qualitative analysis cells were grown to confluence on tissue culture plates, and a wound was made by scraping the monolayer with a pipette tip. Images were captured using Scion Image software immediately after wounding and 18–24 h later. Morphology of the wound edge at 18–24 h was observed and compared with the wound edges of cells shown to be motile or suppressed by quantitative time-lapse analysis. For each cell line assayed, at least two independent clones were assessed by the qualitative assay, and at least one clone was assessed by the quantitative assay.Statistical Analysis—For quantitative assessment of motility, two time-lapse video recordings were made of a clonal cell line, and 8 cells were tracked in each video. Means and S.D. were calculated for the x axis, y axis, and total movement data. Mean motilities were compared by one-way analysis of variance, and pairwise multiple comparisons were carried out using Tukey's adjustment for multiple comparison.Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were carried out as previously described (4Chen H. Paradies N.E. Fedor-Chaiken M. Brackenbury R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar) except that cells were extracted with CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) plus 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin to maintain association of p120ctn with cadherins.Subcellular Fractionation—Cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described (18Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the cytosolic fractions were determined, and for each cell line, 15 μg of cytosolic protein was loaded per well. For the membrane fractions, the volume loaded represented the same proportion of the total sample as the volume of cytosolic sample loaded.RESULTSTo identify regions of the cadherin cytoplasmic domain that are involved in suppression of motility, we examined the effect of mutant and chimeric cadherins on the motility of an MDAMB-435 mammary carcinoma cell line. Although some isolates of MDA-MB-435 cells express N-cadherin (9Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), the isolate used for all studies described here does not express E-cadherin or N-cadherin endogenously but does express low levels of protein(s) that react with a pan-cadherin antibody. The cells form only small loose aggregates in the presence of calcium (Fig. 1) and are motile. These MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with each cadherin expression vector, and in each case, several permanent lines were established. The expression of cadherins was verified by immunofluorescent labeling and quantified by immunoblotting, which revealed that all of the lines transfected with E-cadherin vectors expressed amounts of E-cadherin that were roughly similar to each other and to MCF-10 cells, a relatively normal mammary epithelial line (31Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similarly, immunoblotting revealed that all of the N-cadherin lines expressed comparable amounts of N-cadherin. The ability of the cadherins to mediate aggregation was determined by comparison to control cells and E-cadherin- and N-cadherin-expressing cells as shown in Fig. 1, and then motility was assayed by observing the movement of cells into artificial “wounds” induced by scraping.A New Assay Confirms E- and N-cadherin Differ in Their Ability to Suppress Motility of Mammary Carcinoma Cells— First, we examined the effects of E- and N-cadherin on movement of MDA-MB-435 cells. When observed 18–24 h after wounding, control cells or N-cadherin-expressing cells generally had migrated further into the wound than E-cadherin-expressing cells. This difference in distance moved by the edge of the wound was not always significant or reproducible, but the assays could be reliably scored based on consistent and striking differences in the appearance of cells at the wound edge. E-cadherin-expressing cells appeared to move as a sheet, resulting in a smooth edge of tightly adherent cells oriented toward the wound. In contrast, N-cadherin or control cells appeared to move as individuals, resulting in a ragged edge with cells oriented in different directions (Fig. 2). The difference in movement of E- and N-cadherin or control cells reflected in appearance of the wound edges was placed on an objective footing by analyzing cell tracks determined from time-lapse video recording. Representative tracks illustrate that E-cadherin cells generally move in a straight line perpendicular to the wound, along the y axis, whereas N-cadherin and control cells often move parallel to the wound, along the x axis (Fig. 2). The cell track data were quantified, revealing that x-axis movement and total movement of the E-cadherin cells were significantly lower than control and N-cadherin cells. In contrast, y axis movement was not significantly different between E-cadherin and control cells (Table II), which confirmed the lack of significant differences when the distance moved by the monolayer edge was measured. Similar results were observed with a second mammary carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-231 (not shown). Expression of N-cadherin in the MDA-MB-435 cells resulted in a modest but statistically significant increase in cell movement, as previously observed (9Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 10Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The wound-filling assay was used in all subsequent assays to evaluate the effects of mutant cadherins, scored either by comparing the morphology of the wound edges to that of control and E-cadherin-expressing cells or by quantification of cell tracks and comparison to results from control or E-cadherin-expressing cells. Because expression of E-cadherin was found to decrease x axis movement by 45% compared with control, suppression was defined as the ability to decrease x axis movement by a comparable amount.Fig. 2E-cadherin, but not N-cadherin, suppresses movement of MDA-MB-435 cells. The panels illustrate the movement of MDAMB-435 control cells and cells expressing E- or N-cadherin into wounds. Each panel shows two overlapping images of sheets of cells.

Here also, E-cadherin-expressing cells were less motile than N-cadherin or control cells. Examples of selected cell tracks determined from video recordings are shown in Fig. 3, and quantification of movement calculated from these tracks indicated the difference in movement of E-cadherin cells, and control or N-cadherin cells was statistically significant. In contrast to its effect in wounding assays, N-cadherin did not promote motility relative to control cells in intact monolayers (Fig. 3).Fig. 3E-cadherin, but not N-cadherin, suppresses movement of individual cells in an unwounded, confluent monolayer. Micrographs of MDA-MB-435 control cells and E- and N-cadherin-expressing cells are shown beside tracks of selected control and E- and N-cadherin cells as determined from time-lapse video recordings. The histogram summarizes the mean rate of total movement over 15 h by 16 individual MDA-MB-435 cells transfected with expression vectors for E-cadherin, N-cadherin, or a control vector and grown to confluency.

The overall structure and function of these chimeric molecules was not disrupted, as in each case we verified that the chimeric proteins were correctly localized to the cell surface, and adhesive activity was preserved. This strategy had the potential to reveal regions within E-cadherin that mediate suppression or regions within N-cadherin that overcome or inhibit suppression. An NEE chimera suppressed the motility of MDA-MB-435 cells, but an ENN chimera did not (Fig. 4), as shown both by the morphology of wound edges and by quantitative analysis of video recordings (x axis movement of NEE was significantly less than control, p < 0.0001). Therefore, the ability to suppress motility is dictated by the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domains of these cadherins.Fig. 4Analysis of chimeric cadherins defines a region responsible for the difference between E- and N-cadherin in suppression of motility. The diagram shows the structures of chimeric cadherins in which the extracellular domain, TMS, or portions of the cytoplasmic domain of mouse E- or N-cadherin were fused in various combinations (“Experimental Procedures” and Table I). Each construct was transfected into MDA-MB-435 cells, and the resultant lines were characterized and assayed for the ability to suppress motility by the qualitative assessment of the morphology of wound edges 18–24 h after wounding. The motility of cells expressing the first four constructs listed was also assayed by quantitative analysis of individual cell tracks determined from time-lapse video recording. Aggregation was also assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and scored positive or negative by comparison to aggregation of control or E-cadherin-expressing cells as shown in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further define the region involved in controlling motility, the three segments derived from E- or N-cadherin were linked in all possible combinations, introduced into MDA-MB-435 cells, and analyzed for effects on motility by comparing morphology of the wound edges at 18–24 h to that of E-cadherinand N-cadherin-expressing cells as shown in Fig. 2. In each case, at least two independent lines expressing similar amounts of cadherin were examined, with consistent results. An EEN construct suppressed motility, in contrast to the ENN construct discussed previously, narrowing the sequences that define the difference in suppression ability of E- and N-cadherin to the transmembrane segment (TMS). As this finding would predict, the chimeric cadherin produced by replacing the TMS of N-cadherin with E-cadherin sequences (NEN) also suppressed movement. Unexpectedly, howe"

In addition, IFN-α/β inhibits interleukin (IL)-4 signaling in B cells and monocytes, suggesting that IFN-α/β (like IFN-γ) is a Th1 cytokine. Here, we study cross-talk between IFN-α and IL-4 in human T cells. As expected, stimulation with IFN-α for 12–24 h inhibits IL-4 signaling. Surprisingly, however, IFN-α has the opposite effect on IL-4 signaling at earlier time points (up to 6 h). Thus, IFN-α enhances IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation in both CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells. The effect is specific because (i) another interferon, IFN-γ, does not enhance IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation, (ii) IFN-α-mediated STAT1 and STAT2 activation is not modulated by IL-4, and (iii) activation of Janus kinases is not enhanced or prolonged by simultaneous stimulation with IFN-α and IL-4. Moreover, co-stimulation results in a selective increased STAT6/STAT2 association and an association between IFNAR/IL-4R components, suggesting that the IFNAR provides an additional STAT6 docking site via STAT2, leading to a more efficient dimerization/activation of STAT6 only. The co-stimulatory effect on STAT6 activation correlates with a cooperative increase in nuclear translocation, DNA binding, transcriptional activity, and mRNA expression of STAT6 target genes (IL-4Rα and IL-15Rα). In conclusion, we provide evidence that IFN-α both up- and down-regulates IL-4-mediated STAT6 signaling and thereby regulates the sensitivity to IL-4 in human T lymphocytes. Thus, our findings suggest that IFN-α has a complex regulatory role in adaptive immunity, which is different from the “classical” Th1 profile of IFN-γ.

Thus, in addition to the direct anti-viral effect, IFN-α has several important regulatory effects on multiple cell types involved in the innate immune defense. For example, IFN-α stimulates the cytolytic capacity and function of NK cells, the phagocytic functions and production of cytokines by macrophages, and the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules in most immune cells as well as many other types of somatic cells (1.Wallach D.

In contrast to the well established functions in innate immunity, less is known about the functions of IFN-α in adaptive immunity. Yet some studies indicate that IFN-α promotes Th1 differentiation (4.Brinkmann V. Geiger T. Alkan S. Heusser C.H. J. Exp.

By binding of IL-4 and IFN-α to their high affinity receptors, receptor-associated JAKs become activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Once activated, the JAKs phosphorylate key tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic receptor tails, creating docking sites for STAT transcription factors. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation by JAKs, the recruited STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of cytokine-inducible genes (11.Darnell J.E.J.

IL-4 induces activation of JAK1/JAK3 bound to the IL-4Rα chain/common γ (γc) chain, respectively, whereas TYK2/JAK1 bound to the IFN-αR (IFNAR)-1/IFNAR2, respectively, are activated by IFN-α (3.Pestka S.

IL-4 and IFN-α stimulation thereby lead to activation of STAT6 and STAT1, respectively, and the importance of STAT6/STAT1 in IL-4/IFN-α signaling is clearly demonstrated in studies with STAT-deficient mice; thus, in STAT6-deficient mice, almost all of the IL-4-mediated functions in B and T cells are impaired (14.Kuhn R.

Once activated, STAT6 homodimers and or STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer in complex with the p48 protein (the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex) bind to specific STAT-binding sequences in promotor regions of IL-4- and IFN-α-inducible genes, respectively, thereby assisting in their transcriptional activation (3.Pestka S.

Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed accordingly to the instructions of the Promega luciferase assay system and the Invitrogen β-galactosidase assay kit.RESULTSIt is well known that IFN-α and IL-4 induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT6, respectively (3.Pestka S. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 18-40Google Scholar, 10.Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 35.Quelle F.W.

This tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical step in STAT homodimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation of IFN-α- and IL-4-inducible genes. Thus, to study the early signaling events during cross-talk between IL-4 and IFN-α, we first analyzed the IFN-α- and IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins in a human CD8+ T cell line, MySi. As shown in Fig. 1A, stimulation with IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in a dose-dependent manner with an optimum of 10,000 units/ml and a lower detection level between 500 and 1,000 units/ml. Likewise, IL-4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 in a dose-dependent manner with an optimum of 25 ng/ml and a lower detection level of ∼0.05-0.1 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). IFN-α at 10,000 units/ml induced a weak tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 (Fig. 1C, lane 2), whereas optimal concentrations of IL-4 (25 ng/ml) did not induce detectable levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (Fig. 1C, lane 11). Simultaneous stimulation with IFN-α (10,000 units/ml) and nonstimulatory concentrations of IL-4 (0.05–0.1 ng/ml) triggered a significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 (Fig. 1C, top row, lane 4 versus lane 3 and lane 6 versus lane 5), indicating a synergistic effect of IFN-α and IL-4 at these concentrations. IFN-α also increased IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 at higher concentrations of IL-4 (Fig. 1C, top row, lane 8 versus lane 7 and lane 10 versus lane 9). In contrast, IFN-α-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was not enhanced by simultaneous stimulation with IFN-α and IL-4 (Fig. 1C, third row), indicating that IFN-α had a selective, co-stimulatory effect on IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation, whereas IL-4 did not affect the IFN-α-induced STAT1 phosphorylation.To address whether these observations were a unique finding for the CD8+ MySi T cell line or a general feature for T cells, we tested the effects of IFN-α and IL-4 in alloreactive CD4+ T cell lines and CD4+ CTCL cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, IL-4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 in CD4+ alloreactive T cells with a profile similar to CD8+ T cells. More importantly, the combined stimulation with IL-4 and IFN-α had a synergistic effect on STAT6 activation (Fig. 2A) that was almost identical to that observed in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1C). Again, the combined stimulation with the two cytokines had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 2A, third row, lane 2 versus lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10). IFN-α also enhanced IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 in a CTCL cell line (Fig. 2B). Indeed, the synergistic effect of IFN-α and IL-4 became stronger at suboptimal concentrations of IFN-α (Fig. 2B, top row, lane 6 versus lane 5 and lane 8 versus lane 7), supporting the observation above that IFN-α increased the IL-4 sensitivity or, in other words, lowered the threshold for IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation. Essentially identical findings were observed in other CD4+ T cell lines and CTCL lines (cf. below and data not shown). In contrast to IFN-α, IFN-γ had no positive stimulatory effect on IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation (Fig. 2C), indicating that the different classes of interferons differ in their immunoregulatory effects.Fig. 2IFN-α lowers the threshold for IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6.A and B, alloreactive CD4+ T cells and CD4+ CTCL cells, respectively, were stimulated either simultaneously or alone with IFN-α and/or IL-4 as indicated for 10 min. C, alloreactive CD4+ T cells were preincubated with IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) at the indicated periods of time, prior to stimulation with IL-4 (0.5 ng/ml) as indicated for 10 min.

In these studies, the cells were preincubated with IFN-α or IFN-β for 45 min to 24 h prior to stimulation with IL-4, suggesting that the kinetics play a critical role for the outcome of cytokine cross-talk. Accordingly, experiments were performed to study the kinetics of cross-talk between IL-4 and IFN-α. T cells were incubated with IFN-α for various periods of time prior to stimulation with IL-4. As shown in Fig. 3A, the strongest co-stimulatory effect was seen at the simultaneous addition of cytokines and after short periods of preincubation, whereas the co-stimulatory effect declined following extended preincubations with IFN-α. Almost identical results were obtained when preincubating the T cells with IL-4 prior to stimulation with IFN-α. Here, the co-stimulatory effect declined after only 10 min of preincubations with IL-4 (Fig. 3B). Simultaneous stimulation with the two cytokines triggered a rapid synergistic effect, which became stronger with time (Fig. 3C, top row), suggesting that the effect was accumulating over time. Because JAK1 is associated with the high affinity receptors for both IL-4 and IFN-α, we addressed whether the co-stimulatory effect was mediated through a synergistic effect on JAK1 activation. As judged from induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, co-stimulation with IFN-α and suboptimal concentrations of IL-4 had no significant co-stimulatory effect (Fig. 3C, second row). Likewise, simultaneous stimulation with IFN-α and IL-4 did not induce an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 or TYK2 (data not shown), indicating that the co-stimulatory effect was not mediated through a combinatorial effect on JAK activation per se.Fig. 3Simultaneous stimulation with IFN-α and IL-4 induces maximal STAT6 activation.A, CTCL cells were preincubated with IFN-α (5,000 units/ml) at the indicated periods of time prior to stimulation with IL-4 (0.25 ng/ml) as indicated for 10 min. B, CTCL cells were preincubated with IL-4 (0.25 ng/ml) at the indicated periods of time, prior to stimulation with IFN-α (5,000 units/ml) as indicated for 10 min. C, CTCL cells were simultaneously stimulated with IFN-α (5,000 units/ml) and IL-4 (0.25 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time.

Jiang M. Pernis A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3834-3841PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we found that IFN-α also induced STAT6 phosphorylation in human T cell lines (Figs. 1C; 2, A and B; and 3). Given the ability of STAT6 to both homodimerize and to form complexes with STAT2, a simultaneous stimulation with IL-4 and IFN-α might lead to a faster dissociation of phosphorylated STAT6 proteins from their docking sites on the IL-4/IFN-α receptors. As a result, more STAT6 proteins will bind and become phosphorylated, which in turn might lead to the observed synergistic increase in STAT6 phosphorylation. To investigate this hypothesis, the association between STAT6 and STAT2 was first examined by co-immunoprecipitation during co-stimulation with IL-4 and IFN-α. As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT2 following stimulation with IFN-α did indeed result in an increased association between STAT2 and STAT6 (top panel, first row, lane 3). More importantly, the combined stimulation with IL-4 and IFN-α lead to a significant increase in this association (lane 4 versus lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the association between STAT2 and STAT1 induced by IFN-α was not affected by IL-4 (second row, upper band, lane 4 versus lane 3). Almost identical results were obtained during co-stimulation with the two cytokines, when immunoprecipitating with anti-STAT6 (Fig. 4A, middle panel). However, STAT6 has never been reported to form complexes with STAT1, and no association between these STAT proteins was observed in our study (second row (no upper band)). Total lysates from the stimulated cells were also subjected to Western blotting (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Interestingly, whereas the co-stimulatory effect on the STAT6/STAT2 interaction correlated with increased STAT6 phosphorylation (top row, lane 4 versus lanes 2 and 3), phosphorylation of STAT2 was not affected (second row). Thus, whereas stimulation with IFN-α alone leads to increased STAT2/STAT6 and STAT2/STAT1 association, a simultaneous stimulation with IFN-α and IL-4 only increases the STAT2/STAT6 association and STAT6 phosphorylation, supporting the conclusions above that the co-stimulatory effect was selective for the IL-4-mediated STAT6 signal pathway. In conclusion, these results indicate that IFN-α-activated STAT2 participates in an increased IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation without being further activated itself. Thus, STAT2 seems to act as an additional docking site for STAT6 during IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation, which ultimately results in a more efficient STAT6 dimerization and thereby increased STAT6 phosphorylation/activation.Fig. 4Associations between STAT proteins and receptor components during stimulation with IL-4 and IFN-α. A and B, CTCL cells were stimulated with IFN-α and IL-4 as indicated for 10 min and lysed, and STAT proteins/receptor components were immunoprecipitated (IP) and analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies.

Oncol. 1997; 24: 18-40Google Scholar). To further investigate the co-stimulatory effect on STAT6 activation and support the suggested role of STAT2, we examined the IL-4R components, IL-4Rα and γc, for their association with the IFNAR-1 chain. Simultaneous stimulation with IL-4 and IFN-α clearly increased the association of IL-4Rα and both STAT6 and the γc chain (Fig. 4B, upper panel, first and second rows, lane 4 versus lanes 2 and 3). This indicates that only in combination with IFN-α does the nonstimulatory concentration of IL-4 result in effective oligomerization of the IL-4 high affinity receptor and recruitment of STAT6 to the IL-4Rα chain. However, this did not seem to be mediated through a direct association between the receptor subunits IL-4Rα and IFNAR-1, because no clear association was observed when reblotting with anti-IFNAR-1 (third row). In contrast, a clear association between the γc and IFNAR-1 chains is observed during simultaneous stimulation with IL-4 and IFN-α (Fig. 4B, lower panel, top row), whereas no recruitment of STAT6 to the γc chain was observed (middle row). Finally, the IFN-α-induced STAT2 association to the IFNAR-1 chain was not increased by co-stimulation with IL-4, and no clear association was observed between the IFNAR-2 chain and the IL-4Rα or γc chain during cytokine stimulation (data not shown).

One such enzyme, the mitochondrial inner membrane peptidase, has two catalytic subunits, which recognize distinct cleavage site motifs in their signal peptide substrates. The only other known type I SP with two catalytic subunits is the signal peptidase complex (SPC) in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, as with inner membrane peptidase catalytic subunits, SPC catalytic subunits exhibit nonoverlapping substrate specificity. We constructed two yeast strains without endogenous SP, one expressing canine SPC18 and the other expressing a truncation of canine SPC21 (SPC21ΔN), which lacks 24 N-terminal residues that prevent expression of SPC21 in yeast. By monitoring a variety of soluble and membrane-bound substrates, we find that, in contrast to the tested hypothesis, SPC catalytic subunits exhibit overlapping substrate specificity. SPC18 and SPC21ΔN do, however, cleave some substrates with different efficiencies, although no pattern for this behavior could be discerned. In light of the functional similarities between SPC proteins, we developed a membrane protein fragmentation assay to monitor the position of the catalytic sites relative to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Using this assay, our results suggest that the active sites of SPC18 and SPC21ΔN are located 4-11 Å above the membrane surface. These data, thus, support a model that SPC18 and SPC21 are functionally and structurally similar to each other.

The signal peptides used to target precursors across the plasma membrane in prokaryotic cells and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in eukaryotic cells contain three distinct amino acid stretches: a positively charged N-terminal region, a hydrophobic core, and a polar C-terminal region. A similar amino acid arrangement is present in a subset of signal peptides inside mitochondria and chloroplasts. The vast majority of signal peptides expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a cleavage site motif consisting of a small, uncharged residue at the P1 (also referred to as -1) position and a small, polar or hydrophobic residue at the P3 (-3) position (2von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 3Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 4von Heijne G.

The importance of this motif is illustrated by the fact that leader peptidase, the type I SP in Escherichia coli, has distinct binding pockets to accommodate the side chains of P1 and P3 amino acids in the soluble (extracytosolic) portion of this membrane-bound enzyme (6Paetzel M.

Whereas prokaryotic cells express monomeric type I SPs, the ER and mitochondrion present multisubunit enzymes. The SP purified from canine microsomes (termed the signal peptidase complex (SPC)) has five distinct subunits (8Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Two of these subunits, SPC18 and SPC21, are presumed to have catalytic activity based on their homology to characterized type I SPs (9Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial inner membrane peptidase (IMP) is a three-subunit complex also containing two catalytic subunits in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10Pratje E. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A clue to this subunit complexity comes from an analysis of the IMP, whose catalytic subunits exhibit nonoverlapping substrate specificity (11Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Notably, Imp1p recognizes unconventional cleavage site motifs that can have a variety of structurally unrelated P1 residues (13Chen X. VanValkenburgh C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Imp1p has an unusual preference for acidic residues at the P′1 position in the protein attached to the signal peptide (14Luo W. Chen X. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4943-4948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Imp2p, on the other hand, recognizes the canonical Ala-Xaa-Ala motif in which Ala residues are located at the P1 and P3 positions (11Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Chen X. VanValkenburgh C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol.

Unlike the SPC in mammals, the SPC in the yeast S. cerevisiae has only one catalytic subunit, Sec11p (15YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on this difference and by analogy to the IMP catalytic subunits, a model has emerged in which mammalian cells evolved a second SPC catalytic subunit to cleave an unconventional signal peptide(s) not present in yeast (11Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Here, we tested this model by expressing each catalytic subunit of mammalian SPC in yeast that lack endogenous Sec11p. Using this genetic complementation approach, we have identified soluble and membrane-bound substrates recognized by both SPC subunits.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the BamHI site upstream of the ADH1 promoter in the resulting construct, a unique NotI site adjacent to the BamHI site was cleaved and subjected to the Bal 31 exonuclease. The resulting plasmid was named pHF453. The ADH1 promoter was removed from pHF453 by digestion with SacI and BamHI and inserted into pRS424 and pRS426 (21Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M.

These vectors were used in constructions of plasmids encoding Sec11p, SPC18, and SPC21ΔN under control of the ADH1 promoter. The cDNA encoding SPC18 was amplified from canine spleen mRNA by reverse transcriptase PCR using primers P1 and P2 (Table I). The cDNA encoding SPC21 was amplified using primers P3 and P4.

Two oligonucleotide primers, M5′ and M3′, were used in making the mnn2 mutations. M5′ and M3′ correspond to sequences at the 5′ and 3′ end of the MNN2 gene, respectively. Pairs of complementary internal primers were designed to introduce mutations. For example, to prepare construct A (described under “Results”). M5′ and Mut-A3′ (Table I) were used to generate one PCR product. M3′ and Mut-A5′ were used to generate the second PCR product. We then obtained full-length mnn2 A mutant using M5′ and M3′, the products of the first two PCR reactions serving as template. Finally we inserted the mnn2 mutant genes between the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pHF454 and pHF455, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutation of prepro-α-factor(P1S) was introduced directly by a primer that was synthesized to contain the mutation. Primers for preinvertase, prepro-α-factor, and prepro-α-factor(P1S) were Inv5′ and Inv3′, α5′ and α3′, α-ser5′ and α3′, respectively. In Vitro Coupled Transcription/Translation—A BamHI-EcoRI DNA fragment that encodes SPC21-FLAG was inserted into the pCITER-2c expression vector (Novagen). The resulting construct (pCV107) (1 μg) was used in an in vitro coupled transcription/translation reaction, employing the TnTR coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). A 25-μl volume was used, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 min. In vitro translated SPC21-FLAG was precipitated from a 10-μl reaction mix using agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies (20 μl).

For Mnn2p fragmentation experiments, immunoprecipitates were subjected to endoglycosidase H treatment as described by the supplier (New England Biolabs). Complementation of Δsec11 with Canine Homologs of Sec11p—The alignment depicted in Fig. 1 reveals the high degree of sequence similarity between yeast Sec11p and its canine homologs, SPC18 and SPC21. Importantly, the alignment shows that SPC18 and SPC21 have conserved serine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues that are known to be essential for Sec11p catalytic activity (16VanValkenburgh C.

Based on these similarities, we asked whether SPC18 and SPC21 would function individually in yeast. The cDNAs encoding SPC18 and SPC21 were amplified from canine mRNA and inserted into yeast expression plasmid pHF453 under control of the ADH1 promoter (19Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plasmids pHF341 (SPC18 TRP1), pHF343 (SPC21 TRP1), and control plasmid pHF340 (SEC11 TRP1) were introduced into strain CMY710 (Δsec11)/pCM112 (SEC11 URA3). Cells were then placed on agar plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, which is used to select against the URA3 gene (28Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). As expected, CMY710 (Δsec11) cells cured of pCM112 (SEC11 URA3) and containing no other plasmid were unable to grow, whereas cells that contained pHF340 (SEC11 TRP1) grew in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (Fig. 2). The pHF341 (SPC18 TRP1) plasmid also supported cell growth, but pHF343 (SPC21 TRP1) did not. To understand why SPC21 failed to complement the Δsec11 mutation, we noted the presence of a 24-residue, N-terminal extension in SPC21 that was not present in Sec11p (Fig. 1). Although full-length SPC21 is present in the SPC purified from mammalian cells (25Greenburg G. Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15762-15765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that the extension could affect the function of the protein in yeast. We, therefore, prepared a new construct, pHF344 (TRP1), encoding SPC21ΔN without the N-terminal 24 residues (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2, SPC21ΔN permitted growth of strain CMY710 (Δsec11) in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid. SPC18 also has an extended N terminus relative to Sec11p, although this extension, 12 residues, is shorter than that present in SPC21 (Fig. 1). Indeed, SPC18 lacking these 12 residues supported growth of Δsec11 yeast (data not shown). Furthermore, SPC21 lacking its N-terminal 12 residues and containing a T13M substitution for translation initiation also complemented the Δsec11 mutation.Fig. 2Genetic complementation of the sec11 growth defect. Cells of yeast strain CMY710 (Δsec11)/pCM112 (SEC11 URA3) containing no additional plasmid or containing pHF340 (SEC11 TRP1), pHF341 (SPC18 TRP1), pHF343 (SPC21 TRP1), or pHF344 (SPC21ΔN TRP1) were grown to log phase. 10 μl of a 1:10 dilution of cells were placed on an agar plate containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, and cells were allowed to grow 4 days at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the inability of SPC21 to replace Sec11p was due to a protein expression problem, we C-terminally tagged SPC21 with the FLAG epitope (22Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar) and expressed the protein in vitro and in yeast strain CVY1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although we were able to detect in vitro expressed SPC21-FLAG (Fig. 3, lane 1), we did not detect the protein in yeast (lane 2). For control purposes, we attached the FLAG epitope to the C terminus of SPC21ΔN (lacking the N-terminal 24 residues) and expressed the protein in strain CVY1. In this control analysis, we were able to detect SPC21ΔN-FLAG in yeast cell extracts (lane 4). Surprisingly, when we moved the FLAG epitope to the N terminus of intact SPC21, the protein was expressed in yeast (lane 3), and FLAG-SPC21 supported growth of the Δsec11 mutant (data not shown). We, therefore, conclude that expression of SPC21 is affected by its N terminus. Removing the first 12 or 24 residues from SPC21 or adding the FLAG epitope to the N terminus of intact SPC21 permits expression of SPC21 catalytic activity inside yeast cells. SPC18 and SPC21ΔN Cleave Conventional Signal Peptides—As SP activity is essential for yeast cell growth (26Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the genetic data presented thus far are consistent with the notion that SPC18 and SPC21ΔN cleave signal peptides from yeast-expressed precursors. To generate corroborative biochemical evidence, we analyzed three precursors, preKar2p, preinvertase, and prepro-α-factor. We chose these precursors because their cleavage sites differ in amino acid composition at the critical P1 and P3 positions, although each substrate has a conventional cleavage site motif (i.e. small, uncharged residues at the P1 position and small, uncharged or hydrophobic residues at the P3 position). The precursors also vary in signal peptide length and hydrophobicity, thus presenting distinct features with which to analyze the substrate specificities of SPC18 and SPC21ΔN and to assess the tested hypothesis that these enzymes exhibit nonoverlapping substrate specificity. PreKar2p is the precursor to ER-resident protein Kar2p, the yeast homolog of mammalian BiP (29Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The signal peptide is unusually long (42 residues), is moderately hydrophobic (30Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and has a cleavage site motif consisting of (P3) Val-Xaa-Gly (P1) (29Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Strain CMY730 (Δsec11) bearing pCM112 (Sec11p), pHF341 (SPC18), or pHF344 (SPC21ΔN) was grown to early log phase, and cell extracts were immunoblotted with anti-Kar2p antibodies using methods described previously (18Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29092-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As expected, Sec11p efficiently converted preKar2p to Kar2p (Fig. 4A). SPC18 and SPC21ΔN also cleaved preKar2p, although less efficiently than Sec11p. Thus, in contrast to the tested hypothesis, SPC18 and SPC21ΔN show overlapping substrate specificity with respect to preKar2p. Preinvertase is the precursor to invertase, an enzyme secreted from yeast cells (31Taussig R. Carlson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The signal peptide is 19 residues in length, is strongly hydrophobic (32Rothe C. Lehle L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and has the cleavage site motif Ile-Xaa-Ala (31Taussig R. Carlson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Invertase undergoes extensive core glycosylation in the ER, requiring use of a glycosylation inhibitor to see distinct protein bands on SDS-PAGE gels. Preinvertase presents an additional problem for monitoring signal peptide cleavage, namely that the cleaved and uncleaved proteins cannot easily be resolved on protein gels. This problem necessitated our preparation and use of a truncated construct (residues 1-112) that encodes a protein with reduced molecular mass, termed preinvertase (112). Preinvertase (112) was C-terminally tagged with the HA epitope (23Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and placed under control of the ADH1 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). This construct was introduced into strain CMY730 (Δsec11) harboring pCM112 (Sec11p), pHF341 (SPC18), or pHF344 (SPC21ΔN). Log phase cells were treated with tunicamycin for 10 min to inhibit protein glycosylation (18Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29092-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 10 min, and then proteins were precipitated from cell extracts using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, Sec11p, SPC18, and SPC21ΔN converted similar amounts of preinvertase (112)-HA to invertase (112)-HA, a result consistent with the overlapping substrate specificity model. Prepro-α-factor is the precursor to the α-factor pheromone (33Kurjan J. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1982; 30: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Its signal peptide has 19 residues, is less hydrophobic than signal peptides in the previously examined precursors (30Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and has the cleavage site motif, Ala-Xaa-Ala (33Kurjan J. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1982; 30: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The cleaved and uncleaved forms of prepro-α-factor can be separated on SDS-PAGE gels, although the cleaved form migrates more slowly than the uncleaved form in this gel system (34Green N. Fang H. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prepro-α-factor (HA-tagged) was expressed in the above-mentioned yeast strains, and cells were treated with tunicamycin. As shown by pulse labeling (Fig. 5A), both mammalian enzymes were capable of cleaving prepro-α-factor-HA (Fig. 5A), although SPC21ΔN exhibited slightly more robust activity with this substrate. This latter point is addressed in subsequent sections. Among the precursors examined thus far, preinvertase and prepro-α-factor have alanine residues at the important P1 position, whereas preKar2p has a P1 glycine. Serine can also be found, albeit infrequently, at the P1 position in signal peptides (5Chou K.-C. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To assess the role of serine in the substrate specificities of SPC18 and SPC21ΔN, we asked whether these enzymes cleave prepro-α-factor when its P1 alanine is replaced by serine (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown by pulse labeling (Fig. 5B), both mammalian enzymes were able to recognize serine, although prepro-α-factor(P1S)-HA was cleaved slightly more efficiently by SPC21ΔN than by SPC18. As shown above, prepro-α-factor(P1A)-HA was also cleaved more efficiently by SPC21ΔN than by SPC18 (Fig. 5A), arguing that prepro-α-factor is a slightly better substrate for SPC21ΔN irrespective of the P1 residue. Taken together, the data presented in Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate that the SPC catalytic subunits recognize conventional cleavage site motifs in support of the overlapping substrate specificity model. SPC18 and SPC21ΔN Can Fragment a Membrane Protein—In addition to cleaving signal peptides, ER SP can also fragment integral membrane proteins in mammals and yeast. Membrane-bound substrates include viral polyproteins and abnormal cellular proteins that contain cleavage site motifs similar to those present in signal peptides (17Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36McLauchlan J. Lemberg M. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To monitor membrane protein fragmentation in this study, we employed Mnn2p (α-1,2-mannosyltransferase), a type II membrane protein inserted into the ER and then functionally expressed in the yeast Golgi (24Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We chose this protein for the following reasons. (i) At least some type II membrane proteins can be fragmented by the SPC if they have appropriate cleavage site motifs (17Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). (ii) Mnn2p lacks a subunit partner (24Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which was considered important because membrane protein complexes have been shown to be resistant to SPC fragmentation (35Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A systematic analysis of the “rules” governing membrane protein fragmentation has not been performed. However, the proximity of signal peptide cleavage sites to the hydrophobic regions in signal peptides led us to reason that a membrane protein cleavage site should be located near the transmembrane (TM) segment in Mnn2p. In addition, a signal peptide cleavage site is placed at the C-terminal end of the signal peptide, suggesting that a membrane protein cleavage site should be positioned near the C-terminal end of the TM segment. Using these criteria, we did not find an appropriate SPC cleavage site in Mnn2p, later confirmed by pulse labeling analysis (data not shown). We, therefore, prepared a series of constructs in which different numbers of amino acids were located between an introduced Ala-Xaa-Ala motif and the TM segment of Mnn2p (HA-tagged) (Fig. 6, constructs A-H). In some of the constructs (D and E), an additional amino acid substitution was introduced to eliminate the possibility that the Ala-Xaa-Ala motif would create an unintended cleavage site, which could be processed immediately following the introduced P3 Ala residue. Before examining SPC18 and SPC21ΔN with this series of Mnn2 mutant proteins, we wished to establish our assay using Sec11p. Constructs A-H were placed under control of the ADH1 promoter and expressed in yeast strain CMY730 (Δsec11) bearing pCM112 (Sec11p). Cells were subjected to a 5-min pulse labeling, and proteins were precipitated from cell extracts using anti-HA antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were treated with endoglycosidase H (see “Experimental Procedures”) to remove core oligosaccharides before analysis by SDS-PAGE. As shown by pulse labeling (Fig. 7A), Sec11p fragmented Mnn2-HA mutant proteins with different efficiencies. By plotting fragmentation efficiency against the number of amino acids between the cleavage site (P1 alanine) and the putative end of the TM segment, we observed a peak in activity when the P1 residue was located 1-2 amino acids from the TM segment (Fig. 7B). The significance of this peak is discussed below. Next, we analyzed strain CMY730 (Δsec11) bearing pHF341 (SPC18) or pHF344 (SPC21ΔN). Cells were subjected to pulse labeling as described above, and radiolabeled Mnn2-HA was visualized by autoradiography. As with Sec11p, SPC18 and SPC21ΔN fragmented the Mnn2 mutant proteins with different efficiencies (Fig. 8A). When these data were quantitated, fragmentation efficiency peaked for both mammalian enzymes when the P1 residue was positioned 1-3 amino acids from the TM segment (Fig. 8, B and C). These exceedingly similar fragmentation patterns further support a model of overlapping substrate specificity for SPC18 and SPC21ΔN. Despite these similarities, SPC18 exhibited more robust activity than SPC21ΔN across the entire series of Mnn2 mutant proteins (Fig. 8A). In contrast, we previously observed that SPC21ΔN cleaved prepro-α-factor more efficiently than SPC18 (Fig. 5A), a pattern that held even when the P1 alanine of prepro-α-factor was changed to serine (Fig. 5B). To determine whether a P1 serine had an effect on the fragmentation of Mnn2p, we took advantage of the fact that Mnn2p has a threonine residue conveniently located near the TM segment (Fig. 6). Threonine is commonly found at the P3 position in signal peptide cleavage sites (5Chou K.-C. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As such, Mnn2p needed only an appropriate P1 residue, either alanine (construct J) or serine (construct K) (Fig. 6), for an SPC cleavage site. When constructs J and K were introduced into strains CMY730/pHF341 (SPC18) and CMY730/pHF344 (SPC21ΔN), Mnn2 (P1A) and Mnn2 (P1S) were fragmented better by SPC18 than by SPC21ΔN (Fig. 9), although inclusion of the serine residue significantly reduced fragmentation efficiency by both SPC proteins. These data, thus, point not to a role for serine in the substrate specificities but to a model that Mnn2p is a slightly better substrate for SPC18 than SPC21ΔN. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that type I SPs in the mammalian ER, SPC18 and SPC21, exhibit nonoverlapping substrate specificity, such as that seen with the catalytic subunits of another type I SP, the mitochondrial IMP. To this end, we attempted to complement yeast cells that lack endogenous SP activity with canine SPC18 and SPC21. We were successful using SPC18, but a 24-residue, N-terminal truncation (ΔN) was needed to achieve complementation with SPC21 (Fig. 2). The truncation was required because intact SPC21 is not expressed in yeast (Fig. 3). Using the complemented yeast strains, we demonstrate that SPC18 and SPC21ΔN cleave signal peptides from preKar2p, preinvertase, and prepro-α-factor (Figs. 4 and 5), which have conventional cleavage site motifs (i.e. small uncharged residues at the P1 and P3 positions). Thus, in contrast to the original hypothesis, our data suggest mammalian SPC has two catalytic subunits with overlapping substrate specificity. The functional analysis of leader peptidase, the type I SP in E. coli, supports our use of SPC21ΔN to assess SPC21 catalytic specificity (7Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As shown in that study, the isolated, catalytic domain of leader peptidase can cleave signal peptides accurately in vitro, even though the catalytic fragment lacks the entire cytoplasmic domain and transmembrane segments. On the other hand, SPC21ΔN lacks only the first 24 residues of the SPC21 cytosolic domain. Our inability to express intact SPC21 in yeast may be a problem unique to the system employed here, as full-length SPC21 and, for that matter, SPC18 are present in the SPC complex purified from canine microsomes (9Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Greenburg G. Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15762-15765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, the N-terminal extension may prevent assembly of SPC21 with one or more of the yeast SPC subunits. Sec11p, the yeast homolog of SPC18 and SPC21, binds to Spc3p, a noncatalytic subunit that is required to stabilize Sec11p in the yeast SPC (16VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Fang H. Mullins C. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13159-13164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the N terminus of SPC21 may interfere with Spc3p binding, leading to degradation of SPC21 in yeast. Consistent with the model of overlapping substrate specificity, as monitored using soluble precursors (Figs. 4 and 5), SPC18 and SPC21ΔN exhibit membrane protein fragmentation activity. To monitor fragmentation, we introduced the Ala-Xaa-Ala motif into Mnn2p at different positions relative to its TM segment (Fig. 6). We first used this series of Mnn2 mutant proteins to examine the fragmentation activity of yeast Sec11p. In that analysis, we observed a peak in fragmentation activity when the cleavage (fragmentation) site was located 1-2 residues from the putative end of the TM segment (Fig. 7B). To interpret the meaning of this peak, we considered the fact that Sec11p is an integral membrane protein whose catalytic site is anchored to the surface of the ER membrane (15YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a membrane protein substrate is likely to be fragmented when the distance separating its cleavage site from the ER membrane is similar to the distance separating the Sec11p catalytic site from the ER membrane. According to this interpretation, a distance encompassed by 1-2 amino acid residues is likely to correspond to the height of the Sec11p catalytic site. Approximately 3.5 Å is taken as the distance spanned by each residue in an extended protein (40Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the Sec11p catalytic site is positioned 4-7 Å above the lumenal surface of the ER membrane. Accordingly, the SPC18 and SPC21ΔN catalytic sites are located 4-11 Å (1-3 residues) above the ER membrane (Fig. 8, B and C). The accuracy of these estimates can be questioned by our imprecise knowledge of the boundary between the TM segment and extracytoplasmic domain of Mnn2p. However, the Kyte-Doolittle analysis (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) defined a stretch of 19 consecutive residues exhibiting a hydrophobicity index greater than 0, flanked on both sides by multiple charged residues in Mnn2p (Fig. 6). This amino acid configuration is similar to TM segments in many integral membrane proteins, suggesting that our calculated values are likely to be in error by, at most, only a few residues (angstroms). Furthermore, our estimates are in good agreement with a prior study (41Chen X. VanValkenburgh C. Liang H. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2411-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in which we suggested the SPC catalytic site is closer to the membrane surface than the oligosaccharyltransferase active site, positioned 30-40 Å above the lumenal surface of the ER membrane (40Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Obtaining our estimates for the height of the SPC catalytic sites would probably not be possible using signal peptide substrates because many are not firmly anchored to the ER membrane. 2H. Liang, N. Green, and H. Fang, unpublished result. As a result, placing a cleavage site at different distances from the rather short hydrophobic region of a typical signal peptide would likely yield a broad range of efficiently processed sites, such as that seen previously (42Jain R.G. Rusch S.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16305-16310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, our use of an integral membrane protein substrate has enabled us to identify a narrow range of efficiently processed cleavage sites whose distance from the TM segment is likely to correspond directly to the disposition of the SPC catalytic site with respect to the ER membrane. A major question remains unanswered. Why would mammalian SPC have two catalytic subunits with overlapping substrate specificity? The answer may come from our work showing differences in cleavage efficiency. Prepro-α-factor was cleaved more efficiently by SPC21ΔN than by SPC18 (Fig. 5), whereas Mnn2p was fragmented more efficiently by SPC18 than by SPC21ΔN (Fig. 9). We have not established a pattern for these differences, despite our use of substrates with different residues at the critical P1 and P3 positions, different degrees of hydrophobicity, and different numbers of residues between the cleavage site and hydrophobic segment. Instead, subtle differences in the conformation of the cleavage site may account for the observed differences in cleavage efficiencies. Such conformational effects could result from the absence of amino acid conservation outside the P1 and P3 positions. Considering this sequence variability and the large number of soluble and membrane-bound proteins cleaved by mammalian SPC as compared to yeast SPC, a second catalytic subunit may be needed in mammalian cells to ensure efficient cleavage of all encountered substrates.

T cell stimulation assays showed that varying the concentration of zinc ions present affected the activity of the toxin and we observed that high zinc concentrations considerably inhibited T cell responses. This indicates that SEC2 may have multiple modes of interaction with the immune system that are dependent on serum zinc levels.

Lancet. 1978; 2: 1116-1118Abstract PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Members of the superantigen family include the staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) A, B, C, D, E, and H, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spes) A, B, and C. Amino acid sequence comparison shows that the staphylococcal enterotoxins fall into two main groups with SEA, -D, -E, and -H comprising one group and SEB and the SECs, the second group. The SECs can be classified further into at least three serotypes (C1 to C3) depending on minor epitope differences. TSST-1 shows little sequence homology (less than 28%) with the SEs (4.Blomster-Hautamaa D.A. Schlievert P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but it is more similar to SpeC. Crystallographic studies have led to the elucidation of the crystal structures of SEA (5.Schad E.M. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V.N. Dohlsten M. Kalland T. Schlievert P.M. Ohlendorf D.H. Svensson L.A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and have revealed a common fold shared among the superantigens. Moreover, the crystal structures of TSST-1 and SEB in the presence of a MHC class II molecule and SEC2/SEC3 in complex with a TCR Vβ chain (11.Fields B.A. Malchiodi E.L. Li H. Ysern X. Stauffacher C.V. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) have been reported. From these studies, it is now well established that despite sequence and structural similarity, each superantigen appears to have adopted a different mechanism in forming the MHC·superantigen·TCR tri-molecular complex. The presence of one (SEA, SEC2, SpeA1) or two (SED, SpeC) zinc-binding sites plays a central role in this diversity. The crystal structure of SEC2 has been determined previously in two different space groups: tetragonal P43212 (crystal form I (6.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) and monoclinic P21 (crystal form II (12.Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) at 2.0 and 2.7 Å, respectively. A striking difference between these two SEC2 structures is the presence of a zinc-binding site found in crystal form I but not in crystal form II (we refer to this primary site as Zn I). Here we report a third crystal form (form III) of this toxin grown in the presence of 2.5 mm zinc acetate. The structure revealed the binding of a second zinc atom some 28 Å away from the primary site (we refer to this secondary site as II). It is shown that the presence of zinc ions in the crystallization medium results in conformational changes and the formation of a secondary zinc-binding site close to the normal MHC-binding site of the toxin. In addition, the recent crystal structures of SpeC and SEH in complex MHC class II molecules via their zinc-binding sites have demonstrated that a single zinc ion can act as a high affinity binding site for MHC class II molecules (13.Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J.K. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14.Petersson K. Hakansson M. Nilsson H. Forsberg G. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Walse B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3306-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of a secondary zinc site may have implications for the binding of the MHC class II molecules, suggesting different mechanisms of T cell activation under variable zinc concentrations, which might be linked to the function of SEC2. Moreover, it could guide the efforts to control the effects of enterotoxins on the immune system by controlling the zinc concentrations. T cell Stimulation—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from healthy donors and isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The buoyant layer was removed, and following several washes in phosphate-buffered saline to remove platelets, purified resting T cells were isolated as described previously (15.Sansom D.M. Wilson A. Boshell M. Lewis J. Hall N.D. Immunology. 1993; 80: 242-247PubMed Google Scholar). T cells were stimulated by the addition of HLA·DR4·CD80 transfectants the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml SEC. Assays were carried out at a range of concentrations of ZnCl2 or MgCl2 as indicated. 1 × 105 T cells were incubated at 37° C with 2.5 × 104 CHO transfectants in complete medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin) in 200-μl final volumes in 96-well plates. After 72 h, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added overnight, and proliferation was assessed by liquid scintillation counting (Packard Top-count). All stimulations were performed in triplicate. The data presented are the mean values from a representative experiment. Standard errors of triplicate samples are shown. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test. The experiment shown is representative of four others performed. Transfectants—CHO cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding human HLADR4 *0401β and HLADRα chains under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. These transfectants also expressed the human CD80 molecule to provide co-stimulation for T cell proliferation. Cells were grown and selected as described previously (15.Sansom D.M. Wilson A. Boshell M. Lewis J. Hall N.D. Immunology. 1993; 80: 242-247PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants (1 × 106 cells/ml) were fixed prior to use by treating with 0.025% glutaraldehyde for 2 min and then washed three times in complete medium. Parental CHO cells not expressing HLA-DR molecules were used as a controls and did not stimulate proliferative responses. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—SEC2 was purified by the method of dye affinity chromatography as described previously by Passalacqua et al. (16.Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Acharya K.R. Tranter H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and lyophilized. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. The lyophilized protein was dissolved in MilliQ water to a concentration of ≈10 mg/ml. Four microliters of a reservoir solution containing 17-20% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1-10 mm zinc acetate, and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) were mixed with an equal volume of the protein stock solution on siliconized coverslips. The best crystals, grown from 18% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 2.5 mm zinc acetate, were used for data collection. Although lower concentrations of zinc (as low as 0.1 mm) can also produce crystals, these crystals were very small and thin and were not suitable for x-ray analysis. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions a = 42.54 Å, b = 44.69 Å, c = 131.42 Å and one SEC2 molecule/crystallographic asymmetric unit. Approximately 40% of the crystal volume is occupied by solvent (Matthews coefficient, Vm = 2.1 Å3/D). X-ray diffraction data were collected on station PX 9.5 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK, and BW7B in EMBL (c/o DESY, Hamburg). Three data sets were collected at different times. The oscillation range was 1.5° and the exposure times were 20 s (Hamburg) and 60 s (Daresbury). The data were processed, scaled, and merged using the HKL package (17.Otwinowski Z. DENZO: An Oscillation Data Processing Programme for Macromolecular Crystallography. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar, 18.Otwinowski Z.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The previously determined SEC2 structure (space group P43212; Papageorgiou et al. (6.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) at 2.0 Å resolution was used as a search model. The cross-rotation search gave an unambiguous solution (correlation coefficient 29.5, 14σ above the mean), which still remained at the top of the solution list after the translation search. Examination of the solution after rigid body refinement in AMoRe showed no crystal-packing clashes. Initially refinement was carried out with the 2.4 Å data set with an initial Rcryst and Rfree (5% of the reflections set aside (20.Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar)) of 32.8 and 33.9%, respectively. When the Rcryst and Rfree dropped to 22.1 and 28.5%, respectively, a new data set to 2.0 Å resolution was collected. Extension to 2.0 Å was accomplished in 0.1 Å steps using the simulated annealing protocol in X-PLOR (version 3.851 (21.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: Version 3.1. A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar)). Reflections flagged for Rfree calculations in the 2.4 Å data set were carried over to the new data set. SigmaA-weighted 2 Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps were generated with the CCP4 suite of programs and examined manually using the program O (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 109-110Google Scholar). Water molecules within hydrogen bonding distances from suitable protein atoms were identified manually, and their positions were checked with the aid of 2 Fo - Fc maps (at 1σ) and Fo - Fc maps (at 3σ). Water molecules with temperature factors higher than 50 Å2 after one round of refinement were excluded from subsequent refinement. Refinement was concluded using the program CNS (crystallography NMR software), version 1.1 (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) with iterative cycles of minimization, individual B-factor refinement, and simulated annealing followed by calculation of 2 Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps. Quality of the Structure—The final model, comprising 1851 protein atoms, 77 water molecules, and two zinc ions, has a crystallographic R-factor (Rcryst) of 19.82% and an Rfree of 22.54%. The r.m.s. deviation in bond lengths and bond angles is 0.006 Å and 1.18°, respectively. Examination of the Ramachandran plot with PROCHECK (24.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed 90.6% of non-glycine and non-proline residues to be in the most favored regions and none in the disallowed regions. Details of data processing and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The mean coordinate errors derived from a plot of sigmaA versus (sinθ/λ)2 is 0.22 Å. Residues 98-106 from the disulfide loop have been assigned an occupancy of 0 due to high mobility. The unique feature of the SEC2 structure presented here is the presence of two zinc-binding sites. The primary zinc-binding site was reported previously as a strong feature of the difference electron map at 9σ level. The secondary zinc-binding site (reported here) is some 28 Å away from the primary site. Both zinc ions are characterized by low temperature factors (13.9 and 20.68 Å2) with the former one having similar temperature factor as that reported in crystal form I (6.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Description of the Structure—The structure of SEC2 is similar to that of other superantigens of staphylococcal or streptococcal origin (25.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1997; 5: 991-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 369-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, it consists of two domains, an N-terminal and a C-terminal one (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain comprises a β-barrel known as the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold (OB fold). At the top of the barrel, a disulfide bridge is formed by residues Cys-93 and Cys-110 between strands β4 and β5. The loop linking the disulfide bridge is highly flexible, a characteristic feature common among all the staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens with the exception of TSST-1 and SpeC. This loop cannot be defined with a definite single conformation, and it is most likely able to adopt different conformations. The C-terminal domain has an altered β-grasp motif (a β-sheet packed against an α-helix) structure. In superantigens, this helix is a long central helix (α5) packed diagonally across the molecule. Strands β6, β10, and β12 are parallel to each other and antiparallel to β7 and β9. The N-terminal tail consists of two 310 helices (αN1 and αN2) located on top of the C-terminal domain, and thus it is considered part of this domain. Comparison with Other SEC2 Structures—Superposition of the three crystal forms of SEC2 shows an r.m.s. deviation in Cα atoms of 0.21 and 0.73 for form I-form III and form II-form III, respectively (Table II and Fig. 2A). Residues from the highly flexible disulfide loop were excluded from the calculations because their position is ambiguous. Regions that deviate most include the residues at the N- and C-termini, residues 17-21, 54-58, residues flanking the flexible disulfide loop, and residues 122-130.Table IIComparison of the three crystal forms of SEC2Space groupOrthorhombicTetragonalMonoclinicP212121P43212P21Cell dimensions (Å)42.54 × 44.69 × 131.4243.05 × 43.05 × 290.0043.43 × 69.92 × 42.42β = 90.10°Molecules/asymmetric unit111Resolution (Å)2.02.02.7r.m.s.d.aResidues 96—107 were excluded from the calculationsCα0.210.73Main chain0.220.81All atoms0.551.79No. of water molecules7771No. of zinc ions210a Residues 96—107 were excluded from the calculations Open table in a new tab Zn I Site—This zinc-binding site, site Zn I, is analogous to that found in crystal form I (6.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which is located in a solvent exposed region of the protein at the stretch connecting the N- and C-terminal domains at the bottom of the molecule. In both SEC2 structures the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to His-118, His-122, Asp-83 from one molecule and Asp-9 (from a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal lattice). The temperature factor for the zinc ion is 13.90 Å2. No zinc site was found in crystal form II, probably because of the removal of the zinc ion after extensive dialysis before crystallization (12.Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms in this region ranges from 0.33 to 0.62. When compared with the zinc free SEC2 structure, the side-chain atoms of crystal form I Asp-9, Asp-83, His-118, and His-122 have an r.m.s deviation of 0.9-5.6, 0.38-2.1, 0.43-1.0, and 0.56-0.58 Å2, respectively. Zn II Site—The secondary zinc-binding site in SEC2 (Fig. 1B) was found after co-crystallization of SEC2 with 2.5 mm zinc acetate. This site involves two ligands from one molecule (His-47 and Glu-71) and another two from a symmetry-related molecule (Glu-119, Glu-80). For this site to be created, His-47 had to adopt a different conformation by a swing of about 90° from its original position (Fig. 1C). Moreover, Glu-71 had to move ∼2.6 Å away from its original position to accommodate the zinc ion. Glu-119 and Glu-80 both move toward the zinc ion (about 3.1 and 2.0 Å shift from their original position, respectively) to form a ligand for the zinc ion. Structure-based alignment of SEC2 with SEB shows the presence of a phenylalanine residue, Phe-47 (SEB), in a structurally equivalent to that of His-47 (SEC2). This indicates that SEB would be unlikely to form a similar zinc-binding site. No other major conformational changes in the region are observed. The B-factor for the zinc ion is 20.68 Å2, indicating a well ordered metal ion. T cell Activation—T cell activation assays were carried out to establish the effect of zinc on the T cell stimulatory capacity of SEC2. T cell proliferation assays were therefore carried out either in the presence of a range of zinc or magnesium ion concentrations. The results from these experiments (Fig. 3A) demonstrated a complex pattern of T cell response. Firstly, it was clear that SEC2 stimulation of T cells did not absolutely require zinc and that T cells were stimulated by the toxin in its absence. Secondly, at zinc concentrations between 10-100 nm we routinely observed a small but reproducible decrease in responses, however, in the presence of higher concentrations of zinc (up to 100 μm) T cell responses were enhanced ∼1.5-fold on average compared with controls. Most striking, however, was the abolition of cell responses in the presence of high levels of zinc. It was notable that at all parallel doses of magnesium, no effect on T cell responses was observed (Fig. 3B). These T cell responses were clearly MHC class II-dependent, as control CHO transfectants did not stimulate significant T cell responses (data not shown). Overall, these data demonstrate that the effect of zinc on T cell responses to SEC2 was concentration-dependent, and at high doses, highly significant inhibition was observed. Biological Implications—Multiple zinc-binding sites in superantigens have been identified previously (9.Sundstrom M. Abrahmsen L. Antonsson P. Mehindate K. Mourad W. Dohlsten M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13.Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J.K. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A.

Med. 1997; 186: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the case of SpeC, one zinc site is involved in dimerization of the toxin, the other in binding MHC class II molecules. As such, several possible mechanisms for the interaction of this toxin with MHC II and TCR have been proposed (Fig. 2B). The role of the Zn I site in SEC2 has been discussed previously (6.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this site could be used for the binding of a second MHC class II molecule, away from the normal SEB-like MHC-binding site. Binding could take place at both the generic and Zn I sites or exclusively in only one site depending on the conditions. In support of this argument, MHC class II molecules have previously been shown to bind superantigen zinc sites via His-81 from the β-chain of the MHC molecule (13.Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J.K. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14.Petersson K. Hakansson M. Nilsson H. Forsberg G. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Walse B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3306-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The presentation of some superantigens to T cell receptors is enhanced by the binding of specific peptides (28.Wen R. Cole G.A. Surman S. Blackman M.A. Woodland D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As the SEB·DR1 crystal structure revealed no contacts between the superantigen and the antigen peptide (in contrast to the TSST-1·DR1 complex), a second MHC-binding site could provide the necessary contacts for the peptide. Interestingly the zinc mediated SpeC·HLA-DR2 (13.Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J.K. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and SEH·HLA-DR1 complexes (14.Petersson K. Hakansson M. Nilsson H. Forsberg G. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Walse B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3306-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) show extensive contact (approximately one-third of the contact surface area) between the toxin and the MHC class II-associated antigenic peptide. It has also been suggested that this site may have a structural role, i.e. by providing stability in this region. Nevertheless, the crystal structure of SEC2 without zinc (12.Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) revealed no major conformational changes in this region. A comparison with the corresponding region in SEB (which does not bind zinc) shows B-factors similar to the average B-factor for the protein (7.Papageorgiou A.C. Tranter H.S. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and no major conformational change compared with SEC2. Other possibilities for the role of the Zn I site could also be considered, for example the cross-linking of two SEC2 molecules. This possibility was not discussed previously because of the lack of the TCR·SEC2/SEC3 structures at that time (6.Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on the arrangement of the two symmetry-related SEC2 molecules, binding of a TCR molecule to each of them shows no clashes between the two TCR molecules (Fig. 2C). Moreover, binding of an MHC-class II molecule could also be accommodated to each of the SEC2 molecule. Thus, the cross-linking of two SEC2 molecules leads to the formation of two TCR·SEC2·MHC complexes. However direct experimental data to support this model have yet to be obtained. An SEC2-like zinc-binding site has been found in SEA (29.Schad E.M. Papageorgiou A.C. Svensson L.A. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and SED (9.Sundstrom M. Abrahmsen L. Antonsson P. Mehindate K. Mourad W. Dohlsten M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These two superantigens, however, possess a primary zinc-binding site at their respective C-terminal domains. Biochemical evidence suggests that its role is either to participate in an MHC-class II molecule binding (SEA) or to create homodimers (SED). The role of the SEC2-like zinc-binding site in SEA and SED is still unknown, but some suggestions have been put forward (29.Schad E.M. Papageorgiou A.C. Svensson L.A. Acharya K.R. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2029242514,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents in a variety of human diseases; for example over 99% of cervical carcinomas contain HPV DNA sequences. Often in cervical carcinoma the HPV genome is integrated into the host genome resulting in unregulated expression of the viral transforming proteins E6 and E7. Therefore viral integration is a step toward HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Integration of the HPV genome could occur following double-strand DNA breaks that could arise during viral DNA replication. We investigated the fidelity of HPV 16 E1- and E2-mediated DNA replication of non-damaged and UVC-damaged templates in a variety of cell lines with different genetic backgrounds; C33a (derived from an HPV-negative cervical carcinoma), XP30RO (deficient in the by-pass polymerase η (polη)), XP30η (expressing a restored wild-type polη), XP12RO (nucleotide excision repair defective), and MRC5 (derived from a 14-week-old human fetus). The results demonstrate that the fidelity of E1- and E2-mediated DNA replication is reflective of the genetic background in which the assays are carried out. For example, restoring polη to the XP30 cell line results in a 3-fold drop in the number of mutants obtained following replication of a UVC-damaged template. A relatively high percentage of the mutant-replicated molecules arise as a result of genetic rearrangement. This is the first time such studies have been carried out with an HPV replication system, and the results are discussed in the context of the HPV life cycle and what is known about HPV genomes in human cancers.

Over 99% of cervical carcinomas contain HPV sequences; these are of the high-risk type with HPV16 being the most common. The low risk HPVs are causative agents of genital warts, and HPV6/11 are the most commonly found in this disease (1zur Hausen H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3046) Google Scholar). HPVs are maintained as episomal circular DNA molecules in infected cells and are replicated by the viral proteins E1 and E2 (2LaPorta R.F. Taichman L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3393-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Del Vecchio A.M. Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. Baker C.C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5949-5958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E2 protein forms homodimers and recognizes and binds to 12bp palindromic DNA sequences in the transcriptional control region of HPV (4Ham J. Dostatni N. Gauthier J.M. Yaniv M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). E2 can then regulate transcription from the adjacent promoter that controls the expression of the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7; E2 can either activate or repress transcription depending upon E2 protein levels and the cell type (5Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Vance K.W. Campo M.S. Morgan I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27839-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As well as regulating transcription E2 is also essential for replication of the viral genome; there are three E2 DNA binding sequences surrounding the viral origin (ori) of replication and a physical interaction between E2 and E1 results in recruitment of E1 to the ori sequence (7Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8Berg M. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F.

Following recruitment by E2 the E1 protein interacts with the ori DNA sequence and then forms a hexameric complex required for replication of the viral genome by virtue of its helicase activity (10Sedman J. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E1 is known to interact with subunits of DNA polymerase-α and with components of the Swi/Snf complex in order to activate DNA replication (11Masterson P.J. Stanley M.A. Lewis A.P. Romanos M.A. J.

In many HPV-induced cervical cancers the HPV genome is found integrated into the host genome. This integration usually deletes the coding sequence for the E2 protein and results in elevated expression of the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 (13Jeon S. Lambert P.F. J. Virol. 1995; 92: 1654-1658Google Scholar). It is proposed that increased E6 and E7 levels are involved in progression toward carcinoma. Therefore the loss of episomal status of the HPV genome is an important step on the way to carcinogenesis. The integration is a result of non-homologous recombination and we set out to investigate HPV16 E1/E2-mediated DNA replication to determine if this would provide potential mechanisms that would explain HPV genome integration. Previous studies on the quality of SV40 large T-mediated DNA replication have demonstrated that large T replicates DNA with background mutation frequencies ranging from 1% down to 0.04% depending upon the cell system and the plasmid to be replicated, and the reporter gene used to measure the mutation frequency (14Bourre F. Renault G. Gentil A. Mutat. Res. 1989; 220: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 15MacGregor G.R. James M.R. Arlett C.F. Burke J.F. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, replication by the EBV protein EBNA1 has much lower mutation frequencies that are more reflective of those observed for mammalian cell replication (16James M.R. Stary A. Daya-Grosjean L. Drougard C. Sarasin A. Mutat. Res. 1989; 202: 169-185Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The major difference between the large T and EBNA1 replication is that the latter initiates replication only once per cell cycle as the replication is under the control of the host origin recognition complex (ORC) (17Chaudhuri B. Xu H. Todorov I. Dutta A. Yates J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10085-10089Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), while large T initiates replication more than once per cell cycle (18Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It is known that HPV E1/E2-mediated replication initiation can also occur more than once per cell cycle (19Piirsoo M. Ustav E. Mandel T. Stenlund A. Ustav M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), however the fidelity of E1/E2-mediated replication is unknown. In many HPV lesions there are episomal genomes that either contain multiple insertions/deletions (20Kasher M.S. Roman A. Virology. 1988; 165: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or single deletions (21Deau M.C. Favre M. Orth G. Virology. 1991; 184: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Hall W.S. Goto-Mandeville R. Shih H.A. Shank P.R. Braun L.

Cancer. 2002; 102: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for these rearrangements could also lead to chromosomal integration of viral sequences resulting in progression to cancer. Insertion of HPV genomes into the host genome most likely occurs following the generation of linear HPV genomes, followed by non-homologous recombination. Double-strand DNA breaks in HPV genomes could be generated during replication, particularly if the DNA is damaged resulting in the collapse of replication forks. Therefore we set out to investigate the ability of E1/E2 to replicate both non-damaged and UVC-damaged templates in a variety of genetic backgrounds to provide insights into the mechanisms that contribute to the insertion of the HPV genome into that of the host. The results demonstrate that E1/E2 replicate DNA with fidelity similar to large T and that the mutation frequency is reflective of the genetic background of the cell. These results raise the possibility that aberrant E1/E2-mediated DNA replication might provide substrates for insertion of the viral genome into the host genome. Cell Culture—MRC5 cells immortalized with SV40 were obtained from Cancer Research UK. XP30RO(sv) (XPV) cells, and their complementation to make XP30RO-pcDNA3.1-polη cells, has been described (25Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H.F. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). XP12ROSV40 (XP-A) cells have been previously described (25Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H.F. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The designations of the cell lines are abbreviated to MRC5, XP30, XP30η, and XP12, respectively in this article. MRC5, XP30, and XP12 cells are SV40-transformed skin fibroblasts. C33a is an HPV-negative cervical carcinoma cell line. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) in 10% fetal calf serum and were routinely passaged every 3–4 days. The XP30η cells were also maintained in 100 μg/ml of Zeocin (Invitrogen) to maintain selective pressure for the DNA encoding the wild-type DNA polymerase η. Plasmid Construction—pOri16Lac was created by PCR amplification of the HPV16 Ori PCR from the pOri16 M plasmid (26Boner W. Taylor E.R. Tsirimonaki E. Yamane K. Campo M.S. Morgan I.M. ).J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22297-22303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and this was inserted into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) as a BglII fragment. The HPV16 E1 and E2 expression plasmids (pCMV-E1 and pCMV-E2) have been described previously (27Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Damage—pOri16Lac DNA was diluted to 50 ng/μl and placed on a plastic Petri dish. The DNA was then either mock-irradiated or irradiated with 1600 J/m2 of UVC at 254 nm using a Spectrolinker XL1500 (Spectronics Corporation). Transient DNA Replication Assay—C33a cells were plated out at 6 × 105 in 100-mm dishes, MRC5, XP30, XP30η, and XP12 cells were all plated out at 3 × 105 in 100-mm dishes. The next day plasmid DNA was transfected using the calcium phosphate method, each transfection was done in duplicate. Three days post-transfection low molecular weight DNA was extracted using the Hirt method. Briefly cells were lysed in 800 μl of Hirt solution (0.6% SDS, 10 mm EDTA) and scraped into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. 200 μlof5 m NaCl was added, and the samples were then left at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, 30 min at 4 °C, they were extracted once with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. Following centrifugation the DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and the DNA from each pair of duplicate transfections was pooled and resuspended in a total of 100 μl of water. Southern Blot—42 μl of sample were digested with DpnI and XmnI overnight to reveal linear-replicated pOri16Lac at 4.2 kb. Digested samples were separated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Southern blotting. Blots were probed using either a 700-bp HPV16 ori-containing fragment released from pOri16M by PvuII restriction digest or the 200-bp HPV16 ori released from pOri16Lac by BglII digestion. The fragments were then radiolabeled with32P using the Stratagene prime-it II kit. Blots from XP30 and XP30η cells were probed using the specific 200-bp probe, the larger probe detects the chromosomal integrated plasmid sequences present in XP30η cells (the plasmid encodes the polymerase η (polη) gene). C33a, MRC5, and XP12 blots were probed using the 700-bp probe as this provides a greater signal. Blots were hybridized using Quikhyb solution (Stratagene). Blots were washed to 0.1× SSC and developed using a Storm 840 Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Mutagenesis Analysis—42 μl of sample were digested overnight with DpnI to remove unreplicated pOri16Lac, the sample was then extracted once with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with ethanol, and washed with 70% ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in 3 μl of water and electroporated into DH10B bacteria (Invitrogen), and plated onto kanamycin LB agar containing 100 μg/ml X-gal (Sigma). The α-complementation between the LacZ gene on pOri16Lac and the deleted LacZ in DH10B means that DH10B carrying pOri16Lac with a wild-type LacZ are blue, and those pOri16Lac with mutations in LacZ are light blue/white. Selected colonies were picked and grown overnight and re-streaked on the same medium to confirm the phenotype. Plasmid DNA was prepared using small-scale alkali lysis miniprep system (Qiagen), and samples eluted in 50 μl. 5 μl of DNA was digested with BamHI, then subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to highlight plasmid rearrangements. DNA Sequencing—To ensure that the white colonies selected were truly mutant ∼5 μl (500 ng) of DNA was used to sequence the LacZ promoter and coding sequence using the Big Dye terminator kit on ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Low Fidelity DNA Replication by E1 and E2 in the Cervical Carcinoma Cell Line C33a—To measure the fidelity of DNA replication the HPV origin of replication from pOri16 M was inserted into the BglII site of pCR2.1 to form the vector pOri16Lac (Fig. 1a). The intact LacZα gene was used in subsequent experiments to measure the quality of the DNA replication; when replicated DNA is rescued into DH10B Escherichia coli those replicated pOri16Lac molecules that have mutations in their LacZα gene result in light blue or white bacterial colonies. HPV replication assays are routinely carried out in the cervical carcinoma cell line C33a as this line has no HPV sequences and therefore no endogenous viral proteins that can interfere with the function of HPV E1 and E2 proteins. In these transient DNA replication assays the plasmid to be replicated, in this case pOri16Lac, is co-transfected with plasmids that express the E1 and E2 proteins. The E1 and E2 proteins then bind to the viral origin of replication in pOri16Lac and induce DNA replication of the plasmid. We carried out a replication assay in C33a cells, and the results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1b. The upper band represents the replicated molecules, and it is clear that replication only occurs in the presence of E1 and E2. The lower bands on the blot represent the input plasmids as the probe used in this blot will also recognize the E1, E2, and pCMV plasmids as well as the origin containing plasmid. In lane 2 the larger of the lower bands represents the E1 expression vector (5 μg are used in these experiments), and this is not detected in lane 1 as no E1 expression vector is present in the cells. To measure the fidelity of replication parallel experiments were carried out and the replicated molecules electroporated into DH10B and scored for the number of blue and white colonies. This experiment was carried out three times, and the cumulative results are shown in Table I. The mutation frequency detected was rather high, being 4.10 × 10-3. We wanted to determine what types of mutations were present in the mutant plasmids and to do this we prepared plasmid DNA from the transformed bacteria and digested them with BamHI. This would be predicted to generate bands of 2.9 and 1.2 kb; however, as shown in Fig. 2, this is not what was seen in most cases. There were clearly rearrangements responsible for the majority of the mutants; even those that appeared wild type showed substantial deletions or insertions upon sequencing (see below). These rearranged plasmids must have been caused by recombination. We next wanted to investigate the reason for the high mutation frequency observed with E1- and E2-mediated DNA replication in C33a cells. This could be because E1 and E2 are poor at replicating DNA, or perhaps because the mutation frequency is reflective of the cell line in which the assays were carried out. Indeed, C33a cells are a carcinoma cell line and previous work has demonstrated that this cell line has a replication error phenotype associated with microsatellite instability (28Larson A.A. Kern S. Sommers R.L. Yokota J. Cavenee W.K. Hampton G.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1426-1431PubMed Google Scholar). This could clearly affect the quality of replication mediated by E1 and E2. Therefore we set out to establish whether E1- and E2-mediated DNA replication is reflective of the genetic background in which the replication takes place or whether the replication by these HPV proteins is always of such poor quality.Table IMutation frequency of pOri16Lac by E1/E2-mediated replication in c33a cellsCell typeC33aTotal9477White39MF (×10-5)aMF, mutation frequency (calculated by white/total)412RearrangedbAs scored by BamHI digestion25Rearranged MF (×10-5)cCalculated by rearranged/total263a MF, mutation frequency (calculated by white/total)b As scored by BamHI digestionc Calculated by rearranged/total Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Mutant pOri16Lac plasmids are commonly rearranged. 5 μl of miniprep DNA from replicated plasmids rescued into E. coli were BamHI-digested and resolved on an agarose gel.

This is due to a defect either in nucleotide excision repair (XPA-G) or, in socalled XP variants (XP-V), in polη (29Berneburg M. Lehmann A.R. Adv. Genet. 2001; 43: 71-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polη is a member of the Y-family of polymerases that are involved in trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) across DNA damage. Polη can replicate across cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), in general inserting the “correct” nucleotides opposite the damaged bases (30Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In XP-V cells lacking polη there is an increased UV-induced mutation frequency in the cells following UV irradiation (31Maher V.M. Ouellette L.M. Curren R.D. McCormick J.J. Nature. 1976; 261: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), as an alternative, a less accurate mechanism has to be used by the cell to deal with replication past CPDs. Cell lines have been established from several XP patients by immortalizing primary fibroblasts using SV40 infection. XPV cell lines, and those expressing restored polη, have been used in SV40 replication assays to confirm that polη is indeed involved in the efficient replication of UV-irradiated SV40-based plasmid DNA (32Stary A. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. Sarasin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18767-18775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We set out to establish whether this was also the case for E1/E2-mediated DNA replication and therefore we measured the fidelity of replication of both undamaged and UVC-damaged DNA in a variety of genetic backgrounds. We treated pOri16Lac with UVC irradiation using a Stratagene cross-linker. To ensure that the UVC-irradiated DNA to be transfected contains multiple DNA lesions we tested UVC-irradiated DNA in vitro for its sensitivity to T4 endonuclease V, an enzyme that nicks at CPD sites (see Fig. 3a). These nicks would not be detectable on neutral agarose gels. However at high UV doses, there will be sufficient closely spaced damage on opposite strands to generate double strand breaks on treatment with T4 endoV, which would be detected as increased mobility on neutral gels. We found that doses greater than 400 Jm-2 result in loss of the intact 4.2-kb band, indicating that, above this doses, all plasmid molecules contained many UV lesions. We used 1600 J/m2 UVC in all experiments described below To ensure that the damaged pOri16Lac transfected into the cells was not completely repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) prior to replication, undamaged, and damaged pOri16Lac DNA was harvested by Hirt extraction 3 days post-transfection. The experiment shown in Fig. 3b was carried out in C33a cells as these were initially used in the DNA replication studies as described in Fig. 1b. The DNA was linearized and digested with T4 endonuclease V as described in Fig. 3a, and demonstrates that >90% of the transfected UVC-irradiated DNA still contained multiple CPD lesions 3 days post-transfection (see Fig. 3b). Measuring the Amount and Fidelity of E1- and E2-mediated DNA Replication in a Variety of Genetic Backgrounds—E1- and E2-mediated DNA replication assays were carried out with both non-damaged and UVC-damaged pOri16Lac in C33a cells, XPV cells (XP30), XPV cells with restored polη (XP30η). As a control they were also carried out in MRC5 fibroblasts that have no defined genetic lesion and also with the nucleotide excision repair-defective cell line XP12 (from the XP-A group). In XP12 cells any damage on the template to be replicated will not be repaired prior to entry into S phase. These assays were carried out at least three times and Southern blots carried out to measure the amount of replication in each cell line with the UVC-damaged and non-damaged templates. A representative example of the Southern blots for each cell line is shown in Fig. 4. As with Fig. 1b the upper band represents the replicated molecules and in all cases it is clear that replication only occurs in the presence of E1 and E2. In the MRC5, XP12, and C33a cells the probe used recognizes the origin containing plasmid and the input plasmids and therefore the lower bands represent the E1, E2, pCMV, and pOri16Lac plasmids. The largest of the input bands represents the E1-expressing plasmid, and this acts as an internal control to demonstrate that in both the damaged and non-damaged assays an equivalent amount of DNA was transfected and harvested from the cells. Of note is that in the MRC5 experiment there is less input plasmid detected, probably due to poorer transfection efficiency. However, clear replication can still be detected. Optimum levels of E2 for maximum DNA replication were used in all cell types (see Ref. 26Boner W. Taylor E.R. Tsirimonaki E. Yamane K. Campo M.S. Morgan I.M. ).J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22297-22303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and therefore the results suggest that E1- and E2-mediated DNA replication is more efficient in MRC5 cells. An alternative probe was used in the XP30 and the XP30η blots as the probe used with the other cell lines recognizes the plasmid-expressing polη in XP30η making interpretation impossible. Therefore a probe that exclusively recognizes the HPV16 origin in pOri16Lac was used, and as a result the input bands are much fainter as this probe only recognizes the input pOri16Lac. The same probe was used in the XP30 and XP30η to allow direct comparison between the two cell lines. See “Materials and Methods” for a precise description of the two probes. In both MRC5 and C33a there was no apparent reduction in the amount of replication that is detected with the damaged template compared with the non-damaged. However, in all XP cell lines there was a clear reduction in replication of the damaged template. This may be expected in the XP30 and XP12 cells due to their genetic defects that hinder the response to DNA damage. However, restoration of polη, as demonstrated by XP30η, does not significantly enhance the ability of this cell line to replicate damaged DNA. It was important to monitor the quality of the replication occurring and this was done by rescuing the replicated templates into bacteria and counting the number of white colonies. This was done at least three times, and the total number for each cell line is shown in Table II. Several facts become apparent when studying this table. First, statistically all of the cell lines have insignificant differences in their background mutation frequency, apart from C33a cells where the number of mutants is significantly higher (p < 0.001). Second, damaging the template to be replicated with UVC significantly increased the numbers of mutants rescued in all cell types (p < 0.001). Third, restoration of polη to XP30 cells reduced the number of mutations observed around 3-fold demonstrating once more the role of this polymerase in the replication of UV-damaged DNA (p < 0.001). Fourth, upon restoration of polη the mutation frequency observed is no different from the MRC5 cell line. Fifth, the number of mutations observed in MRC5 upon replication of the damaged template is significantly lower than that observed in XP30, XP12, and C33a cells (p < 0.001). Sixth, damaging the template to be replicated with UVC significantly increased the numbers of re-arrangement mutants rescued in all cell types (p < 0.001). Seventh, the number of rearranged recombinant plasmids detected following replication of the UVC-damaged template are significantly increased in XP30, XP12, and C33a cells when compared with MRC5 (p < 0.001). Finally, the large increase in mutations observed in the XP12 cells following replication of the UVC-damaged template suggests that most of the damage on the template that will result in mutation is repaired using NER prior to replication of the template in S phase.Table IIMutation frequency of pOril16Lac by E1/E2-mediated replication in a variety of DNA repair/replication deficient cellsCell typeMRC5XP30XP20ηXP12C33apOri16LacNo1600No1600No1600No1600No1600TreatmentaUVC irradiation prior to transfectionUVCJ/m2 UVCUVCJ/m2 UVCUVCJ/m2 UVCUVCJ/m2 UVCUVCJ/m2 UVCTotal106344104833015026565226210971115794772850White105054652038339104MF (×10-5)bMF, mutation frequency (calculated by white/total)941218603062768842771744123649RearrangedcAs scored by BamHI digestion414511392142527Rearranged383416073245398181210263947MF (×10-5)dCalculated by rearranged/totala UVC irradiation prior to transfectionb MF, mutation frequency (calculated by white/total)c As scored by BamHI digestiond Calculated by rearranged/total Open table in a new tab Summarizing the Replication of the Damaged and Non-damaged Templates—To assist in the analysis of all of the results shown in Fig. 4 and tabulated in Table II we represented them graphically as shown in Fig. 5.

Loss of p53 or p19ARF was previously shown to be required for Abelson murine leukemia virus transformation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). By comparing gene expression patterns in primary p53-/- MEFs acutely infected with the v-Abl retrovirus, v-Abl-transformed MEF clones, and v-Abl-transformed MEF clones treated with Abl kinase inhibitor STI 571, we have identified additional genetic alterations associated with v-Abl transformation. Bcl-xL mRNA was elevated in three of five v-Abl-transformed MEF clones. In addition, elevated expression of c-Myc mRNA, caused either by c-myc gene amplification or by enhanced signaling via STAT3, was observed in five v-Abl-transformed MEF clones. The data suggest that increases in cell survival associated with Bcl-xL and increases in cell growth associated with c-Myc facilitate the transformation process dependent on constitutive mitogenic signaling by v-Abl.

Virus Res. 1988; 35: 39-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). v-Abl provides an excellent system for dissecting the individual molecular events required for malignant transformation. v-Abl constitutively activates multiple signaling pathways, including the Ras, Rac, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and STAT pathways, all of which contribute to its transforming potential (3Zou X.

Virol. 1987; 61: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) implies that despite being a potent oncogene, v-Abl by itself is not sufficient to cause transformation. Additional genetic alterations are believed to be necessary for v-Abl-mediated transformation (6Green P.L. Kaehler D.A. Bennett L.M. Risser R. J.

Abelson murine leukemia virus signal transducers and activators of transcription mouse embryonic fibroblast RNase protection assay 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. Previous studies have shown that loss of p53 facilitates v-Abl-mediated transformation in B cells (7Unnikrishnan I. Radfar A. Jenab-Wolcott J. Rosenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4825-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Zou X. Cong F. Coutts M. Cattoretti G. Goff S.P. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, loss of p53 is essential for v-Abl-mediated transformation, because wild type MEFs undergo growth arrest in response to v-Abl (9Cong F. Zou X. Hinrichs K. Calame K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, only a small proportion of A-MuLV-infected p53-/- MEFs are eventually transformed, suggesting that even in a p53 null background cells that become transformed have undergone additional mutations that allow transformation. Moreover, loss of p53 function in nonpermissive immortal fibroblasts failed to relieve v-Abl toxicity, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism of v-Abl toxicity in these cells (9Cong F. Zou X. Hinrichs K. Calame K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). p53-/- MEFs can be transformed by v-Abl but, unlike primary pre-B cells, do not depend on v-Abl for extended growth in culture. Furthermore, loss of p53 causes genetic instability (10Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T. Tlsty T.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 923-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 11Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which would be predicted to accelerate additional genetic alterations that might enhance v-Abl-dependent transformation. We exploited these characteristics of p53-/- MEFs to create an experimental system for identification of genetic changes associated with v-Abl-dependent transformation. A comparison of p53-/- MEFs transiently infected with v-Abl retrovirus and v-Abl-transformed MEF clones allowed us to distinguish the initial response of MEFs to v-Abl, from transformation-associated changes. In addition, comparing untransformed p53-/- MEFs to v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones treated with the Abl kinase inhibitor STI 571 (13Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Mett H. Meyer T. Muller M. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 100-104PubMed Google Scholar, 14Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3156) Google Scholar) allowed us to identify additional genetic changes that occur during the process of v-Abl transformation. Our studies reveal that mRNA encoding an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-xL, is elevated in a v-Abl kinase-independent manner in three of the five v-Abl-transformed MEF clones that were studied. In addition, overexpression of c-Myc mRNA, either through gene amplification or through enhanced signaling via STAT3, was identified as a secondary event in five of six clones tested. Overexpression of c-Myc provided v-Abl-transformed MEF clones with a growth advantage, which was evident in their decreased doubling times and elevation of telomerase activity. These observations support a role for the c-myc proto-oncogene in stabilizing the malignant phenotype of v-Abl-transformed MEFs. Retroviral Vectors—The Vxy-IRES-puro retroviral vector was a gift from Lou Staudt (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The coding sequence for p160 v-Abl was cloned into the EcoRI site of Vxy-IRES-puro by blunt end ligation, thus creating a bi-cistronic retroviral construct expressing both v-Abl and puromycin resistance. pMIG-ts-v-Abl-IRES-GFP retrovirus expressing a temperature-sensitive v-Abl kinase and green fluorescent protein was a kind gift from Dr. Naomi Rosenberg (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA). Production of Retrovirus from 293T Cells and Infection of MEFs— 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 20 μg of retrovirus construct, 15 μg of ψeco packaging DNA encoding gag and pol genes, and 15 μg of pMDG-VSVG pseudotyped envelope protein following the Nolan lab protocol (www. stanford.edu/group/nolan/protocols/pro_helper_dep.html). Pseudotyped virus was concentrated by centrifugation at 80,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min, and viral pellets were redissolved in 30 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) by gentle agitation at 4 °C for a minimum of 1 h. MEFs were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. On the day of infection, 2 μl of 5 mg/ml polybrene and 50 μl of concentrated virus were added to 2 ml of growth medium in each well, and the plates were spun at 800 × g for 60-90 min at room temperature. The plates were then incubated overnight at 32 °C. The virus-containing medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were transferred to a 37 °C incubator. p53-/- MEFs infected with puro viruses were expanded in medium for 2 days after infection and selected with puromycin at a concentration of 1.4 μg/ml for 3 days. RNA extracts were prepared from puromycin-resistant cells. Cell Culture—MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml of gentamicin sulfate. MEF clones 9, 19, 46, and 12R transformed with wild type v-Abl were generated by infecting p53-/- MEFs with wild type v-Abl virus obtained from a producer line that makes both v-Abl and Moloney helper viruses (9Cong F. Zou X. Hinrichs K. Calame K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MEF clone ts60 was generated by infecting p53-/- MEFs with v-Abl virus expressing temperature-sensitive kinase (15Engelman A. Rosenberg N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4242-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained by transfection of 293T cells as described. Following infection, MEFs were plated in soft agar. Single colonies were picked after 14 days and expanded in liquid culture. Portions of the cells from each clone were frozen, and the remaining cells were passaged continuously for a period of 6 months. v-Abl kinase activity was inhibited by treatment of v-Abl-transformed MEFs with 0.4 μm STI 571 (kind gift from Novartis), after bringing up the drug concentration over a period of 4 days in 0.1 μm increments. Increasing the drug concentration gradually, using this protocol, was found to be effective in completely abolishing v-Abl kinase activity without causing extensive apoptosis of cells or selecting for drug resistant variants (data not shown). To determine the doubling times of untransformed MEFs and of v-Abl-transformed MEF clones, the cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105/well in six-well plates. The viable cells were counted in triplicate wells at 24-h intervals. Ribonuclease Protection Assays (RPA)—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions, and RPAs were performed using c-Myc, p107, and p19ARF probes, as described (9Cong F. Zou X. Hinrichs K. Calame K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Coutts M. Zou X. Calame K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). RPAs for Bcl-2 family members were performed using the mAPO-2 multi-probe template set (Pharmingen). Whole Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blots— Whole cell extracts were prepared as described (9Cong F. Zou X. Hinrichs K. Calame K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-Abl antibodies (sc-131; Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (sc-508; Santa Cruz). The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-Abl antibodies to control for equal loading. Bcl-xL and c-Myc protein levels in whole cell extracts were analyzed using rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-xL antibodies (sc-634; Santa Cruz) and polyclonal antiserum raised to the COOH terminus of c-Myc (17Lin Y. Wong K.K. Calame K. Science. 1997; 276: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), respectively. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) to control for equal loading. For analysis of activated STAT3, MEFs were serum-starved for 36 h, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described (9Cong F. Zou X. Hinrichs K. Calame K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE and transfer, the membranes were probed with polyclonal anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) antibodies (number 9131; Cell Signaling Technology). The membranes were stripped and reprobed with polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibodies (sc-482; Santa Cruz). Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Southern Blot—Southern blots of genomic DNA from untransformed and v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEFs were performed using standard protocols (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.55Google Scholar). The c-Myc probe template consisted of a 1144-bp XmnI fragment from c-Myc cDNA. The actin probe template consisted of a 800-bp HincII fragment from actin cDNA. Telomerase Assay—Whole cell extracts of MEFs were prepared using CHAPS lysis buffer (19Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6550) Google Scholar) and telomerase activity was determined using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, as described (20Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Steady-state mRNA and Protein Levels of Anti-apoptotic Protein Bcl-xL Are Elevated in Three of Five p53-/-MEF Clones Transformed by v-Abl—Decreased apoptosis is often important in transformation (21Lowe S.W.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and Bcl-2 family proteins are critical regulators of apoptosis (24Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 25Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether and how expression of v-Abl affects expression of Bcl-2 family members in our experimental system. Steady-state mRNA levels of Bcl-2 family members were analyzed by RPA in p53-/- MEFs acutely infected with a v-Abl/puroR bicistronic retrovirus or a control puroR retrovirus. Two days post-infection, MEFs were plated in medium containing 1.4 μg/ml of puromycin. Total RNA was isolated after 3 days of puromycin selection and analyzed by RPA. There was no difference in the mRNA levels of Bcl-xL (anti-apoptotic), Bak (pro-apoptotic), or Bax (pro-apoptotic) between p53-/- MEFs transiently infected with either control virus or v-Abl retrovirus (Fig. 1). The levels of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) and Bad (pro-apoptotic) mRNA were too low to be quantified (data not shown). Thus, in MEFs, acute expression of v-Abl does not alter steady-state transcripts of Bcl-2 family genes, Bcl-xL, Bak, and Bax. To determine whether the process of v-Abl transformation selects cells with altered steady-state levels of Bcl-2 family transcripts, a similar RPA was performed on individual p53-/- MEF clones transformed by v-Abl. Clones 1, 9, 19, 46, and 12R were compared with untransformed p53-/- MEFs. v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clone 1 has been described previously (9Cong F. Zou X. Hinrichs K. Calame K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Clones 9, 19, 46, and 12R were freshly isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total RNA from untransformed p53-/- MEFs and from the v-Abl-transformed MEF clones was analyzed for steady-state mRNA levels of Bcl-2 family members by RPA. No significant difference in Bak or Bax mRNA levels was observed in any clones. Bak mRNA levels were 0.7-0.8-fold as compared with untransformed MEFs, and Bax mRNA levels were 1-1.2-fold as compared with untransformed MEFs (data not shown). Bcl-2 and Bad mRNA levels were too low to be quantified. In clones 1 and 12R, Bcl-xL mRNA levels were not significantly different from those of untransformed MEFs (data not shown). However, clones 9, 19, and 46 had a significant increase in Bcl-xL mRNA (2-4-fold; Fig. 2A). A corresponding increase was also observed in Bcl-xL protein (Fig. 2B). To explore the increase in Bcl-xL mRNA further, we determined whether it depended on v-Abl kinase activity by treating clones 9, 19, and 46 with STI571 (Fig. 3A). v-Abl kinase activity was completely abolished following STI 571 treatment in all clones, as determined by v-Abl autophosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the increased Bcl-xL mRNA was not reduced following treatment of clones 9, 19, and 46 with STI 571 (Fig. 3A), establishing that the elevated Bcl-xL mRNA levels are not dependent on v-Abl kinase activity. Thus, in clones 9, 19, and 46, the v-Abl transformation process has selected for MEFs with elevated levels of mRNA encoding the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL.Fig. 3Induction of Bcl-xL mRNA is v-Abl kinase independent in v-Abl-transformed MEF clones 9, 19, and 46.A, equal amounts of total RNA from control (▪) and STI 571-treated () untransformed p53-/- MEFs and v-Abl-transformed MEF clones 9, 19, and 46 were tested for levels of Bcl-xL mRNA in a RPA. The bands were quantified using ImageQuant software and normalized to ribosomal protein L32. The results from three independent experiments are represented as fold change (means ± S.D.) as compared with untransformed p53-/- MEFs. B, whole cell extracts from control (lanes 1, 3, and 5) and STI 571-treated (lanes 2, 4, and 6) MEF clones 9, 19, and 46 were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Abl antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-Abl antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Elevated Levels of c-Myc mRNA and Protein Are Found in Clones of p53-/-MEFs Transformed by v-Abl—Induction of c-Myc mRNA by v-Abl is one of several mitogenic events required for v-Abl-dependent transformation (3Zou X.

Cell. 1992; 70: 901-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). v-Abl induces mRNA for c-myc and a variety of other E2F-dependent genes by initiating a signaling pathway that results in phosphorylation of Rb family proteins and subsequent activation of E2F family proteins (27Zou X. Rudchenko S. Wong K. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We determined how expression of various E2F-dependent genes was affected by acute expression of v-Abl in p53-/- MEFs and in the p53-/- MEF clones transformed by v-Abl. Steady-state mRNA levels of E2F-dependent genes c-myc, p107, and p19ARF were compared by RPA in p53-/- MEFs, in p53-/- MEFs acutely infected with a v-Abl retrovirus, and in v-Abl-transformed MEF clone 1. Steady-state mRNA for p107, c-Myc, and p19ARF were induced 2-3-fold in p53-/- MEFs acutely expressing v-Abl (Fig. 4a, lanes 2, 5, and 8). A similar increase in p107 and p19ARF mRNA was observed in transformed clone 1 (Fig. 4a, lanes 3 and 6). These increases are consistent with previous work showing induction of E2F-dependent genes by v-Abl (16Coutts M. Zou X. Calame K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Zou X. Rudchenko S. Wong K. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, c-Myc mRNA levels in clone 1 were 30-fold higher than in untreated MEFs and 10-fold higher than in MEFs acutely expressing v-Abl (Fig. 4a, lanes 7-9). The c-Myc mRNA levels were explored further. Aliquots of clone 1 frozen prior to extensive growth in culture were unavailable. However, we had samples of other v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones that were frozen immediately after soft agar cloning and also following growth in culture for approximately 6 months (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We performed RPAs for c-Myc, p107, and p19ARF mRNA with total RNA from clones 9, 19, 46, and 12R, comparing freshly isolated clones to those that had been grown in culture for 6 months. Similar to our observations for clone 1, a 2-4-fold increase in p107 and p19ARF mRNA was observed in all freshly isolated clones, and there was no significant change in mRNA levels of p19ARF and p107 in clones 9, 19, 46, and 12R following growth in culture (Fig. 4b and Table I). c-Myc mRNA was induced ∼2-fold in clones 9, 46, and 12R and 4-fold in clone 19 in the early isolates. However, after 6 months in culture, the c-Myc mRNA levels had increased an additional 2-fold in clones 9, 19, and 12R, whereas a 6-fold increase was observed in clone 46 (Fig. 4b and Table I). The increase in c-Myc mRNA levels was also reflected in increased c-Myc protein levels in clones 1, 9, 19, 46, and 12R (Fig. 5). However, the fold increase in c-Myc protein did not correspond precisely with mRNA levels in every case. This may be due to additional mechanisms that regulate c-Myc protein levels.Table IChanges in expression of E2F-dependent genes during cell culture in v-Ab1 transformed MEF clones 9, 19, 46, and 12RClonec-Mycp19ARFp107Clone 9, fresh isolate1.9 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.3Clone 9, 6-month culture3.8 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.4Clone 19, fresh isolate4.4 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.2Clone 19, 6-month culture7.3 ± 0.84.5 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.2Clone 46, fresh isolate2.1 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.4Clone 46, 6-month culture12.6 ± 0.44.3 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.1Clone 12R, fresh isolate2.6 ± 0.042.1 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.2Clone 12R, 6-month culture4.7 ± 0.42.8 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.2Clone 117.6 ± 1.053.1 ± 0.072.6 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Treatment of clones 1, 19, and 12R with STI 571 reduced c-Myc mRNA to levels close to those seen in untransformed p53-/- MEFs (Fig. 6, a, lane 5, and b, lanes 4 and 6). However, treatment of clones 46 and ts60 (a p53-/- MEF clone transformed by a temperature-sensitive form of v-Abl kinase) with STI 571 did not reduce c-Myc mRNA levels to those seen in untransformed p53-/- MEFs (Fig. 6c, lanes 4 and 6), indicating that c-Myc mRNA induction was not completely dependent on v-Abl kinase activity in these clones. Following treatment with STI 571 (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), v-Abl kinase was inactivated in all clones (data not shown). Thus, steady-state mRNA encoding c-Myc is elevated in five of six v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones (clones 1, 12R, 19, 46, and ts60 but not clone 9), when compared with MEFs acutely expressing v-Abl. In clones 12R, 19, and 46, we documented that the increase in c-Myc mRNA occurred during growth in culture. These increases were specific to c-Myc and were not observed for other E2F-dependent genes, p107 and p19ARF. The induction of c-Myc mRNA was dependent on v-Abl in clones 1, 12R, and 19, whereas it was only partially dependent on v-Abl in clones 46 and ts60. c-myc Gene Amplification Explains Elevated mRNA Levels in Four v-Abl-transformed p53-/-MEF Clones—What mechanism might account for the observed elevation in c-Myc mRNA in the v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones following growth in culture? Taking into consideration that elevated mRNA levels were wholly or partially dependent on v-Abl but were not observed in other E2F-dependent genes and thus were unlikely to depend on levels of activated E2F, we considered three possible mechanisms: 1) mutations in the E2F/STAT3 binding site of the c-myc promoter resulting in an elevated response to v-Abl signaling via E2F or STAT3, 2) c-myc gene amplification, or 3) increased responsiveness of the STAT3 pathway to v-Abl. When the E2F/STAT3-binding sites in the c-myc promoters of clones 1, 9, 19, 46, and 12R were sequenced, all of the clones had the wild type sequence (data not shown), ruling out the first model. To address the second possibility, genomic DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting. As shown in Fig. 7a, clone 1 contains ∼30 copies of the c-myc gene. Southern analysis was also performed on clones 9, 19, 46, and 12R, using DNA from both freshly isolated clones and clones grown in culture for 6 months. No c-myc gene amplification was evident in any of the freshly isolated clones. However, clones 12R and 46 acquired c-myc gene amplification (approximately three copies in clone 12R and 32 copies in clone 46) after 6 months in culture (Fig. 7b, lanes 8 and 9). c-myc gene amplification during growth in culture was also observed in v-Abl-transformed clone, ts60. Southern blot analysis of ts60 at various time points during culture indicated that c-myc gene amplification was acquired after 2 months in cell culture (Fig. 7c, lanes 4 and 5). Southern analysis of an additional six freshly isolated v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones did not reveal c-myc gene amplification (Fig. 8), further confirming that c-myc gene amplification was a secondary event. Thus, gene amplification during growth in culture appears to account for elevated c-Myc mRNA levels in clones 1, 12R, 46, and ts60.Fig. 8c-myc gene is not amplified in freshly isolated v-Abl-transformed p53-/-MEF clones 5, 6, 7, 25, 33, and 45. Genomic DNA from untransformed p53-/- MEFs (lane 1) and v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones 5, 6, 7, 25, 33, and 45 (lanes 2-7) was analyzed by Southern blot using c-myc (upper panel) and actin (lower panel) probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enhanced STAT3 Activation Occurs in Two v-Abl-transformed p53-/-MEF Clones—The third model is based on the observation that v-Abl activates c-myc transcription not only by activating E2F family proteins but also by activating STAT3, which binds an adjacent site in the c-myc promoter (28Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). STAT3 activation was analyzed in clones 9, 19, 46, and 12R. Whole cell extracts from serum-starved cells were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies. To control for equal loading, the blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 9, clones 9 and 46 had modest increases in phosphorylated STAT3 relative to untransformed p53-/- MEFs, which likely reflects constitutive activation by v-Abl. However, clone 19 and, to a lesser extent, clone 12R, contained significantly more activated STAT3 than clones 9 and 46. Thus, increased activation of STAT3 is involved in elevated c-Myc mRNA in clones 19 and 12R. Elevated c-Myc Expression Correlates with Increased Growth of v-Abl-transformed MEFs—We wished to determine whether elevated c-Myc mRNA in the v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones was accompanied by known downstream effects of c-Myc. The doubling times of v-Abl-transformed MEF clones were compared with untransformed p53-/- MEFs (Fig. 10a). Clone 1, which contains ∼30 copies of c-myc and has the highest levels of c-Myc mRNA, had a doubling time of 8 h. Clone 19, which displays no gene amplification but a significant increase in phosphorylated STAT3 and an intermediate level of c-Myc mRNA, had a doubling time of 14 h. Clone 9, which exhibits the lowest levels of c-Myc mRNA, had a doubling time of 22 h. Thus, there is a strong correlation between the doubling time of the different clones and their relative c-Myc mRNA levels, suggesting that elevated c-Myc does indeed provide a proliferative advantage. Transcription of telomerase reverse transcriptase, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is induced by c-Myc (29Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Activation of telomerase allows transformed cells to bypass crisis caused by erosion of telomeres (30DePinho R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 31Hackett J.A. Greider C.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 619-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, levels of telomerase in whole cell extracts of untransformed p53-/- MEFs and v-Abl-transformed MEF clone 1 were measured by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay. Telomerase activity was significantly increased in clone 1 compared with untransformed p53-/- MEFs (Fig. 10b, lane 2b). Moreover, treatment of clone 1 with STI 571 caused a reduction of telomerase activity to levels seen in untransformed MEFs, concomitant with the reduction in c-Myc mRNA levels (Fig. 10b, lane 3b). Thus, elevated expression of c-Myc is associated with shorter doubling times and higher telomerase levels. Malignant transformation is understood to be a multi-step process, the components of which include constitutive mitogenic signals, evasion of apoptotic and anti-growth signals, stable telomere maintenance, and, for solid tumors, acquisition of angiogenesis and tissue invasion capabilities (32Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar). Although A-MuLV is an acute transforming virus providing constitutive mitogenic signals (3Zou X. Calame K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18141-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), v-Abl-dependent transformation is also a multi-step process, requiring genetic alterations in addition to expression of the v-Abl oncoprotein. This is suggested by the fact that A-MuLV infects many cell types in vivo but transforms only a limited number of pro-/pre-B cell clones (5Green P.L. Kaehler D.A. Risser R. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Green P.L. Kaehler D.A. Bennett L.M. Risser R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies provided direct evidence for a multi-step process of v-Abl transformation: after being maintained in culture for 3 months, Abelson-transformed lymphoid cells showed improved growth in liquid culture and caused rapid tumor formation in animals (33Whitlock C.A. Ziegler S.F. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This progression to a more malignant phenotype occurred in the absence of any detectable changes in concentration, half-life, phosphorylation, in vitro kinase activity, or subcellular localization of the v-Abl protein, suggesting that cellular changes complemented the activity of v-Abl in producing the fully malignant phenotype (33Whitlock C.A. Ziegler S.F. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Studies from the Rosenberg lab have also shown progressive clonal outgrowth of v-Abl-transformed pro-/pre-B cells in vivo and a crisis period in in vitro culture that is resolved by cell death or the outgrowth of stably transformed clones (7Unnikrishnan I. Radfar A. Jenab-Wolcott J. Rosenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4825-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Radfar A. Unnikrishnan I. Lee H.W. DePinho R.A. Rosenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13194-13199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p53-dependent growth arrest or apoptotic pathways has been identified as one component of v-Abl transformation (7Unnikrishnan I. Radfar A. Jenab-Wolcott J. Rosenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4825-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Zou X. Cong F. Coutts M. Cattoretti G. Goff S.P. Calame K. Mol. Cell.

Additional genetic alterations, although implied by the oligoclonal transformation of p53-/- cells, have not been identified for v-Abl-dependent transformation. Here we present evidence identifying elevated expression of mRNAs encoding the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and the oncoprotein c-Myc as genetic alterations that frequently accompany v-Abl transformation of p53-/- MEFs. We also show that elevated c-Myc levels are accompanied by a growth advantage and increased telomerase activity in v-Abl-transformed clones. Bcl-xL—Bcl-xL mRNA and protein was found to be elevated in three of five v-Abl-transformed p53-/- MEF clones tested. Given the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL (24Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 35Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar) and the fact that elevated Bcl-xL expression has been observed in other murine myeloid and T cell malignancies (36Packham G. White E.L. Eischen C.M. Yang H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Grillot D.A. Zambetti G.P. Nunez G. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suggest that this alteration facilitates transformation. Increased levels of Bcl-xL mRNA could result from a mutation in a regulatory element of the bcl-xL gene itself or from a mutation in a component of regulatory pathways that control either the transcription or the stability of Bcl-xL mRNA. Although previous studies provide evidence for v-Abl-dependent induction of Bcl-xL mRNA in mast cells and pre-B cells (37Chen Q. Turner J. Watson A.J. Dive C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Banerjee A. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4611-4617PubMed Google Scholar), the increase in Bcl-xL mRNA in the MEF clones was independent of v-Abl kinase activity (Fig. 3). This may reflect differences between fibroblasts and hematopoietic lineages. It is consistent with the idea that the mutation(s) causing increased Bcl-xL mRNA may have been present and growth-selected upon v-Abl expression; alternatively the mutation(s) may have occurred and been selected following v-Abl expression. c-Myc—Deregulated expression of c-Myc is well known to be oncogenic in many settings (39Hoffman B. Amanullah A. Shafarenko M. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3414-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 40Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 764-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and a requirement for induction of c-myc transcription has been well established for transformation by both v-Abl and BCR-ABL (26Sawyers C.L. Callahan W. Witte O.N. Cell. 1992; 70: 901-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). v-Abl activates E2F-dependent genes, thus providing mitogenic signals that drive G1/S cell cycle progression in fibroblasts (3Zou X. Calame K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18141-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Coutts M. Zou X. Calame K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Zou X. Rudchenko S. Wong K. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The data presented here confirm that steady-state mRNA levels of E2F-dependent genes c-myc, p19ARF, and p107 are induced 2-4-fold by v-Abl-both in MEFs transiently infected with v-Abl and in freshly isolated v-Abl-transformed MEF clones. However, our data show that in addition to v-Abl-dependent induction of c-myc transcription, events that occur later in the transformation process often elevate c-Myc mRNA levels further and are likely to be important for v-Abl transformation. Clones 12R, 19, and 46 acquired elevated c-Myc mRNA levels (Fig. 4b and Table I) during culture. Most significantly, c-Myc mRNA levels correlated with increased doubling times and elevated levels of telomerase activity (Fig. 10), providing strong evidence that this later increase plays a role in transformation. The increased mRNA was specific for c-myc and was not found in other E2F-dependent genes, such as p107 or p19ARF. Furthermore, c-myc transcriptional induction was completely dependent on v-Abl in clones 1, 12R, and 19 but only partially dependent on v-Abl in clones 46 and ts60. We have identified two different genetic mechanisms responsible for elevated c-Myc mRNA in these clones; clones 1, 12R, 46, and ts60 exhibited c-myc gene amplification, whereas clone 19 displayed enhanced STAT3 activity. Consistent with our findings, the loss of p53 is known to cause genomic instability (10Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T. Tlsty T.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 923-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 11Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and c-Myc overexpression and gene amplification have been observed in cells from various organs of 4-6-week old p53-/- mice (12Fukasawa K. Wiener F. Vande Woude G.F. Mai S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amplification of c-myc has been observed previously in v-Abl-transformed NIH3T3 cell lines (41Nepveu A. Fahrlander P.D. Yang J.Q. Marcu K.B. Nature. 1985; 317: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 42Colledge W.H. Gebhardt A. Edge M.D. Bell J.C. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 753-757PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that genomic instability caused by the loss of p53 contributed to the large fraction of clones that acquired c-myc gene amplification. v-Abl activates STATs (43Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 44Danial N.N. Rothman P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2523-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 45Hilbert D.M. Migone T.S. Kopf M. Leonard W.J. Rudikoff S. Immunity. 1996; 5: 81-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and STAT3 is known to activate c-myc transcription (28Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that the increase in STAT3 activity that we observed in clone 19 is mechanistically responsible for the elevated c-Myc mRNA levels observed in this clone. The genetic alteration responsible for elevated STAT3 phosphorylation is not known but could be caused by changes in Jak activity, protein phosphatase activity, or the STAT3 protein itself. In summary, by using an experimental system that is able to reveal genetic changes associated with v-Abl transformation, we have identified increases in Bcl-xL and c-Myc mRNA as changes that occur during the process of v-Abl transformation. Our findings underline the importance of anti-apoptotic and hyperproliferative changes during transformation initiated by constitutive expression of the v-Abl kinase."

Protease-sensitive repressor molecules with an altered C-terminal sequence promote rapid degradation of the wild-type repressor by inducing its C-terminal end to become exposed. Here we determined that the last 5 C-terminal residues (CTD5) of the wild-type repressor contain the motif required for recognition by the ClpX molecular chaperone, a motif that is strongly dependent upon the context in which it is presented. Although attachment of the 11-residue ssrA degradation tag to the C terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) promoted its rapid degradation by ClpXP, attachment of 5-27 C-terminal residues of the repressor failed to promote degradation. Disordered peptides derived from 41 and 35 C-terminal residues of CcdA (CcdA41) and thioredoxin (TrxA35), respectively, activated CTD5 when placed as linkers between GFP and repressor C-terminal sequences. However, when the entire thioredoxin sequence was included as a linker to promote an ordered configuration of the TrxA35 peptide, the resulting substrate was not degraded. In addition, a hybrid tag, in which CTD5 replaced the 3-residue recognition motif of the ssrA tag, was inactive when attached directly to GFP but active when attached through the CcdA41 peptide. Thus, CTD5 is sufficient to act as a recognition motif but has requirements for its presentation not shared by the ssrA tag. We suggest that activation of CTD5 may require presentation on a disordered or flexible domain that confers ligand flexibility.

Exit from lysogeny and phage replication can be induced by inactivation of the repressor, a process potentially brought about by reducing the affinity of the repressor for DNA or by increasing its susceptibility to degradation by ClpXP protease (6Vogel J.L.

Deletions within this domain suppress temperature-sensitive mutations in the DNA binding domain (DBD), which makes up approximately the first 80 N-terminal residues. These deletions also promote resistance to ClpXP in the presence of dominant-negative Vir repressors (13Vogel J.L. Geuskens V. Desmet L. Higgins N.P. Toussaint A.

The 6- or 13-residue segments created by the mutation not only cause Vir proteins to be rapidly degraded by ClpXP but also allow Vir to promote rapid degradation of the wild-type repressor (Rep) (9Welty D.J.

The movement of the Rep CTD plays a critical role in modulating interactions with DNA and ClpX. As Rep binds to DNA, its CTD moves away from the DBD, whereas the CTD of the temperature-sensitive DBD mutant cts62Rep fails to do so at the elevated temperature (17Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The close proximity of the CTD to the DBD is associated with low DNA binding affinity, suggesting that the CTD may sterically inhibit interactions of the DBD with DNA. Vir also induces movement of the Rep CTD such that its C terminus is exposed (18Marshall-Batty K.R. Nakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1612-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of Rep and repressor CTD mutants has indicated the likelihood that a ClpX recognition motif, required for the recognition of Rep as a protease substrate, is present within the CTD. Although Vir can accelerate Rep degradation, Rep alone can be degraded by ClpXP with a relatively high Michaelis constant (9Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rep degradation can be accelerated in the absence of Vir by heat denaturation. In contrast, repressor molecules with a deletion in the CTD or with certain amino acid replacements in the CTD are resistant to ClpXP even upon heat denaturation or in the presence of Vir (14Mukhopadhyay B. Marshall-Batty K.R. Kim B.D. O'Handley D. Nakai H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recognition motifs of a number of ClpX substrates can be attached to heterologous proteins to promote their degradation by ClpXP. For example, 10 C-terminal residues of the MuA protein can be attached to the C terminus of phage P22 Arc repressor to promote its degradation (19Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 11-residue ssrA degradation tag includes a ClpX recognition motif specified predominantly by the last 3 C-terminal residues (LAA) (20Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Seidel M. Wickner S.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This degradation signal is added by ssrA RNA or tmRNA, which has characteristics of both tRNA and mRNA and serves to rescue stalled ribosomes while attaching the degradation tag encoded within its open reading frame to the C terminus of the stalled peptide (21Keiler K.C.

Neher S.B. Kim Y.-I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). ClpX substrates with motifs at their C-terminal ends have been found to have C-terminal sequences similar to that of MuA or that of the ssrA tag (25Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.-I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The last 6 residues of the Mu repressor (EVKKAV) most resemble that of MuA (RRKKAI). The C-terminal motifs present on the various ClpX substrates have suggested that a 3-6-residue sequence is sufficient to promote ClpX recognition. However, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the Rep CTD has indicated that 8 single-replacement mutations within the Ser181-Val196 segment of the CTD confer ClpXP resistance in the presence of Vir (14Mukhopadhyay B. Marshall-Batty K.R. Kim B.D. O'Handley D. Nakai H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Characterization of Rep V183C in vitro, for example, has indicated that it cannot be degraded after heat denaturation or in the presence of Vir. Because the cysteine-replacement mutations known to confer ClpXP resistance span 16 residues of the CTD, the question arises whether the ClpX recognition motif is much larger than 6 residues. Here we demonstrate that the last 5 C-terminal residues of Rep are sufficient to promote degradation of a heterologous protein when attached to its C terminus. However, we demonstrate that the activity of CTD5 as the recognition motif, but not the ssrA tag, is highly dependent upon the local conformation of the C-terminal domain to which it is attached. We suggest that the ClpX recognition motif of Rep may be activated when attached to disordered or flexible domains that confer ligand flexibility. Plasmids and Proteins—ClpX (27Kruklitis R.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, which contain an N-terminal His10 tag, were overproduced in strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) from plasmid vectors described below. Overproducing plasmids for GFPmut3 (29Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar) fusion proteins were all derivatives of pYYH2, which was a gift from Drs. Yanhua Yang and Elliott Crooke (Georgetown University Medical Center). Coding sequences for attachments and linkers were fused to GFP through a NheI site encoded at the C-terminal end of the GFP coding sequence (see Fig. 1A) and expressed under the control of the phage T7 promoter. The complete Rep coding sequence was fused to GFP with the short linker GCCGGGGGATCC present between the NheI site and the first Met codon of Rep. Coding sequences for peptides from the Rep CTD and the ssrA tag were attached directly to the NheI site as double-stranded oligonucleotides with cohesive ends. GFP coding sequences that included the CcdA41 peptide linker (see Fig. 1B) were constructed by PCR amplification of the F plasmid DNA using primers GAGCTCCCTAGGATGCAGAATGAAGCCCGTCGTCTGCG and CGAATTCGCTAGCCCAGTCCCTGTTCTCGTCAGCAAAAG or CGCGGATCCTATTAGCTTGCCCAGTCCCTGTTCTCGTCAGCAAAAG. PCR products synthesized with the former pair of primers were digested with AvrII and NheI and ligated into the NheI site of coding sequences for GFP that have C-terminal attachments. PCR products formed with the latter pair of primers were digested with AvrII and BamHI and ligated into the NheI and BamHI sites of plasmid pYYH2 to produce the coding sequence for GFP-CcdA41. Plasmids encoding thioredoxin as the linker (see Fig. 1B) were constructed by amplification of total Escherichia coli K12 DNA using primers GAGCTCCCTAGGAGCGATAAAATTATTCACCTGACTGACG and CGAATTCGCTAGCCAGGTTAGCGTCGAGGAACTCTTTC or CGCGGATCCTATTAGCTTGCCAGGTTAGCGTCGAGGAACTCTTTC. The PCR product synthesized with the former pair of primers was digested with AvrII and NheI and ligated into NheI sites to produce coding sequences for GFP-Trx with C-terminal attachments. Products formed with the latter pair of primers were digested with AvrII and BamHI and ligated into the NheI and BamHI sites of pYYH2 to produce the coding sequence of GFP-Trx. Coding sequences for GFP-TrxA35 (see Fig. 1B) with or without C-terminal attachments were constructed in an analogous fashion using GAGCTCCCTAGGGGTATCCCGACTCTGCTGCTGTTC as the first (N-terminal) primer. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of GFP Fusion Proteins—Plasmid-bearing strains were grown in 500 ml of L broth to an A600 of 0.4-0.6 and induced for 2 h at 37 °C by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) to a 0.4 mm final concentration. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% w/v sucrose, 1 ml/g of wet cells). The suspension was adjusted to contain 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and treated with 250 μg/ml lysozyme at 0 °C for 45 min. It was then heated in a 37 °C water bath to 20 °C, cooled on ice to 0 °C, and then subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle using liquid nitrogen. The mixture was fractionated by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti-50 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 45 min (4 °C). Although GFP fusion proteins could be purified from both the pellet and supernatant, purification from the pellet fraction minimized contamination with truncated peptides yielding a preparation that was greater than 95% pure. This procedure also allowed us to express protease-sensitive substrates at high levels without using protease-deficient cells. GFP fusion proteins in the pellet were solubilized in 5-10 ml of Buffer B (25 mm HEPES-Na+, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 7 m urea, 10% w/v glycerol), dispersed with a Dounce homogenizer, and then placed on ice for 1 h. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (Beckman 50 Ti rotor; 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was mixed with Superflow nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, 2.5 ml of bed volume). Batch adsorption of GFP proteins to the resin was allowed to proceed with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was spun down by centrifugation and washed two times in batch with 10-12 ml of Buffer B. The resin was subsequently packed into a column, and bound protein was eluted with Buffer B that contains 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein fraction was diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and dialyzed sequentially against 2 liters of Buffer C (25 mm HEPES-Na+, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% w/v glycerol) containing 5, 3, 1, and 0 m urea (at least 2 h for each change of dialysis buffer, with overnight dialysis at 3 and 0 m urea). The purified protein was frozen in aliquots with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. GFP-Rep was purified from the clarified crude cell extract (the soluble fraction after centrifugation). For lysis, cells were suspended in Buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. GFP-Rep in the soluble fraction was purified by adsorption to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as described previously, but urea was not present in any of the column buffers. The purified protein was dialyzed extensively in Buffer C for storage at -80 °C. ClpX, ClpP, and all protease substrate concentrations were determined by the method of Pace (30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar) and are given in equivalents of protein monomers. Protease Assays—Reaction mixtures (210 μl) contained 25 mm HEPES-K+, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 2 μm protease substrate, 1.8 μm ClpP, and 0.9 μm ClpX. Reactions were started by the addition of ClpX and incubated at 37 °C, and 30-μl samples were withdrawn at indicated times and adjusted to contain 20 mm EDTA. As a control, a separate 30-μl reaction mixture was incubated for the maximum time in the absence of added ClpX and ClpP. In all experiments, no degradation of substrates was detected in the absence of ClpXP. Proteins in the samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The stained gel was photographed with a Kodak DC290 digital camera, and the level of protein degradation was quantified by densitometry using the NIH Image Software. The level of substrate present at 0 min was set at 100% GFP remaining. Results representative of at least three independent experiments are shown. The Last 5 C-terminal Residues of the Repressor Promote Degradation of GFP When Attached to Its C Terminus via the CcdA41 Peptide Linker—To determine whether a ClpX recognition motif is contained within the Rep CTD (Ile170-Val196), the last 27 (CTD27), 15 (CTD15), 10 (CTD10), or 5 (CTD5) C-terminal residues were attached to the C terminus of GFP (Fig. 1). Because ClpX recognition motifs found at the C-terminal end of protein substrates have been found to be as small as 3-6 residues (20Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Seidel M. Wickner S.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.-I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), a fully functional recognition motif was likely to be contained within the 27-residue CTD. However, the GFP could not be degraded by ClpXP when any of the CTD peptides were attached, even the entire CTD (GFP-CTD27), whereas the 11-residue ssrA tag (GFP-ssrA) promoted rapid GFP degradation (Fig. 2). GFP-Rep, which has the entire Rep sequence attached to GFP, could be degraded at a low level. The presence of Vir could accelerate the degradation of GFPRep but not of GFP-CTD27 (data not shown). We therefore examined whether a linker placed between GFP and Rep CTD residues would promote substrate degradation. We chose as a linker the C-terminal residues of the CcdA protein, which can be converted to a ClpXP substrate by the addition of a recognition motif to its C-terminal end. CcdA is the antidote protein for the postsegregational killing system of the F plasmid that eliminates plasmid-free cells (31Ogura T. Hiraga S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4784-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 32Jaffe A. Ogura T. Hiraga S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 841-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CcdA protein is a substrate of the lon protease (33Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 34Van Melderen L. Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), but not of ClpXP, but it is degraded by ClpXP in vivo when 7 C-terminal residues (FMNRKVL) of the ClpXP-sensitive Vir3061 protein are attached to the CcdA C terminus (35Laachouch J.E. Desmet L. Geuskens V. Grimaud R. Toussaint A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When 41 C-terminal residues of the CcdA protein were attached as linkers (CcdA41) between the GFP C terminus and the CTD5 peptide, the GFP substrate (GFP-CcdA41-CTD5) could then be degraded by ClpXP (Fig. 3). No intermediates in degradation, such as products of aborted degradation after proteolysis of the Ccd41-CTD5 moiety, were observed (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that differences in protease sensitivity between GFP-CTD5 and GFP-CcdA41-CTD5 are not likely caused by differential effects on GFP folding caused by the different peptide appendages. As was demonstrated previously for the ssrA tag (36Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), these appendages do not interfere with the fluorescent properties of the GFP protein. In addition, the stability of the GFP portion is not affected by these appendages. Fluorescence quantum yield and emission spectrum for GFP, GFP-CcdA41, GFP-CTD5, and GFP-CcdA41-CTD5 were essentially the same in the presence of 6 m urea (data not shown). 2K. Marshall-Batty and H. Nakai, unpublished results. The control GFP protein with the attached CcdA41 peptide (GFP-CcdA41) but without Rep CTD peptides could not be degraded. Attachment of more than 5 residues of the CTD did not increase the rate of degradation. GFP-CcdA41-CTD10, -CTD15 (data not shown), and -CTD27 could be degraded but more slowly than GFP-CcdA-CTD5 (Fig. 3B). The results indicate that the CcdA41 protein linker allows the C-terminal motif of Rep to be properly displayed for recognition by ClpX. Together with additional data described later, the results also indicate that CTD5 is sufficient to serve as a ClpX recognition determinant. Thus, the CTD residues outside of CTD5 are not likely to be part of the ClpX recognition motif and may play a key role in the proper display of CTD5 when Rep is in the ClpXP-sensitive form. The ClpX Recognition Motif Attached to the C Terminus of Thioredoxin Promotes Degradation in the Context of the Disordered Peptide but Not in the Context of the Native Full-length Protein—An important question is why attachment of even 27 C-terminal residues of Rep directly to GFP fails to promote GFP degradation whereas attachment of the 11-residue ssrA tag readily can. The CcdA protein apparently has an extended or partially unfolded conformation (34Van Melderen L. Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which may serve not only to expose the attached motif but also promote conformational flexibility of a recognition motif attached to the C terminus. We chose to use the CcdA41 peptide as the linker on the GFP substrate because it lacks the α-helical structure that is present in the full-length, 72-residue CcdA protein (34Van Melderen L. Thi M.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), a property that may confer conformational disorder to the attached Rep peptide.

We therefore wished to determine whether activity of CTD5 as a recognition motif, but not the ssrA tag, is greatly dependent upon the local conformation of protein substrates at the site of its attachment. To examine this problem, CTD5 was attached to the C terminus of GFP with thioredoxin peptide linkers, GFP-Trx-CTD5 containing the full-length 108-residue thioredoxin protein and GFP-TrxA35-CTD5 containing the 35 C-terminal residues of thioredoxin. By itself the TrxA35 peptide assumes a disordered state (41Reutimann H. Straub B. Luisi P.L. Holmgren A. J. Biol.
