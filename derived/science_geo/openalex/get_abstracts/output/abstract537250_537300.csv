https://openalex.org/W2209106767,"Hae Kyung Im and colleagues report a method for predicting gene expression perturbations from genotype data after training on reference transcriptome data sets. Association of predicted gene expression with disease traits identifies known and new candidate disease genes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations."

https://openalex.org/W2204392137,"Dmitry Gordenin and colleagues use a yeast reporter strain to identify distinct mutagenic signatures for the cytosine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. They find that cancer samples with APOBEC3A-like mutation signatures have greater than tenfold more APOBEC signature mutations than those with APOBEC3B-like signatures. Elucidation of mutagenic processes shaping cancer genomes is a fundamental problem whose solution promises insights into new treatment, diagnostic and prevention strategies1. Single-strand DNA–specific APOBEC cytidine deaminase(s) are major source(s) of mutation in several cancer types2,3,4. Previous indirect evidence implicated APOBEC3B as the more likely major mutator deaminase, whereas the role of APOBEC3A is not established5,6. Using yeast models enabling the controlled generation of long single-strand genomic DNA substrates7, we show that the mutation signatures of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are statistically distinguishable. We then apply three complementary approaches to identify cancer samples with mutation signatures resembling either APOBEC. Strikingly, APOBEC3A-like samples have over tenfold more APOBEC-signature mutations than APOBEC3B-like samples. We propose that APOBEC3A-mediated mutagenesis is much more frequent because APOBEC3A itself is highly proficient at generating DNA breaks8,9,10, whose repair can trigger the formation of single-strand hypermutation substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2202793491,"Paul Khavari and colleagues report genomic analyses of cutaneous T cell lymphomas. They identify recurrent point mutations and genomic gains of TNFRSF1B, encoding the tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR2, in 18% of tumors and show that expression of a recurrent TNFR2 mutant in T cells leads to enhanced non-canonical NF-κB signaling that is sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome comprise the majority of cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs), disorders notable for their clinical heterogeneity that can present in skin or peripheral blood. Effective treatment options for CTCL are limited, and the genetic basis of these T cell lymphomas remains incompletely characterized1. Here we report recurrent point mutations and genomic gains of TNFRSF1B, encoding the tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR2, in 18% of patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Expression of the recurrent TNFR2 Thr377Ile mutant in T cells leads to enhanced non-canonical NF-κB signaling that is sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Using an integrative genomic approach, we additionally discovered a recurrent CTLA4-CD28 fusion, as well as mutations in downstream signaling mediators of these receptors."

Here we speculated that differences in autoantigen-binding repertoires between a heterozygote's two expressed HLA variants might result in additional non-additive risk effects. We tested the non-additive disease contributions of classical HLA alleles in patients and matched controls for five common autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (ncases = 5,337), type 1 diabetes (T1D; ncases = 5,567), psoriasis vulgaris (ncases = 3,089), idiopathic achalasia (ncases = 727) and celiac disease (ncases = 11,115). In four of the five diseases, we observed highly significant, non-additive dominance effects (rheumatoid arthritis, P = 2.5 × 10(-12); T1D, P = 2.4 × 10(-10); psoriasis, P = 5.9 × 10(-6); celiac disease, P = 1.2 × 10(-87)). In three of these diseases, the non-additive dominance effects were explained by interactions between specific classical HLA alleles (rheumatoid arthritis, P = 1.8 × 10(-3); T1D, P = 8.6 × 10(-27); celiac disease, P = 6.0 × 10(-100)). These interactions generally increased disease risk and explained moderate but significant fractions of phenotypic variance (rheumatoid arthritis, 1.4%; T1D, 4.0%; celiac disease, 4.1%) beyond a simple additive model."
https://openalex.org/W1176330553,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed after the disease has metastasized; it is among the most lethal forms of cancer. We recently described aberrant expression of an open reading frame 1 protein, ORF1p, encoded by long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1; L1) retrotransposon, in PDAC. To test whether LINE-1 expression leads to somatic insertions of this mobile DNA, we used a targeted method to sequence LINE-1 insertion sites in matched PDAC and normal samples. We found evidence of 465 somatic LINE-1 insertions in 20 PDAC genomes, which were absent from corresponding normal samples. In cases in which matched normal tissue, primary PDAC and metastatic disease sites were available, insertions were found in primary and metastatic tissues in differing proportions. Two adenocarcinomas secondarily involving the pancreas, but originating in the stomach and duodenum, acquired insertions with a similar discordance between primary and metastatic sites. Together, our findings show that LINE-1 contributes to the genetic evolution of PDAC and suggest that somatic insertions are acquired discontinuously in gastrointestinal neoplasms."

https://openalex.org/W2217039962,"PCSK6 is identified as the protease that cleaves and activates the zymogen form of corin, a protease that in turn activates the natriuretic peptides that control salt balance and blood pressure. Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease, afflicting >30% of adults1. The cause of hypertension in most individuals remains unknown2,3, suggesting that additional contributing factors have yet to be discovered. Corin is a serine protease that activates the natriuretic peptides, thereby regulating blood pressure4. It is synthesized as a zymogen that is activated by proteolytic cleavage. CORIN variants and mutations impairing corin activation have been identified in people with hypertension and pre-eclampsia5,6,7,8,9. To date, however, the identity of the protease that activates corin remains elusive. Here we show that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-6 (PCSK6, also named PACE4; ref. 10) cleaves and activates corin. In cultured cells, we found that corin activation was inhibited by inhibitors of PCSK family proteases and by small interfering RNAs blocking PCSK6 expression. Conversely, PCSK6 overexpression enhanced corin activation. In addition, purified PCSK6 cleaved wild-type corin but not the R801A variant that lacks the conserved activation site. Pcsk6-knockout mice developed salt-sensitive hypertension, and corin activation and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide processing activity were undetectable in these mice. Moreover, we found that CORIN variants in individuals with hypertension and pre-eclampsia were defective in PCSK6-mediated activation. We also identified a PCSK6 mutation that impaired corin activation activity in a hypertensive patient. Our results indicate that PCSK6 is the long-sought corin activator and is important for sodium homeostasis and normal blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2194393752,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) has been identified as a susceptibility factor of late onset Alzheimer disease in genome-wide association studies. ABCA7 has been shown to mediate phagocytosis and affect membrane trafficking. The current study examined the impact of ABCA7 loss of function on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and generation of amyloid-β (Aβ). Suppression of endogenous ABCA7 in several different cell lines resulted in increased β-secretase cleavage and elevated Aβ. ABCA7 knock-out mice displayed an increased production of endogenous murine amyloid Aβ42 species. Crossing ABCA7-deficient animals to an APP transgenic model resulted in significant increases in the soluble Aβ as compared with mice expressing normal levels of ABCA7. Only modest changes in the amount of insoluble Aβ and amyloid plaque densities were observed once the amyloid pathology was well developed, whereas Aβ deposition was enhanced in younger animals. In vitro studies indicated a more rapid endocytosis of APP in ABCA7 knock-out cells that is mechanistically consistent with the increased Aβ production. These in vitro and in vivo findings indicate a direct role of ABCA7 in amyloid processing that may be associated with its primary biological function to regulate endocytic pathways. Several potential loss-of-function ABCA7 mutations and deletions linked to Alzheimer disease that in some instances have a greater impact than apoE allelic variants have recently been identified. A reduction in ABCA7 expression or loss of function would be predicted to increase amyloid production and that may be a contributing factor in the associated Alzheimer disease susceptibility.

https://openalex.org/W2098381037,"Although dairy manure is widely applied to land, it is relatively understudied compared to other livestock as a potential source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to the environment and ultimately to human pathogens. Ceftiofur, the most widely used antibiotic used in U.S. dairy cows, is a 3rd generation cephalosporin, a critically important class of antibiotics to human health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of typical ceftiofur antibiotic treatment on the prevalence of ARGs in the fecal microbiome of dairy cows using a metagenomics approach. β-lactam ARGs were found to be elevated in feces from Holstein cows administered ceftiofur (n = 3) relative to control cows (n = 3). However, total numbers of ARGs across all classes were not measurably affected by ceftiofur treatment, likely because of dominance of unaffected tetracycline ARGs in the metagenomics libraries. Functional analysis via MG-RAST further revealed that ceftiofur treatment resulted in increases in gene sequences associated with “phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids”, suggesting that this treatment also enriched the ability to horizontally transfer ARGs. Additional functional shifts were noted with ceftiofur treatment (e.g., increase in genes associated with stress, chemotaxis, and resistance to toxic compounds; decrease in genes associated with metabolism of aromatic compounds and cell division and cell cycle), along with measureable taxonomic shifts (increase in Bacterioidia and decrease in Actinobacteria). This study demonstrates that ceftiofur has a broad, measureable and immediate effect on the cow fecal metagenome. Given the importance of 3rd generation cephalospirins to human medicine, their continued use in dairy cattle should be carefully considered and waste treatment strategies to slow ARG dissemination from dairy cattle manure should be explored."
https://openalex.org/W1932694010,"Damaged mitochondria are eliminated through autophagy machinery. A cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, a gene product mutated in familial Parkinsonism, is essential for this pathway. Recent progress has revealed that phosphorylation of both Parkin and ubiquitin at Ser65 by PINK1 are crucial for activation and recruitment of Parkin to the damaged mitochondria. However, the mechanism by which phosphorylated ubiquitin associates with and activates phosphorylated Parkin E3 ligase activity remains largely unknown. Here, we analyze interactions between phosphorylated forms of both Parkin and ubiquitin at a spatial resolution of the amino acid residue by site-specific photo-crosslinking. We reveal that the in-between-RING (IBR) domain along with RING1 domain of Parkin preferentially binds to ubiquitin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, another approach, the Fluoppi (fluorescent-based technology detecting protein-protein interaction) assay, also showed that pathogenic mutations in these domains blocked interactions with phosphomimetic ubiquitin in mammalian cells. Molecular modeling based on the site-specific photo-crosslinking interaction map combined with mass spectrometry strongly suggests that a novel binding mechanism between Parkin and ubiquitin leads to a Parkin conformational change with subsequent activation of Parkin E3 ligase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2140288056,"Background Reliable in vitro islet quality assessment assays that can be performed routinely, prospectively, and are able to predict clinical transplant outcomes are needed. In this paper we present data on the utility of an assay based on cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in predicting clinical islet autotransplant (IAT) insulin independence (II). IAT is an attractive model for evaluating characterization assays regarding their utility in predicting II due to an absence of confounding factors such as immune rejection and immunosuppressant toxicity. Methods Membrane integrity staining (FDA/PI), OCR normalized to DNA (OCR/DNA), islet equivalent (IE) and OCR (viable IE) normalized to recipient body weight (IE dose and OCR dose), and OCR/DNA normalized to islet size index (ISI) were used to characterize autoislet preparations (n = 35). Correlation between pre-IAT islet product characteristics and II was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Preparations that resulted in II had significantly higher OCR dose and IE dose (p<0.001). These islet characterization methods were highly correlated with II at 6–12 months post-IAT (area-under-the-curve (AUC) = 0.94 for IE dose and 0.96 for OCR dose). FDA/PI (AUC = 0.49) and OCR/DNA (AUC = 0.58) did not correlate with II. OCR/DNA/ISI may have some utility in predicting outcome (AUC = 0.72). Conclusions Commonly used assays to determine whether a clinical islet preparation is of high quality prior to transplantation are greatly lacking in sensitivity and specificity. While IE dose is highly predictive, it does not take into account islet cell quality. OCR dose, which takes into consideration both islet cell quality and quantity, may enable a more accurate and prospective evaluation of clinical islet preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1137470125,"Endurance exercise training induces substantial adaptive cardiac modifications such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Simultaneously to the development of LVH, adipose tissue (AT) lipolysis becomes elevated upon endurance training to cope with enhanced energy demands. In this study, we investigated the impact of adipose tissue lipolysis on the development of exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Mice deficient for adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) in AT (atATGL-KO) were challenged with chronic treadmill running. Exercise-induced AT lipolytic activity was significantly reduced in atATGL-KO mice accompanied by the absence of a plasma fatty acid (FA) increase. These processes were directly associated with a prominent attenuation of myocardial FA uptake in atATGL-KO and a significant reduction of the cardiac hypertrophic response to exercise. FA serum profiling revealed palmitoleic acid (C16:1n7) as a new molecular co-mediator of exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy by inducing nonproliferative cardiomyocyte growth. In parallel, serum FA analysis and echocardiography were performed in 25 endurance athletes. In consonance, the serum C16:1n7 palmitoleate level exhibited a significantly positive correlation with diastolic interventricular septum thickness in those athletes. No correlation existed between linoleic acid (18:2n6) and diastolic interventricular septum thickness. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence that adipose tissue lipolysis directly promotes the development of exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy involving the lipokine C16:1n7 palmitoleate as a molecular co-mediator. The identification of a lipokine involved in physiological cardiac growth may help to develop future lipid-based therapies for pathological LVH or heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2199707019,"In ticks, the digestion of blood occurs intracellularly and proteolytic digestion of hemoglobin takes place in a dedicated type of lysosome, the digest vesicle, followed by transfer of the heme moiety of hemoglobin to a specialized organelle that accumulates large heme aggregates, called hemosomes. In the present work, we studied the uptake of fluorescent metalloporphyrins, used as heme analogs, and amitraz, one of the most regularly used acaricides to control cattle tick infestations, by Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus midgut cells. Both compounds were taken up by midgut cells in vitro and accumulated inside the hemosomes. Transport of both molecules was sensitive to cyclosporine A (CsA), a well-known inhibitor of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Rhodamine 123, a fluorescent probe that is also a recognized ABC substrate, was similarly directed to the hemosome in a CsA-sensitive manner. Using an antibody against conserved domain of PgP-1-type ABC transporter, we were able to immunolocalize PgP-1 in the digest vesicle membranes. Comparison between two R. microplus strains that were resistant and susceptible to amitraz revealed that the resistant strain detoxified both amitraz and Sn-Pp IX more efficiently than the susceptible strain, a process that was also sensitive to CsA. A transcript containing an ABC transporter signature exhibited 2.5-fold increased expression in the amitraz-resistant strain when compared with the susceptible strain. RNAi-induced down-regulation of this ABC transporter led to the accumulation of metalloporphyrin in the digestive vacuole, interrupting heme traffic to the hemosome. This evidence further confirms that this transcript codes for a heme transporter. This is the first report of heme transport in a blood-feeding organism. While the primary physiological function of the hemosome is to detoxify heme and attenuate its toxicity, we suggest that the use of this acaricide detoxification pathway by ticks may represent a new molecular mechanism of resistance to pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W1756560109,"Chlamydia spp. utilize multiple secretion systems, including the type III secretion system (T3SS), to deploy host-interactive effector proteins into infected host cells. Elucidation of secreted proteins has traditionally required ectopic expression in a surrogate T3SS followed by immunolocalization of endogenous candidate effectors to confirm secretion by chlamydiae. The ability to transform Chlamydia and achieve stable expression of recombinant gene products has enabled a more direct assessment of secretion. We adapted TEM-1 β-lactamase as a reporter system for assessment of chlamydial protein secretion. We provide evidence that this system facilitates visualization of secretion in the context of infection. Specifically, our findings provide definitive evidence that C. trachomatis CT695 is secreted during infection. Follow-up indirect immunofluorescence studies confirmed CT695 secretion and indicate that this effector can be secreted at multiple points during the chlamydial developmental cycle. Our results indicate that the BlaM-fusion reporter assay will allow efficacious identification of novel secreted proteins. Moreover, this approach can easily be adapted to enable more sophisticated studies of the secretion process in Chlamydia."

PV patients develop pathogenic anti-desmoglein (Dsg) 3 ± 1 and antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), but it remained unknown whether and how AMA enter KCs and why other cell types are not affected in PV. Therefore, we sought to elucidate mechanisms of cell entry, trafficking, and pathogenic action of AMA in PV. We found that PVIgGs associated with neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) on the cell membrane, and the PVIgG-FcRn complexes entered KCs and reached mitochondria where they dissociated. The liberated AMA altered mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration, and ATP production and induced cytochrome c release, although the lack or inactivation of FcRn abolished the ability of PVIgG to reach and damage mitochondria and to cause detachment of KCs. The assays of mitochondrial functions and keratinocyte adhesion demonstrated that although the pathobiological effects of AMA on KCs are reversible, they become irreversible, leading to epidermal blistering (acantholysis), when AMA synergize with anti-Dsg antibodies. Thus, it appears that AMA enter a keratinocyte in a complex with FcRn, become liberated from the endosome in the cytosol, and are trafficked to the mitochondria, wherein they trigger pro-apoptotic events leading to shrinkage of basal KCs uniquely expressing FcRn in epidermis. During recovery, KCs extend their cytoplasmic aprons toward neighboring cells, but anti-Dsg antibodies prevent assembly of nascent desmosomes due to steric hindrance, thus rendering acantholysis irreversible. In conclusion, FcRn is a common acceptor protein for internalization of AMA and, perhaps, for PV autoantibodies to other intracellular antigens, and PV is a novel disease paradigm for investigating and elucidating the role of FcRn in this autoimmune disease and possibly other autoimmune diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2262441789,"The efficacy of engaging multiple drug targets using bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) is affected by the relative cell-surface protein levels of the respective targets. In this work, the receptor density values were correlated to the in vitro activity of a BsAb (JNJ-61186372) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET). Simultaneous binding of the BsAb to both receptors was confirmed in vitro. By using controlled Fab-arm exchange, a set of BsAbs targeting EGFR and c-MET was generated to establish an accurate receptor quantitation of a panel of lung and gastric cancer cell lines expressing heterogeneous levels of EGFR and c-MET. EGFR and c-MET receptor density levels were correlated to the respective gene expression levels as well as to the respective receptor phosphorylation inhibition values. We observed a bias in BsAb binding toward the more highly expressed of the two receptors, EGFR or c-MET, which resulted in the enhanced in vitro potency of JNJ-61186372 against the less highly expressed target. On the basis of these observations, we propose an avidity model of how JNJ-61186372 engages EGFR and c-MET with potentially broad implications for bispecific drug efficacy and design."
https://openalex.org/W1923309553,"The identification of a predisposition toward malignant hyperthermia (MH) as a risk factor for exertional heat stroke (EHS) remains a matter of debate. Such a predisposition indicates a causal role for MH susceptibility (MHS) after EHS in certain national recommendations and has led to the use of an in vitro contracture test (IVCT) to identify the MHS trait in selected or unselected EHS patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether the MHS trait is associated with EHS.EHS subjects in the French Armed Forces were routinely examined for MHS after experiencing an EHS episode. This retrospective study compared the features of IVCT-diagnosed MHS (iMHS) EHS subjects with those of MH-normal EHS patients and MH patients during the 2004-2010 period. MHS status was assessed using the European protocol.During the study period, 466 subjects (median age 25 years; 31 women) underwent MHS status investigation following an EHS episode. None of the subjects reported previous MH events. An IVCT was performed in 454 cases and was diagnostic of MHS in 45.6% of the study population, of MH susceptibility to halothane in 18.5%, of MH susceptibility to caffeine in 9.9%, and of MH susceptibility to halothane and caffeine in 17.2%. There were no differences in the clinical features, biological features or outcomes of iMHS EHS subjects compared with those of MH-normal or caffeine or halothane MHS subjects without known prior EHS episode. The recurrence rate was 12.7% and was not associated with MH status or any clinical or biological features. iMHS EHS patients exhibited a significantly less informative IVCT response than MH patients.The unexpected high prevalence of the MHS trait after EHS suggested a latent disturbance of calcium homeostasis that accounted for the positive IVCT results. This study did not determine whether EHS patients have an increased risk of MH, and it could not determine whether MH susceptibility is a risk factor for EHS."

In S. cerevisiae, the biosynthesis of Q takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and implicates at least 12 proteins, Coq1-Coq9, Coq11, Arh1, and Yah1 (5Pierrel F. Hamelin O. Douki T.

Endogenous pABA and 4-HB originate from chorismate and are limiting for Q6 biosynthesis because their addition to the growth medium increases Q6 levels in S. cerevisiae (5Pierrel F. Hamelin O.

Competition experiments demonstrated that pABA and 4-HB provided exogenously are equally efficient at promoting Q6 biosynthesis (12Marbois B. Xie L.X. Choi S. Hirano K. Hyman K.

We also showed that several synthetic analogs of 4-HB (2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHB), and vanillic acid (VA)) can serve as precursors of Q6 and can bypass deficient biosynthetic steps (10Xie L.X.

In particular, addition of VA or 3,4-diHB to the growth medium restores Q6 biosynthesis in Δcoq6 cells deficient for the C5-hydroxylation reaction (13Ozeir M. Mühlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R.

This result could either reflect an inefficient transport of VA to the mitochondrial matrix and/or a higher affinity of Coq2 for 4-HB than for VA (13Ozeir M. Mühlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R.

Class A FMOs contain a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and we recently demonstrated the presence of FAD in purified Coq6. 6A. Ismail, V. Leroux, M. Smaja, L. Gonzalez, M. Lombard, F. Pierrel, C. Mellot-Draznieks, and M. Fontecave, Coenzyme Q biosynthesis: evidence for a substrate access channel in the FAD-dependent monooxygenase Coq6. submitted for publication. The prototype enzyme of class A FMOs is para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (16Huijbers M.M. Montersino S. Westphal A.H. Tischler D. van Berkel W.J. Flavin dependent monooxygenases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2014; 544: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the ortho-hydroxylation of 4-HB in some bacteria (17Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Protein dynamics and electrostatics in the function of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase the FAD cofactor is reduced by NADPH and then reacts with dioxygen to form a FAD-hydroperoxide intermediate, which transfers a hydroxyl group onto the substrate (17Entsch B.

Biophys. 2010; 493: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The resulting FAD-hydroxide then eliminates water, which results in oxidized FAD, the starting point of the next catalytic cycle. All class A FMOs proceed similarly and thus use one oxygen atom of the dioxygen molecule for hydroxylation of the substrate, whereas the other oxygen atom is reduced into water (16Huijbers M.M.

Δcoq6 cells overexpressing Coq8 (+ COQ8) form 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminophenol (4-AP6) in the presence of pABA and 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxyphenol (4-HP6) when 4-HB is used as a precursor (13Ozeir M.

The accumulation of 4-HP6 and 4-AP6 shows that the C1-decarboxylation and C1-hydroxylation reactions can take place in the absence of a C5-methoxy group. Δcoq9 + COQ8 cells produce 4-AP6 and 4-imino-demethoxy-Q6 (IDMQ6) with pABA, and 4-HP6 and demethoxy-Q6 (DMQ6) with 4-HB (10Xie L.X. Ozeir M. Tang J.Y. Chen J.Y. Jaquinod S.K. Fontecave M.

Thus deletion of Coq9 causes a partial inactivation of the C5-hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by Coq6 and a complete impairment of the C6-hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by Coq7 (10Xie L.X.

Accordingly, human Coq9 was demonstrated to bind lipids and to associate with Coq7, leading to the suggestion that Coq9 may present DMQ10 to Coq7 (25Lohman D.C. Forouhar F. Beebe E.T. Stefely M.S.

The role played by Coq6 and Coq9 in the yeast C4-deamination reaction is unclear and the step at which this reaction takes place is not defined (Fig. 1). The formation of IDMQ6 from pABA in Δcoq9 + COQ8 cells shows that all Coq biosynthetic enzymes up to Coq7 can accommodate substrates with a C4-amino group. However, the predominant accumulation of demethyl-demethoxy-Q6 (DDMQ6) and DMQ6 in Δcoq5 + COQ8 and Δcoq7 + COQ8 cells grown in the presence of pABA suggests that the C4-deamination reaction may take place prior to the C2-methyltransferase reaction catalyzed by Coq5 (10Xie L.X.

In this study, we address the question of the C4-deamination step allowing pABA conversion into Q6 in S. cerevisiae. We unambiguously show that this reaction is achieved by Coq6. We provide evidence supporting that the C4-deamination occurs on an early intermediate of Q6 biosynthetic pathway, namely 3-hexaprenyl-4-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHAB) and that the reaction proceeds via hydroxylation of the C4-amino carbon atom of HHAB and subsequent loss of the amino group. We further show that Coq9 plays only an indirect role in the C4-deamination reaction, likely by affecting the C-terminal region of Coq6. Collectively, our results define Coq6 as an FMO that catalyzes two sequential hydroxylation reactions on two adjacent aromatic carbon atoms when pABA is used as a precursor of Q6 by S. cerevisiae.

This PCR product was obtained with primers COQ9_5 (5′-GGCGGAAGAAAAATAGC) and COQ9_3 (5′-CCACTGGCCCAGGAAGG) used on the genomic DNA from the Δcoq9 strain. Transformants were selected on YPD-agar plates containing G418 and clones were checked by coq9 locus PCR and phenotypic characterization. The cultures were placed on ice for 30 min, then the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with ice-cold water, and their wet weight was determined in pre-weighted Eppendorf tubes before freezing at −20 °C. For lipid extraction, glass beads (100 μl), 50 μl of KCl (0.15 m), a Q4 solution (4 μm in methanol, 2 μl/mg of wet weight), and 0.6 ml of methanol were added to cell pellets (10–30 mg wet weight) and the tubes were vortexed for 10 min. Neutral lipids were extracted by adding 0.4 ml of petroleum ether (40–60 °C boiling range) and by vortexing for 3 min. The"

Similar metabolic changes are observed with age, suggesting that chronic jet lag and accelerated cell aging are intimately related, but the association remains to be determined. We addressed whether jet lag induces metabolic and cell aging impairments in young grass rats (2–3 mo old), using control old grass rats (12–18 mo old) as an aging reference. Desynchronized young and control old subjects had impaired glucose tolerance (+60 and +280%) when compared with control young animals. Despite no significant variation in liver DNA damage, shorter telomeres were characterized, not only in old animal liver cells (–18%), but also at an intermediate level in desynchronized young rats (–9%). The same pattern was found for deacetylase sirtuin (SIRT)-1 (–57 and –29%), confirming that jet-lagged young rats have an intermediate aging profile. Our data indicate that an experimental circadian desynchronization in young animals is associated with a precocious aging profile based on 3 well-known markers, as well as a prediabetic phenotype. Such chronic jet lag-induced alterations observed in a diurnal species constitute proof of principle of the need to develop preventive treatments in jet-lagged persons and shift workers.—Grosbellet, E., Zahn, S., Arrivé, M., Dumont, S., Gourmelen, S., Pévet, P., Challet, E., Criscuolo, F.

The influence of these components on pulmonary inflammation has been largely studied in the context of individual agonists, despite knowledge that they can have synergistic effects when used in combination. Here we have explored the effects of LPS and β-glucan, two commonly-encountered microbial agonists, on the pathogenesis of allergic and non-allergic respiratory responses to house dust mite allergen. Notably, sensitization with these microbial components in combination acted synergistically to promote robust neutrophilic inflammation, which involved both Dectin-1 and TLR-4. This pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation was corticosteroid-refractory, resembling that found in patients with severe asthma. Thus our results provide key new insights into how microbial components influence the development of respiratory pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1181555117,"Structural and biochemical studies of scavenger decapping enzyme identify conformational changes induced by substrate binding to a second binding site that occur faster than catalytic turnover, such that high substrate concentrations inhibit enzyme activity. The scavenger decapping enzyme hydrolyzes the protective 5′ cap structure on short mRNA fragments that are generated from the exosomal degradation of mRNAs. From static crystal structures and NMR data, it is apparent that the dimeric enzyme has to undergo large structural changes to bind its substrate in a catalytically competent conformation. Here we studied the yeast enzyme and showed that the associated opening and closing motions can be orders of magnitude faster than the catalytic turnover rate. This excess of motion is induced by the binding of a second ligand to the enzyme, which occurs at high substrate concentrations. We designed a mutant that disrupted the allosteric pathway that links the second binding event to the dynamics and showed that this mutant enzyme is hyperactive. Our data reveal a unique mechanism of substrate inhibition in which motions that are required for catalytic activity also inhibit efficient turnover when they are present in excess."
https://openalex.org/W1925529664,"The recent increase in the use of high field MR systems is accompanied by a demand for acquisition techniques and coil systems that can take advantage of increased power and accuracy without being susceptible to increased noise. Physical location and anatomical complexity of targeted regions must be considered when attempting to image deeper structures with small nuclei and/or complex cytoarchitechtonics (i.e. small microvasculature and deep nuclei), such as the brainstem and the cerebellum (Cb). Once these obstacles are overcome, the concomitant increase in signal strength at higher field strength should allow for faster acquisition of MR images. Here we show that it is technically feasible to quickly and accurately detect blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes and obtain anatomical images of Cb at high spatial resolutions in individual subjects at 7 Tesla in a single one-hour session. Images were obtained using two high-density multi-element surface coils (32 channels in total) placed beneath the head at the level of Cb, two channel transmission, and three-dimensional sensitivity encoded (3D, SENSE) acquisitions to investigate sensorimotor activations in Cb. Two classic sensorimotor tasks were used to detect Cb activations. BOLD signal changes during motor activity resulted in concentrated clusters of activity within the Cb lobules associated with each task, observed consistently and independently in each subject: Oculomotor vermis (VI/VII) and CrusI/II for pro- and anti-saccades; ipsilateral hemispheres IV-VI for finger tapping; and topographical separation of eye- and hand- activations in hemispheres VI and VIIb/VIII. Though fast temporal resolution was not attempted here, these functional patches of highly specific BOLD signal changes may reflect small-scale shunting of blood in the microvasculature of Cb. The observed improvements in acquisition time and signal detection are ideal for individualized investigations such as differentiation of functional zones prior to surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2222975708,"Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that controls diverse biological processes by covalently conjugating the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to specific targets. Neddylation is commonly mediated by NEDD8-specific enzymes (typical neddylation) and, sometimes, by ubiquitin enzymes (atypical neddylation). Although typical neddylation is known to regulate protein function in many ways, the regulatory mechanisms and biological consequence of atypical neddylation remain largely unexplored. Here we report that NEDD8 conjugates were accumulated in the diseased hearts from mouse models and human patients. Proteotoxic stresses induced typical and atypical neddylation in cardiomyocytes. Loss of NUB1L exaggerated atypical neddylation, whereas NUB1L overexpression repressed atypical neddylation through promoting the degradation of NEDD8. Activation of atypical neddylation accumulated a surrogate misfolded protein, GFPu. In contrast, suppression of atypical neddylation by NUB1L overexpression enhanced GFPu degradation. Moreover, NUB1L depletion accumulated a cardiomyopathy-linked misfolded protein, CryABR120G, whereas NUB1L overexpression promoted its degradation through suppressing neddylation of ubiquitinated proteins in cardiomyocytes. Consequently, NUB1L protected cells from proteotoxic stress-induced cell injury. In summary, these data indicate that NUB1L suppresses atypical neddylation and promotes the degradation of misfolded proteins by the proteasome.

Since the discovery of ubiquitin in the 1970s, a dozen ubiquitin-like proteins have been identified that modify protein substrates in a manner similar to ubiquitination (1Hochstrasser M.

Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins in protein regulation.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1276-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Among all ubiquitin-like proteins, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8) shares the highest (80%) homology with Ub and is evolutionarily conserved among most species (3Kumar S. Yoshida Y. Noda M. Cloning of a cDNA which encodes a novel ubiquitin-like protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similar to Ub, NEDD8 is covalently attached to target proteins by forming an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of NEDD8 and the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues on the recipient substrate. Typical neddylation requires the NEDD8-specific heterodimeric E1-activating enzyme (NAE), the E2 conjugation enzyme (Ubc12), and a still largely unknown set of E3 ligases. The conjugated NEDD8 can be cleaved off the substrates by deneddylases such as the COP9 signalosome (CSN) and NEDD8 protease 1 (NEDP1) in a process known as deneddylation (4Enchev R.I.

Consequently, by modulating the cellular functions of the substrates, neddylation influences diverse cellular processes, including ubiquitination, cell proliferation, DNA damage response, transcriptional regulation, signaling transduction, and others (4Enchev R.I.

Cullin family proteins are the best characterized NEDD8 substrates. However, an increasing number of cellular proteins have been identified recently as NEDD8 targets (11Kandala S. Kim I.M. Su H. Neddylation and deneddylation in cardiac biology.Am. J. Cardiovasc. Dis. 2014; 4: 140-158PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent reports indicate that, under various stress conditions, NEDD8 incorporates into the existing Ub chain, leading to mixed ubiquitin- and NEDD8-modified conjugates (17Leidecker O. Matic I. Mahata B. Pion E. Xirodimas D.P. The ubiquitin E1 enzyme Ube1 mediates NEDD8 activation under diverse stress conditions.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Such neddylation requires a ubiquitin-conjugation system, such as the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBE1, but not the canonical NAE. Therefore, this process has been termed atypical neddylation (17Leidecker O. Matic I. Mahata B. Pion E. Xirodimas D.P. The ubiquitin E1 enzyme Ube1 mediates NEDD8 activation under diverse stress conditions.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Hjerpe R. Thomas Y. Chen J.

J. 2012; 441: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how atypical neddylation is controlled or what its functional consequence is in cells. The interferon-inducible protein NEDD8 ultimate buster 1 long (NUB1L) has been proposed as a negative regulator of neddylation (19Tanaka T. Kawashima H. Yeh E.T. Kamitani T. Regulation of the NEDD8 conjugation system by a splicing variant, NUB1L.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32905-32913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It possesses a ubiquitin-like domain and three ubiquitin-associating domains. NUB1L specifically binds to NEDD8 and promotes the transfer of NEDD8 to the proteasome for degradation by cooperating with the p97UFD1-NPL4 complex (20Liu S. Yang H. Zhao J. Zhang Y.H. Song A.X. Hu H.Y. NEDD8 ultimate buster-1 long (NUB1L) protein promotes transfer of NEDD8 to proteasome for degradation through the P97UFD1/NPL4 complex.J. Biol.

Although neddylation does not lead to the proteasomal degradation of NEDD8-modified substrates, accumulating evidence suggests a cross-talk between NEDD8 and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. In support of this, typical neddylation of cullin-based or non-cullin Ub ligases controls their activities and the degradation of their substrates (6Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 10Xie P. Zhang M. He S. Lu K. Chen Y. Xing G. Lu Y.

Furthermore, neddylation of cellular proteins can actually antagonize their ubiquitination and increase their stability (7Zuo W. Huang F. Chiang Y.J. Li M. Du J. Ding Y. Zhang T. Lee H.W. Jeong L.S.

So far, whether atypical neddylation, particularly neddylation of ubiquitinated proteins, influences ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has not been explored in any cell type, including cardiomyocytes. Here we report that proteotoxic stress activates atypical neddylation in cardiomyocytes, which, in turn, impairs global proteasomal proteolysis. We further demonstrate that NUB1L suppresses atypical neddylation and promotes the proteasomal degradation of a misfolded protein that causes cardiomyopathy, thereby conferring protection to cardiomyocytes against proteotoxic stress. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized cross-talk between ubiquitin and the NEDD8 pathway. Given that proteotoxicity has been identified as a pathogenic factor in many cardiac disorders, selectively targeting atypical neddylation could be a novel therapeutic strategy to combat cardiac pathogenesis involving prevalent proteotoxic stress. Transgenic (Tg) mouse models expressing a missense mutant (arginine 120 to glycine) of αB-crystallin (CryABR120G) or a seven-amino acid deletion mutant of desmin (D7-des) haven been described previously (25Wang X.

All animal experiments were approved by the Georgia Regents University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human heart tissue blocks from 10 patients with end-stage heart failure and five non-failing controls (without a history of cardiovascular disorders) were retrieved from the archive of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The protocol for the use of human heart samples was reviewed and exempted by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The HEK293 cell line stably expressing a degron signal CL1-fused green fluorescent protein (GFPu) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) was created as described previously (27Su H. Huang W. Wang X.

Cells were harvested for analysis 48 h after transfection. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were isolated using the neonatal cardiomyocyte isolation system (Worthington) following the protocol of the manufacturer (29Zheng Q. Su H. Ranek M.J. Wang X.

Adenoviruses expressing SF-NEDD8 (Ad-SF-NEDD8) or FLAG-tagged NUB1L (Ad-NUB1L) were created using the AdEasy adenoviral vector system (Stratagene). Adenoviruses expressing GFPu (Ad-GFPu), RFP (Ad-RFP), HA-tagged wild-type CryAB (Ad-CryAB), or HA-tagged CryABR120G (Ad-HA-CryABR120G) were used. Infection of NRVMs was generally performed 24∼48 h after plating in serum-free DMEM for 3 h. The adenovirus-containing medium were replaced with fresh medium containing 2% serum. Ad-NUB1L was applied to NRVMs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 unless specified otherwise. Control cells were infected with Ad expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal) at a comparable MOI.

The siRNAs used for NUB1L were 5′-CCGGAAACGATGCCTTACTTA-3′ and 5′-TCCGAGGCTCCGGAAAGATAA-3′. siRNA against luciferase (5′-AACGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′) was used as a negative control in all knockdown experiments. Briefly, NRVMs were transfected with siRNA (100 pmol/2 × 106 cells) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) following the protocol of the manufacturer 24∼48 h after plating. Six hours after transfection, the siRNA-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2% FBS. A second round of siRNA transfection was performed 3 days after the first transfection to achieve a sustained silencing effect. Simulated ischemia or ischemia reperfusion was achieved using a modified Krebs buffer/anaerobic environment protocol as described previously (30Fahmi A. Smart N. Punn A. Jabr R. Marber M.

Autophagy and p62 in cardiac proteinopathy.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cardiomyocytes were lysed in cold PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 30 min and vortexed for 30 s every 10 min. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected as soluble fractions. The pellets were dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture), sonicated on ice, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as insoluble fractions. For the protein dot blot, equal amounts of soluble or insoluble protein fractions were loaded onto a PVDF membrane using a Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then rinsed with cold PBS and subjected to Western blot analysis. Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcription into single-stranded cDNA was performed as described previously (29Zheng Q. Su H. Ranek M.J. Wang X. Autophagy and p62 in cardiac proteinopathy.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Gene expression levels were measured in duplicate per sample by real-time PCR (StepOnePlus real-time PCR system, Life Technologies) using the SYBR Green assay with gene-specific primers at a final concentration of 200 nm. The following primers were used: GFPu forward, GGGCACAAGCTGGAGTACAACT; GFPu reverse, ATGTTGTGGCGGATCTTGAAG; HA-CryABR120G forward, TTCTTCGGAGAGCACCTGTT; and HA-CryABR120G reverse, CCCCAGAACCTTGACTTTGA. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔct method against rat housekeeping gene acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (RPLP0). Each experiment was repeated at least three times independently. This was performed as described previously with minor modifications (31Powell S.R. Davies K.J. Divald A. Optimal determination of heart tissue 26S-proteasome activity requires maximal stimulating ATP concentrations.J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2007; 42: 265-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured NRVMs were lysed on ice in cytosolic extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). Protein concentrations were determined with BCA reagents (Pierce) and diluted to equal concentration in proteasome assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Peptidase activities were determined in the presence of ATP for chymotrypsin-like (28 μm) and caspase-like activity (14 μm). The synthetic fluorogenic substrates Suc-LLVY-AMC (18 μm, Enzo Life Sciences) and Suc-LLE-AMC (45 μm, Millipore) were used for measuring chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, respectively. Peptide cleavage reactions were carried out in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Enzo Life Sciences). The portion of activities that was inhibited by MG132 was considered to be the proteasome activity. The fluorescence was read in a Bio-Tek Synergy H4 plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. NRVMs subject to various experimental treatments were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing CHX (100 μm, Sigma) to suppress protein synthesis. The cells were collected at different consecutive time points after CHX administration, and whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot for the protein of interest. For immunohistochemical staining of NEDD8, 4-μm sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. To recover antigen, these sections were incubated in preheated sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0, 99 °C) for 20 min with the PT Link system (Dako). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2. After preincubation with 10% non-immune goat serum (Invitrogen) to prevent nonspecific binding, tissue sections were incubated with rabbit anti-NEDD8 antibody (1:400, Cell Signal Technology) at 4 °C overnight. The signal was amplified with the Histostain-SP kit (Life Technologies) and detected with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate (Dako). Special attention was paid to avoid color overdevelopment. Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Negative controls were incubated with appropriate non-immune serum instead of primary antibody under the same conditions. NRVMs were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and a deubiquitin enzyme inhibitor, PR-619 (30 μm, Lifesensors), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then quantified for protein concentration with BCA reagents, and 1 mg of the supernatant, in a total volume of 1 ml, was used for the subsequent immunoprecipitation. The tissue lysates were first precleared by incubation with appropriate IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were then incubated with mouse anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose beads to pull down HA-tagged CryABR120G or tandem ubiquitin binding entity-conjugated agarose beads (Lifesensors) to pull down polyubiquitinated proteins at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) along with unconjugated mouse IgG (4 μg of IgG/1 mg of protein, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control agarose (Lifesensors) served as immunoprecipitation controls. The immunoprecipitates were finally eluted using 2× sample loading buffer (160 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analyses. Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the collected culture medium was measured using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche) and following the instructions of the manufacturer. Cell viability was determined by measuring cellular ATP levels using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability kit (Promega) and following the instructions of the manufacturer. Luminescence was recorded with a Centro XS3 LB 960 microplate luminometer (Berthold). Results are shown as mean ± S.E. Paired data were evaluated using two-tailed Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance or, when appropriate, two-way analysis of variance, followed by a post hoc test was performed. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To study the role of neddylation in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, we first asked whether neddylation is dysregulated in hearts exposed to proteotoxic stress. It has been established previously that proteotoxic stress is prevalent in Tg mouse hearts overexpressing the misfolded proteins CryABR120G or D7-des in which these misfolded proteins form protein aggregates in cardiomyocytes (25Wang X. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Gerdes A.M. Nieman M. Lorenz J. Hewett T. Robbins J. Expression of R120G-αB-crystallin causes aberrant desmin and αB-crystallin aggregation and cardiomyopathy in mice.Circ.

In adult CryABR120G and D7-des Tg mouse hearts, we observed ∼3-fold increases of neddylated proteins compared with littermate non-Tg mice. This was accompanied by up-regulation of the negative regulator of neddylation NUB1L and the deneddylase NEDP1 (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that the increase in neddylated proteins likely results from activation of neddylation rather than defective deneddylation. Furthermore, proteotoxic stress is also prevalent in human failing hearts, as evidenced by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and protein aggregates (32Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2258824161,"Abnormal epigenetic reprogramming of donor nuclei after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is thought to be the main cause of low cloning efficiencies. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated a positive role of Scriptaid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) that belongs to an existing class of hydroxamic acid-containing HDACis, on the development competence of cloned embryos in many species. The present study investigated the effects of Scriptaid on the development of porcine SCNT embryos in vitro and its mechanism. Treatment with 300 or 500 nM Scriptaid for 20 h after activation significantly increased the percentage of SCNT embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage and the total number of cells per blastocyst and significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells in blastocysts. Scriptaid treatment significantly increased the level of histone H3 acetylated at K9 and the conversion of 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and significantly decreased the level of histone H3 trimethylated at K9 at the pronuclear stage. As a potential mechanism for the DNA methylation changes, our results showed that the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 was frequently down-regulated in Scriptaid-treated embryos in comparison with untreated embryos and was inversely correlated to endogenous microRNA-152 (miR-152). Taken together, these findings illustrated a crucial functional crosstalk between miR-152 and DNMT1. Meanwhile, mRNA and protein levels of POU5F1 and CDX2 were increased in Scriptaid-treated embryos. mRNA levels of Caspase3, and Bax were significantly decreased and that of Bcl-xL was significantly increased in Scriptaid-treated embryos. In conclusion, these observations would contribute to uncover the nuclear reprogramming mechanisms underlying the effects of Scriptaid on the improvement of porcine SCNT embryos."

The major and fastest component, called non-photochemical quenching, occurs within the photosystem II antenna system by the action of two essential light-harvesting complex (LHC)-like proteins, photosystem II subunit S (PSBS) in plants and light-harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR) in green algae and diatoms.

Photosynthesis depends on light; however, excess light can be harmful for the photosynthetic apparatus when its intensity exceeds the activity of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Indeed, light in excess with respect to the photochemical quenching activity increases the lifetime of chlorophyll singlet excited states (1Chl*), 2The abbreviations used are: ChlchlorophyllCarcarotenoidLHClight-harvesting complexLHCSRlight-harvesting complex stress-relatedNPQnon-photochemical quenchingPSphotosystemPSBSphotosystem II subunit Sα-DMn-dodecyl α-d-maltopyranosideoeLHCSR1LHCSR1-overexpressingoeLHCSR1 His tagLHCSR1 with histidine tail-overexpressingdpidays postagroinfiltrationPpLHCSR1P. patens LHCSR1SsupernatantPpelletBband. thus increasing the probability of triplet chlorophyll (3Chl*) formation. Long living triplets react with O2 to yield singlet oxygen (1O2), leading to photodamage and photoinhibition (1Barber J. Andersson B. Too much of a good thing: light can be bad for photosynthesis.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 2Miller G. Shulaev V. Mittler R.

How do environmental stresses accelerate photoinhibition?.Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Plants developed multiple photoprotection mechanisms against photooxidation. A major mechanism for response to changes in light availability is non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which is activated upon exposure to excess light and leads to the dissipation of excess energy absorbed as heat (4Genty B. Briantais J.M. Baker N.R. The relationship between the quantum yield of photosynthetic electron transport and quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence.Biochim. Biophys.

NPQ includes several components whose relative importance for photoprotection depends on species and physiological state. The energy quenching (qE) component is reversibly activated within seconds upon an increase in light intensity and has the highest potential for quenching. Slowly relaxing components are included under the definition of “inhibitory quenching” (qI) and are activated within several minutes of excess irradiance and relax within 1–2 h in the dark (5Niyogi K.K.

Zeaxanthin is produced in excess light from pre-existing violaxanthin and is photoprotective (8Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R.

Finally, the actual quenching from photoinhibition (9Powles S.B. Björkman O.

An intermediate kinetic component, qM, which relaxes in 8–20 min, has been attributed to the chloroplast avoidance relocation in the cell, implying that this fluorescence decay is not dependent on quenching (11Cazzaniga S.

Among quenching mechanisms, the most studied and yet obscure is qE whose mechanistic details are still a matter of intense debate some 50 years after its first report (12Duysens L.N.M. Sweers H.E. Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists Studies on Microalgae and Photosynthetic Bacteria. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo, Japan1963: 352-372Google Scholar). Forward genetic analysis showed that qE requires one of two lhc-like gene products, PSBS and LHCSR, respectively, in plants and algae. These are essential for sensing pH of the thylakoid lumen (13Li X.P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K.

Kanamycin-resistant transgenic lines were selected and tested by immunoblot analysis using homemade polyclonal α-PpLHCSR antibody. Bacterial suspension in infiltration buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm acetosyringone, pH 5.6) at a final A600 of 0.8 was used for syringe infiltration of 5–6-week-old N. benthamiana plants. Five leaves were infiltrated for each plant and for each construct. The recombinant protein time course accumulation of P. patens LHCSR1 (PpLHCSR1) protein was estimated by immunoblotting total protein extract starting from a disk of infected leaves collected for 7 days after agroinfiltration and ground in loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 3% β-mercaptoethanol). Thylakoids were purified from N. tabacum and N. benthamiana leaves following a protocol for seed plants (26Bassi R. Simpson D.J. Chlorophyll-protein complexes of barley photosystem I.Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For separation of pigment-binding complex, 500 μg Chl of thylakoid membranes were washed with 5 mm EDTA and resuspended at a final concentration of 1 mg/mlChl in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Samples were then solubilized at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml Chl, adding 1.6% n-dodecyl α-d-maltopyranoside (α-DM) and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 and vortexing for 1 min. After 10 min of incubation on ice, thylakoid membranes were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate unsolubilized material. Fractionation occurred upon ultracentrifugation on a 0.1–1 m sucrose gradient containing 0.03% α-DM and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (22 h at 280,000 × g at 4 °C). Non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE was performed according to (27Peter G.F. Takeuchi T. Philip Thornber J.

The stacking and resolving gels contained, respectively, 3.5 (w/v) and 7% (w/v) acrylamide (38:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). Thylakoids concentrated at 1 mg/ml Chl were solubilized with 0.8% α-DM. 500 μg of Chl were loaded in each wide well for comparing LHCSR1-expressing (oeLHCSR1) plants with the corresponding wild type (WT). 30 mg of Chl of thylakoid membranes from oeLHCSR1 with histidine tail-expressing (oeLHCSR1 His tag) plants were washed with 5 mm EDTA and resuspended at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Samples were then solubilized with 1% α-DM and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate unsolubilized material. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel affinity column equilibrated with the same buffer, and the resin was washed with 2–3 column volumes of washing buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.03% α-DM). Further step elutions were performed by increasing the imidazole concentration (25, 50, and 250 mm). The pigment composition of the complexes was analyzed by fitting the spectrum of the 80% acetone-extracted pigments with the spectra of the individual pigments in acetone and by HPLC as described previously (28Gilmore A.M.

Samples collected from the sucrose gradients were analyzed by absorption spectroscopy using an SLM-Aminco DW-2000 (Aminco) spectrophotometer at room temperature. Spectra were also collected for native Chl-binding complexes after extraction from the acrylamide gel by grinding the slices in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.03% α-DM. SDS-PAGE analyses were performed as described (30Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). An acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 75:1 and a total concentration of acrylamide of 4.5 and 15% were used, respectively, for stacking and running gels. Urea (6 m) was also added into the running gel. Following SDS-PAGE, polypeptides were transferred onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) using a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad) and detected by homemade polyclonal antibodies. In vivo Chl fluorescence of N. tabacum leaf disks of WT and oeLHSCR1 plants was measured at room temperature on a FluorCam imaging fluorometer (Photon Systems Instruments) with saturating light at 4000 μmol m−2 s−1 and actinic light at 1200 μmol m−2 s−1. Before measurements, plants were dark-adapted for 40 min at room temperature. Parameters Fv/Fm and NPQ were calculated as (Fm − Fo)/Fm and (Fm − Fm′)/Fm′ (31Demmig-Adams B. Gilmore A.M.

Data are presented as means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. The full-length ORFs of LHCSR1 with or without thrombin-cleavable histidine tail (His tag) at the C terminus of the protein were introduced by LR recombination into the binary GATEWAY vector pK7WG2 under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The resulting vectors, named pK7WG2.LHCSR1 and pK7WG2.LHCSR1 His tag, were used for stable (25Horsch R.B. Klee H.J. Stachel S. Winans S.C. Nester E.W. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T.

N. benthamiana was used as host for transient expression (34Goodin M.M. Zaitlin D. Naidu R.A. Lommel S.A. Nicotiana benthamiana: its history and future as a model for plant-pathogen interactions.Mol. Plant. Microbe Interact. 2008; 21: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Five leaves of 5–6 week-old plants were agroinfiltrated. Upon infection, a time course analysis was performed by collecting leaf disks for 7 days postagroinfiltration (dpi) to identify the peak of recombinant protein accumulation. Total proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an α-PpLHCSR1 polyclonal antibody. α-CP43, a subunit of PSII core, was used as a loading control. Fig. 1 shows the time course analysis of PpLHCSR1 (Fig. 1A) and PpLHCSR1 His tag (Fig. 1B) expression in N. benthamiana. α-PpLHCSR1 antibody revealed a band at ∼23-kDa apparent molecular mass in N. benthamiana leaf disks, whereas two bands were detected in the WT P. patens sample, which contains both LHCSR1 and LHCSR2 (21Alboresi A. Gerotto C. Giacometti G.M. Bassi R. Morosinotto T. Physcomitrella patens mutants affected on heat dissipation clarify the evolution of photoprotection mechanisms upon land colonization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11128-11133Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The LHCSR1 signal had the same apparent molecular weight in both N. benthamiana and P. patens, implying that the maturation of the precursor recombinant protein in N. benthamiana occurred as in the homologous moss system. In the case of oeLHCSR1 His tag N. benthamiana plants, the molecular weight of LHCSR1 is slightly higher with respect to P. patens LHCSR1. This difference is due to the presence of the thrombin-cleavable histidine tail affecting the mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE. No reaction was observed in the untransformed WT N. benthamiana sample. In Fig. 1, C and D, the accumulation of PpLHCSR1 with and without His tag is shown. In both constructs, the protein was detectable at 2 dpi and reached a maximum at 4 dpi. Alternatively, we used N. tabacum cv. Petit Havana SR1 for stable transformation into the nuclear genome. Transgenic plants were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of leaf disks and in vitro regeneration of plants under kanamycin selection. About 80 regenerated plants were analyzed for each construct. Fig. 1E shows the accumulation of PpLHCSR1 protein by immunoblotting analysis in oeLHCSR1 plants of N. tabacum. Similar to results with N. benthamiana, the reaction in the WT moss had the same apparent molecular weight as the recombinant PpLHCSR1. PpLHCSR1 protein from oeLHCSR1 His tag plants showed slightly slower migration than LHCSR1 from oeLHCSR1 plants due to additional sequence encoding the tag and thrombin target site (Fig. 1F). The protein accumulation levels varied significantly between independently transformed lines, likely reflecting the positional effects of random insertion (35Krysan P.J. Young J.C. Jester P.J. Monson S. Copenhaver G. Preuss D. Sussman M.R. Characterization of T-DNA insertion sites in Arabidopsis thaliana and the implications for saturation mutagenesis.OMICS. 2002; 6: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein level was used to select T1 transgenic lines (elite lines) for a breeding program to reach homozygosis of the inserted transgene(s), which was initiated by self-crossing the best performing T1 oeLHCSR1 and oeLHCSR1 His tag transgenic plants. In the following paragraphs, the results obtained with T1 plants are reported. The intracellular localization of recombinant PpLHCSR1 was analyzed in N. benthamiana and N. tabacum plants. In mosses, LHCSR1 is encoded by the nuclear genome, translated in the cytoplasm, and targeted toward the chloroplast (36Stengel A. Soll J. Bölter B. Protein import into chloroplasts: new aspects of a well-known topic.Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The transit peptide is then removed, and the apoprotein co-insertionally assembles in the thylakoid membranes with Chl and carotenoids (37Hoober J. Eggink L. Assembly of light-harvesting complex II and biogenesis of thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts.Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 197-215Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To study the intracellular fate of the recombinant protein in Nicotiana sp., thylakoid membranes were purified from N. benthamiana-infected leaves 4 dpi and N. tabacum transgenic plants. Fig. 1G shows the results of immunoblotting analysis on thylakoid membranes using α-PpLHCSR antibody. LHCSR1 and LHCSR1 His tag recombinant proteins were detected in thylakoids of both N. benthamiana and N. tabacum as well as in thylakoids from WT P. patens but not in WT thylakoids of N. benthamiana and N. tabacum or in the lhcsr knock-out (KO) of P. patens, implying that Nicotiana sp. machinery is competent for the targeting of PpLHCSR1 into the thylakoid compartment. Next, we tested the aggregation state of recombinant tobacco-produced PpLHCSR1 as compared with the native P. patens LHCSR1 (22Pinnola A. Dall'Osto L. Gerotto C. Morosinotto T. Bassi R. Alboresi A. Zeaxanthin binds to light-harvesting complex stress-related protein to enhance nonphotochemical quenching in Physcomitrella patens.Plant Cell. 2013; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were solubilized with the mild detergent α-DM and loaded onto a sucrose gradient, which was centrifuged at 280,000 × g for ∼22 h. The separation pattern, consisting of seven green bands, was similar in WT and oeLHCSR1 N. benthamiana or N. tabacum plants. Bands were collected from the gradient and analyzed by absorption spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE to identify their pigment protein content and polypeptide composition. Fig. 2A shows the result of the sucrose gradient: in the upper part of the gradient, a yellow top band contained carotenoid-enriched free pigments (band 1 (B1)), monomeric LHCs (B2), trimeric LHCII (B3), and LHCII-CP29-CP24 complex (B4). In the central part of the gradient, PSII core complex was found (B5), whereas PSI-LHCI (B6) and PSII-LHCII supercomplexes (B7) migrated in the lower part of the gradient. The separation pattern was very similar in WT versus oeLHCSR1. Absorption spectra of B1 and B2 of oeLHCSR1 showed a red-shifted Qy absorption peak when compared with the corresponding fractions from WT (Fig. 3, A–D); because a red-shifted spectrum is a typical characteristic of LHCSR1 protein (20Bonente G. Ballottari M. Truong T.B. Morosinotto T. Ahn T.K. Fleming G.R. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R.

This characteristic was more evident in the case of N. benthamiana (Fig. 3A) where the Qy peak of B1 was shifted from 672.2 nm in WT to 677.7 nm in oeLHCSR1 but was less evident in N. tabacum plants (Fig. 3B). Absorption spectra of B2 also showed a small red shift of the Qy peak from 676.6 nm in WT to 677.7 nm in oeLHCSR1 of N. benthamiana but was almost absent in the case of N. tabacum (Fig. 3, C and D). No differences were found between the absorption spectra of WT and oeLHCSR1 of other bands (data not shown).FIGURE 3Absorption (Abs) spectra of fractions obtained from sucrose gradient.

On regulatory T cells, CD73 is necessary for immunosuppressive functions, and on Th17 cells CD73-generated adenosine exerts anti-inflammatory effects. However, the expression and function of CD73 in pro-inflammatory M1 and in immunosuppressive M2 macrophages is largely unknown. Here we show that CD73 expression and enzyme activity were induced in in vitro polarized pro-inflammatory human M(LPS+TNF) monocytes/macrophages, while CD73 was absent from immunosuppressive M(IL-4+M-CSF)-polarized macrophages. Inhibition of CD73 activity with the inhibitor AMPCP did not affect the polarization of human monocytes. In mice, CD73 was present on resident peritoneal macrophages. In striking contrast, elicited peritoneal macrophages remained CD73 negative regardless of their polarization towards either a pro-inflammatory M(LPS) or anti-inflammatory M(IL-4c) direction. Finally, the ability of peritoneal macrophages to polarize to pro- and anti-inflammatory cells was perfectly normal in CD73-deficient mice in vivo. These data indicate that, in contrast to other major leukocyte subpopulations, CD73 activity on macrophages does not play a major role in their polarization and that in mice host CD73 on any cell type is not required in vivo for peritoneal macrophage polarization towards either a pro- or an anti-inflammatory direction."

This study aimed to determine the osteogenic ability of nHA-CS osteo-induced bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) composites and to explore the relationship between bone formation and scaffold biodegradation. The nHA-CS osteo-induced BMSC composites (nHA-CS+cells group) and the nHA-CS scaffolds (nHA-CS group) were implanted into the femoral spatium intermusculare of SD rats. At 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks post-implantation, the rat femurs were scanned using computerized tomography (CT), and the CT values of the implants were measured and comparatively analyzed. The implants were then harvested and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson's trichrome staining, and the percentages of bone area, scaffold area and collagen area were compared between the two groups. The CT values of the implants were higher in the nHA-CS+cells group than the nHA-CS group at the same time points (P < 0.05). Histological analysis revealed that de novo bone and collagen formation in the pores of the scaffolds gradually increased from 2 weeks post-implantation in both groups and that the scaffold gradually degraded as bone formation proceeded. However, more de novo bone and collagen formation and scaffold degradation occurred in the nHA-CS+cells group than in the nHA-CS group at the same time points (P < 0.05). In conclusion, nHA-CS osteo-induced BMSC composites are promising bone tissue engineering substitutes, and osteo-induced BMSCs can significantly enhance the osteogenic ability and play an active role in the degradation of nHA-CS scaffolds on par with bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W1925894491,"Litchi is an important fruit tree in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. However, there is widespread confusion regarding litchi cultivar nomenclature and detailed information of genetic relationships among litchi germplasm is unclear. In the present study, the potential of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for the identification of 96 representative litchi accessions and their genetic relationships in China was evaluated using 155 SNPs that were evenly spaced across litchi genome. Ninety SNPs with minor allele frequencies above 0.05 and a good genotyping success rate were used for further analysis. A relatively high level of genetic variation was observed among litchi accessions, as quantified by the expected heterozygosity (He = 0.305). The SNP based multilocus matching identified two synonymous groups, 'Heiye' and 'Wuye', and 'Chengtuo' and 'Baitangli 1'. A subset of 14 SNPs was sufficient to distinguish all the non-redundant litchi genotypes, and these SNPs were proven to be highly stable by repeated analyses of a selected group of cultivars. Unweighted pair-group method of arithmetic averages (UPGMA) cluster analysis divided the litchi accessions analyzed into four main groups, which corresponded to the traits of extremely early-maturing, early-maturing, middle-maturing, and late-maturing, indicating that the fruit maturation period should be considered as the primary criterion for litchi taxonomy. Two subpopulations were detected among litchi accessions by STRUCTURE analysis, and accessions with extremely early- and late-maturing traits showed membership coefficients above 0.99 for Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, respectively. Accessions with early- and middle-maturing traits were identified as admixture forms with varying levels of membership shared between the two clusters, indicating their hybrid origin during litchi domestication. The results of this study will benefit litchi germplasm conservation programs and facilitate maximum genetic gains in litchi breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W1167896338,"Polyglutamine expansion is a hallmark of nine neurodegenerative diseases, with protein aggregation intrinsically linked to disease progression. Although polyglutamine expansion accelerates protein aggregation, the misfolding process is frequently instigated by flanking domains. For example, polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-3 allosterically triggers the aggregation of the catalytic Josephin domain. The molecular mechanism that underpins this allosteric aggregation trigger remains to be determined. Here, we establish that polyglutamine expansion increases the molecular mobility of two juxtaposed helices critical to ataxin-3 deubiquitinase activity. Within one of these helices, we identified a highly amyloidogenic sequence motif that instigates aggregation and forms the core of the growing fibril. Critically, by mutating residues within this key region, we decrease local structural fluctuations to slow ataxin-3 aggregation. This provides significant insight, down to the molecular level, into how polyglutamine expansion drives aggregation and explains the positive correlation between polyglutamine tract length, protein aggregation, and disease severity.

https://openalex.org/W2160969230,"The rapid expansion of the use of passive acoustic telemetry technologies has facilitated unprecedented opportunities for studying the behavior of marine organisms in their natural environment. This technological advance would greatly benefit from the parallel development of dedicated methodologies accounting for the variety of timescales involved in the remote detection of tagged animals related to instrumental, environmental and behavioral events. In this paper we propose a methodological framework for estimating the site fidelity (“residence times”) of acoustic tagged animals at different timescales, based on the survival analysis of continuous residence times recorded at multiple receivers. Our approach is validated through modeling and applied on two distinct datasets obtained from a small coastal pelagic species (bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus) and a large, offshore pelagic species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares), which show very distinct spatial scales of behavior. The methodological framework proposed herein allows estimating the most appropriate temporal scale for processing passive acoustic telemetry data depending on the scientific question of interest. Our method provides residence times free of the bias inherent to environmental and instrumental noise that can be used to study the small scale behavior of acoustic tagged animals. At larger timescales, it can effectively identify residence times that encompass the diel behavioral excursions of fish out of the acoustic detection range. This study provides a systematic framework for the analysis of passive acoustic telemetry data that can be employed for the comparative study of different species and study sites. The same methodology can be used each time discrete records of animal detections of any nature are employed for estimating the site fidelity of an animal at different timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2114119312,"Around 1% of angiosperms are parasitic plants. Their growth and development solely or partly depend on host plants from which they extract water, nutrients, and other molecules using a parasitic plant-specific organ, the haustorium. Strong depletion of nutrients can result in serious growth retardation and in some cases, death of the hosts. The genus Cuscuta (dodder) comprises about 200 holoparasitic species occurring on all continents. Their seedlings have no roots and cotyledons but are only string-like hypocotyls. When they contact suitable host plants, haustoria are formed and thereafter seedlings rapidly develop into vigorously growing branches without roots and leaves. This highly specialized lifestyle suggests that Cuscuta plants likely have unique physiology in development and stress responses. Using germination and seedling growth assays, we show that C. australis seeds and seedlings are highly insensitive to abscisic acid (ABA). Transcriptome analysis and protein sequence alignment with Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice homologs revealed that C. australis most likely consists of only four functional ABA receptors. Given that Cuscuta plants are no longer severely challenged by drought stress, we hypothesize that the ABA-mediated drought resistance pathway in Cuscuta spp. might have had degenerated over time during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1797352249,"Quantification of spatial and temporal changes in forest cover is an essential component of forest monitoring programs. Due to its cloud free capability, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an ideal source of information on forest dynamics in countries with near-constant cloud-cover. However, few studies have investigated the use of SAR for forest cover estimation in landscapes with highly sparse and fragmented forest cover. In this study, the potential use of L-band SAR for forest cover estimation in two regions (Longford and Sligo) in Ireland is investigated and compared to forest cover estimates derived from three national (Forestry2010, Prime2, National Forest Inventory), one pan-European (Forest Map 2006) and one global forest cover (Global Forest Change) product. Two machine-learning approaches (Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees) are evaluated. Both Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees classification accuracies were high (98.1–98.5%), with differences between the two classifiers being minimal (<0.5%). Increasing levels of post classification filtering led to a decrease in estimated forest area and an increase in overall accuracy of SAR-derived forest cover maps. All forest cover products were evaluated using an independent validation dataset. For the Longford region, the highest overall accuracy was recorded with the Forestry2010 dataset (97.42%) whereas in Sligo, highest overall accuracy was obtained for the Prime2 dataset (97.43%), although accuracies of SAR-derived forest maps were comparable. Our findings indicate that spaceborne radar could aid inventories in regions with low levels of forest cover in fragmented landscapes. The reduced accuracies observed for the global and pan-continental forest cover maps in comparison to national and SAR-derived forest maps indicate that caution should be exercised when applying these datasets for national reporting."
https://openalex.org/W1801017172,"Background Anorectal Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) is frequently diagnosed in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in women, but it is unknown whether these infections are comparable in clinical impact and transmission potential. Quantifying bacterial load and identifying determinants associated with high bacterial load could provide more insight. Methods We selected a convenience sample of MSM who reported anal sex (n = 90) and women with concurrent urogenital/anorectal chlamydia who reported anal sex (n = 51) or did not report anal sex (n = 61) from the South Limburg Public Health Service’s STI unit. Bacterial load (Chlamydia/ml) was quantified for all samples and log transformed for analyses. Samples with an unquantifiable human leukocyte antigen (n = 9) were excluded from analyses, as they were deemed inadequately sampled. Results The mean log anorectal chlamydia load (3.50) was similar for MSM and women who reported having anal sex (3.80, P = 0.21). The anorectal chlamydia load was significantly higher in these groups than in women who did not report having anal sex (2.76, P = 0.001). Detectable load values ranged from 1.81–6.32 chlamydia/ml for MSM, 1.74–7.33 chlamydia/ml for women who reported having anal sex and 1.84–6.31 chlamydia/ml for women who did not report having anal sex. Symptoms and several other determinants were not associated with anorectal chlamydia load. Conclusions Women who did not report anal sex had lower anorectal loads, but they were within a similar range to the other two groups. Anorectal chlamydia load was comparable between MSM and women who reported anal sex, suggesting similar transmission potential."
https://openalex.org/W2160976645,"Hypothyroidism is a complex clinical condition found in both humans and dogs, thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In this study we present a multi-breed analysis of predisposing genetic risk factors for hypothyroidism in dogs using three high-risk breeds--the Gordon Setter, Hovawart and the Rhodesian Ridgeback. Using a genome-wide association approach and meta-analysis, we identified a major hypothyroidism risk locus shared by these breeds on chromosome 12 (p = 2.1x10(-11)). Further characterisation of the candidate region revealed a shared ~167 kb risk haplotype (4,915,018-5,081,823 bp), tagged by two SNPs in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. This breed-shared risk haplotype includes three genes (LHFPL5, SRPK1 and SLC26A8) and does not extend to the dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class II gene cluster located in the vicinity. These three genes have not been identified as candidate genes for hypothyroid disease previously, but have functions that could potentially contribute to the development of the disease. Our results implicate the potential involvement of novel genes and pathways for the development of canine hypothyroidism, raising new possibilities for screening, breeding programmes and treatments in dogs. This study may also contribute to our understanding of the genetic etiology of human hypothyroid disease, which is one of the most common endocrine disorders in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1936720378,"To identify novel susceptibility variants for osteoporosis in Korean postmenopausal women, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of 1180 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in 405 individuals with osteoporosis and 722 normal controls of the Korean Association Resource cohort. A logistic regression analysis revealed 72 nsSNPs that showed a significant association with osteoporosis (p<0.05). The top 10 nsSNPs showing the lowest p-values (p = 5.2×10-4–8.5×10-3) were further studied to investigate their effects at the protein level. Based on the results of an in silico prediction of the protein’s functional effect based on amino acid alterations and a sequence conservation evaluation of the amino acid residues at the positions of the nsSNPs among orthologues, we selected one nsSNP in the SQRDL gene (rs1044032, SQRDL I264T) as a meaningful genetic variant associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. To assess whether the SQRDL I264T variant played a functional role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, we examined the in vitro effect of the nsSNP on bone remodeling. Overexpression of the SQRDL I264T variant in the preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization, and the mRNA expression of osteoblastogenesis markers, Runx2, Sp7, and Bglap genes, whereas the SQRDL wild type had no effect or a negative effect on osteoblast differentiation. Overexpression of the SQRDL I264T variant did not affect osteoclast differentiation of the primary-cultured monocytes. The known effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on bone remodeling may explain the findings of the current study, which demonstrated the functional role of the H2S-catalyzing enzyme SQRDL I264T variant in osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion, the results of the statistical and experimental analyses indicate that the SQRDL I264T nsSNP may be a significant susceptibility variant for osteoporosis in Korean postmenopausal women that is involved in osteoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1940375340,"Species at risk with secretive breeding behaviours, low densities, and wide geographic range pose a significant challenge to conservation actions because population trends are difficult to detect. Such is the case with the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), a seabird listed as 'Threatened' by the Species at Risk Act in Canada largely due to the loss of its old growth forest nesting habitat. We report the first estimates of population trend of Marbled Murrelets in Canada derived from a monitoring program that uses marine radar to detect birds as they enter forest watersheds during 923 dawn surveys at 58 radar monitoring stations within the six Marbled Murrelet Conservation Regions on coastal British Columbia, Canada, 1996-2013. Temporal trends in radar counts were analyzed with a hierarchical Bayesian multivariate modeling approach that controlled for variation in tilt of the radar unit and day of year, included year-specific deviations from the overall trend ('year effects'), and allowed for trends to be estimated at three spatial scales. A negative overall trend of -1.6%/yr (95% credibility interval: -3.2%, 0.01%) indicated moderate evidence for a coast-wide decline, although trends varied strongly among the six conservation regions. Negative annual trends were detected in East Vancouver Island (-9%/yr) and South Mainland Coast (-3%/yr) Conservation Regions. Over a quarter of the year effects were significantly different from zero, and the estimated standard deviation in common-shared year effects between sites within each region was about 50% per year. This large common-shared interannual variation in counts may have been caused by regional movements of birds related to changes in marine conditions that affect the availability of prey."
https://openalex.org/W2274389043,"The α-kinases are a widely expressed family of serine/threonine protein kinases that exhibit no sequence identity with conventional eukaryotic protein kinases. In this report, we provide new information on the catalytic properties of the α-kinase domain of Dictyostelium myosin-II heavy chain kinase-A (termed A-CAT). Crystallization of A-CAT in the presence of MgATP yielded structures with AMP or adenosine in the catalytic cleft together with a phosphorylated Asp-766 residue. The results show that the β- and α-phosphoryl groups are transferred either directly or indirectly to the catalytically essential Asp-766. Biochemical assays confirmed that A-CAT hydrolyzed ATP, ADP, and AMP with kcat values of 1.9, 0.6, and 0.32 min(-1), respectively, and showed that A-CAT can use ADP to phosphorylate peptides and proteins. Binding assays using fluorescent 2'/3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) analogs of ATP and ADP yielded Kd values for ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine of 20 ± 3, 60 ± 20, 160 ± 60, and 45 ± 15 μM, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Glu-713, Leu-716, and Lys-645, all of which interact with the adenine base, were critical for nucleotide binding. Mutation of the highly conserved Gln-758, which chelates a nucleotide-associated Mg(2+) ion, eliminated catalytic activity, whereas loss of the highly conserved Lys-722 and Arg-592 decreased kcat values for kinase and ATPase activities by 3-6-fold. Mutation of Asp-663 impaired kinase activity to a much greater extent than ATPase, indicating a specific role in peptide substrate binding, whereas mutation of Gln-768 doubled ATPase activity, suggesting that it may act to exclude water from the active site."

The PPS after EGFR-TKI treatment was 9.1 months, and survival after the termination of EGFR-TKI treatment in those patients treated with second-line chemotherapy was 13.9 months. The site of relapse was investigated and PFS in EGFR-TKI-treated patients with relapse in the brain (11.6 months) showed a trend toward a longer PFS compared with patients with relapse at other sites (8.2 months). The median PPS after EGFR-TKI treatment also showed the same trend in each group (12.9 and 9.2 months, respectively).The PPS after EGFR-TKI treatment failure was 9.1 months, while the survival of patients who underwent second-line chemotherapy after the termination of EGFR-TKI treatment was 13.9 months, comparable with the overall survival of EGFR mutation-negative patients, as previously reported. The prognosis of these NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations varied according to the sites of recurrence after first-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Of particular note was the prognosis of patients with brain metastases, which tended to be better than that of patients with metastases to other sites."
https://openalex.org/W1738301510,"Several diseases have common risk factors. The joint modeling of disease outcomes within a spatial statistical context may provide more insight on the interaction of diseases both at individual and at regional level. Spatial joint modeling allows for studying of the relationship between diseases and also between regions under study. One major approach for joint spatial modeling is the multivariate conditional autoregressive approach. In this approach, it is assumed that all the covariates in the study have linear effects on the multiple response variables. In this study, we relax this linearity assumption and allow some covariates to have nonlinear effects using the penalized regression splines. This model was used to jointly model the spatial variation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus-type 2 (HSV-2) among women in Kenya. The model was applied to HIV and HSV-2 prevalence data among women aged 15–49 years in Kenya, derived from the 2007 Kenya AIDS indicator survey. A full Bayesian approach was used and the models were implemented in WinBUGS software. Both diseases showed significant spatial variation with highest disease burdens occurring around the Lake Victoria region. There was a nonlinear association between age of an individual and HIV and HSV-2 infection. The peak age for HIV was around 30 years while that of HSV-2 was about 40 years. A positive significant spatial correlation between HIV and HSV-2 was observed with a correlation of 0.6831(95% CI: 0.3859, 0.871)."
https://openalex.org/W1913864807,"Inflammasome complexes form upon interaction of Nod Like Receptor (NLR) proteins with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAPMS) inside the cytosol. Stimulation of a subset of inflammasome receptors including NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 triggers formation of the micrometer-sized spherical supramolecular complex called the ASC speck. The ASC speck is thought to be the platform of inflammasome activity, but the reason why a supramolecular complex is preferred against oligomeric platforms remains elusive. We observed that a set of cytosolic proteins, including the model antigen ovalbumin, tend to co-aggregate on the ASC speck. We suggest that co-aggregation of antigenic proteins on the ASC speck during intracellular infection might be instrumental in antigen presentation."
https://openalex.org/W1917823070,"To assess functional importance of the residues in the amino- and carboxyl-termini of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone in the mud crab Scylla olivacea (Sco-CHH), both wild-type and point-mutated CHH peptides were produced with an amidated C-terminal end. Spectral analyses of circular dichroism, chromatographic retention time, and mass spectrometric analysis of the recombinant peptides indicate that they were close in conformation to native CHH and were produced with the intended substitutions. The recombinant peptides were subsequently used for an in vivo hyperglycemic assay. Two mutants (R13A and I69A rSco-CHH) completely lacked hyperglycemic activity, with temporal profiles similar to that of vehicle control. Temporal profiles of hyperglycemic responses elicited by 4 mutants (I2A, F3A, D12A, and D60A Sco-CHH) were different from that elicited by wild-type Sco-CHH; I2A was unique in that it exhibited significantly higher hyperglycemic activity, whereas the remaining 3 mutants showed lower activity. Four mutants (D4A, Q51A, E54A, and V72A rSco-CHH) elicited hyperglycemic responses with temporal profiles similar to those evoked by wild-type Sco-CHH. In contrast, the glycine-extended version of V72A rSco-CHH (V72A rSco-CHH-Gly) completely lost hyperglycemic activity. By comparing our study with previous ones of ion-transport peptide (ITP) and molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) using deleted or point-mutated mutants, detail discussion is made regarding functionally important residues that are shared by both CHH and ITP (members of Group I of the CHH family), and those that discriminate CHH from ITP, and Group-I from Group-II peptides. Conclusions summarized in the present study provide insights into understanding of how functional diversification occurred within a peptide family of multifunctional members."
https://openalex.org/W2223801926,"An inefficient immune response against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is related to the pathogenesis of a subgroup of classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHL). Some EBV immune-evasion mechanisms target HLA presentation, including the non-classical HLA-E molecule. HLA-E can be recognized by T cells via the TCR, and it also regulates natural killer (NK) cell signaling through the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptor. Some evidences indicate that EBV-infected B-cells promote the proliferation of NK subsets bearing CD94/NKG2A, suggesting a relevant function of these cells in EBV control. Variations in CD94/NKG2A-HLA-E interactions could affect NK cell-mediated immunity and, consequently, play a role in EBV-driven transformation and lymphomagenesis. The two most common HLA-E alleles, E*01:01 and E*01:03, differ by a single amino acid change that modifies the molecule function. We hypothesized that the functional differences in these variants might participate in the pathogenicity of EBV.We studied two series of cHL patients, both with EBV-positive and-negative cases, and a cohort of unrelated controls, to assess the impact of HLA-E variants on EBV-related cHL susceptibility.We found that the genotypes with at least one copy of E*01:01 (i.e., E*01:01 homozygous and heterozygous) were underrepresented among cHL patients from both series compared to controls (72.6% and 71.6% vs 83%, p = 0.001). After stratification by EBV status, we found low rates of E*01:01-carriers mainly among EBV-positive cases (67.6%). These reduced frequencies are seen independently of other factors such as age, gender, HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02, HLA alleles positively and negatively associated with the disease (adjusted OR = 0.4, p = 0.001). Furthermore, alleles from both HLA loci exert a cumulative effect on EBV-associated cHL susceptibility.These results indicate that E*01:01 is a novel protective genetic factor in EBV-associated cHL and support a role for HLA-E recognition on the control of EBV infection and lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2286625625,"Objective To examine the adjusted associations of fruit consumption and vegetable consumption with the Framingham score and its components in the non-Western setting of Southern China, considering health status. Method Linear regression was used to assess the cross-sectional associations of fruit and vegetable consumption with the Framingham score and its components, among 19,518 older Chinese (≥50 years) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study in Southern China (2003–2006), and whether these differed by health status. Results The association of fruit consumption with the Framingham score varied by health status (P-value<0.001), but not vegetable consumption (P-value 0.51). Fruit consumption was associated with a lower Framingham score (-0.04 per portions/day, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.08 to -0.004) among participants in poor health, adjusted for age, sex, recruitment phase, socio-economic position and lifestyle. However, similarly adjusted, fruit consumption was associated with a higher Framingham score (0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.09) among participants in good health, perhaps due to a positive association of fruit consumption with fasting glucose. Similarly adjusted, vegetable consumption was associated with a higher Framingham score (0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05) among all participants, with no difference by health status. Conclusion This large study from a non-western setting found that fruit and vegetable consumption was barely associated with the Framingham score, or major CVD risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2096549742,"Identification of catalytic residues can help unveil interesting attributes of enzyme function for various therapeutic and industrial applications. Based on their biochemical roles, the number of catalytic residues and sequence lengths of enzymes vary. This article describes a prediction approach (PINGU) for such a scenario. It uses models trained using physicochemical properties and evolutionary information of 650 non-redundant enzymes (2136 catalytic residues) in a support vector machines architecture. Independent testing on 200 non-redundant enzymes (683 catalytic residues) in predefined prediction settings, i.e., with non-catalytic per catalytic residue ranging from 1 to 30, suggested that the prediction approach was highly sensitive and specific, i.e., 80% or above, over the incremental challenges. To learn more about the discriminatory power of PINGU in real scenarios, where the prediction challenge is variable and susceptible to high false positives, the best model from independent testing was used on 60 diverse enzymes. Results suggested that PINGU was able to identify most catalytic residues and non-catalytic residues properly with 80% or above accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The effect of false positives on precision was addressed in this study by application of predicted ligand-binding residue information as a post-processing filter. An overall improvement of 20% in F-measure and 0.138 in Correlation Coefficient with 16% enhanced precision could be achieved. On account of its encouraging performance, PINGU is hoped to have eventual applications in boosting enzyme engineering and novel drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1907041088,"Menopause is a period that may predispose one to a decrease in muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and quality of life. A study was carried out to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of physical activity among women displaying symptoms of menopause. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on data from a six-month randomised controlled trial (n = 151). The women in the intervention group engaged in an unsupervised session of at least 50 minutes of physical activity four times a week. The control group continued their physical activity as before. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in terms of maximal oxygen consumption, lean muscle mass, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. A bootstrap technique was utilised to estimate uncertainty around the point estimate for ICER associated with the intervention. The mean total cost in the intervention group was €1,307 (SEM: €311) and in the control group was €1,253 (SEM: €279, p = 0.10) per person. The mean intervention cost was €208 per person. After six months of the behaviour-change intervention, the ICER was €63 for a 1 ml/kg/min improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, the additional cost per one-gram increase in lean muscle mass was €126, and the cost per QALY gained was €46. According to the findings, physical activity among menopausal women was cost-effective for cardiorespiratory fitness, for lean muscle mass, and for QALYs gained, since the intervention was more effective than the actions within the control group and the additional effects of physical activity were gained at a very low price. From the societal perspective, the intervention used may promote ability to work and thereby save on further costs associated with early retirement or disability pension if the physical-activity level remains at least the same as during the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1909713665,"Adenosine is a powerful trigger for ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Myocardial ischemia induces intracellular and extracellular ATP degradation to adenosine, which then activates adenosine receptors and elicits cardioprotection. Conventionally extracellular adenosine formation by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) during ischemia was thought to be negligible compared to the massive intracellular production, but controversial reports in the past demand further evaluation. In this study we evaluated the relevance of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) for infarct size reduction by ischemic preconditioning in in vitro and in vivo mouse models of myocardial infarction, comparing CD73-/- and wild type (WT) mice.3x5 minutes of IPC induced equal cardioprotection in isolated saline perfused hearts of wild type (WT) and CD73-/- mice, reducing control infarct sizes after 20 minutes of ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion from 46 ± 6.3% (WT) and 56.1 ± 7.6% (CD73-/-) to 26.8 ± 4.7% (WT) and 25.6 ± 4.7% (CD73-/-). Coronary venous adenosine levels measured after IPC stimuli by high-pressure liquid chromatography showed no differences between WT and CD73-/- hearts. Pharmacological preconditioning of WT hearts with adenosine, given at the measured venous concentration, was evenly cardioprotective as conventional IPC. In vivo, 4x5 minutes of IPC reduced control infarct sizes of 45.3 ± 8.9% (WT) and 40.5 ± 8% (CD73-/-) to 26.3 ± 8% (WT) and 22.6 ± 6.6% (CD73-/-) respectively, eliciting again equal cardioprotection. The extent of IPC-induced cardioprotection in male and female mice was identical.The infarct size limiting effects of IPC in the mouse heart in vitro and in vivo are not significantly affected by genetic inactivation of CD73. The ecto-5'-nucleotidase derived extracellular formation of adenosine does not contribute substantially to adenosine's well known cardioprotective effect in early phase ischemic preconditioning."
https://openalex.org/W1801294163,"The unique programmability of nucleic acids offers alternative in constructing excitable and functional nanostructures. This work introduces an autonomous protocol to construct DNA Tetris shapes (L-Shape, B-Shape, T-Shape and I-Shape) using modular DNA blocks. The protocol exploits the rich number of sequence combinations available from the nucleic acid alphabets, thus allowing for diversity to be applied in designing various DNA nanostructures. Instead of a deterministic set of sequences corresponding to a particular design, the protocol promotes a large pool of DNA shapes that can assemble to conform to any desired structures. By utilising evolutionary programming in the design stage, DNA blocks are subjected to processes such as sequence insertion, deletion and base shifting in order to enrich the diversity of the resulting shapes based on a set of cascading filters. The optimisation algorithm allows mutation to be exerted indefinitely on the candidate sequences until these sequences complied with all the four fitness criteria. Generated candidates from the protocol are in agreement with the filter cascades and thermodynamic simulation. Further validation using gel electrophoresis indicated the formation of the designed shapes. Thus, supporting the plausibility of constructing DNA nanostructures in a more hierarchical, modular, and interchangeable manner."
https://openalex.org/W1814374461,"Background Although coronary revascularisation by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are common procedures, little is known regarding disability pension (DP) at the time of coronary revascularisation and its association with mortality. The aim was to investigate the five-year mortality following a first coronary revascularisation among women and men on DP, compared with those not on DP at the time of intervention, accounting for socio-demographic and medical factors. Material and Methods A nationwide prospective population-based cohort study was conducted, using national registers including 70,040 patients (80% men), aged 30–64 years, with a first CABG (n = 24,987; 36%) or PCI (n = 45,053; 64%) during 1994–2006 in Sweden, who were alive 30 days after the intervention. The main outcome was all-cause and cause-specific mortality within five years or through 31 December 2006, following CABG and PCI, and the exposure was DP at the time of a first coronary revascularisation. Information on DP, patient characteristics, date and cause of death was obtained from nationwide registers. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcome were estimated, using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. All analyses were stratified by type of intervention and gender. Findings Four percent died following coronary revascularisation. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death (54%), followed by neoplasms (25%). Regardless of type of intervention, gender and after multivariable adjustments, patients on DP had a higher HR for five-year mortality compared with those not on DP at time of revascularisation (CABG: women HR 2.14; 95% CI 1.59–2.89, men HR 2.09; 1.84–2.38, PCI: women HR 2.25; 1.78–2.83, men HR 1.95; 1.72–2.21). Young women on DP at the time of PCI had a substantially higher HR (HR 4.10; 95% CI: 2.25–7.48). Conclusion Patients on DP at the time of first coronary revascularisation had a higher five-year risk of mortality compared with those not on DP."
https://openalex.org/W1879637873,"Benthic bivalves are important links between primary production and consumers, and are essential intermediates in the flow of energy through estuarine systems. However, information on the diet of filter feeding bivalves in estuarine ecosystems is uncertain, as estuarine waters contain particulate matter from a range of sources and as bivalves are opportunistic feeders. We surveyed bivalves at different distances from the creek mouth at the Yangtze estuarine marsh in winter and summer, and analyzed trophic dynamics using stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) techniques. Different bivalve species had different spatial distributions in the estuary. Glauconome chinensis mainly occurred in marshes near the creek mouth, while Sinonovacula constricta preferred the creek. Differences were found in the diets of different species. S. constricta consumed more diatoms and bacteria than G. chinensis, while G. chinensis assimilated more macrophyte material. FA markers showed that plants contributed the most (38.86 ± 4.25%) to particular organic matter (POM) in summer, while diatoms contributed the most (12.68 ± 1.17%) during winter. Diatoms made the largest contribution to the diet of S. constricta in both summer (24.73 ± 0.44%) and winter (25.51 ± 0.59%), and plants contributed no more than 4%. This inconsistency indicates seasonal changes in food availability and the active feeding habits of the bivalve. Similar FA profiles for S. constricta indicated that the bivalve had a similar diet composition at different sites, while different δ13C results suggested the diet was derived from different carbon sources (C4 plant Spartina alterniflora and C3 plant Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) at different sites. Species-specific and temporal and/or spatial variability in bivalve feeding may affect their ecological functions in intertidal marshes, which should be considered in the study of food webs and material flows in estuarine ecosystems."
