https://openalex.org/W3214683033,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission leads to the emergence of variants, including the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of concern that is causing a new wave of infections and has become globally dominant. We show that these variants dampen the in vitro potency of vaccine-elicited serum neutralizing antibodies and provide a structural framework for describing their immune evasion. Mutations in the B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and Delta spike glycoproteins abrogate recognition by several monoclonal antibodies via alteration of key antigenic sites, including remodeling of the Delta amino-terminal domain. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding affinities of the Kappa and Delta receptor binding domains are comparable to the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, whereas B.1.617.2+ (Delta+) exhibits markedly reduced affinity."
https://openalex.org/W3211455418,"Mesothelioma is a rare and fatal cancer with limited therapeutic options until the recent approval of combination immune checkpoint blockade. Here we report the results of the phase 2 PrE0505 trial ( NCT02899195 ) of the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy for 55 patients with previously untreated, unresectable pleural mesothelioma. The primary endpoint was overall survival compared to historical control with cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy; secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety, progression-free survival and biomarkers of response. The combination of durvalumab with chemotherapy met the pre-specified primary endpoint, reaching a median survival of 20.4 months versus 12.1 months with historical control. Treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with known side effects of chemotherapy, and all adverse events due to immunotherapy were grade 2 or lower. Integrated genomic and immune cell repertoire analyses revealed that a higher immunogenic mutation burden coupled with a more diverse T cell repertoire was linked to favorable clinical outcome. Structural genome-wide analyses showed a higher degree of genomic instability in responding tumors of epithelioid histology. Patients with germline alterations in cancer predisposing genes, especially those involved in DNA repair, were more likely to achieve long-term survival. Our findings indicate that concurrent durvalumab with platinum-based chemotherapy has promising clinical activity and that responses are driven by the complex genomic background of malignant pleural mesothelioma."
https://openalex.org/W3212896089,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is crucial for FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and essential for autoantibody production by B cells in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Fenebrutinib, an orally administered, potent, highly selective, reversible BTK inhibitor, may be effective in CSU. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial (EudraCT ID 2016-004624-35 ) randomized 93 adults with antihistamine-refractory CSU to 50 mg daily, 150 mg daily and 200 mg twice daily of fenebrutinib or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in urticaria activity score over 7 d (UAS7) at week 8. Secondary end points were the change from baseline in UAS7 at week 4 and the proportion of patients well-controlled (UAS7 ≤ 6) at week 8. Fenebrutinib efficacy in patients with type IIb autoimmunity and effects on IgG-anti-FcεRI were exploratory end points. Safety was also evaluated. The primary end point was met, with dose-dependent improvements in UAS7 at week 8 occurring at 200 mg twice daily and 150 mg daily, but not at 50 mg daily of fenebrutinib versus placebo. Asymptomatic, reversible grade 2 and 3 liver transaminase elevations occurred in the fenebrutinib 150 mg daily and 200 mg twice daily groups (2 patients each). Fenebrutinib diminished disease activity in patients with antihistamine-refractory CSU, including more patients with refractory type IIb autoimmunity. These results support the potential use of BTK inhibition in antihistamine-refractory CSU."

It entails a homology search step, carried out along a conserved RecA/Rad51-ssDNA filament assembled on each DSB end. Whether, how and to what extent a DSB impacts chromatin folding, and how this (re)organization in turns influences the homology search process, remain ill-defined. Here we characterize two layers of spatial chromatin reorganization following DSB formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although cohesin folds chromosomes into cohesive arrays of ~20-kb-long chromatin loops as cells arrest in G2/M, the DSB-flanking regions interact locally in a resection- and 9-1-1 clamp-dependent manner, independently of cohesin, Mec1ATR, Rad52 and Rad51. This local structure blocks cohesin progression, constraining the DSB region at the base of a loop. Functionally, cohesin promotes DSB–dsDNA interactions and donor identification in cis, while inhibiting them in trans. This study identifies multiple direct and indirect ways by which cohesin regulates homology search during recombinational DNA repair. Piazza et al. report that following double-strand break (DSB) formation in S. cerevisiae, cohesin at DSBs facilitates local homology search during repair by homologous recombination, while suppressing DSB contacts with genome-wide double-strand DNAs."

https://openalex.org/W3211602234,"Publications involving fluorescent microscopy images generally contain many panels with split channels, merged images, scale bars and label text. Similar layouts of panels are used when displaying other microscopy images, electron micrographs, photographs, and other images. Assembling and editing these figures with even spacing, consistent font, text position, accurate scale bars, and other features can be tedious and time consuming. In order to save time, I have created a toolset and ImageJ Plugin called QuickFigures. QuickFigures includes many helpful features that streamline the process of creating, aligning, and editing scientific figures. Those features include tools that automatically create split channel figures from a region of interest (""Quick Figure"" button and ""Inset Tool""), layouts that make it easy to rearrange panels, multiple tools to align objects, and ""Figure Format"" menu options that help a user ensure that large numbers of figures have consistent appearance. QuickFigures was compared to previous tools by measuring the amount of time needed for a user to create a figure using each software (QuickFigures, OMERO.figure. EZFig, FigureJ and PowerPoint). QuickFigures significantly reduced the amount of time required to create a figure. The toolsets were also compared by checking each software against a list of features. QuickFigures had the most extensive set of features. Therefore, QuickFigures is an advantageous alternative to traditional methods of constructing scientific figures. After a user has saved time by creating their work in QuickFigures, the figures can be exported to a variety of formats including PowerPoint, PDF, SVG, PNG, TIFF and Adobe Illustrator. Export was successfully tested for each file format and object type. Exported objects and text are editable in their target software, making them suitable for sharing with collaborators. The software is free, open source and can be installed easily."
https://openalex.org/W3211744212,"Infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 and their mitigation measures can exacerbate underlying gender disparities, particularly among adolescents and young adults in densely populated urban settings.An existing cohort of youth ages 16-26 in Nairobi, Kenya completed a phone-based survey in August-October 2020 (n = 1217), supplemented by virtual focus group discussions and interviews with youth and stakeholders, to examine economic, health, social, and safety experiences during COVID-19, and gender disparities therein.COVID-19 risk perception was high with a gender differential favoring young women (95.5% vs. 84.2%; p<0.001); youth described mixed concern and challenges to prevention. During COVID-19, gender symmetry was observed in constrained access to contraception among contraceptive users (40.4% men; 34.6% women) and depressive symptoms (21.8% men; 24.3% women). Gender disparities rendered young women disproportionately unable to meet basic economic needs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.21; p<0.05) and in need of healthcare during the pandemic (aOR = 1.59; p<0.001). At a bivariate level, women had lower full decisional control to leave the house (40.0% vs. 53.2%) and less consistent access to safe, private internet (26.1% vs. 40.2%), while men disproportionately experienced police interactions (60.1%, 55.2% of which included extortion). Gender-specific concerns for women included menstrual hygiene access challenges (52.0%), increased reliance on transactional partnerships, and gender-based violence, with 17.3% reporting past-year partner violence and 3.0% non-partner sexual violence. Qualitative results contextualize the mental health impact of economic disruption and isolation, and, among young women, privacy constraints.Youth and young adults face gendered impacts of COVID-19, reflecting both underlying disparities and the pandemic's economic and social shock. Economic, health and technology-based supports must ensure equitable access for young women. Gender-responsive recovery efforts are necessary and must address the unique needs of youth."
https://openalex.org/W3211685055,"Urea is a byproduct of the urea cycle in metabolism and is excreted through urine and sweat. Ammonia, which is toxic at low levels, is converted to the safe storage form of urea, which represents the largest efflux of nitrogen from many organisms. Urea is an important nitrogen source in agriculture, is added to many industrial products, and is a large component in wastewater. The enzyme urease hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and bicarbonate. This reaction is microbially mediated in soils, hydroponic solutions, and wastewater recycling and is catalyzed in vivo in plants using native urease, making measurement of urea environmentally important. Both direct and indirect methods to measure urea exist. This protocol uses diacetyl monoxime to directly determine the concentration of urea in solution. The protocol provides repeatable results and stable reagents with good color stability and simple measurement techniques for use in any lab with a spectrophotometer. The reaction between diacetyl monoxime and urea in the presence of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, thiosemicarbazide, and ferric chloride produces a chromophore with a peak absorbance at 520 nm and a linear relationship between concentration and absorbance from 0.4 to 5.0 mM urea in this protocol. The lack of detectable interferences makes this protocol suitable for the determination of millimolar levels of urea in wastewater streams and hydroponic solutions."
https://openalex.org/W3211958937,"Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 data remain limited and seropositivity rates in children were reported as <1% early in the pandemic. Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the US was performed.Children and adolescents ≤19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, US. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens.In 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Secondary analysis included orthogonal antibody testing with assays for 1) a receptor binding domain specific antigen and 2) a nucleocapsid specific antigen had concordance rates of 80.5% and 79.3% respectively.A much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported; this was also higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19 infection. The role of children's disease transmission must be considered in COVID-19 mitigation strategies including vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3213100594,"The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a different picture in Africa; the first case was identified in the continent after it had already caused a significant loss to the rest of the world and the reported number of cases and mortality rate has been low. Understanding the characteristics and outcome of the pandemic in the African setup is therefore crucial.To assess the characteristics and outcome of Patients with COVID-19 and to identify determinants of the disease outcome among patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.A prospective cohort study was conducted among 1345 consecutively admitted RT-PCR confirmed Patients with COVID-19 from July to September, 2020. Frequency tables, KM plots, median survival times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to identify determinants of time to clinical recovery and the independent variables, where adjusted hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted hazard ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. Binary logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a statistically significant association between disease outcome and the independent variables, where adjusted odds ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted odds ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.Among the study population, 71 (5.3%) died, 72 (5.4%) were transferred and the rest 1202 (89.4%) were clinically improved. The median time to clinical recovery was 14 days. On the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model; temperature (AHR = 1.135, 95% CI = 1.011, 1.274, p-value = 0.032), COVID-19 severity (AHR = 0.660, 95% CI = 0.501, 0.869, p-value = 0.003), and cough (AHR = 0.705, 95% CI = 0.519, 0.959, p-value = 0.026) were found to be significant determinants of time to clinical recovery. On the binary logistic regression, the following factors were found to be significantly associated with disease outcome; SPO2 (AOR = 0.302, 95% CI = 0.193, 0.474, p-value = 0.0001), shortness of breath (AOR = 0.354, 95% CI = 0.213, 0.590, p-value = 0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (AOR = 0.549, 95% CI = 0.337, 0.894, p-value = 0.016).The average duration of time to clinical recovery was 14 days and 89.4% of the patients achieved clinical recovery. The mortality rate of the studied population is lower than reports from other countries including those in Africa. Having severe COVID-19 disease severity and presenting with cough were found to be associated with delayed clinical recovery of the disease. On the other hand, being hyperthermic is associated with shorter disease duration (faster time to clinical recovery). In addition, lower oxygen saturation, subjective complaint of shortness of breath and being diabetic were associated with unfavorable disease outcome. Therefore, patients with these factors should be followed cautiously for a better outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3212471015,"Viewing behavior provides a window into many central aspects of human cognition and health, and it is an important variable of interest or confound in many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. To make eye tracking freely and widely available for MRI research, we developed DeepMReye, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that decodes gaze position from the magnetic resonance signal of the eyeballs. It performs cameraless eye tracking at subimaging temporal resolution in held-out participants with little training data and across a broad range of scanning protocols. Critically, it works even in existing datasets and when the eyes are closed. Decoded eye movements explain network-wide brain activity also in regions not associated with oculomotor function. This work emphasizes the importance of eye tracking for the interpretation of fMRI results and provides an open source software solution that is widely applicable in research and clinical settings."

Understanding the magnitude and duration of protective immune responses is vital to curbing the pandemic. We enrolled 461 high-risk health services workers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and first responders in the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) to assess the humoral responses in previously infected (PI) and infection naïve (NPI) individuals to mRNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer- BioNTech or mRNA-1273/Moderna). A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in vaccinees prior to (n = 21) and following each vaccine dose (n = 246 following dose 1 and n = 315 following dose 2), and at days 31-60 (n = 110) and 61-90 (n = 190) following completion of the 2-dose series. Both vaccines induced robust antibody responses in all immunocompetent individuals. Previously infected individuals achieved higher median peak titers (p = 0.002) and had a slower rate of decay (p = 0.047) than infection-naïve individuals. mRNA-1273 vaccinated infection-naïve individuals demonstrated modestly higher titers following each dose (p = 0.005 and p = 0.029, respectively) and slower rates of antibody decay (p = 0.003) than those who received BNT162b2. A subset of previously infected individuals (25%) required both doses in order to reach peak antibody titers. The biologic significance of the differences between previously infected individuals and between the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines remains uncertain, but may have important implications for booster strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4226391292,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex pathological change that includes primary SCI and gradually evolves into secondary SCI. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the pathology of a variety of neurological diseases and injuries. However, the characteristics and function of circRNAs in SCI have yet to be elucidated. Although previous research demonstrated that circPrkcsh induces astrocytes to produce inflammatory factors and chemokines, the precise function and mechanism of circPrkcsh in microglia after SCI remains unknown. In this study, we constructed a mouse model of SCI by applying a SCI impactor. Quantitative Real-time PCR and Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that circPrkcsh was upregulated in the microglia of SCI mice when compared to sham-operated mice. Gain- or loss-of-function experiments and in vivo assays further indicated that circPrkcsh promotes microglia M1 polarization both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase assays, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays, confirmed that circPrkcsh serves as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to promote the expression of MEKK1 mRNA by sponging miR-488. Double knockout rescue experiments further showed that circPrkcsh regulates the MEKK1/JNK/p38 MAPK pathway via miR-488. Our research provides a better understanding of the mechanism of circPrkcsh in SCI and demonstrates that the circPrkcsh/miR-488/Mekk1 axis is a promising regulatory method for the treatment of SCI."
https://openalex.org/W3212066223,"The molybdenum/tungsten-bis-pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide family of formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) plays roles in several metabolic pathways ranging from carbon fixation to energy harvesting because of their reaction with a wide variety of redox partners. Indeed, this metabolic plasticity results from the diverse structures, cofactor content, and substrates used by partner subunits interacting with the catalytic hub. Here, we unveiled two noncanonical FDHs in Bacillus subtilis, which are organized into two-subunit complexes with unique features, ForCE1 and ForCE2. We show that the formate oxidoreductase catalytic subunit interacts with an unprecedented partner subunit, formate oxidoreductase essential subunit, and that its amino acid sequence within the active site deviates from the consensus residues typically associated with FDH activity, as a histidine residue is naturally substituted with a glutamine. The formate oxidoreductase essential subunit mediates the utilization of menaquinone as an electron acceptor as shown by the formate:menadione oxidoreductase activity of both enzymes, their copurification with menaquinone, and the distinctive detection of a protein-bound neutral menasemiquinone radical by multifrequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments on the purified enzymes. Moreover, EPR characterization of both FDHs reveals the presence of several [Fe-S] clusters with distinct relaxation properties and a weakly anisotropic Mo(V) EPR signature, consistent with the characteristic molybdenum/bis-pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor of this enzyme family. Altogether, this work enlarges our knowledge of the FDH family by identifying a noncanonical FDH, which differs in terms of architecture, amino acid conservation around the molybdenum cofactor, and reactivity."

The aberrations in TCF4 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, an autism-spectrum disorder characterized by developmental delay. Several disease-associated missense mutations in TCF4 have been shown to interfere with TCF4 function, but for many mutations, the impact remains undefined. Here, we tested the effects of 12 functionally uncharacterized disease-associated missense mutations and variations in TCF4 using transient expression in mammalian cells, confocal imaging, in vitro DNA-binding assays, and reporter assays. We show that Pitt-Hopkins syndrome-associated missense mutations within the basic helix-loop-helix domain of TCF4 and a Rett-like syndrome-associated mutation in a transcription activation domain result in altered DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of the protein. Some of the missense variations found in schizophrenia patients slightly increase TCF4 transcriptional activity, whereas no effects were detected for missense mutations linked to mild intellectual disability. We in addition find that the outcomes of several disease-related mutations are affected by cell type, TCF4 isoform, and dimerization partner, suggesting that the effects of TCF4 mutations are context-dependent. Together with previous work, this study provides a basis for the interpretation of the functional consequences of TCF4 missense variants."

This pattern seems unpredictable, and the propagation appears unstoppable, resulting in over 350,000 death tolls in the U.S. by the end of 2020. Here, we create the spatiotemporal inter-county mobility network using 10 TB (Terabytes) trajectory data of 30 million smart devices in the U.S. in the first six months of 2020. We investigate its bound percolation by removing the weakly connected edges. The mobility network becomes vulnerable and prone to reach its criticality and thus experience surprisingly abrupt phase transitions. Despite the complex behaviors of the mobility network, we devised a novel approach to identify a small, manageable set of recurrent critical bridges, connecting the giant component and the second-largest component. These adaptive links, located across the United States, played a key role as valves connecting components in divisions and regions during the pandemic. Beyond, our numerical results unveil that network characteristics determine the critical thresholds and the bridge locations. The findings provide new insights into managing and controlling the connectivity of mobility networks during unprecedented disruptions. The work can also potentially offer practical future infectious diseases both globally and locally."
https://openalex.org/W3212660756,"Introduction As a result of the increasing average human life expectancy and the related population growth in many countries, research on factors increasing seniors’ quality of life is becoming particularly important. An event critical for seniors’ functioning is retirement. A concept reflecting the dynamics of seniors’ personality associated with the changes taking place in their life situation is psychological capital. This concept was identified as a factor that is constituted by four personality variables changing because of experiences: self-efficacy, optimism, psychological resilience, and hope of success. An interesting issue is the relationship between psychological capital and quality of life in seniors working after retirement. Aim The aim of this paper was to analyze the relationship between psychological capital (self-efficacy, dispositional optimism, psychological resilience) and quality of life in seniors working after retirement, as well as the mediating role of hope of success in this relationship. Methods A total of 304 seniors—103 women and 201 men—participated in the study. The mean age was 65.24. The Quality-of-Life Scale (CASP-19), the Polish adaptation of Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Hope of Success Questionnaire (KNS), and polish adaptation of the Resilience Assessment Scale (SPP-25) were employed in the research. A mediation model was applied to explore the pathway from psychological capital via hope of success to quality of life. Results The tested components of psychological capital correlate positively with working senior citizens’ quality of life. The mediating role of hope of success between psychological capital and quality of life was confirmed. The study presented three mechanisms in which hope of success strengthens the relationships between the components of psychological capital and working senior citizens’ quality of life. Conclusions The mediating role of hope of success between the remaining components of psychological capital and quality of life confirms pattern posited in the COR theory, namely, that increasing one resource leads to the activation of others, which results in a spiral of personal resources being generated. One the one hand, people who have greater resources have a greater capacity for generating spirals of gains. One the other hand, individuals who lack personal resources are both more exposed to losing them and less capable of starting a spiral of gains in resources."
https://openalex.org/W3213146966,"Microbiome is now considered as a significant metabolic organ with an immense potential to influence overall human health. A number of diseases that are associated with pharmacotherapy interventions was linked with altered gut microbiota. Moreover, it has been reported earlier that gut microbiome modulates the fate of more than 30 commonly used drugs and, vice versa, drugs have been shown to affect the composition of the gut microbiome. The molecular mechanisms of this mutual relationship, however, remain mostly elusive. Recent studies indicate an indirect effect of the gut microbiome through its metabolites on the expression of biotransformation enzymes in the liver. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of gut microbiome on the fate of metronidazole in the mice through modulation of system of drug metabolizing enzymes, namely by alteration of the expression and activity of selected cytochromes P450 (CYPs). To assess the influence of gut microbiome, germ-free mice (GF) in comparison to control specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice were used. First, it has been found that the absence of microbiota significantly affected plasma concentration of metronidazole, resulting in higher levels (by 30%) of the parent drug in murine plasma of GF mice. Further, the significant interaction between presence/absence of the gut microbiome and effect of metronidazole application, which together influence mRNA expression of CAR, PPARα, Cyp2b10 and Cyp2c38 was determined. Administration of metronidazole itself influenced significantly mRNA expression of Cyp1a2, Cyp2b10, Cyp2c38 and Cyp2d22. Finally, GF mice have shown lower level of enzyme activity of CYP2A and CYP3A than their SPF counterparts. The results hence have shown that, beside direct bacterial metabolism, different expression and enzyme activity of hepatic CYPs in the presence/absence of gut microbiota may be responsible for the altered metronidazole metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3211562252,"Tumor development can be promoted/suppressed by certain N-glycans attached to proteins at the cell surface. Here we examined aberrant neuronal properties in 2D and 3D rat neuroblastoma (NB) cell cultures with different N-glycan populations. Lectin binding studies revealed that the engineered N-glycosylation mutant cell line, NB_1(- Mgat1 ), expressed solely oligomannose N-glycans, and verified that the parental cell line, NB_1, and a previous engineered N-glycosylation mutant, NB_1(- Mgat2 ), expressed significant levels of higher order N-glycans, complex and hybrid N-glycans, respectively. NB_1 grew faster than mutant cell lines in monolayer and spheroid cell cultures. A 2-fold difference in growth between NB_1 and mutants occurred much sooner in 2D cultures relative to that observed in 3D cultures. Neurites and spheroid cell sizes were reduced in mutant NB cells of 2D and 3D cultures, respectively. Cell invasiveness was highest in 2D cultures of NB_1 cells compared to that of NB_1(- Mgat1 ). In contrast, NB_1 spheroid cells were much less invasive relative to NB_1(- Mgat1 ) spheroid cells while they were more invasive than NB_1(- Mgat2 ). Gelatinase activities supported the ranking of cell invasiveness in various cell lines. Both palladin and HK2 were more abundant in 3D than 2D cultures. Levels of palladin, vimentin and EGFR were modified in a different manner under 2D and 3D cultures. Thus, our results support variations in the N-glycosylation pathway and in cell culturing to more resemble in vivo tumor environments can impact the aberrant cellular properties, particularly cell invasiveness, of NB."

In this study, we examine the spatial and demographic response of a keystone endemic plant of the Namib Desert ( Welwitschia mirabilis ), for which displacement and reduction of suitable climate has been foreseen under future conditions. The main aim is to assess the association between ongoing climate change and geographical patterns of welwitschia health, reproductive status, and size. We collected data on welwitschia distribution, health condition, reproductive status, and plant size in northern Namibia. We used ecological niche models to predict the expected geographic shift of suitability under climate change scenarios. For each variable, we compared our field measurements with the expected ongoing change in climate suitability. Finally, we tested the presence of simple geographical gradients in the observed patterns. The historically realized thermal niche of welwitschia will be almost completely unavailable in the next 30 years in northern Namibia. Expected reductions of climatic suitability in our study sites were strongly associated with indicators of negative population conditions, namely lower plant health, reduced recruitment and increased adult mortality. Population condition does not follow simple latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. The observed pattern of population traits is consistent with climate change trends and projections. This makes welwitschia a suitable bioindicator (i.e. a ‘sentinel’) for climate change effect in the Namib Desert ecosystems. Our spatially explicit approach, combining suitability modeling with geographic combinations of population conditions measured in the field, could be extensively adopted to identify sentinel species, and detect population responses to climate change in other regions and ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3213292380,"The pressure upon local governments to redeem their debt could affect government fiscal ability. It could consequently affect their fiscal policies on corporations, which might distort corporate innovation. Based on the data of Chinese Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies and the local government implicit short-term debt financed by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) in 31 provinces, this paper shows that local government debt (LGD) negatively affects corporate R&D investment in China, thereby suggesting a strong crowding-out effect. The crowding-out effect is more pronounced when the firm is a non-state-owned enterprise (NSOE), the firm's size is small, the firm's age is young, or the firm is in the lower market competition. This paper provide evidence by interacting the terms that local government actions, such as consumption of fiscal resources, strengthening tax collection efforts, or consumption of credit resources, might partially account for the crowding-out effect. This study illustrates the innovation costs of local government debt."

Dissection of the genetic architecture of water deficit responses is highly desirable for developing water-deficit tolerant potato cultivars and enhancing the resilience of existing cultivars. This study examined genetic variation in response to water deficit in a panel of diploid potato and identified the QTL governing this trait via a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A panel of 104 diploid potato accessions were evaluated under both well-watered and water deficit treatments at tuber initiation stage. Drought stress index (DTI) was calculated to assess tolerance of the diploid potato genotypes to water deficit. The GWAS was conducted using a matrix of 47K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), recently available for this population. We are reporting 38 QTL, seven for well-watered conditions, twenty-two for water deficit conditions and nine for DTI which explain between 12.6% and 44.1% of the phenotypic variance. A set of 6 QTL were found to be associated with more than one variable.

https://openalex.org/W3211542243,"Having a vaccine available does not necessarily imply that it will be used. Indeed, uptake rates for existing vaccines against infectious diseases have been fluctuating in recent years. Literature suggests that vaccine hesitancy may be grounded in deeply rooted intuitions or values, which can be modelled using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). We examine the respective prominence of the MFT dimensions in government communication regarding childhood vaccinations and explore its effect on parents' vaccine hesitancy. We measure the MFT dimension loading of the vaccination information brochures from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) between 2011-2019 and connect this information with the electronic national immunisation register to investigate if the use of moral foundations in government communication has a measurable effect on vaccination uptake. We find the largest positive effect for the dimensions Authority/Subversion and Liberty/Oppression and suggestive evidence in favour of a small positive effect for Purity/Degradation. Conversely, Loyalty/Betrayal actually has a negative effect on vaccination rates. For the dimension Harm/Care, we find no significant effect. While Purity/Degradation and Harm/Care appear to be the two most frequently used moral foundations by RIVM, these dimensions have in fact no or only a minor effect on parents' vaccine hesitancy. Reducing the use of these moral foundations may be the first step towards optimising government communication in this context. Instead, formulations activating the moral foundations Authority/Subversion and Liberty/Oppression appear to have positive effects on vaccination uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3212667859,"The marine copepod, Tigriopus californicus, produces the red carotenoid pigment astaxanthin from yellow dietary precursors. This 'bioconversion' of yellow carotenoids to red is hypothesized to be linked to individual condition, possibly through shared metabolic pathways with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Experimental inter-population crosses of lab-reared T. californicus typically produces low-fitness hybrids is due in large part to the disruption of coadapted sets nuclear and mitochondrial genes within the parental populations. These hybrid incompatibilities can increase variability in life history traits and energy production among hybrid lines. Here, we tested if production of astaxanthin was compromised in hybrid copepods and if it was linked to mitochondrial metabolism and offspring development. We observed no clear mitonuclear dysfunction in hybrids fed a limited, carotenoid-deficient diet of nutritional yeast. However, when yellow carotenoids were restored to their diet, hybrid lines produced less astaxanthin than parental lines. We observed that lines fed a yeast diet produced less ATP and had slower offspring development compared to lines fed a more complete diet of algae, suggesting the yeast-only diet may have obscured effects of mitonuclear dysfunction. Astaxanthin production was not significantly associated with development among lines fed a yeast diet but was negatively related to development in early generation hybrids fed an algal diet. In lines fed yeast, astaxanthin was negatively related to ATP synthesis, but in lines fed algae, the relationship was reversed. Although the effects of the yeast diet may have obscured evidence of hybrid dysfunction, these results suggest that astaxanthin bioconversion may still be related to mitochondrial performance and reproductive success."
https://openalex.org/W3212797330,"The nitroreductase superfamily of enzymes encompasses many flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent catalysts promoting a wide range of reactions. All share a common core consisting of an FMN-binding domain, and individual subgroups additionally contain one to three sequence extensions radiating from defined positions within this core to support their unique catalytic properties. To identify the minimum structure required for activity in the iodotyrosine deiodinase subgroup of this superfamily, attention was directed to a representative from the thermophilic organism Thermotoga neapolitana (TnIYD). This representative was selected based on its status as an outlier of the subgroup arising from its deficiency in certain standard motifs evident in all homologues from mesophiles. We found that TnIYD lacked a typical N-terminal sequence and one of its two characteristic sequence extensions, neither of which was found to be necessary for activity. We also show that TnIYD efficiently promotes dehalogenation of iodo-, bromo-, and chlorotyrosine, analogous to related deiodinases (IYDs) from humans and other mesophiles. In addition, 2-iodophenol is a weak substrate for TnIYD as it was for all other IYDs characterized to date. Consistent with enzymes from thermophilic organisms, we observed that TnIYD adopts a compact fold and low surface area compared with IYDs from mesophilic organisms. The insights gained from our investigations on TnIYD demonstrate the advantages of focusing on sequences that diverge from conventional standards to uncover the minimum essentials for activity. We conclude that TnIYD now represents a superior starting structure for future efforts to engineer a stable dehalogenase targeting halophenols of environmental concern.

The rapid accumulation of genomic information has far outstripped our ability to anticipate the function of the proteins encoded. Predicting structure is a bit less daunting if homologous sequences are available, but predicting function is typically very difficult without experimental characterization of many related sequences. The process of selecting the most appropriate representatives to examine has been significantly advanced by the introduction of sequence similarity networks (SSNs) that parse large number of sequences within a structural superfamily and identify clusters of related members (1Gerlt J.A. Genomic enzymology: Web tools for leveraging protein family sequence-function space and genome context to discover novel functions.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 4293-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Copp J.N.

Exploring the sequence, function, and evolutionary space of protein superfamilies using sequence similarity networks and phylogenetic reconstructions.Methods Enzymol. 2018; 620: 315-347Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Even entire metabolic pathways can be discovered by this approach (3Zhao S. Kumar R. Sakai A. Vetting M.W. Wood B.M. Brown S. Bonanno J.B. Hillerich B.S. Seidel R.D. Babbitt P.C. Almo S.C.

Discovery of new enzymes and metabolic pathways by using structure and genome context.Nature. 2013; 502: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such analysis of the nitroreductase superfamily (NTR) encompassing over 24,000 sequences successfully identified numerous clusters of uncharacterized sequences among those with previously determined activity (4Akiva E. Copp J.N. Tokuriki N. Babbit P.C. Evolutionary and molecular foundations of multiple contemporary functions of the nitroreductase superfamily.Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E9549-E9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The predominant features of each subgroup may guide identification of related catalysts but do not necessarily define the essential requirements for sustaining a particular function. As described below, distinct representatives that are remote from the norm best define the minimal features necessary to support reductive dehalogenation by a subgroup within the NTR superfamily. Such information is critical for refining gene annotations and selecting the most expedient parent sequence for engineering new enzyme specificities. The NTR superfamily extends well beyond nitroreductases and includes the dehalogenase above as well as quinone and quinoline reductases, flavin destructases, and various dehydrogenases. As described by the SSN analysis, a central hub of representatives contain only minimal sequences to form α2-homodimers that generate equivalent binding sites for two flavin mononucleotides (FMNs) within the interface of the subunits (Fig. 1) (4Akiva E. Copp J.N. Tokuriki N. Babbit P.C. Evolutionary and molecular foundations of multiple contemporary functions of the nitroreductase superfamily.Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E9549-E9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Radiating away from this hub are more than 14 distinct subgroups that support various activities by the added presence of one, two, or three extensions labeled previously as E1, E2, and E3 that emanate from distinct positions within the central homodimer (Fig. 1) (4Akiva E. Copp J.N. Tokuriki N. Babbit P.C. Evolutionary and molecular foundations of multiple contemporary functions of the nitroreductase superfamily.Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E9549-E9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For example, the subgroup associated with the well-characterized nitroreductase NfsB contains only an E2 extension, whereas the subgroup of flavin destructases associated with BluB contains E1, E2, and E3 extensions. The vast majority of sequences ascribed to iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD) contain E1 and E2. These extensions have been postulated to control substrate recognition since they are typically distal to FMN (4Akiva E. Copp J.N. Tokuriki N. Babbit P.C.

A. 2017; 114: E9549-E9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The central core α+β fold is then likely responsible for controlling the redox chemistry of the FMN required for the various mechanisms of substrate transformation (4Akiva E. Copp J.N. Tokuriki N.

IYD provides an interesting exception since its substrate halotyrosine establishes many of the polar contacts to FMN directly (5Thomas S.R. McTamney P.M. Adler J.M. LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Rokita S.E.

E1 appears disordered in the absence of substrate and forms a helix-linker-helix upon substrate coordination. This fold provides an active site lid that sequesters substrate from solvent and activates single electron transfer pathways of FMN as necessary for substrate dehalogenation (6Hu J. Chuenchor W.

Rokita S.E. Redox control of iodotyrosine deiodinase.Protein Sci. 2019; 28: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Active site ligands that are unable to stabilize the lid cannot induce dehalogenation and instead allow for an innate nitroreduction by a single two electron transfer (10Hu J. Su Q. Schlessman J.L. Rokita S.E. Redox control of iodotyrosine deiodinase.Protein Sci. 2019; 28: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The role of E2 is less clear but is present in mammalian and bacterial IYDs alike (8Sun Z. Su Q. Rokita S.E. The distribution and mechanism of iodotyrosine deiodinase defied expectations.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2017; 632: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The structure of IYD implies a possible supporting role for E2 based on its contacts to, and presumably stabilization of, the lid structure of E1. Together, E1 and E2 were expected to control the specificity of substrates. IYD was first discovered in humans based on its ability to salvage iodide from iodotyrosine generated in the thyroid although this enzyme and its homologues also promote debromination and dechlorination (Fig. 2) (11Rokita S.E.

The general specificity for halotyrosines is surprisingly consistent throughout metazoa (14Phatarphekar A. Rokita S.E. Functional analysis of iodotyrosine deiodinase from Drosophila melanogaster.Protein Sci. 2016; 25: 2187-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and has prompted efforts to engineer IYDs for accepting halophenols as substrates for the goal of bioremediation (9Sun Z. Rokita S.E. Towards a halophenol dehalogenase from iodotyrosine deiodinase via computational design.ACS Catal. 2018; 8: 11783-11793Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These investigations began using human IYD (HsIYD) as the parent sequence based on the availability of its crystal structure but homologues from thermophilic organisms offer an attractive alternative (15Atomi H. Sato T. Kanai T. Application of hyperthermophiles and their enzymes.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2011; 22: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Bommarius A.S. Blum J.K. Abrahamson M.J. Status of protein engineering for biocatalysts: How to design an industrially useful biocatalyst.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2011; 15: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, there was hope that IYD from thermophiles might accept a broad array of substrates since the need for a halotyrosine-specific enzyme is not easily rationalized in Bacteria or Archaea. Even the ability of thermophiles to promote dehalogenation could be questioned since none contained E2 sequences in contrast to the homologues from mesophiles. However, studies presented below demonstrate that the minimal structure provided by the thermophilic organism sustains dehalogenation and should offer a robust platform for future engineering of a reductive dehalogenase active in an aerobic environment. The IYD subgroup is evident in all three domains of life, but to date most attention has been directed toward the mammalian representatives based on their role in iodide homeostasis (17Rosenberg I.N.

Metab. 2008; 93: 4894-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The function of this enzyme in other metazoa is not yet known although a link to spermatogenesis has been identified in Drosophila (20Phatarphekar A. Su Q. Eun S.H. Chen X. Rokita S.E. The importance of a halotyrosine dehalogenase for Drosophila fertility.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 10314-10321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and a role in regulating a potassium channel in Caenorhabditis has also been suggested (21de la Cruz I.P. Ma L. Horvitz H.R. The Caenorhabditis elegans iodotyrosine deiodinase ortholog SUP-18 functions through a conserved channel SC-Box to regulate the muscle two-pore domain potassium channel SUP-9.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: 1004175Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). From the SSN illustrated in Figure 3, metazoan sequences cluster together with a notable unique grouping that includes the Caenorhabditis sequence. In general, these sequences all contain significant N-terminal extensions beyond the common catalytic core and often include a single transmembrane anchor. A large number of representatives also derive from mesophilic Bacteria. These contain only short N-terminal extensions and lack an anchor for membrane association. IYDs from bacterial and archaeal thermophiles have no N-terminal sequence beyond the catalytic core and are also truncated by ten amino acids in E2 and one amino acid in E1 (Figs. 3 and S1). Examples from Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermotoga neapolitana share less than 40% identity with HsIYD and less than 58% identity between each other. We were encouraged to focus on the T. neapolitana variant, which represented one of the most distant and relatively unique outliers since preliminary data already suggested that even the P. furiosus protein maintained some activity as a deiodinase (A. Phatarphekar, N. Ingavat, and S. E. Rokita, unpublished observations) (8Sun Z. Su Q. Rokita S.E. The distribution and mechanism of iodotyrosine deiodinase defied expectations.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2017; 632: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These putative dehalogenases from thermophiles are far from the clusters populated by the mesophilic and psychrophilic organisms from all three domains of life. The structure and catalytic activity of the protein from T. neapolitana (TnIYD) are now reported to define the minimal structural requirements for dehalogenation. TnIYD was expressed in Escherichia coli with a C-terminal (His)6 tag under conditions equivalent to those used to generate IYD from Drosophila melanogaster (DmIYD) (14Phatarphekar A. Rokita S.E. Functional analysis of iodotyrosine deiodinase from Drosophila melanogaster.Protein Sci. 2016; 25: 2187-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and Haliscomenobacter hydrossis (HhIYD) (7Ingavat N. Kavran J.M. Sun Z. Rokita S.E. Active site binding is not sufficient for reductive deiodination by iodotyrosine deiodinase.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 1130-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purification included the addition of FMN to the cell lysate to boost FMN occupancy in IYD. Typically, the addition yields a bright yellow solution due to excess FMN. However, the mixture containing TnIYD and excess FMN rapidly turned dark green. After separation on Ni-NTA resin, the TnIYD fraction appeared purple and exhibited absorption bands at 350, 450, and 590 nm that are typical for a neutral flavin semiquinone (Figs. 4 and S2) (22Massey V. Ghisla S. Role of charge-transfer interactions in flavoprotein catalysis.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 227: 446-465Crossref Google Scholar). After the column-bound TnIYD was washed extensively with air saturated buffer, the purple color dissipated along with its absorbance at 590 nm while absorbance at 450 nm increased. This response is consistent with the expected oxidation of a flavin semiquinone under aerobic conditions. The resulting TnIYD still retained a greenish tint to the expected yellow color of an oxidized flavoprotein (Fig. S2). This tint likely results from the persistence of a weak and broad absorbance near 590 nm (Fig. 4B). No such absorbance was detected previously after preparing IYD from mesophiles, but such an observation has been noted for a few other flavoproteins after their formation of charge-transfer complexes between the flavin and various aromatic ligands (22Massey V. Ghisla S. Role of charge-transfer interactions in flavoprotein catalysis.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 227: 446-465Crossref Google Scholar). The greenish-yellow preparation of TnIYD was denatured and precipitated with formic acid to release all noncovalent species. Along with FMN, a relatively hydrophilic compound was observed by reverse-phase (C18) HPLC from its absorbance at 275 nm. Subsequent examination by ultraperformance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) identified this compound to be Tyr (Fig. S3). This discovery was quite surprising since no other IYD had previously expressed any measurable affinity for Tyr despite its obvious similarities to the substrate I-Tyr (6Hu J. Chuenchor W. Rokita S.E. A switch between one- and two-electron chemistry of the human flavoprotein iodotyrosine deiodinase is controlled by substrate.J. Biol.

A mammalian reductive deiodinase has broad power to dehalogenate chlorinated and brominated substrates.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 14212-14213Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Aromatic ligands copurifying with other flavoproteins had been released upon FMN reduction (23Matthews R.G. Massey V. Sweeley C.C. Identification of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde as the ligand in the green form of Old Yellow Enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9294-9298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus TnIYD bound to Ni-NTA resin was treated with dithionite to release the bound Tyr. Re-oxidation of this protein with air-saturated buffer generated the standard yellow flavoprotein without Tyr (Figs. S2B and S3). The various states of TnIYD were also recapitulated individually. First, the purple form was generated by reduction of TnIYD in the presence of Tyr, NADH, and an E. coli flavin reductase Fre (Fig. S4). Second, the greenish-yellow form with a weak absorbance around 590 nm was formed after adding 1.7 eq. of Tyr to an otherwise Tyr-free preparation of TnIYD containing FMN in its resting, oxidized form (Fig. S5). Ligand binding to IYD is routinely monitored by the characteristic quenching of fluorescence emitted by the active site FMN in its oxidized form (6Hu J. Chuenchor W. Rokita S.E. A switch between one- and two-electron chemistry of the human flavoprotein iodotyrosine deiodinase is controlled by substrate.J. Biol.

The high affinity of Tyr for TnIYD was verified by this method, and the Kd was determined to be 0.45 ± 0.07 μM at 25 °C. The Kd for I-Tyr was even smaller with a value of 0.05 ± 0.02 μM. This high affinity is similar to that of the mammalian HsIYD and more than 160-fold greater than that of HhIYD from a mesophilic bacteria. Consistent with all other IYDs characterized to date, TnIYD binds 2-iodophenol (2-IP, Kd = 31 ± 1 μM) significantly weaker than its amino acid derivative, I-Tyr. This suggests that even these thermophilic bacteria maintain a preference for halotyrosines rather than simple halophenols. Such specificity is even more apparent in the Km values for I-Tyr and 2-IP that differ by 19,000-fold (25 °C, Table 1). Surprisingly, 2-IP is dehalogenated by TnIYD with a kcat value that differs by only 2-fold relative to the kcat value of I-Tyr, but kcat/Km values still indicate a great preference for the halogenated amino acid. Overall, the kinetic constants are best used only for qualitative comparisons since the very low Km value of I-Tyr and the enzyme’s sensitivity to substrate inhibition limit the reliability of these values.Table 1Steady-state properties of TnIYDaAll data and error were obtained by fitting a minimum of two independent measurements to standard Michaelis–Menten kinetics.T °CSubstratekcat (min−1)KM (μM)kcat/KM (μM−1 min−1)25 °CI-Tyr1.6 ± 0.10.22 ± 0.077.2 ± 2.42-IP0.84 ± 0.06(4.2 ± 0.7) × 103(2.0 ± 0.4) × 10−460 °CI-Tyr27 ± 113.5 ± 2.510 ± 6Br-Tyr5.1 ± 0.30.14 ± 0.1236 ± 31Cl-Tyr2.9 ± 0.65 ± 20.6 ± 0.32-IP6.5 ± 0.3(6.6 ± 0.5) × 103(9.9 ± 0.9) × 10−4a All data and error were obtained by fitting a minimum of two independent measurements to standard Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Open table in a new tab Enzyme turnover was also measured at an elevated temperature to approach more natural conditions for the thermophile T. neapolitana. As expected, TnIYD (Tm = 88 °C) maintained structural integrity at much higher temperatures than HsIYD (Tm = 45 °C) as observed by CD (Fig. S6). At 60 °C, the kcat and Km for I-Tyr increased by more than 20-fold relative to the values at 25 °C (Table 1). The large error associated with these values is again due to in part the limited range of substrate concentrations available before substrate inhibition dominates (Fig. S7) (17Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Purification and characterization of a flavoprotein from bovine thyroid with iodotyrosine deiodinase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12318-12325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such inhibition was not observed during 2-IP turnover and instead high concentrations of this substrate were necessary to characterize catalysis. The kcat for 2-IP increased by less than 8-fold after the temperature was raised from 25 °C to 60 °C. The milder effect of temperature on the kcat for 2-IP versus that for I-Tyr may reflect the difficulty of 2-IP to induce a productive orientation of active site side chains, but this difference may alternatively result from only the large uncertainty of the values. The kcat/Km for 2-IP remained more than 10,000-fold smaller than that for I-Tyr at both temperatures. Similar to IYD from mesophiles (HsIYD and DmIYD), TnIYD also promotes debromination and dechlorination of the suitable halotyrosines. Again, the large uncertainty in the kinetic constants for these substrates limits possible comparisons. Crystals of TnIYD bound alternatively to Tyr and I-Tyr were grown by vapor diffusion and diffracted X-rays to 1.8 Å and 1.6 Å, respectively. The crystal structure of TnIYD bound to Tyr was phased by molecular replacement using a ligand-free model generated from the structure of HhIYD bound to I-Tyr (PDB 5KO8) (7Ingavat N. Kavran J.M. Sun Z. Rokita S.E. Active site binding is not sufficient for reductive deiodination by iodotyrosine deiodinase.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 1130-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Initial electron-density maps were improved by prime-and-switch density modification (24Terwilliger T.C. Using prime-and-switch phasing to reduce model bias in molecular replacement.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2144-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) followed by iterative rounds of model building and refinement. Bound FMN and Tyr in each active site along with the entire TnIYD dimer except for the first two residues were visualized in these maps. The final model was refined to an Rfactor of 15.8% and Rfree of 20.1% (Table 2). The structure of the I-Tyr·TnIYD complex was determined by difference Fourier using a ligand-free model of TnIYD based on the Tyr-bound structure of TnIYD. The resulting difference maps had clear density corresponding to I-Tyr and the final occupancy of I-Tyr refined to 0.8 (Fig. S8). Overall, this structure refined to an Rfactor of 17.0% and Rfree of 20.3% (Table 2). Both crystals had the same unit cell in which the asymmetric unit contained a single copy of the native α2-homodimer. The two active sites within each dimer were essentially identical, thus only one representative of each is discussed below.Table 2Data collection and refinement statistics of TnIYD structuresProcessTyr bound to TnIYDI-Tyr bound to TnIYDPDB ID6PZ06Q1LData collection Space groupP212121P212121 Unit Cella,b,c (Å)42.88, 81.82, 103.7542.86, 81.23, 103.90α = β = γ (°)9090 Number of unique reflectionsaThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.34,678 (1965)47,126 (2264) Number of observed reflectionsaThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.225,230 (11,584)211,852 (9484) Resolution (Å)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.35.67–1.80 (1.84–1.80)37.91–1.60 (1.63–1.60) Rpim (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.,bRpim=∑hkl(1/(n−1))⋅∑i|Ii−〈I〉|/∑hkl∑iIi, where Ii is the intensity of an individual reflection and <I> is the mean intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.4.3(13.8)3.9 (38.0) I/σaThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.15.1(5.1)10.7 (2.1) Completeness (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.99.8 (97.7)96.9 (95.5) RedundancyaThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.6.5 (5.9)4.5 (4.2)Refinement Rcryst (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.,cRcryst is ∑‖Fo−Fc‖/∑Fo, where Fo is an observed amplitude and Fc a calculated amplitude; Rfree is the same statistic calculated over a subset of the data that has not been used for refinement.15.83 (16.63)17.04 (22.607) Rfree (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.,cRcryst is ∑‖Fo−Fc‖/∑Fo, where Fo is an observed amplitude and Fc a calculated amplitude; Rfree is the same statistic calculated over a subset of the data that has not been used for refinement.20.10 (21.59)20.26 (25.27) Ramachandran analysisFavored (%)97.8598.63Allowed (%)2.151.37 rmsd bonds0.0070.010 rmsd angles1.0511.3 Average B-factor for protein (Å2)23.5521.81 Average B-factor for water (Å2)31.1531.30 Average B-factor for ligands (Å2)15.2114.49a The values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.b Rpim=∑hkl(1/(n−1))⋅∑i|Ii−〈I〉|/∑hkl∑iIi, where Ii is the intensity of an individual reflection and <I> is the mean intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.c Rcryst is ∑‖Fo−Fc‖/∑Fo, where Fo is an observed amplitude a"

However, esaxerenone-related data with respect to hypertension with heart failure are limited. We investigated the safety and efficacy of esaxerenone in hypertensive patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Hypertensive patients with HFrEF treated with esaxerenone were retrospectively analyzed at two timepoints (short-term: 35±15 days; mid-term: 167±45 days). Adverse events including hyperkalemia (K+ >5.5 mEq/L), worsening renal function (WRF; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction by ≥20%), and hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) were evaluated. eGFR and K+, serum creatinine, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at baseline, short-term, and mid-term assessments were compared. Patients administered esaxerenone as their first MRB (first-MRB cohort) and those who converted from another MRB (conversion cohort) were separately analyzed. There were 50 (56±10 years old, 26% female) patients. At the short-term assessment, hyperkalemia or hypotension was not observed at a dose of 2.0±0.9 mg/day. Seven patients (14%) showed WRF. K+ was slightly elevated (4.12±0.41 to 4.25±0.39 mmol/L, p = 0.07) and eGFR was significantly reduced (66.9±19.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 62.4±19.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.006). In the conversion cohort, significant changes in K+ and eGFR from baseline were not observed at the short-term assessment. BNP levels were consistently improved regardless of the cohorts (first-MRB cohort, 310 [110-370] pg/mL to 137 [47-152] pg/mL, p = 0.001; conversion cohort, 181 [30-203] pg/mL to 108 [26-146] pg/mL, p = 0.028). At the mid-term assessment, there were no significant changes in K+ and eGFR compared with the short-term assessment. In conclusion, esaxerenone was safe for hypertensive patients with HFrEF. Hyperkalemia and hypotension were rarely noted, while eGFR was marginally reduced. Moreover, esaxerenone might be beneficial for HFrEF in terms of BNP level reduction."

Demographics and related factors were compared among newborns with and without RHs. The newborns' eyes were divided into the minimal, mild, moderate, and severe groups according to the number of RHs, and characteristics like bilaterality, laterality, involved retinal layer, involved zone, macular and/or optic nerve (ON) involvement were compared.Among 56247 newborns, 13026 had birth-related RHs (23.2%). Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (NSVD) showed the highest association with RHs (odds ratio, 19.774; 95% confidence interval, 18.277-21.393; P < 0.001) on multivariate analysis. Bilateral RHs (8414/13026; 64.59%) were more common than unilateral RHs (4612/13026; 35.41%); however, unilateral RHs (2383/4217; 56.51%) were more common than bilateral RHs (1834/4217; 43.49%) in the minimal group. RHs showed no laterality differences between the two eyes (P = 0.493). Most RHs were intraretinal (18678/21440; 87.12%), and 2328 (31.65%) eyes with preretinal hemorrhage were observed in the severe group. Zone I RHs were common in the minimal (7072/7090; 99.75%), mild (4953/4960; 99.86%), and moderate (2013/2035; 98.92%) groups; zone I and II RHs were common in the severe group (4843/7355; 65.85%); and RHs in zone III were rare (7/21440; 0.03%). Most RHs showed no macular and/or ON involvement in the minimal and mild group; however, this was common in the severe group (7111/7355; 96.68%).Birth-related RHs were common in healthy newborns and were significantly associated with NSVD. RHs were usually bilateral, intraretinal, and distributed posterior to the retina, but severe RHs had unique characteristics. Future long-term and longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the prognosis of severe RHs."

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial profile of nosocomial infections and their antibiotic resistance in Ahvaz, southwest Iran.The gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were identified on the basis of conventional culture and biochemical tests. The antibiotic resistance of the bacterial isolates against antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method.Among total 1156 collected positive samples, E. coli and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the most frequent pathogenic gram negative bacteria (GNB) and gram positive bacteria (GPB) respectively. Drug susceptibility testing revealed that among GNB, P. aeruginosa was 100% resistant to amikacin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. In the case of E. coli, the resistance rate was (98%) for trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and cefepime. For GPB, S. aureus showed the highest resistance rates to amikacin (100%) and clindamycin (100%). In addition, CoNS strains showed a high level of resistance to doxycycline (100%), erythromycin (100%) and cefoxitin (97%). In Bacteroeides fragilis isolates, the highest resistance rate belonged to clindamycin (72%), and Clostridium perfringens strains showed high level of resistance to penicillin (46%).The results highlighted that there are distinct factors leading to antimicrobial resistance in Ahvaz, southwest Iran. The primary contributors to the resistance development, include poor surveillance of drug-resistant infections, poor quality of available antibiotics, clinical misuse, and the ease of access to antibiotics. Moreover, similar factors such as self-medication and the lack of regulation on medication imports play a role in antibiotic resistance in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3214444861,"According to evidence from developed countries, age at first alcohol use has been identified as a determinant of heavy episodic drinking (HED). This study aimed to investigate the association between age at first alcohol use and HED using data from the Smoking and Drinking Behavior Survey 2017, a Thai nationally representative survey. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the association. This study used data from 23,073 current drinkers in the survey. The survey participants were chosen to represent the Thai population aged 15 years and older. The prevalence of HED and frequent HED among Thai drinkers was 18.6% and 10.1%, respectively. Age at first drinking <20 years was associated with higher odds of HED (adjusted OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.26-1.62) and frequent HED (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53) relative to age at first drinking ≥25 years. Regular drinking, drinking at home, and exposure to alcohol advertising increased the odds of HED. Drinking at home was associated with frequent HED. There was a significant interaction between the effect of age at first alcohol use and sex on HED and frequent HED with a stronger effect of age at first alcohol use observed in females. This study provides evidence from a developing country that early onset of alcohol use is associated with HED. Effective measures such as tax and pricing policy should be enforced to delay the onset of drinking."
https://openalex.org/W3211826552,"Aging in place (AIP) is a policy strategy designed to help older adults remain in their community. While planners internationally have modified aspects of the older adult care continuum (e.g., home care, assisted living, nursing homes) to facilitate AIP, further improvements to community-based supports and services are also required. This study compared and constrasted the community-based factors (e.g., supports, services and personal strategies or characteristics) that family/friend care partners and healthcare stakeholders (i.e., planners/providers) view as most important to help older adults successfully AIP.An initial list of factors shown to influence AIP was created from the academic literature. These factors were used to develop a Delphi survey implemented separately on care partners and healthcare stakeholders. Respondents rated the importance of each factor using a 10-point Likert Scale (1 = not important; 10 = absolutely critical). Consensus in each group was defined when at least 80% of participants scored a factor ≥8 (""very important""), with an interquartile range ≤2. Respondents suggested additional factors during Delphi round one.Care partners (N = 25) and healthcare stakeholders (N = 36) completed two and three Delphi rounds, respectively. These groups independently agreed that the following 3 (out of 27) factors were very important to help older adults age in place: keeping one's home safe, maintaining strong inter-personal relationships, and coordinating care across formal providers. While healthcare stakeholders did not reach consensus on other factors, care partners agreed that 7 additional factors (e.g., access to affordable housing, having mental health programs) were important for AIP.Compared to healthcare stakeholders, care partners felt that more and diverse community-based factors are important to support older adults to successfully AIP. Future research should replicate these findings in other jurisdictions, examine the availability and accessibility of the priority factors, and develop sustainable solutions to enhance their effectiveness."

We also investigated whether the pharmacokinetic interaction observed in this study can be avoided by staggered dosing of the chemical drug and semi-solid enteral nutrient.The plasma concentration of SVA, LEV and CBZ after oral administration was measured by LC-MS/MS method.There was no difference in pharmacokinetic characteristics of SVA and LEV when the dosing time of RASS was altered. On the other hand, the plasma concentration of CBZ after oral administration at all sampling points decreased with the extension of the dosing time of RASS, which was consistent with the Cmax and AUC. However, no significant difference was observed in the pharmacokinetic profiles or parameters of CBZ between the short-term and long-term RASS dosing groups by prolonging the administered interval of CBZ and RASS for 2 hr.We concluded that the pharmacokinetic profiles of CBZ, but not SVA and LEV, after its oral administration are affected by the dosing time of RASS, but staggered administration of CBZ and RASS prevented their interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3212231578,"Introduction A healthy and balanced diet is very important during pregnancy. By enhancing maternal nutritional status, healthcare providers can lower the risks of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes. Objectives To assess the pre-natal nutrition knowledge and services rendered by healthcare providers in antenatal clinics at Primary Health care Centres in Lagos, Nigeria. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study carried out in June—September 2019. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on nutritional knowledge from 391 nurses and midwives who provided pre-natal nutrition education. Direct observation with checklist was used to assess the nutrition education services at the ANC clinics and covered: adequacy of the venue, availability/use of nutrition education resources, education content and teaching strategies. EPi-Info version 3.5 was used for data analysis. Inferential statistics such as chi square and multiple logistic regression were used to determine associated factors and predictors of nutrition knowledge. The level of significance was set at 5% (p&lt;0.05). Results The mean age of respondents was 41.71±10.33years, all were females; 44.8% were Registered Nurses, 12.0% were Registered Midwives, and 23.8% had a B.Sc. in Nursing. Majority (81.3%) had taken a nutrition course in nursing training program, 62.1% as elective classes. Majority (81.1%) had good knowledge of prenatal nutrition. Respondents who were older (51-60years) (p&lt;0.001), single (p&lt;0.001) and Christian (p = 0.001) had significantly better knowledge. Nurses who had University degrees (p&lt;0.001), of higher cadre (p&lt;0.001), more years of practice (p&lt;0.001) and involved in treating severely malnourished children (p = 0.013) were also significantly more knowledgeable. Respondents below 40 years (OR 0.104, CI 0.049–0.218) and those with 10 years or less of practice (OR 0.189, CI 0.092–0.387) had less odds of having good nutrition knowledge. Being single (OR 8.791, CI 3.125–24.731), and Christian (OR = 5.810, CI: 3.321–10.164) predict good nutrition knowledge. In 39% of the 41 PHCs observed, quality of nutrition education services was inadequate. Gaps were mainly in availability of certain nutrition education facilities/resources and teaching strategies. Conclusion The majority of the respondents had good knowledge of pre-natal nutrition. Overall, however, nutrition education services provided by two-fifths of the facilities were inadequate. Interventions to improve prenatal nutrition knowledge of nurses/midwives should be focused more on those who are younger and have less work experience. All necessary equipment required for health service providers to execute their roles as nutrition counselors and educators should also be provided by the government."

A cross-sectional study was conducted with data from older people (≥ 60 years of age; n = 23,815) who participated in the 2013 National Health Survey. Frequencies of non-vaccination and the main reasons for nonadherence were calculated with respective 95% confidence intervals. The prevalence of non-vaccination was 26.9% (approximately 7,106,730 older people). The reason rarely gets the flu was the most cited among the men (28.2%), the 60-to-69-year-old age group (29.6%), individuals with higher education (41.9%), and those with health insurance (32.3%). Fear of a reaction was the most cited reason in the northeastern region (25.4%), among women (29.3%), longer-lived individuals (≥70 years; 28.7%), and those who did not know how to read/write (26.7%). A total of 12.1% reported not believing in the vaccine's protection, and 5.5% did not know that it was necessary to take vaccine. The proportions of the main reasons for non-vaccination varied by sociodemographic characteristics. This study's findings highlight the need to increase older people's knowledge regarding influenza and influenza vaccines. Healthcare providers should be encouraged to counsel older people-especially those in subgroups with lower adherence, such as residents in the Northeast region, those aged 60-69 years, those who do not know how to read/write, those without a spouse/companion, and those without health insurance-regarding the different aspects of the vaccine and formally indicate it for groups at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3212587217,"Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR) γt is a member of the RORC nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors. RORγt functions as a critical regulator of thymopoiesis and immune responses. RORγt is expressed in multiple immune cell populations including Th17 cells, where its primary function is regulation of immune responses to bacteria and fungi through IL-17A production. However, excessive IL-17A production has been linked to numerous autoimmune diseases. Moreover, Th17 cells have been shown to elicit both pro- and anti-tumor effects. Thus, modulation of the RORγt/IL-17A axis may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and some cancers. Herein we report the design, synthesis and characterization of three selective allosteric RORγt inhibitors in preclinical models of inflammation and tumor growth. We demonstrate that these compounds can inhibit Th17 differentiation and maintenance in vitro and Th17-dependent inflammation and associated gene expression in vivo, in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, RORγt inhibitors were assessed for efficacy against tumor formation. While, RORγt inhibitors were shown to inhibit tumor formation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organoids in vitro and modulate RORγt target genes in vivo, this activity was not sufficient to delay tumor volume in a KP/C human tumor mouse model of pancreatic cancer."

Aim To investigate the relationship between fibrinogen plasma levels and lung function impairment later in life. Methods Longitudinal analysis of 2,150 participants of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) aged 50 years and older. Associations between changes in plasma fibrinogen between waves 2 (2004–05) and 4 (2008–09) and lung function in wave 6 (2012–13) were performed using multiple linear regression adjusted by potential confounders. Results Regarding the fibrinogen profile, 18.5% of the participants presented higher levels in both waves. In the adjusted models, the maintenance of high fibrinogen levels was associated with a significant reduction of lung function only for men. FEV 1 showed a reduction of 0.17L, FVC of 0.22L, and the percentages predicted were 5.16% for FEV 1 and 6.21% for FVC compared to those that maintained normal levels of fibrinogen. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the relationship between changes in fibrinogen levels over a long follow-up period and lung function in older adults without pre-existing chronic diseases. ELSA has information on critical demographic and clinical parameters, which allowed to adjust for potential confounding factors. Conclusion It was found that the persistence of high levels of plasma fibrinogen in older English men, but not women, is associated with lung function decline. Therefore, plasma fibrinogen showed to be an important biomarker of pulmonary dysfunction in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3212686508,"An anisotropic structure, gold (Au) nanoplates was synthesized using a two-step wet chemical seed mediated growth method (SMGM) directly on the substrate surface. Prior to the synthesis process, poly-l-lysine (PLL) as a cation polymer was used to enhance the yield of grown Au nanoplates. The electrostatic interaction of positive charged by PLL with negative charges from citrate-capped gold nanoseeds contributes to the yield increment. The percentage of PLL was varied from 0% to 10% to study the morphology of Au nanoplates in term of shape, size and surface density. 5% PLL with single layer treatment produce a variety of plate shapes such as hexagonal, flat rod and triangular obtained over the whole substrate surface with the estimated maximum yield up to ca. 48%. The high yield of Au nanoplates exhibit dual plasmonic peaks response that are associated with transverse and longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance (TSPR and LSPR). Then, the PLL treatment process was repeated twice resulting the increment of Au nanoplates products to ca. 60%. The thin film Au nanoplates was further used as sensing materials in plasmonic sensor for detection of boric acid. The anisotropic Au nanoplates have four sensing parameters being monitored when the medium changes, which are peak position (wavelength shift), intensity of TSPR and LSPR, and the changes on sensing responses. The sensor responses are based on the interaction of light with dielectric properties from surrounding medium. The resonance effect produces by a collection of electron vibration on the Au nanoparticles surface after hit by light are captured as the responses. As a conclusion, it was found that the PLL treatment is capable to promote high yield of Au nanoplates. Moreover, the high yield of the Au nanoplates is an indication as excellent candidate for sensing material in plasmonic sensor."

Students in the fifth year of an undergraduate dentistry program (N = 92) participated in this study. The dependent variables were real motor skills, perceived motor skills and time required to complete the fine motor skills test. The independent variable was the use of a magnification system under four conditions. For each condition, the Dental Manual Dexterity Assessment was performed, which consisted of inserting the #3195FF bur into targets positioned on a Styrofoam plate. The accuracy of each penetration of the targets was scored, using a point system with a maximum possible score of 246 points. Students' perceived fine motor skills were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from zero for no skills to ten for maximum skills. A descriptive statistical analysis and the repeated measures ANOVA were performed (α = 0.05).The Galilean and Keplerian loupes were found to positively affect students' real fine motor skills (p<0.01); however, perceived fine motor skills and time were significantly better (p<0.01) under the naked eye.Dental students' real fine motor skills were better when Galilean and Keplerian loupes were used, but the perceived fine motor skills were not."

It is assumed that specific molecular entities such as Aβ and tau cause synapse loss in AD, yet unbiased screens for synaptotoxic activities have not been performed. Here, we performed size exclusion chromatography on soluble human brain homogenates from AD cases, high pathology non-demented controls, and low pathology age-matched controls using our novel high content primary cultured neuron-based screening assay. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic toxicities were elevated in homogenates from AD cases and high pathology non-demented controls to a similar extent, with more modest synaptotoxic activities in homogenates from low pathology normal controls. Surprisingly, synaptotoxic activities were found in size fractions peaking between the 17-44 kDa size standards that did not match well with Aβ and tau immunoreactive species in these homogenates. The fractions containing previously identified high molecular weight soluble amyloid beta aggregates/""oligomers"" were non-toxic in this assay. Furthermore, immunodepletion of Aβ and tau did not reduce synaptotoxic activity. This result contrasts with previous findings involving the same methods applied to 3xTg-AD mouse brain extracts. The nature of the synaptotoxic species has not been identified. Overall, our data indicates one or more potential Aβ and tau independent synaptotoxic activities in human AD brain homogenates. This result aligns well with the key role of synaptic loss in the early cognitive decline and may provide new insight into AD pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W4226276758,"Alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, including their intracellular trafficking, are common early manifestations of neuronal degeneration. However, current methodologies used to study mitochondrial trafficking events rely on parameters that are primarily altered in later stages of neurodegeneration. Our objective was to establish a reliable applied statistical analysis to detect early alterations in neuronal mitochondrial trafficking. We propose a novel quantitative analysis of mitochondria trajectories based on innovative movement descriptors, including straightness, efficiency, anisotropy, and kurtosis. We evaluated time- and dose-dependent alterations in trajectory descriptors using biological data from differentiated SH-SY5Y cells treated with the mitochondrial toxicants 6-hydroxydopamine and rotenone. MitoTracker Red CMXRos-labelled mitochondria movement was analyzed by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy followed by computational modelling to describe the process. Based on the aforementioned trajectory descriptors, this innovative analysis of mitochondria trajectories provides insights into mitochondrial movement characteristics and can be a consistent and sensitive method to detect alterations in mitochondrial trafficking occurring in the earliest time points of neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3212788520,"This paper constructs the measurement index of core competence by text analysis method and empirically tests the impact of core competence on stock price synchronicity. We find that the stronger the core competence, the lower the stock price synchronicity, and mechanism test shows that core competence reduces the stock price synchronicity by enhancing the transparency of corporate information, which is still valid under a series of robustness tests. Further research shows that:(1) when the corporate governance environment is poor (higher level of internal earnings management, lower quality of accounting information, greater separation of ownership and control, lower shareholding ratio of external institutional investors, weaker product market competition, less media attention), the core competence has a more significant effect on the decline of stock price synchronization; (2)vertically, the dynamic improvement of core competence in the time dimension can play a role in stabilizing stock price synchronization; (3)after distinguishing the types of core competence, we find that the core competence related to information disclosure is more helpful to reduce the stock price synchronization; (4)after the CSRC forces listed companies to disclose the core competence information in the annual report, the core competence plays a stronger role in reducing the stock price synchronization. This study reveals the important role of core competence in reducing stock price synchronization. It not only enriches the relevant literature of core competence and stock price synchronization, but also has important practical significance for the government and regulatory departments to improve the efficiency of capital market allocation."
https://openalex.org/W3212971401,"A comprehensive methodology for semiparametric probability density estimation is introduced and explored. The probability density is modelled by sequences of mostly regular or steep exponential families generated by flexible sets of basis functions, possibly including boundary terms. Parameters are estimated by global maximum likelihood without any roughness penalty. A statistically orthogonal formulation of the inference problem and a numerically stable and fast convex optimization algorithm for its solution are presented. Automatic model selection over the type and number of basis functions is performed with the Bayesian information criterion. The methodology can naturally be applied to densities supported on bounded, infinite or semi-infinite domains without boundary bias. Relationships to the truncated moment problem and the moment-constrained maximum entropy principle are discussed and a new theorem on the existence of solutions is contributed. The new technique compares very favourably to kernel density estimation, the diffusion estimator, finite mixture models and local likelihood density estimation across a diverse range of simulation and observation data sets. The semiparametric estimator combines a very small mean integrated squared error with a high degree of smoothness which allows for a robust and reliable detection of the modality of the probability density in terms of the number of modes and bumps."

Given those doctrines, we scrutinize the impact persistence of volatility spillover and illiquidity spillover of Chinese commodity markets in this paper. Based on the sample from 2010 to 2020, we reveal that there is a cross-market spillover of volatility and illiquidity in China and also, interactions between volatility and illiquidity in different financial markets are pronounced. More importantly, we demonstrate that different commodity markets have different responsiveness to stock market shocks, which embeds their market characteristics. Specifically, we discover that the majority of the traders in gold market might be hedger and therefore gold market is more sensitive to stock market illiquidity shock and thus the shock impact in persistent. On the other hand, agricultural markets like corn and soybean markets might be dominated by investors and thus those markets respond to the stock market volatility shocks and the shock impact in persistent over 10 periods given the first period of risk shock happening. In fact, different Chinese commodity markets' responsiveness towards Chinese stock market risk shocks indicates the stock market risk impact persistence in Chinese commodity markets. This result can help policymakers to understand the policy propagation effect according to this risk spillover channel and risk impact persistence mechanism in China."
https://openalex.org/W3213408361,"Besides its several threats to health, welfare, social and academic development and performance of kids and teenagers, school bullying remains highlighted as one of the most relevant related challenges for educational, behavioral and legal sciences worldwide. Moreover, the lack of research on the field and the crucial but unattended need to count on psychometrically suitable and valid tools to detect school bullying make difficult understanding its contexts, dynamics and possible solutions. Objective The aim of this study was to thoroughly present in detail the psychometric properties and validity issues of the School Bullying Questionnaire (CIE-A) among secondary students. Methods A regionwide sample of 810 (47.2% girls) secondary students attending to 21 schools across the Valencian Community (Spain), aged M = 14.40 (SD = 1.61) years, responded to a paper-based questionnaire containing the 36-item version of the CIE-A and various scales related to psychosocial health and wellbeing, used as criterion variables. Results The outcomes of this study suggest that the CIE-A has a clear factor structure, an optimal set of item loadings and goodness-of-fit indexes. Further, that CIE-A has shown good internal consistency and reliability indexes, coherent associations with other mental health and academic performance variables, and the possibility to assess gender differences on bullying-related factors among secondary students. Conclusion The CIE-A may represent a suitable tool for assessing bullying in a three-factorial approach ( i . e ., victimization, symptomatology, and intimidation), offering optimal psychometric properties, validity and reliability insights, and the potentiality of being applied in the school environment. Actions aimed at improving the school coexistence and the well-being of secondary students, targeting potential bullied/bully profiles or seeking to assess demographic and psychosocial correlates of bullying among teenagers, might get benefited from this questionnaire."
https://openalex.org/W3214305746,"The photochemically-induced thrombosis (photothrombosis) method can create focal cerebral infarcts anywhere in the relatively superficial layers of the cerebrum; it is easy to implement and minimally invasive. Taking advantage of this versatility, we aimed to establish a new rat model of urinary frequency with focal cerebral infarction, which was characterized by its simplicity, nonlethal nature, and high reproducibility. The prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, which are involved in lower urinary tract control, were targeted for focal cerebral infarction, and urinary parameters were measured by cystometrogram. Cystometric analysis indicated that micturition intervals significantly shortened in photothrombosis-treated rats compared with those in the sham operative group on Days 1 and 7 (P < 0.01), but prolonged after 14 days, with no difference between the two groups. Immunopathological evaluation showed an accumulation of activated microglia, followed by an increase in reactive astrocytes at the peri-infarct zone after photothrombotic stroke. Throughout this study, all postphotothrombosis rats showed cerebral infarction in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex; there were no cases of rats with fatal cerebral infarction. This model corresponded to the clinical presentation, in that the micturition status changed after stroke. In conclusion, this novel model combining nonlethality and high reproducibility may be a suitable model of urinary frequency after focal cerebral infarction."
https://openalex.org/W3212565206,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with impaired decision making, yet few studies have adopted paradigms from behavioral economics to decompose which, if any, aspects of decision making may be impacted. This may be particularly relevant for decision-making processes relevant to known difficulties with emotive dysfunction and corresponding reward dysregulation in BD. Participants with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 44) and non-psychiatric healthy controls (CTL; n = 28) completed three well-validated behavioral economics decision making tasks via a remote-based survey, including loss aversion and framing effects, that examined sensitivity to probabilities and potential gains and losses in monetary and non-monetary domains. Consistent with past work, we found evidence of moderate loss aversion and framing effects across all participants. No group differences were found in any of the measures of loss aversion or framing effects. We report no group differences between bipolar and non-psychiatric groups with respect to loss aversion and framing effects using a remote-based survey approach. These results provide a framework future studies to explore similar tasks in clinical populations and suggest the context and degree to which decision making is altered in BD may be rooted in a more complex cognitive mechanism that warrants future research."
https://openalex.org/W3212909513,"Background Research has shown that organizational leadership and support affect organizational outcomes in several sectors, including healthcare. However, less is known about how organizational leadership might influence the wellbeing of clinical trainees as well as the quality of their patient care practices. Objectives This study examined the mediating effects of burnout and engagement between program director-resident relationship quality and residents’ reported quality of care, and the moderating effect of perceived departmental support. Methods The authors conducted a cross-sectional study in September 2020, using a 41-item questionnaire, among 20 residency programs in an academic medical center in Lebanon. Measures included program director-resident relationship quality, perceived departmental support, burnout subcomponents, engagement, and self-reported quality of care. Ordinary least squares regression was used to conduct parallel mediation and moderated mediation analyses using SPSS macro-PROCESS, to assess the strength and direction of each of the proposed associations. Results A total of 95/332 (28.6%) residents responded. Results revealed that program director-resident relationship quality had a significant indirect effect on residents’ suboptimal patient care practices and attitudes towards patients, through at least one of the wellbeing dimensions ( p &lt; .05). Perceived departmental support did not play a dominant role over program director-resident relationship quality, and thus did not influence any of the mediated relationships. Conclusion Our study adds a new dimension to the body of literature suggesting that program director-resident relationship quality plays an important role in promoting residents’ wellbeing and achieving important clinical health outcomes. Such findings imply that the quality of program director-resident relationship could be an important component of residents’ wellbeing and patient safety. If further research confirms these associations, it will become imperative to determine what interventions might improve the quality of relationships between program directors and residents."
https://openalex.org/W3213271392,"Injured patients requiring definitive intervention, such as surgery or transarterial embolization (TAE), are an extremely time-sensitive population. The effect of an emergency physician (EP) patient care delivery system in this important trauma subset remains unclear. We aimed to clarify whether the preoperative time course and mortality among injured patients differ between ambulances staffed by EPs and those staffed by emergency life-saving technicians (ELST). This was a retrospective cohort study at a community emergency department (ED) in Japan. We included all injured patients requiring emergency surgery or TAE who were transported directly from the ED to the operating room from January 2002 to December 2019. The primary exposure was dispatch of an EP-staffed ambulance to the prehospital scene. The primary outcome measures were preoperative time course including prehospital length of stay (LOS), ED LOS, and total time to definitive intervention. The other outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare these outcomes between the groups. Of the 1,020 eligible patients, 353 (34.6%) were transported to the ED by an EP-staffed ambulance. In the propensity score-matched analysis with 295 pairs, the EP group showed a significant increase in median prehospital LOS (71.0 min vs. 41.0 min, P < 0.001) and total time to definitive intervention (189.0 min vs. 177.0 min, P = 0.002) in comparison with the ELST group. Conversely, ED LOS was significantly shorter in the EP group than in the ELST group (120.0 min vs. 131.0 min, P = 0.043). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (8.8% vs.9.8%, P = 0.671). At a community hospital in Japan, EP-staffed ambulances were found to be associated with prolonged prehospital time, delay in definitive treatment, and did not improve survival among injured patients needing definitive hemostatic procedures compared with ELST-staffed ambulances."
https://openalex.org/W3213288326,"We examine the learning effects of borrowers' failures in online lending. Based on funding ratios of borrowers' loan listings in online lending, we first explore the role of failure degree in borrowers' future funding performance. Further, we disaggregate borrowers' funding failure into complete failure and incomplete failure, and compare theirs learning effects. Using a large sample of 610,000 online loan applications over six years from a Chinese leading online lending platform Renrendai, we use funding ratio to quantifiably measure each loan listing's failure degree and conduct a series of tests. The results show that: (1) Borrowers' failure degree of prior loan applications is negatively associated with one's subsequent funding performance. (2) Borrowers' complete failure cannot promote learning, while incomplete failure is good for future performance. (3) Both incomplete failure and complete failure interacted to influence the value of each type of experience and generate improved learning. Our results are robust across a variety of settings. The study sheds light for deeply understanding of failure learning phenomenon, and can also provide important implications for online lending managers to support successful financial transactions."
