https://openalex.org/W2030998472,"The distribution of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of 68 depressed patients was bimodal. Twenty-nine percent of the patients were in the lower mode, with a concentration of 5-HIAA below 15 nanograms per milliliter. Although there were no differences in overall severity of depression between the two modes, there was a significant correlation between the concentration of 5-HIAA and severity of depression in the lower, but not in the upper, mode. The finding suggests the existence of a biochemical subgroup of depressive disorder, characterized by a disturbance of serotonin turnover."

The rate of recovery of fluorescence after bleaching can be interpreted as a measure of the lateral diffusion of integral membrane proteins labeled with fluorescein.
https://openalex.org/W2000722657,"Three species of sunfishes segregate ecologically when stocked together in small ponds. When each species is stocked separately in replicate ponds, it exhibits competitive release through increases in growth rate and average food size. Niche shifts are indicated by convergence of these species to the same food habits in the absence of competitors. These shifts are due to phenotypic (behavioral) plasticity. The significance of niche flexibility is related to seasonal patterns in resource availability."
https://openalex.org/W1526449859,"Analysis of soluble Ehrlich ascites proteins by the Sanger procedure revealed methionine, alanine, valine, and glycine as the major NH2-terminal amino acids. The average monomer weights of these proteins calculated from the yields of NH2-terminal amino acids was 144,000. In contrast, the average monomer weight of Ehrlich ascites soluble proteins calculated from the data obtained after electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate was 32,500. The explanation for the disparity in the estimates of average monomer weight obtained by the procedures appears to be that extensive blocking of alpha-NH2 groups by acetate occurs in these proteins, i.e. of the acetate present in the acidic peptides isolated from proteolytic digests of ascites proteins, 23.2 nmol/mg of protein appears to originate from N-acetyl amino acids. These results suggest that approximately 80% of the soluble proteins from Ehrlich ascites cells contain acetate at their NH2-terminal residues. The extensive N-acetylation of proteins does not appear to be limited to Ehrlich ascites cells and may be characteristic of eukaryotic proteins."

Eleven additional cell lines not previously indicted are described. When they exhibit (i) type A (fast) mobility for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, (ii) phosphoglucomutase type 1 at locus 1 and locus 3, (iii) absence of a Y chromosome by fluorescent staining, and (iv) possession of a complex of trypsin-Giemsa banded marker chromosomes present in known HeLa cells, then cell substrates regardless of designation should be considered de facto strains of HeLa."
https://openalex.org/W2021893781,The adrenaline-forming enzyme (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) was elevated in the A1 and A2 regions of the brainstem of 4-week-old spontaneously (genetic) hypertensive rats and in the A1 region of adult experimentally (deoxycorticosterone acetate and sodium chloride) hypertensive rats. The administration of a phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor to experimentally hypertensive animals caused a reduction of the elevated blood pressure to normal values. These results implicate adrenaline-containing neurons in the brainstem in the development of hypertension.

Combination overtones of C-H stretching vibrations in benzene have been identified and agree with previous results obtained by conventional spectroscopy with a long optical path. Extinction coefficients as low as 1 × 10-6 liter mole-1 cm-1 have been accurately determined. The sensitivity of the technique has been further demonstrated by measuring the S0→T1 absorption of anthracene; the spectrum compares favorably with results obtained by conventional techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1985542200,"Phytoestrogens, largely formononetin and genistein, are produced in the leaves of stunted desert annuals in a dry year. When ingested by California quail, these compounds apparently inhibit reproduction and prevent the production of young that will not have adequate food. In a wet year, forbs grow vigorously and phytoestrogenic substances are largely absent. Quail then breed prolifically and the abundant seed crop carries the enlarged population through the winter."
https://openalex.org/W1483387535,"The synthesis and release of alanine and glutamine were investigated with an intact rat epitrochlaris muscle preparation. This preparation will maintain on incubation for up to 6 hours, tissue levels of phosphocreatine, ATP, ADP, lactate, and pyruvate closely approximating those values observed in gastrocnemius muscles freeze-clamped in vivo. The epitrochlaris preparation releases amino acids in the same relative proportions and amounts as a perfused rat hindquarter preparation and human skeletal muscle. Since amino acids were released during incubation without observable changes in tissue amino acids levels, rates of alanine and glutamine release closely approximate net amino acid synthesis. Large increases in either glucose uptake or glycolysis in muscle were not accompanied by changes in either alanine or glutamine synthesis. Insulin increased muscle glucose uptake 4-fold, but was without effect on alanine and glutamine release. Inhibition of glycolysis by iodacetate did not decrease the rate of alanine synthesis. The rates of alanine and glutamine synthesis and release from muscle decreased significantly during prolonged incubation despite a constant rate of glucose uptake and pyruvate production. Alanine synthesis and release were decreased by aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of alanine aminotransferase. This inhibition was accompanied by a compensatory increase in the release of other amino acids, such as aspartate, an amino acid which was not otherwise released in appreciable quantities by muscle. The release of alanine, pyruvate, glutamate, and glutamine were observed to be interrelated events, reflecting a probable near-equilibrium state of alanine aminotransferase in skeletal muscle. It is concluded that glucose metabolism and amino acid release are functionally independent processes in skeletal muscle. Alanine release reflects the de novo synthesis of the amino acid and does not arise from the selective proteolysis of an alanine-rich storage protein. It appears that the rate of alanine and glutamine synthesis in skeletal muscle is dependent upon the transformation and metabolism of amino acid precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1502242927,"The synthesis and release of alanine and glutamine have been studied in the intact rat epitrochlaris skeletal muscle preparation. Aspartate, cysteine, leucine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, serine, theronine, and glycine increased significantly the formation and release of alanine from muscle. Cysteine, leucine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, tyrosine, lysine, and phenylalanine increased the rate of glutamine synthesis. Only ornithine, arginine, and tryptophan were without effect on the synthesis of either alanine or glutamine. Half-maximal stimulation of alanine and glutamine formation by added amino acids was observed with concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 1.0 mM. Increases in alanine and glutamine formation were not accompanied by changes in pyruvate production or glucose uptake. The progressive decline in alanine and glutamine synthesis noted on prolonged incubation was prevented by the addition of amino acids to the incubation medium. Stimulation of alanine synthesis by added amino acids was unaffected by inhibition of glycolysis with iodoacetate. Inhibition of alanine aminotransferase with aminooxyacetate significantly decreased alanine formation. Pyruvate and ammonium chloride did not increase further the rate of either alanine or glutamine formation above that produced by added amino acids. These data indicate that most amino acids are precursors for alanine and glutamine synthesis in skeletal muscle. A general mechanism is presented for the de novo formation of alanine from amino acids in skeletal muscle, and the importance of proteolysis for the supply of amino acid precursors for alanine and glutamine synthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1659973391,"A monoacylglycerol-hydrolyzing enzyme has been purified 2500-fold from rat adipose tissue. The key step was the solubilization of the enzyme, presumably as an enzyme-detergent complex, by sonication with a nonionic polyoxyethylene alcohol detergent. The purification was achieved by ion exchange and gel chromatography, and isoelectric focusing, in the presence of detergent. By sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis the enzyme protein was more than 85% pure. This method indicated a minimum molecular weight of 32,900. The preliminary amino acid composition, excluding tryptophan, could best be fitted with a value of 31,800. The purified enzyme had a pI of 7.2, an estimated Stokes radius of 39 A by gel chromatography and a pH optimum of 8.0. Enzyme stability was highly dependent on presence of detergent and free sulfhydryl groups. The enzyme was responsible for the main monoacylglycerol- but only a small part of the p-nitrophenylacetate-hydrolyzing activity of crude adipose tissue extracts and hydrolyzed 1(3)- and 2-monooleoylglycerol at equal rates. Under the assay conditions used it did not catalyze the hydrolysis of emulsified trioleoylglycerol, micellar or emulsified dioleoylglycerol, emulsified cholesterol oleate or micellar lysophosphatidylcholine. It is possible that the enzyme may be a specific monoacylglycerol hydrolase."

The exacerbation of the disease process was not due to variations in neuroleptic doses. After termination of the gluten challenge, the course of improvement was reinstated. The observed effects seemed to be due to a primary schizophrenia-promoting effect of wheat gluten."
https://openalex.org/W2015368195,"A unique biological system whereby optical isomers are selectively transformed to geometrical isomers is demonstrated in Ips paraconfusus. Exposure of adult male and female beetles to vapor of (-)-alpha-pinene resulted in the production of (+)-cis-verbenol, a pheromone of this species, whereas (+)-alpha-pinene was oxidized to (+)-trans-verbenol. It appears, therefore, that the ability of a bark beetle to produce its aggregation pheromone can be governed by the chirality of a precursor in the host tree."
https://openalex.org/W1507144112,"3-O-[14C]Methylglucose was used to study the insulin action on the sugar transport in white fat cells. The experiments comprised determinations of the 3-O-methylglucose space at stationary distribution, of the rate constants for 3-O-methylglucose equilibrium exchange under various conditions, and of the 3-O-methylglucose inhibition of the lipogenesis from glucose. The following was found. The intracellular distribution space for 3-O-methylglucose at equilibrium was unaffected by insulin and was identical with the intracellular 3H2O space. The half-time for the equilibrium exchange of 3-O-methylglucose at a concentration of 25 mM was about 240 s in the absence of insulin and about 15 s with insulin (0.7 muM) present. Addition of phloridzin (5 mM) decreased the rate of the exchange process about 25-fold in both cases. The self-exchange of 3-O-methylglucose (1 mM) was at least 50 times faster than the self-exchange of L-glucose (1 mM). The concentration dependence of the 3-O-methylglucose exchange rate was approximately hyperbolic both in the absence and the presence of insulin, although the saturation of the transport mechanism at high concentrations of sugar was not as complete as predicted. In the absence of insulin the estimate of the half-saturation constant (Kt) was about 5 mM; that of the maximal exchange rate (Vmax) varied from 0.07 mmol s-1/liter of intracellular water to 0.2 mmol s-1 liter-1. In the presence of insulin Kt remained about 5 mM, whereas Vmax was increased to about 1.7 mmol s-1 liter-1. The latter estimate was reproducible within about 20%. The incorporation of trace amounts of [U-14C]glucose into intracellular lipids was inhibited by unlabeled 3-O-methylglucose pre-equilibrated over the membrane. The inhibition constant estimated from such experiments was about 5 mM both in the absence and the presence of insulin, and the insulin-induced increase in the rate of glucose incorporation was similar to the increase in the rate of the 3-O-methylglucose exchange process. It is concluded that exchange of 3-O-methylglucose proceeds via a mechanism which shows stereospecificity and saturability and that insulin acts by increasing the maximal transport capacity without changing the half-saturation constant."
https://openalex.org/W2047039046,"Infant looking time was monitored during habituation to the repeated presentation of a wavelength stimulus selected from one basic adult hue category and after a change in stimulation. Recovery from habituation was greater to a wavelength selected from an adjacent hue category than to a wavelength from the same category even though these two stimuli were equally distant (in nanometers) from the habituation wavelength. Differential responding evidenced infants' categorical perception of hue; that is, infants see the physically continuous spectrum as divided into the hue categories of blue, green, yellow, and red. These results help to resolve the long-standing controversy surrounding the primacy of perception over language in the organization of hue."
https://openalex.org/W1984760552,"A subgross sampling technique with histological confirmation was used to study the pathology of 119 whole human breasts, either cancer-associated (that is, containing cancer or contralateral to a cancer) or taken from random routine autopsies. Atypical lobules were observed much more frequently in the cancer-associated group than in the group of routine autopsy breasts. Atypical lobules showed varying degrees of anaplasia that formed a continuum between normal epithelium and carcinoma in situ, usually of the common ductal type. As apprarent markers for increased cancer risk, atypical lobules in the human breast may be homologous to hyperplastic alveolar nodules that are abundant in high mammary cancer strains of mice. This indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that atypical lesions are common preneoplastic lesions in the human mammary gland."

https://openalex.org/W1485274941,"Affinity partitioning has been employed in the purification of membranes rich in cholinergic receptor from Torpedo californica electric organs. The procedure involves a modification of poly(ethylene oxide)-dextran aqueous phase partitioning systems where a ligand selective for the receptor is conjugated to the poly(ethylene oxide). Specific partitioning of the receptor-containing membranes into the poly(ethylene oxide)-rich phase occurs when bis-alpha,omega-trimethylamino poly(ethylene oxide) or bis-rho-tri-methylammonium phenylamino poly(ethylene oxide) was added to the phase system in low mole ratio. bis-alpha,omega-Methylamino poly(ethylene oxide), which should impart equivalent interfacial electromotive potential to the system but bind poorly to the receptor sites, was much less effective in producing phase distribution changes. The ligand-polymer-dependent phase distribution shifts were blocked by bisquaternary methonium ligands at concentrations consistent with their relative affinities for the cholinergic receptor. Titration or receptor sites with cobra alpha-toxin decreased the phase distribution changes in a linear fashion up to the point of stoichiometry. These observations are consistent with the phase distribution changes being consequent to ligand-polymer association with the pharmacologically important site on the receptor. The affinity partitioning procedure, when employed following an initial purification of the membranes by differential and density gradient centrifugation, yields membrane preparations with a high degree of morphological uniformity and a specific activity between 2.9 and 4.6 nmol of bound cobra alpha-toxin/mg of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1554020743,"It was shown previously that 4 to 5 times more human placental lactogen (hPL) was synthesized in cell-free extracts from term placentae than in comparable extracts prepared from first trimester tissue. In an attempt to define what accounts for this differential rate of synthesis RNA was prepared from first trimester and term placentae. Following purification through an oligo(dT)-cellulose column, these RNA preparations were tested for their ability to direct the synthesis of the hPL precursor in the wheat germ cell-free system. With similar amounts of first trimester and term mRNA, the overall efficiency as defined by the stimulation of total amino acid incorporation was comparable. However, there was approximately 4 times more hPL synthesized in the presence of term RNA. This was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and tryptic fingerprinting. The peak of the hPL precursor messenger activity sedimented at 12 to 13 S on sucrose gradient. Analysis of the RNA by formamide-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis further supported this value. The data indicate that the increased synthesis of hPL at term reflects greater levels of hPL mRNA in term tissue than in first trimester tissue. The data also show that the overall in vivo levels of hPL can be correlated not only with the increase in placental syncytial mass during pregnancy but also in the greater proportion of hPL synthesized per g of tissue. The latter results from the continual differentiation of the placenta occurring throughout gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2057716451,"We studied the contribution of the Aplysia peripheral nervous system, in the siphon and gill, to habituation of the gill withdrawal reflex. After removal of one central ganglion, the parietovisceral, repeated stimulation of the siphon caused habituation of the reflex as it had with the ganglion intact, showing that there is a peripheral pathway between the siphon and gill with competence to mediate habituation. Repeated electrical stimulation of two efferent nerves to the gill, after removal of the parietovisceral ganglion, resulted in habituation of withdrawal movements, which shows that the terminals of the ganglion neurons in the gill are a site of habituation. Also, stimulation of one nerve dishabituates the withdrawal movements elicited by the other. These identify two sites of habituation in the gill in addition to sites in the parietovisceral ganglion."
https://openalex.org/W1539680015,"The synthesis of collagen has been demonstrated in endothelial cells of Descemet's membrane isolated from rabbit cornea. Incorporation of [14C]proline and [14C]lysine into nondialyzable protein was measured in the medium and cell fraction after incubating Descemet's membrane for up to 5 hours. In the [14C]collagen synthesized by the endothelium, 15% of the hydroxy[14C]proline was present as the 3-isomer. About 98% of the hydroxy[14C]lysine in the 14C-labeled-protein found in the medium was glycosylated; 95% of the glycosylated hydroxy[14C]lysine was in the form of the disaccharide glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxy[14C]lysine. Time course experiments with [14C]proline indicated that there was a delay of about 60 min before significant amounts of [14C]collagen were secreted into the medium. The initial polypeptides of [14C]collagen synthesized by the corneal endothelium had an apparent molecular weight of 155,000.

https://openalex.org/W1531536466,"Abstract Two new double-headed protease inhibitors have been isolated from black-eyed peas. The isoinhibitors can be purified to homogeneity with greater than 90% recovery in a four-step procedure by means of sequential affinity chromatography on trypsin-Sepharose and chymotrypsin-Sepharose affinity columns. The isoinhibitors both have molecular weights near 8,000 and both have the same NH1-terminal residue serine. Black-eyed pea chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) has an isoelectric point of 5.1 and inhibits trypsin and chymotrypsin simultaneously. Black-eyed pea trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI) has an isoelectric point of 6.5 and inhibits 2 molecules of trypsin simultaneously. BEPTI binds to chymotrypsin-Sepharose above pH 6 but does not inhibit chymotrypsin in the standard inhibitor assay with 10-3 M substrate. These new inhibitors are distinct from the Ventura inhibitor isolated from Serido black-eyed peas. An endogenous seed protease has been isolated from black-eyed peas by affinity chromatography on soybean inhibitor-carboxymethylcellulose affinity columns. A protease-BEPCI complex has been isolated by ion exchange chromatography. A dual physiological function of inhibition and protection of the seed protease is suggested as a plausible role of seed protease inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1508293989,Transfer of tritium from [3-3H]pyruvate into propionyl-CoA is found during the reaction of transcarboxylase: Methylmalonyl-CoA + pyruvate leads to oxalacetate + propionyl-CoA. About 5% of the tritium counts that are labilized in the reaction are found in a position of the propionate that exchanges rapidly with water in the presence of transcarboxylase. Transfer from [2-3H]propionate of propionyl-CoA to pyruvate is real but only about one-tenth as great. The tritium transfers between reactants on two subunits are difficult to explain by a carbanion mechanism of --C--H bond cleavage and support the cyclic mechanism in which carboxybiotin itself is the base and the enol form of biotin is the proton-transferring agent.
https://openalex.org/W1484603920,"Intact avian liver mitochondria were shown to synthesize glutamine from glutamate in the absence of exogenous ATP and ammonia. With L-[U-14C]glutamate as the substrate, there was an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry between glutamate deaminated (as measured by the release of 14CO2 due to alpha-keto-[14C]glutarate oxidation) and glutamate amidated. With L-[15N]glutamate as the substrate, the isolated glutamine was shown by low and high resolution mass spectrometry of its phenylisothiocyanate derivative to contain 15N in both the alpha-amino and amide groups. Thus, for each mole of glutamate taken up, approximately 0.5 mol is deaminated and the other 0.5 mol serves as a substrate for glutamine synthetase previously localized in these mitochondria (Vorhaben, J. E., and Campbell, J. W. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247,2763). The permeability of L-glutamine to intact avian liver mitochondria was studied by a rapid centrifugation technique. Efflux as well as influx of L-glutamine were both rapid and appeared to occur by a passive, energy-independent process. These results indicate that the mitochondrial glutamine synthetase present in uricotelic species represents the primary ammonia detoxication reaction in that ammonia released intramitochondrially during amino acid catabolism is converted to glutamine for efflux to the cytosol where it may serve as a substrate for purine (uric acid) biosynthesis."

In particular, the reversal potential for the action of ACh on the postsynaptic membrane has not been measured directly. In order to obtain the reversal potential, ACh was applied iontophoretically from a micropipette onto the innervated membrane. The resulting depolarization (ACh potential) decreased in amplitude as the cell was depolarized, reached zero at a reversal potential of about -4 millivolts, and then reversed in sign as the inside of the cell was made increasingly more postive. The relation between ACh potential amplitude and membrane potential was nonlinear because of a decrease with depolarization of the peak conductance change produced by the drug."

https://openalex.org/W1600704989,"Abstract Complex formation between two new double-headed protease inhibitors from black-eyed peas, trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) and a trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI), and trypsin and chymotrypsin was investigated in the concentration range from 10-8 to 10-4 M by titration experiments and gel filtration chromatography. Dissociation equilibrium constants measured for complexes detected in the titration experiments range from as large as 10-8 M for trypsin bound nonspecifically to the chymotrypsin site of BEPCI to as small as 10-18 M2 for the interaction of BEPCI with chymotrypsin. The identity and stoichiometry of complexes detected during titration experiments were confirmed by gel filtration of mixtures of native and fluorescently labeled proteases and inhibitors. Half-site reactivity is observed in the formation of complexes between BEPCI or BEPTI and trypsin and chymotrypsin at all experimentally practical concentrations. The double-headed complex contains 1 molecule each of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and BEPCI dimer. The bimolecular rate constants of complex formation between trypsin or chymotrypsin and isolated BEPCI oligomers range from 1.8 X 10(5) M-1 S-1 for chymotrypsin and BEPCI monomer to 4.4 X 10(7) M-1 S-1 for trypsin and the rapidly equilibrating BEPCI dimer. The estimated rate constants for the dissociation of half-site-liganded dimer complexes and liganded monomer complexes range from 7.5 X 10-3 S-1 for the trypsin-liganded BEPCI monomer complex to 1.6 X 10-6 S-1 for the chymotrypsin-liganded BEPCI dimer complex."
https://openalex.org/W1603144731,"The geometry of the binary and ternary complexes of two black-eyed pea inhibitors with trypsin and chymotrypsin has been established by distance measurements using the technique of singlet-singlet energy transfer. Triangulation of measured distances in the ternary double-headed complex of the trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) with trypsin and chymotrypsin limits the possible structural models for this complex to those in which the center to center distance between trypsin and chymotrypsin is about 64 A, the distance from the center of trypsin to the single fluorescently labeled tyrosyl residue of the BEPCI dimer is about 33 A, and the distance between the chymotrypsin center and the labeled tyrosine of the inhibitor is about 43 A. Energy transfer results for the trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI) complexes show conclusively that the weak trypsin site is structurally analogous to the strong chymotrypsin binding site of BEPCI. The weak chymotrypsin binding site of BEPTI is structurally analogous to the strong trypsin sites of BEPCI and BEPTI. Corresponding distances in binary and ternary complexes are the same, indicating that little or no structural rearrangement occurs when the ternary complexes are formed. Complex formation was shown to involve tryptophan and tryosine residues of both trypsin and chymotrypsin as judged by absorption and circular dichroism difference spectroscopy. In addition, circular dichroism difference spectra revealed some disulfide contributions."
https://openalex.org/W1594368718,"The half-site reactivity of trypsin and chymotrypsin binding to two double-headed black-eyed pea protease inhibitors a trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) had a trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI), is explained in terms of the energetics of these inhibitor-protease interactions. Free energy diagrams are constructed to facilitate interpretation of the energetics. Coupling-free energies are calculated to reflect the magnitude of the interdependence of protease-binding (alloassociation) and inhibitor subunit interactions (isoassociation). The experiment observation of the predominance of liganded monomer complexes for the lima bean inhibitor and the Bowman-Birk soybean inhibitor and the predominance of half-site-liganded complexes for BEPCI and BEPTI is the direct result of the magnitudes and signs of the coupling free energies which result from these protease-inhibitor interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1547947520,"The synthesis of the multienzyme complex rat liver fatty acid synthetase was investigated utilizing modifications of methods developed in the laboratory of Schimke (Schimke, R. T. (1964) J. Biol. Chem. 239, 3808-3817 and Arias, I. M., Doyle, D., and Schimke, R. T. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3303-3315). The relative amounts of radioactivity from a pulse of labeled lysine appearing in polypeptides derived from purified synthetase complex can be measured compensating for the varying amounts of lysine per polypeptide chain. The results show that labeled amino acid is incorporated into polypeptides derived from the complex at heterogeneous rates. However, 10 to 15 hours after the administration of a pulse, the amount of label per lysine residue in these polypeptides is identical. The results support the previously proposed model of this multienzyme complex (Tweto, J., Dehlinger, P., and Larrabee, A. R. (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 48, 1371-1377). The previous work and that reported here suggests the existence of a pool of synthetase subunits which is an obligatory intermediate in both synthesis and turnover of the complex. The results obtained in this work are consistent with this model if the exchange of subunits into the intact complex is a relatively slow process requiring several hours to reach equilibrium."
