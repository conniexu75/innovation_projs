https://openalex.org/W2914655152,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been associated with poor health status later in life. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between ACEs and health-related behaviors, chronic diseases, and mental health in adults.A cross-sectional study was performed with 1501 residents of Macheng, China. The ACE International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) was used to assess ACEs, including psychological, physical, and sexual forms of abuse, as well as household dysfunction. The main outcome variables were lifetime drinking status, lifetime smoking status, chronic diseases, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between overall ACE score and individual ACE component scores and risk behaviors/comorbidities in adulthood after controlling for potential confounders.A total of 66.2% of participants reported at least one ACE, and 5.93% reported four or more ACEs. Increased ACE scores were associated with increased risks of drinking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.09, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.00-1.09), chronic disease (AOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06-1.28), depression (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.27-1.48), and posttraumatic stress disorder (AOR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.23-1.42) in adulthood. After adjusting for confounding factors, the individual ACE components had different impacts on risk behavior and health, particularly on poor mental health outcomes in adulthood.ACEs during childhood were significantly associated with risk behaviors and poor health outcomes in adulthood, and different ACE components had different long-term effects on health outcomes in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2913428707,"How a neuron acquires an axon is a fundamental question. Piecemeal identification of many axonogenesis-related genes has been done, but coordinated regulation is unknown. Through unbiased transcriptome profiling of immature primary cortical neurons during early axon formation, we discovered an association between axonogenesis and neuron-specific alternative splicing. Known axonogenesis genes exhibit little expression alternation but widespread splicing changes. Axonogenesis-associated splicing is governed by RNA binding protein PTBP2, which is enriched in neurons and peaks around axonogenesis in the brain. Cortical depletion of PTBP2 prematurely induces axonogenesis-associated splicing, causes imbalanced expression of axonogenesis-associated isoforms, and specifically affects axon formation in vitro and in vivo. PTBP2-controlled axonogenesis-associated Shtn1 splicing determines SHTN1’s capacity to regulate actin interaction, polymerization, and axon growth. Precocious Shtn1 isoform switch contributes to disorganized axon formation of Ptbp2−/− neurons. We conclude that PTBP2-orchestrated alternative splicing programming is required for robust generation of a single axon in mammals."

A prospective observational study was carried out between October 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013. A sample of 247 individuals was initially selected. After a primary revision, 39 participants were excluded (clearly not meeting inclusion criteria, lack of data, or not agree to participate in the study), and finally a total of 208 participants were included in the analysis, 166 women, with an average age of 84.59 years, and 42 men, with an average age of 82.05. 54.80% of all cases were older than 85 years. The mean Barthel index value prior to fracture was 76.63, decreasing to 64.91 at one-year follow-up. Only 22.12% of patients achieved a full recovery for activities of daily living. A statistical analysis was performed by comparing Barthel index recovery depending on the values of Charlson and Pfeiffer indexes, respectively. The mean differences in Barthel index drop between the one-year follow-up and the hospital admission values were found statistical significant (p<0.01). These findings indicate that Charlson and Pfeiffer indexes clearly influence the Barthel index recovery. Low values of Charlson and Pfeiffer indexes resulted in better Barthel index recovery. In conclusion, the Barthel index is a good tool to evaluate the physical recovery after osteoporotic hip fracture."
https://openalex.org/W2911284627,"Lysyl oxidase-generated intermolecular cross-links are essential for the tensile strength of collagen fibrils. Two cross-linking pathways can be defined, one based on telopeptide lysine aldehydes and another on telopeptide hydroxylysine aldehydes. Since the 1970s it has been accepted that the mature cross-linking structures on the lysine aldehyde pathway, which dominates in skin and cornea, incorporate histidine residues. Here, using a range of MS-based methods, we re-examined this conclusion and found that telopeptide aldol dimerization is the primary mechanism for stable cross-link formation. The C-telopeptide aldol dimers formed labile addition products with glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine at α1(I)K87 in adjacent collagen molecules that resisted borohydride reduction and after acid hydrolysis produced histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL), but only from species with a histidine in their α1(I) C-telopeptide sequence. Peptide MS analyses and the lack of HHL formation in rat and mouse skin, species that lack an α1(I) C-telopeptide histidine, revealed that HHL is a laboratory artifact rather than a natural cross-linking structure. Our experimental results also establish that histidinohydroxymerodesmosine is produced by borohydride reduction of N-telopeptide allysine aldol dimers in aldimine intermolecular linkage to nonglycosylated α1(I) K930. Borohydride reduction of the aldimine promotes an accompanying base-catalyzed Michael addition of α1(I) H932 imidazole to the α,β-unsaturated aldol. These aldehydes are intramolecular at the N terminus but at the C terminus they can be both intramolecular and intermolecular according to present and earlier findings.

https://openalex.org/W2913117464,"Initially, the function of the fat mass and obesity associated (Fto) gene seemed to be primarily the regulation of the body weight. Here we show that loss of Fto results in a hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In consequence, Fto-/- mice display an anxiety-like behavior and impairments in working memory. Furthermore, differentiation of neurons is affected in the hippocampus. As a cause of these impairments we identified a processing defect of the neurotrophin BDNF which is most likely the result of a reduced expression of MMP-9. Therefore, we propose FTO as a possible new target to develop novel approaches for the treatment of diseases associated with hippocampal disorders. In parallel, we also would like to make the point that any anti-obesity therapy via blocking FTO function can have negative effects on the proper function of the hippocampus."

The Ethics and Society subproject is part of the core research project. Recognizing that its research may raise various ethical, social, and philosophical issues, the HBP has made the identification, examination, and management of those issues a top priority. The Ethics and Society subproject is part of the core research project. The Human Brain Project (HBP) is one of two European flagship projects with a 10-year horizon. It aims to contribute to an integrated understanding of the human brain by providing a European brain research infrastructure that is intended for both neuroscience and neuro-inspired research as well as intense data sharing and collaboration on one of the most demanding scientific challenges of the 21st century. The human brain is an exceptional organ—it is the basis of our cognition, emotion, ability to act, language, memory, consciousness, and self-consciousness. Furthermore, due to its complexity, knowledge of the brain requires an integrative, multimodal, and multiscale approach—from signal molecules and genes, neuronal and glial cells, and microcircuits up to large networks with numerous, interconnected brain regions. The fact that approximately 86 billion nerve cells, each with approximately 10,000 synapses, interact in a dynamic manner with each other illustrates the challenge that the project faces. The analysis of the human brain will provide new insights into the uniqueness of each human being and into the common biological basis of humankind embedded into the evolution of our species. Such knowledge has important practical applications, for example, the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools and even the prevention of brain diseases. The human brain and human behavior have developed during evolution by mutation, selection, and adaptive introgression, and they change structurally and functionally at each of the different developmental stages—from the embryonic and fetal periods through childhood, adulthood, and old age by progressive and regressive processes. The brain has reacted and will react to constantly changing physical, social, and cultural conditions by “cultural recycling” (Dehaene and Cohen, 2007Dehaene S. Cohen L. Cultural recycling of cortical maps.Neuron. 2007; 56: 384-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), “synaptic epigenesis” (Changeux, 2017Changeux J.P. Climbing brain levels of organisation from genes to consciousness.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21 (Published online Feb 1, 2017): 168-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and “bio-cultural feedback” (D’Ambrosio and Colagè, 2017D’Ambrosio P. Colagè I. Extending epigenesis: from phenotypic plasticity to the bio-cultural feedback.Biol. Philos. 2017; 32: 705-728Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All these conditions and biological mechanisms enable us to adapt to changing environments in a globalized world and highlight the “history of the brain.” Facing the extraordinary complexity of the human brain and the various perspectives ranging from basic, natural science to ethical and philosophical questions, the HBP has set up a roadmap to combine empirical and theoretical neuroscience with brain-inspired development in computing, data science, and robotics. Simulation is considered a central strategy to test models which are constrained by experimental data and to predict features that could then be tested again in the lab. Simulation alone, however, is not capable of decoding human brain complexity, since the models and the outcomes of simulation have to be constrained, sometimes going beyond wet lab research. Therefore, the HBP supplements simulation with big-data analysis, relying on sophisticated workflows and tools of analysis including deep and machine learning methods as well as statistical tools, image analysis, and processing. This requires considerable computing resources, sometimes exceeding those available in the fastest supercomputers. Data safety and security become increasingly important when large amounts of data from healthy subjects and patients are processed. To provide and share data, to combine data from different sources, and to avoid acquiring the same data because of missing information are challenges that require a dedicated infrastructure such as the HBP Joint Platform. The significance given to neuroethics within the HBP responds to two factors. First, from the start, the HBP has recognized that its research may raise various ethical, social, and philosophical issues. Thus, identifying, examining, and addressing them has always been a top priority. Second, the project is funded by the European Commission in the framework of the EU’s Horizon2020 program, which actively promotes responsible research and innovation (RRI). RRI is generally understood as an interactive process that engages multiple stakeholders who must be mutually and jointly responsive and work toward the ethical permissibility of both research and its products. RRI calls for aligning science and technology with societal needs and for addressing the legal, ethical, and social dimensions of research and innovation by focusing not just on outcomes, but also on the examination of the values that inform the trajectory of the scientific work and that feed into the research agenda itself. The HBP’s Ethics and Society Subproject is tasked with carrying out ethical, social, and philosophical analyses and with developing, broadening, and enhancing RRI into all HBP research (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/social-ethical-reflective/). The Ethics and Society Subproject is not external to the HBP but embedded in it: it is part of the core research project itself, funded with approximately 4.5% of the overall budget. It is structured around a number of inter-related activities; these range from early identification of the ethical, social, and philosophical concerns raised both by potential HBP research developments and their implications to engagement with public and private stakeholders in an attempt to strengthen public dialogue and empower those likely to be affected by HBP research via organization of citizens meetings and stakeholder dialogs (Figure 1) (http://www.tekno.dk/project/human-brain-project/?lang=en). Ethics Support carries out applied ethics research (for example, research ethics) and—together with the external Ethics Advisory Board, the Ethics Rapporteur Programme, and the Point of Registration (PORE) for ethics, regulatory and social concerns—provides the tools to ensure that the issues raised by HBP research subprojects are transparently communicated and managed and that HBP researchers comply with ethical codes and legal statutes. Lastly, the Ethics and Society Subproject includes an area devoted specifically to neuroethical and philosophical reflection and research. Within the HBP, neuroethical reflection is also intended to open up a different, productive space for carrying out theoretical analysis and to offer distinctive and possibly complementary approaches to the issues investigated by empirical science, examining key neuroscientific and philosophical notions (e.g., consciousness, or human versus artificial intelligence), thereby also contributing to the understanding of HBP research itself. The underlying idea is that, in addition to normative issues, other concerns such as the role of neuroscientific research in assessing fundamental topics (e.g., what makes us human) need to be addressed. In this respect, conceptual analysis of key scientific notions and a focus on the epistemic and ontological aspects (beliefs about knowledge and reality) embedded in the research process (e.g., in the framing of scientific questions) facilitate a more integrated picture of, and a more informed link between, neuroscientific findings and philosophical notions and questions (Salles et al., 2018Salles A. Evers K. Farisco M. Neuroethics and philosophy in responsible research and innovation: the case of the human brain project.Neuroethics. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12152-018-9372-9Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HBP’s IT-based strategy to integrate neuroscientific data from around the world requires not only compliance with the relevant data protection legislation but also the design and development of mechanisms and infrastructure to manage the issues raised by each phase of data collection, storage, access, curation, retention, destruction, security, processing, and analysis. The challenges posed are partly due to a massive increase in the volume, modality, and dimensionality of data generated by novel neuroscientific instruments for imaging and activity recordings and by increased reliance on novel technical and analytical approaches to exploiting neuroscience data. In addition, data about the brain raise particularly strong concerns in many people. The Data Protection and Privacy Opinion has shaped the project-wide approach to data governance (https://sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io/public-website-production/filer_public/24/0e/240e2eaa-8a10-4a17-87bc-b056a3f0cc8c/opinion_on_data_protection_and_privacy_done_01.pdf). The Opinion draws on the expertise of the researchers in the social sciences and the humanities involved in the HBP ethics and society work, including members of the Ethics Advisory Board (EAB), the Ethics Rapporteurs, and members of the Foresight Lab, the Neuroethics and Philosophy Group, Public Engagement, and Ethics Support in the Ethics and Society Subproject. This document identifies some of the main privacy-related concerns within HBP, undertakes a conceptual and neuroethical analysis of some of the more contested notions—e.g., brain privacy—articulates the basic ethical principles that should guide examination of the issues, presents a brief overview of the public’s view of privacy and the HBP, and provides a review of the history of data protection and regulation in Europe. Finally, it offers recommendations intended to minimize potential risks while securing the public benefit anticipated from HBP research. In order to facilitate the development and implementation of responsible data governance in the HBP, interconnected structures and roles have been created. They respond to the challenges of innovative neuro-ICT research in an international, collaborative context while contributing to the open science agenda and supporting data protection (Stahl et al., 2018Stahl B.C. Rainey S. Harris E. Fothergill B.T. The role of ethics in data governance of large neuro-ICT projects.J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 2018; 25: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Data Protection Officer supports Data Protection Impact Assessments; for supporting legislative compliance, the Compliance Manager ensures project-wide compliance with the relevant European (Horizon 2020) ethics requirements; and internal data type experts evaluate and ensure that aspects of study documentation align with the requisite legal frameworks. Lastly, the Data Governance Working Group develops project-specific data policy, processes, and workflows and supports the development of an infrastructure for each step of the data life cycle. In addressing the relevant concerns pragmatically, the HBP categorizes data to identify and clarify the ethical issues raised. Specific ethics review processes and controls have been developed for each type: human research data, human clinical data, non-human animal data, and model data. This is necessary both to prevent potential harm caused by the data generated, analyzed, or shared and to clearly define the conditions that apply to the use of the data. The considerations above are balanced against the societal benefits of open science, including the need for increased credibility of published scientific literature and accelerated discovery, which requires extensive data sharing. While incentives for data sharing are not well established in neuroscience communities, the HBP’s perspective is that implementing systems for data citation and contribution tracking will encourage researchers not only to publish reports but also to share data, improve study reproducibility, and increase transparency. To apply the key FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable [https://www.go-fair.org/], the HBP developed and operates the HBP Knowledge Graph (KG), which stores curated metadata for all HBP published data. But while FAIR is generally positive, there are cases where its application must be limited to fulfil ethical and legal imperatives (e.g., anonymization of personal data). Secure analytics systems to query federated databases of human clinical and research data without access to personal information (e.g., as conceptualized for the HBP Medical Informatics Platform) are designed in part to address some privacy and data protection concerns. In summary, the HBP attempts to manage data governance responsibly through collaborative project-wide policy development and the cultivation of key roles, groups, and dialogues at multiple project levels, reflecting the interests of stakeholders while supporting open science. Considering that the different brain initiatives have recognized the importance of data stewardship and data protection (for example, the Canberra Declaration; https://brainalliance.org.au/learn/media-releases/worlds-brain-initiatives-move-forward-together/), we expect to foster and support intensive international collaboration centering on the identification of high-priority data related issues and the development of infrastructure and the appropriate policies. In a recently published article, a group of neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and policy makers identify five key neuroethics questions and additional subquestions that can be usefully addressed across all national-level brain initiatives (Rommelfanger et al., 2018Rommelfanger K.S. Jeong S.J. Ema A. Fukushi T. Kasai K. Ramos K.M. Salles A. Singh I. Global Neuroethics Summit DelegatesNeuroethics questions to guide ethical research in the international brain initiatives.Neuron. 2018; 100: 19-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The article is the result of the first meeting of the Global Neuroethics Summit last year in South Korea; the goal of the questions is to promote a culturally aware discussion of some of the main issues (ethical and conceptual) raised by research in the different brain projects. There are several topics in the HBP research agenda that engage those questions. One of them (NEQN 2: what are the ethical standards of biological material and data collection, and how do local standards compare with those of global collaborators?), was discussed above. But additional fields of inquiry within the HBP are relevant to addressing the other questions identified in the article as well, particularly those about the moral significance of engineered neural circuitry; about the potential of brain interventions to affect autonomy; about the potential impact of a biological model or neuroscientific account of disease on individuals, communities, and societies; and about possible uses and misuses of neuroscience. These are outlined below. Studies on consciousness are central within the HBP efforts to describe and understand the human brain and to further enhance our knowledge of human beings. They are also central to addressing questions about moral significance (of humans, animals, and even potentially machines). Empirical, theoretical, clinical, and conceptual research is carried out by different HBP research groups, from systems and cognitive neuroscience and theoretical neuroscience to neuroethics and philosophy. New ways to measure consciousness levels, presently being tested by empirical neuroscientists, are potentially very helpful in clinical contexts: for example, in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and minimally conscious state. Such research might also impact how some psychiatric disorders are understood. In collaboration with empirical scientists, philosophers from the HBP are developing a new conceptual model, i.e., intrinsic consciousness theory (Farisco et al., 2017Farisco M. Laureys S. Evers K. The intrinsic activity of the brain and its relation to levels and disorders of consciousness.Mind Matter. 2017; 15: 197-219Google Scholar), and investigating its clinical and ethical implications, specifically with respect to people unable to communicate verbally like infants and people with disorders of consciousness (Evers, 2016Evers K. Neurotechnological assessment of consciousness disorders: five ethical imperatives.Dialogues Clin. Neurosci. 2016; 18: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, attention is given to the impact of computer science on consciousness. The question of whether artificial systems have the potential to develop consciousness and how this could be determined, as well as the relevance that consciousness might have for (natural or artificial) “intelligence” (topics we address next), attracts a broad audience. The HBP neurorobotics platform connects spiking neural networks to virtual and real robots. It links brain research to information technology by using research data and models of cognition and behavior. While some basic types of behavior (i.e., visual-motor control) are understood in reasonable detail and their transfer to neurorobotics is increasingly within reach, the biological basis of others, including complex patterns of behavior, consciousness, and sentience is less clear. The neuroscientific notion of sentience, key for understanding the moral significance of engineered neural circuitry, is difficult to define and measure given its primarily experiential, first-person nature (the “other minds” problem). The HBP is progressing research to understand it, including the possibility of “islands of consciousness” in damaged brains (Storm et al., 2017Storm J.F. Boly M. Casali A.G. Massimini M. Olcese U. Pennartz C.M.A. Wilke M. Consciousness regained: disentangling mechanisms, brain systems, and behavioral responses.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 10882-10893Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These islands are important with respect to sentience because they might suggest the possibility of creating consciousness, or some form of sentience, in AI or robots that embody only a partial or simplified model of the brain (Prescott, 2017Prescott J.P. Robots are not just tools.Connect. Sci. 2017; 29: 142-149Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One long-standing issue is the distinction between simulation and emulation, and the question of whether and under what circumstances simulated minds could have experiential properties. Another is biocentrism, the view that all living things have inherent value by virtue of their biological nature. While biocentrism brings a greater range of organisms into the scope of moral consideration, as a result of the sufficiency of “biology” for moral value, any evidence that leads us to ascribe sentience to machines would present a challenge to the assumption that only living systems are subjects of moral consideration. If a machine instantiated the properties sufficient for some degree of moral status, how we treat it would matter (i.e., it could be harmed and/or wronged) even if we were unable to know that it instantiated those properties. So, how should we proceed given epistemic uncertainty regarding machine sentience, sapience, or self-awareness? At what point of machine complexity would it be better to err on the side of assuming that the machine has some degree of moral status? And what degree of moral status should be presumptively ascribed to a machine under such circumstances? An explicit goal of the Human Brain Project is to further our understanding of what “makes us human.” Additional expected consequences of brain research are the development and applications of neuro-technology to alleviate symptoms or enhance the human brain. But those neurointerventions may also change our cognitive and emotional faculties, eventually impact our freedom and autonomy, and even change our views of what human beings are. Within neuroethics, there is a lively debate on how manipulating the brain can affect and maybe threaten human autonomy and identity. In practice, expressions of fear regarding the potentially autonomy-reducing or dehumanizing aspect of brain machine interfaces, robotics, or even deep brain stimulation procedures can, at least partially, be explained by the prevalence of different, often muddled conceptions. Thus, the plausibility of the discussion itself about neuroscience’s and neuro-technologies’ potential impact on human agency in particular and on what makes us human in general rests on notions such as “agency,” “humanity,” and “identity” that require a careful conceptual examination. Taking recent neuroscientific research on cultural imprinting on brain architecture as a starting point (Changeux, 2017Changeux J.P. Climbing brain levels of organisation from genes to consciousness.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21 (Published online Feb 1, 2017): 168-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), philosophers in the HBP are revisiting the main questions and conceptually analyzing the relevant philosophical and scientific notions. While much HBP neuroscientific research is directed toward medical use, it can also be used for additional civilian and military applications. Dual use, a term used to address this possibility, raises conceptual, ethical, societal, and regulatory concerns. To address them, the Ethics and Society subproject has written the Opinion on Responsible Dual Use. The Opinion (https://sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io/public-website-production/filer_public/f8/f0/f8f09276-d370-4758-ad03-679fa1c57e95/hbp-ethics-society-2018-opinion-on-dual-use.pdf) is intended to clarify operative terms (emphasizing the importance of focusing on possible domains, types, and developments of brain research that could be used for political, military, and/or warfare purposes of concern), address emerging neuroscientific research that could have dual-use capabilities, identify the ethical issues raised, examine ethical approaches employed to assess and guide dual-use brain science, and analyze international frameworks for regulating and governing both research and use of weaponizable brain science. It also develops recommendations regarding engagement, scope, and conduct of dual-use brain science that are both directly applicable to the HBP and that may serve as a basis for wider application and use within the international neuroscientific and regulatory policy communities. In particular, the Opinion proposes that the identification of which uses are of concern be based on the applications of the principles of responsible research and innovation that allow for a distinction between responsible and irresponsible research and technological development. Recognizing the important implications of HBP research, the project has given ethical, social, and philosophical reflection a key role. From its beginning, the HBP has introduced a set of structures and mechanisms intended to make sure that neuroscience, neuro-medicine, and neuro-inspired technology are carried out in a responsible way for the benefit of individuals as well as societies. For this goal to be achieved, we need a dynamic and interdisciplinary collaboration. Many of the research disciplines involved (e.g., computing, big-data analytics, simulation, and AI) develop rapidly and pose novel challenges. We must make sure that our theoretical concepts —whether scientific, ethical, or philosophical—are informed by the rapid progress of technology and are relevant to understanding and managing its actual and potential directions. With such conceptual tools, we can proceed to identify and safeguard potential benefits as well as foresee and manage potential risks and provide a platform for societal dialogue in this field, addressing people’s concerns and expectations."
https://openalex.org/W2911437220,"Neurotransmitter release can be synchronous and occur within milliseconds of action potential invasion, or asynchronous and persist for tens of milliseconds. The molecular determinants of release kinetics remain poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that asynchronous release dominates when fast Synaptotagmin isoforms are far from calcium channels or when specialized sensors, such as Synaptotagmin 7, are abundant. Here we test these hypotheses for GABAergic projections onto neurons of the inferior olive, where release in different subnuclei ranges from synchronous to asynchronous. Surprisingly, neither of the leading hypotheses accounts for release kinetics. Instead, we find that rapid Synaptotagmin isoforms are abundant in subnuclei with synchronous release but absent where release is asynchronous. Viral expression of Synaptotagmin 1 transforms asynchronous synapses into synchronous ones. Thus, the nervous system controls levels of fast Synaptotagmin isoforms to regulate release kinetics and thereby controls the ability of synapses to encode spike rates or precise timing."
https://openalex.org/W2914346470,"Calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) is a fundamental autoregulatory mechanism in CaV1 and CaV2 voltage-gated calcium channels. Although CDI initiates with the cytoplasmic calcium sensor, how this event causes CDI has been elusive. Here, we show that a conserved selectivity filter (SF) domain II (DII) aspartate is essential for CDI. Mutation of this residue essentially eliminates CDI and leaves key channel biophysical characteristics untouched. DII mutants regain CDI by placing an aspartate at the analogous SF site in DIII or DIV, but not DI, indicating that CaV SF asymmetry is key to CDI. Together, our data establish that the CaV SF is the CDI endpoint. Discovery of this SF CDI gate recasts the CaV inactivation paradigm, placing it squarely in the framework of voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily members in which SF-based gating is important. This commonality suggests that SF inactivation is an ancient process arising from the shared VGIC pore architecture."

While earlier approaches in neuroscience have often focused on the functioning of specific cell types or brain regions in isolation, BRAIN 2025 aims to foster innovation through investigating the dynamic interrelations of these varied components within circuits. BRAIN 2025 focuses on neural circuitry not only because of its critical role in brain function, but also because circuit dysfunction is the basis of the symptoms and disability in many neurological, mental, and substance use disorders. In many such disorders (including substance use and chronic pain), there is no evident brain pathology or lesion that can explain the grave disability experienced by afflicted persons. Progress in treatment for these conditions is likely to require a fuller understanding of the function of brain circuits. Even in the case of conditions such as stroke where discrete pathologies are known, treatment is limited by our abilities to monitor and precisely modulate brain circuit function. According to the 2016 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, the top 25 causes of disability-adjusted life years, a function of premature mortality and healthy years of life lost to disability, include cerebrovascular disease (stroke), low back and neck pain, depressive disorders, self-harm, Alzheimer’s disease, and migraine (GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2016GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.Lancet. 2016; 388: 1459-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4101) Google Scholar). The early onset of most neuropsychiatric disorders, and their chronic or recurrent courses, makes this class of disorders the greatest contributor to disability and economic loss worldwide (Whiteford et al., 2013Whiteford H.A. Degenhardt L. Rehm J. Baxter A.J. Ferrari A.J. Erskine H.E. Charlson F.J. Norman R.E. Flaxman A.D.

There is a powerful imperative to develop an improved understanding of the circuits underlying these disorders, along with better diagnostics, and safer and more effective treatments. The United States BRAIN Initiative is one of several international brain projects that are increasing investments in neuroscience research (Brose, 2016Brose K. Global neuroscience.Neuron. 2016; 92: 557-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Among these projects with complementary areas of emphasis, the NIH BRAIN Initiative uniquely focuses its mission on seven scientific priority areas (Figure 1). Together, these priorities support the overall goal of understanding how the nervous system processes massive amounts of information, in real time, to generate our experience of the world and our actions in it. Bioethics is a well-established discipline, focused on the ethics of biomedical research including the protection of human research participants, and grounded in existing ethical principles such as those found in the Belmont Report: respect of persons, beneficence, and justice. Neuroethics is a newer field that rests on the belief that there are unique ethical considerations in studying the brain, and advances in our understanding of the brain and our ability to record and modulate brain function can challenge or transform our understanding of the human mind and human identity. Thus, neuroethics includes considerations beyond the scope of traditional bioethics such as cognitive or behavioral predictions based on neuroscience (e.g., that might be used to assign educational or vocational opportunities); drawing conclusions about past or future decision-making and behavior based on evidence from brain data; interventions in the brain that might influence personal identity, memory, impulsivity, or cognitive control; interpretation of decision-making capacity (e.g., in a psychotic or addicted person, or a person with closed-loop brain stimulation); and how the construction of better models of human brains, such as three-dimensional in vitro cell culture systems known as brain organoids, leads us to the question of when and to what degree a model becomes an object of concern for our existing ethical framework. Exploring these questions represents a unique opportunity for the NIH BRAIN Initiative to enrich the work of the broader neuroscience community. The NIH, including through the NIH BRAIN Initiative, is committed to research that adheres to the highest ethical standards, and all research NIH supports is expected to follow existing policy and laws regarding the protection of human research participants. Since the inception of the BRAIN Initiative, the Initiative has endeavored to integrate neuroethics into its science. When the BRAIN Initiative began in 2013, the U.S. Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues embarked on a two-year process of engaging with the scientific community, the public, and other stakeholders to proactively identify a set of core ethical standards both to guide neuroscience research and to address some of the ethical issues likely to be prompted by the application of neuroscience research findings. The Commission published a two-volume report entitled Gray Matters, which strongly endorses proactive integration of neuroethics into any neuroscience research endeavor (https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/node/3543.html). That notion of integration is at the heart of the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s neuroethics strategy, which emphasizes proactive, ongoing assessment of the neuroethical implications of the development and application of BRAIN-funded tools and neurotechnologies (Bianchi et al., 2018Bianchi D.W. Cooper J.A. Gordon J.A. Heemskerk J. Hodes R. Koob G.F. Koroshetz W.J. Shurtleff D. Sieving P.A. Volkow N.D. et al.Neuroethics for the National Institutes of Health BRAIN Initiative.J. Neurosci. 2018; 38: 10583-10585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The NIH BRAIN Initiative receives input from multiple sources, including an external Multi-Council Working Group (MCWG), a group of experts who provide ongoing perspective on the long-term scientific vision of the Initiative in the context of the evolving neuroscience landscape. Given the importance of neuroethics for the success of the Initiative, in addition to its importance across all NIH neuroscience efforts, the MCWG includes a dedicated Neuroethics Working Group (NEWG) comprising both neuroethicists and neuroscientists to provide expert input on neuroethics and help ensure that neuroethical considerations are fully integrated into the Initiative (https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group). The NEWG recently published a set of Neuroethics Guiding Principles, intended primarily for BRAIN Initiative researchers, to frame and help navigate the neuroethical questions that BRAIN-funded research may prompt (Greely et al., 2018Greely H.T. Grady C. Ramos K.M. Chiong W. Eberwine J. Farahany N.A. Johnson L.S.M. Hyman B.T. Hyman S.E. Rommelfanger K.S. Serrano E.E. Neuroethics guiding principles for the NIH BRAIN Initiative.J. Neurosci. 2018; 38: 10586-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar; Figure 1). These Guiding Principles provide an overarching framework intended to inform a public dialog among a highly interdisciplinary group of stakeholders—investigators, clinicians, legal scholars, philosophers, institutional review boards that oversee human research, funders, research participants, patients, and the public—regarding the design and conduct of research, the implications of the resulting advances on our understanding of human brain function, and the risks and benefits of interventions into the brain. The principles echo the neuroethics questions formulated at the 2017 Global Neuroethics Summit, for example urging researchers to work to share widely the benefits of neuroscience research and resulting technologies. Though the Guiding Principles are focused on the NIH BRAIN Initiative, they may prove useful to others engaged in cutting-edge technology development and research. The NEWG organizes topical workshops that enable dialog regarding different areas of the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s research portfolio, bringing together stakeholders representing neuroscience, neurosurgery, neuroethics, philosophy, law, and more. Recent workshops have focused on research with human neural tissue, and human neuroscience research utilizing novel invasive and non-invasive neural devices (discussed below). These workshops provide opportunities for discussion on how to advance cutting-edge neuroscience research in the most ethical manner. These neuroethics-focused activities form part of a growing international effort by groups engaged in neuroethics work that is focused on modern neuroscience advancements (for discussion, see Rommelfanger et al., 2018Rommelfanger K.S. Jeong S.J. Ema A. Fukushi T. Kasai K. Ramos K.M. Salles A. Singh I. Global Neuroethics Summit DelegatesNeuroethics questions to guide ethical research in the International Brain Initiatives.Neuron. 2018; 100: 19-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Internal to the NIH, a neuroethics project team comprising NIH scientific program staff ensures the integration of neuroethics as NIH leadership decide which applications to fund, informed by the peer review process, and throughout ongoing oversight of funded grants. The project team’s efforts are informed by the Guiding Principles and the topical workshops organized by the NEWG. Additionally, the project team gathers neuroethics questions elicited by BRAIN-funded research and leverages the NEWG to explore and address these questions. The project team also considers these questions in their efforts to build a growing neuroethics research portfolio. Informed by a 2016 Request for Information that solicited public input on BRAIN-related neuroethics questions amenable to research, the NIH published a funding opportunity announcement (FOA) in 2017 to support research on the ethical implications of advancements in neurotechnology and brain science supported by the NIH BRAIN Initiative. The FOA was reissued in FY2018 and FY2019, with application due dates through FY2021 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-19-400.html). To date, nine R01 grants awarded under this FOA are addressing key neuroethical issues. The project team also promotes neuroethics training through BRAIN-supported training mechanisms, and administrative supplements to embed neuroethics in existing NIH BRAIN Initiative grants. The authors of BRAIN 2025 anticipated that rapid advances in neuroscience may merit revisiting the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s strategic plan. To that end, a working group of the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director (ACD), the highest-level advisory committee at the NIH, is working to update BRAIN 2025 in light of the cutting-edge tools and neurotechnologies developed through the Initiative, and the scientific possibilities they unlock. Neuroethics is integral to this effort, and NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins tasked a Neuroethics Subgroup of the ACD working group to develop a “Neuroethics Roadmap” that will characterize the potential neuroethical implications of the development and use of new neurotechnologies supported by the NIH BRAIN Initiative. A preliminary draft of this report is anticipated in spring of 2019 followed by an opportunity for public input, with the final report delivered to the ACD in June 2019. Once the updated strategic plan and Neuroethics Roadmap are approved, NIH staff will use them to shape the second half of the Initiative. The Neuroethics Roadmap will complement the Neuroethics Guiding Principles as an overarching framework for the Initiative, and the NEWG will continue to provide expert input on neuroethics questions that arise and help ensure that neuroethical considerations are integrated into the science. The NIH BRAIN Initiative, and other similar efforts focused on understanding the brain, will raise familiar bioethical issues pertaining to research conducted with human participants, such as questions about acceptable degrees of risk, necessary levels of antecedent evidence before conducting human trials, consent capacity, and the tension between data sharing and privacy. These issues can be more trenchant in the context of neuroscience research with novel neurotechnologies, as compared with other areas of biomedicine. For instance, concerns are heightened when considering acceptable degrees of risk for people receiving experimental deep brain stimulation to treat intractable mental illness, given that such interventions in the brain may affect the patient’s mind. In other instances, ethical issues beyond the scope of traditional bioethics may arise because the brain is the organ of the mind and, for many, is believed to be the seat of the self. For example, emphasizing a mechanistic explanation of brain function may conflict with societal conceptions of personhood, individuality, and free will. In a sense, this is an example of the first question (Neuroethics Question [NeQN] 1) developed at the 2017 Global Neuroethics Summit: What is the potential impact of a neuroscientific account of healthy mental function on individuals, communities, and society? Further, novel neurotechnologies may enable not only measurement of brain activity underlying thoughts and moods but also precise modulation of that activity, which will raise ethical, legal, and societal questions, including questions regarding how such interventions might affect autonomy, and who bears responsibility for such effects. This is captured by NeQN 4. Two specific examples serve to illustrate the nature of neuroethical questions elicited by NIH BRAIN Initiative research. The first pertains to research with human neural tissue, including ex vivo brain tissue and brain organoids. The NIH BRAIN Initiative’s NEWG held a workshop on this topic in March 2018 to explore the state of the science and attendant ethical considerations (https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/nihbrainneuroethicssummarymarch2018_508c.pdf). Ex vivo brain tissue, ranging from small cubes of tissue removed during surgical procedures to whole animal brains and potentially whole human brains, is particularly well suited for studying intact brain circuits, along with visualization and reconstruction of detailed cell structure, and genetic analysis. This evolving approach allows researchers to investigate genetic and electrical properties of cell types and neural circuitry at unprecedented levels of resolution (Ting et al., 2018Ting J.T. Kalmbach B. Chong P. de Frates R. Keene C.D. Gwinn R.P. Cobbs C. Ko A.L. Ojemann J.G. Ellenbogen R.G. et al.A robust ex vivo experimental platform for molecular-genetic dissection of adult human neocortical cell types and circuits.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Brain organoids are three-dimensional multicellular structures derived from pluripotent stem cells, grown in culture systems to resemble parts of the developing human brain. They represent a new avenue of research, one that is still being explored and refined by scientists, and which holds great potential for shedding light on human brain development and function in health and disease. Brain organoids may serve as useful predictive models of brain disorders specific to certain genetic mutations, including monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders such as Timothy syndrome. They may also help translate therapeutic approaches from animal models into clinical practice (Amin and Paşca, 2018Amin N.D. Paşca S.P. Building models of brain disorders with three-dimensional organoids.Neuron. 2018; 100: 389-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and could bridge the gap when there are no models for novel diseases, such as microcephaly associated with the Zika virus outbreak of 2016 (Qian et al., 2017Qian X. Nguyen H.N. Jacob F. Song H. Ming G.L. Using brain organoids to understand Zika virus-induced microcephaly.Development. 2017; 144: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Research with ex vivo brain tissue and brain organoids raises a number of neuroethical questions, including NeQN 3: What is the moral significance of neural systems that are under development in neuroscience research laboratories? And further, what functions or capacities would need to be present in a human brain model to lend it moral significance? Exploring these questions may inform a related one: What is appropriate stewardship for human brain organoids or ex vivo brain tissue? This reflects NeQN 2b: Should special regard be given to brain tissue and its donors due to the origin of the tissue and its past? In addition to the Initiative’s NEWG deliberations on these questions, BRAIN-funded investigators working with these model systems are actively engaged in considering and addressing the unique ethical issues raised by these research approaches. A second example of ethical questions elicited by BRAIN Initiative research pertains to basic neuroscience research made possible by direct access to brain recording and stimulation from invasive surgical procedures—i.e., conducting in vivo neuroscience research with patients undergoing neurosurgery for clinical indications, who elect to allow researchers access to their brains for research purposes during those surgeries. For example, some patients with epilepsy who have electrodes implanted to monitor their seizures may agree to permit researchers to implant additional electrode arrays to enable recording of brain activity via electrocorticography. These studies are reviewed and approved by institutional review boards and, like all NIH-funded research, are guided by ethical frameworks based on NIH policy and U.S. law. This cutting-edge work raises familiar bioethical questions about acceptable risk and informed consent, but because the brain is the organ of the mind, neuroethical implications include, for example, questions about how interventions may affect cognition, consent capacity, decision-making, and voluntary participation. The NIH BRAIN Initiative held a workshop in October 2017 and a meeting in August 2018 to explore these issues, with a publication planned that will offer relevant points to consider for investigators and institutional review boards. Additionally, the BRAIN-funded investigators working in this space are actively engaged in collaboration with ethicists to ensure ongoing deliberation on the unique ethical issues raised by human neuroscience research. Large investments in neuroscience research around the world hold the potential to unlock unprecedented understanding of how the brain works and how to treat brain disorders. As national brain projects continue to develop around the world, there remains ongoing emphasis on global conversations about shared opportunities and challenges in neuroscience, and collaborative international efforts to overcome those challenges and maximize success. For example, the NIH has memoranda of understanding with Brain Canada, the Lundbeck Foundation of Denmark, and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council to promote international collaboration on NIH BRAIN Initiative projects. More broadly, the emergence of the International Brain Initiative underscores the interest in coordination and synergy between the various brain projects around the world. Embedding robust neuroethics efforts within these large neuroscience research programs is an important step to ensure the ethical conduct of research and the ethical application and use of resultant research findings. As is the case for neuroscience, coordination across brain projects around the world in the space of neuroethics has the potential to strengthen our collective efforts through sharing lessons learned and best practices. Multinational partnerships also invite new ideas and new approaches that may deepen our cross-cultural understanding of neuroscience advances and their ethical, legal, and social implications. This, in turn, maximizes the potential for international scientific collaboration and for reaping the benefits of neuroscience advances. Rommelfanger et al., 2018Rommelfanger K.S. Jeong S.J. Ema A. Fukushi T. Kasai K. Ramos K.M. Salles A. Singh I. Global Neuroethics Summit DelegatesNeuroethics questions to guide ethical research in the International Brain Initiatives.Neuron. 2018; 100: 19-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar discussed that the various brain projects will likely share human brain data, prompting questions around privacy. For example: Are brain data revealing or stigmatizing in ways that are unique compared to other biomedical data, or to data derived from psychological research? Exploring such questions while navigating cultural norms that differentially define and operationalize privacy will be complex, and proactive consideration of these ethical questions will maximize the ability to make use of, and learn from, human brain data. Neuroethics is an essential partner to neuroscience, serving to anticipate and address ethical questions raised by neuroscience research, and to help guide the progress of the field. In our modern inter-connected world, international collaboration in neuroscience and neuroethics is essential to realize the transformative potential of understanding brain function, and to address the attendant implications for human self-understanding and society through a cross-cultural lens.

https://openalex.org/W2913850011,"The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), specifically exosomes, in intercellular communication likely plays a key role in placental orchestration of pregnancy and maternal immune sensing of the fetus. While murine models are powerful tools to study pregnancy and maternal-fetal immune interactions, in contrast to human placental exosomes, the content of murine placental and pregnancy exosomes remains largely understudied. Using a recently developed in vitro culture technique, murine trophoblast stem cells derived from B6 mice were differentiated into syncytial-like cells. EVs from the conditioned media, as well as from pregnant and non-pregnant sera, were enriched for exosomes. The RNA composition of these murine trophoblast-derived and pregnancy-associated exosome-enriched-EVs (ExoE-EVs) was determined using RNA-sequencing analysis and expression levels confirmed by qRT-PCR. Differentially abundant miRNAs were detected in syncytial differentiated ExoE-EVs, particularly from the X chromosome cluster (mmu-miR-322-3p, mmu-miR-322-5p, mmu-miR-503-5p, mmu-miR-542-3p, and mmu-miR-450a-5p). These were confirmed to be increased in pregnant mouse sera ExoE-EVs by qRT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, fifteen miRNAs were only present within the pregnancy-derived ExoE-EVs compared to non-pregnant controls. Mmu-miR-292-3p and mmu-miR-183-5p were noted to be some of the most abundant miRNAs in syncytial ExoE-EVs and were also present at higher levels in pregnant versus non-pregnant sera ExoE-EVs. The bioinformatics tool, MultiMir, was employed to query publicly available databases of predicted miRNA-target interactions. This analysis reveals that the X-chromosome miRNAs are predicted to target ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and intracellular signaling pathways. Knowing the cargo of placental and pregnancy-specific ExoE-EVs as well as the predicted biological targets informs studies using murine models to examine not only maternal-fetal immune interactions but also the physiologic consequences of placental-maternal communication."

However, this procedure, which replaces the patient's variant transthyretin with the WT protein, can fail to stop subsequent cardiac deposition, ultimately requiring heart transplantation. We recently showed that preformed amyloid fibrils present in the heart at the time of surgery can template or seed further amyloid aggregation of native transthyretin. Here we assess possible interventions to halt this seeding, using biochemical and EM assays. We found that chemical or mutational stabilization of the transthyretin tetramer does not hinder amyloid seeding. In contrast, binding of the peptide inhibitor TabFH2 to ex vivo fibrils efficiently inhibits amyloid seeding by impeding self-association of the amyloid-driving strands F and H in a tissue-independent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2911777692,"Birds are commonly used as bio-indicators of the quality of environments and the changes to them. Therefore, ecologists put a lot of effort into the monitoring of their population trends. One of the methods used for bird population monitoring is autonomous sound recording. Current studies provide inconsistent results when the number of detected species by autonomous sound recorders was compared with that delivered by an observer. In our study, observers counted birds using a point-count method at 64 random points in forest and farmland. At the same points, autonomous sound recorders recorded the soundscape four separate times (including counting by observer period) and the species present in the recordings were later identified by observers in the lab. We compared the number of species detected by simultaneous observations and recordings, as well as the number of species detected by recorders during four different surveys. Additionally, we calculated the Sorensen index to compare the species composition during different surveys at the same point. We found that observers detected more species than autonomous sound recorders. However, differences in the number of detected species were habitat dependent-observers detected more species than recorders in farmland, but not in the forest. When the time for recording was doubled, recorders were more effective than observers during a single survey. The average Sorensen index between the four repeated surveys performed by autonomous sound recorders ranged from 0.58 to 0.67, however we did not find significant differences in the number of species detected during different surveys conducted at the same point. Our study showed that 10-minutes sampling from the same point gives various species composition estimates but not species richness estimates between different surveys. Therefore, even when recorders detect less species than observers during the simultaneous surveys, increasing the survey duration of recorders may alter this difference. The use of autonomous sound recording for monitoring bird populations should be promoted, especially in forest habitats, as this technique is easier to standardise, eliminates many errors observed in the traditional point-count approach, enables conducting survey during adverse field conditions and delivers more reliable results for the majority of the species."
https://openalex.org/W2914156309,"Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays a key role in embryonic development, and its expression is down-regulated in adult cells. However, Twist1 is highly expressed during cancer development, conferring a proliferative, migratory, and invasive phenotype to malignant cells. Twist1 expression can be regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation or ubiquitination events. We report in this study a previously unknown and relevant Twist1 phosphorylation site that controls its stability. To identify candidate phosphorylation sites in Twist1, we first conducted an in silico analysis of the Twist1 protein, which yielded several potential sites. Because most of these sites were predicted to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), we overexpressed PKCα in several cell lines and found that it phosphorylates Twist1 on Ser-144. Using a combination of immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, protein overexpression, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PKCα knockout experiments, we observed that PKCα-mediated Twist1 phosphorylation at Ser-144 inhibits Twist1 ubiquitination and consequently stabilizes it. These results provide evidence for a direct association between PKCα and Twist1 and yield critical insights into the PKCα/Twist1 signaling axis that governs cancer aggressiveness.

https://openalex.org/W2911583817,"Massive apoptosis of lymphocytes is a hallmark of sepsis. The resulting immunosuppression is associated with secondary infections, which are often lethal. Moreover, sepsis-survivors are burdened with increased morbidity and mortality for several years after the sepsis episode. The duration and clinical consequences of sepsis induced-immunosuppression are currently unknown. We have used the mouse model of peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) to investigate the quantitative and qualitative recovery of T lymphocytes for 3.5 months after sepsis with or without IL-7 treatment. Thymic output and the numbers of naive and effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes quickly recovered after sepsis. IL-7 treatment resulted in an accelerated recovery of CD8+ lymphocytes. Next generation sequencing revealed no significant narrowing of the T cell receptor repertoire 3.5 months after sepsis. In contrast, detailed functional analyses of T helper (Th)-cell responses towards a fungal antigen revealed a significant loss of Th cells. Whereas cytokine production was not impaired at the single cell level, the absolute number of Th cells specific for the fungal antigen was reduced. Our data indicate a clinically relevant loss of pathogen-specific T cell clones after sepsis. Given the small number of naive T lymphocytes specific for a given antigen, this decrement of T cell clones remains undetected even by sensitive methods such as deep sequencing. Taken together, our data are compatible with long lasting impairments in CD4+ T-cell responses after sepsis despite rapid recovery of T lymphocyte populations."
https://openalex.org/W2914805249,"Diabetes promotes the posttranslational modification of proteins by O-linked addition of GlcNAc (O-GlcNAcylation) to Ser/Thr residues of proteins and thereby contributes to diabetic complications. In the retina of diabetic mice, the repressor of mRNA translation, eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), is O-GlcNAcylated, and sequestration of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E) is enhanced. O-GlcNAcylation has also been detected on several eukaryotic translation initiation factors and ribosomal proteins. However, the functional consequence of this modification is unknown. Here, using ribosome profiling, we evaluated the effect of enhanced O-GlcNAcylation on retinal gene expression. Mice receiving thiamet G (TMG), an inhibitor of the O-GlcNAc hydrolase O-GlcNAcase, exhibited enhanced retinal protein O-GlcNAcylation. The principal effect of TMG on retinal gene expression was observed in ribosome-associated mRNAs (i.e. mRNAs undergoing translation), as less than 1% of mRNAs exhibited changes in abundance. Remarkably, ∼19% of the transcriptome exhibited TMG-induced changes in ribosome occupancy, with 1912 mRNAs having reduced and 1683 mRNAs having increased translational rates. In the retina, the effect of O-GlcNAcase inhibition on translation of specific mitochondrial proteins, including superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), depended on 4E-BP1/2. O-GlcNAcylation enhanced cellular respiration and promoted mitochondrial superoxide levels in WT cells, and 4E-BP1/2 deletion prevented O-GlcNAcylation-induced mitochondrial superoxide in cells in culture and in the retina. The retina of diabetic WT mice exhibited increased reactive oxygen species levels, an effect not observed in diabetic 4E-BP1/2-deficient mice. These findings provide evidence for a mechanism whereby diabetes-induced O-GlcNAcylation promotes oxidative stress in the retina by altering the selection of mRNAs for translation."
https://openalex.org/W2914868109,"Upon phagocytosis into macrophages, the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila secretes effector proteins that manipulate host cell components, enabling it to evade lysosomal degradation. However, the bacterial proteins involved in this evasion are incompletely characterized. Here we show that the L. pneumophila effector protein RavD targets host membrane compartments and contributes to the molecular mechanism the pathogen uses to prevent encounters with lysosomes. Protein–lipid binding assays revealed that RavD selectively binds phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) in vitro. We further determined that a C-terminal RavD region mediates the interaction with PI(3)P and that this interaction requires Arg-292. In transiently transfected mammalian cells, mCherry-RavD colocalized with the early endosome marker EGFP-Rab5 as well as the PI(3)P biosensor EGFP-2×FYVE. However, treatment with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not disrupt localization of mCherry-RavD to endosomal compartments, suggesting that RavD's interaction with PI(3)P is not necessary to anchor RavD to endosomal membranes. Using superresolution and immunogold transmission EM, we observed that, upon translocation into macrophages, RavD was retained onto the Legionella-containing vacuole and was also present on small vesicles adjacent to the vacuole. We also report that despite no detectable effects on intracellular growth of L. pneumophila within macrophages or amebae, the lack of RavD significantly increased the number of vacuoles that accumulate the late endosome/lysosome marker LAMP-1 during macrophage infection. Together, our findings suggest that, although not required for intracellular replication of L. pneumophila, RavD is a part of the molecular mechanism that steers the Legionella-containing vacuole away from endolysosomal maturation pathways. Upon phagocytosis into macrophages, the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila secretes effector proteins that manipulate host cell components, enabling it to evade lysosomal degradation. However, the bacterial proteins involved in this evasion are incompletely characterized. Here we show that the L. pneumophila effector protein RavD targets host membrane compartments and contributes to the molecular mechanism the pathogen uses to prevent encounters with lysosomes. Protein–lipid binding assays revealed that RavD selectively binds phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) in vitro. We further determined that a C-terminal RavD region mediates the interaction with PI(3)P and that this interaction requires Arg-292.

https://openalex.org/W2913005840,"Formation of adventitious roots in plants is a common response to hypoxia caused by flooding. In tobacco, after one week of root hypoxia treatment, plants produced twice as many adventitious roots as the aerated plants, but their maximum length was reduced. Hypoxia severely reduced net photosynthesis, transpiration rates, and photosynthetic light responses. Relative transcript abundance of the examined aquaporins in lateral roots was reduced by hypoxia, but in adventitious roots it remained unchanged. This apparent lack of an effect of root hypoxia on the aquaporin expression likely contributed to maintenance of high hydraulic conductance in adventitious roots. Lateral roots had lower porosity compared with adventitious roots and the expression of the ACS (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) gene was induced in hypoxic lateral roots, but not in adventitious roots, providing additional evidence that lateral roots were more affected by hypoxia compared with adventitious roots. ATP concentrations were markedly lower in both hypoxic lateral and adventitious roots compared with aerated roots, while the expression of fermentation-related genes, ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1) and PDC1 (pyruvate decarboxylase 1), was higher in lateral roots compared with adventitious roots. Since root porosity was greater in adventitious compared with lateral roots, the results suggest that the improved O2 delivery and stable root aquaporin expression in adventitious roots were likely the key factors helping flooded tobacco plants maintain high rates of root hydraulic conductance and, consequently, shoot gas exchange."

Throughout seven weeks, the intervention group had meetings focused on emotions, mental health of medical students, gratitude, appreciation, optimism, resilience, qualities and virtues. The control group attended conventional medical psychology classes (psychosomatic aspects in clinical illness, for example).The intervention group presented average increase by 2.85 points in the positive emotions scale; average increase by 2.53 points in the satisfaction-with-life scale; and average decrease by 1.79 points in the SRQ-20 scale, when it was compared to the control group. The intervention effect size was moderate.Use of techniques to increase SWB may reduce CMD in MS, even if these techniques do not diminish negative emotions."

BIN1 also curbs cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and increases sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA-damaging therapeutic agents such as cisplatin. However, how BIN1 deficiency, a hallmark of advanced cancer cells, increases cisplatin resistance remains elusive. Here, we report that BIN1 inactivates ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM) serine/threonine kinase, particularly when BIN1 binds E2F1. BIN1 + 12A (a cancer-associated BIN1 splicing variant) also inhibited cellular PARylation, but only BIN1 increased cisplatin sensitivity. BIN1 prevented E2F1 from transcriptionally activating the human ATM promoter, whereas BIN1 + 12A did not physically interact with E2F1. Conversely, BIN1 loss significantly increased E2F1-dependent formation of MRE11A/RAD50/NBS1 DNA end-binding protein complex and efficiently promoted ATM autophosphorylation. Even in the absence of dsDNA breaks (DSBs), BIN1 loss promoted ATM-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2A family member X (forming γH2AX, a DSB biomarker) and mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1, a γH2AX-binding adaptor protein for DSB repair). Of note, even in the presence of transcriptionally active (i.e. proapoptotic) TP53 tumor suppressor, BIN1 loss generally increased cisplatin resistance, which was conversely alleviated by ATM inactivation or E2F1 reduction. However, E2F2 or E2F3 depletion did not recapitulate the cisplatin sensitivity elicited by E2F1 elimination.

https://openalex.org/W2914782367,"Objective To explore influential factors contributing to the choice of primary care facilities (PCFs) for the initial treatment among rural and urban residents in Southwestern China. Methods A face-to-face survey was conducted on a multistage stratified random sample of 456 rural and 459 urban residents in Sichuan Province from January to August in 2014. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on residents’ characteristics, provider of initial treatment and principal reason for the choice. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with choosing PCFs for the initial treatment. Results The result showed that 65.4% of the rural residents and 50.5% of the urban residents chose PCFs as their initial contact for medical care. Among both rural and urban residents, the principal reason for choosing medical institutions for the initial treatment was convenience (42.3% versus 40.5%, respectively), followed by high quality of medical care (26.5% versus 29.4%, respectively). Compared to rural residents, urban residents were more likely to value trust in doctors and high quality of medical care but were less likely to value the insurance designation status of the facilities. Logistic regression analysis showed that both rural and urban residents were less likely to choose PCFs for the initial treatment if they lived more than 15 minutes (by walk) from the nearest facilities (rural: OR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.09–0.26; urban: OR = 0.19, 95%CI = 0.10–0.36), had fair (rural: OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.26–0.92; urban: OR = 0.31, 95%CI = 0.15–0.64) or poor (rural: OR = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.07–0.30; urban: OR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.11–0.44) self-reported health status. Among rural residents, attending college or higher education (OR = 0.21, 95%CI = 0.08–0.59), being retired (OR = 0.90, 95%CI = 0.44–1.84) and earning a per capita annual income of household of 10,000–29,999 (OR = 0.24, 95%CI = 0.11–0.52) and 30,000–49,999 (OR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.07–0.92) were associated with lower rates of seeking care at PCFs. Conclusion Efforts should be made to improve the accessibility of PCFs and to upgrade the services capability of PCFs both in rural and urban areas in China. At the same time, resources should be prioritized to residents with poorer self-reported health status, and rural residents who retire or have better education and higher income levels should be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2912870657,"Large dams and their respective reservoirs provide renewable energy and water security, but also can profoundly alter riverine ecosystems. Here, we present evidence of changing aquatic food web structure in the seasons following short-duration, extreme manipulation of water levels in a reservoir (i.e., draining of the reservoir to the original riverbed during fall to assist outmigration of juvenile Chinook Salmon). We find unintended and lagged consequences of transitioning from a lake to a river, even temporarily, that resulted in trophic shifts away from piscivory and towards feeding at lower trophic levels for two common piscivorous fishes in reservoirs. Using natural abundances of nitrogen stable isotopes, we observed lower trophic level of feeding for invasive Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) and native Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during the summers following reservoir refilling than in nearby reference reservoirs that were not temporarily drained during fall. Declines in trophic levels of aquatic top predators have been rarely documented outside of controlled laboratory conditions. While useful for assisting outmigration of juvenile salmonids, the temporary draining of a reservoir to riverbed can also result in novel shifts in foodweb dynamics including reduced piscivory. As large dams continue to be operated and constructed worldwide, increased understanding of the community and ecosystem-level effects of reservoir management will be critical to evaluating trade-offs between human water needs, conservation of high value species, and ecosystem services impacted by river fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2912839464,"The SMAD4 tumor suppressor gene product inhibits transforming growth factor-β-mediated signaling and is mutated in ~10% of colorectal carcinomas. The prognostic significance of SMAD4 mutations has been controversial. We studied the pathological and clinical characteristics of SMAD4-mutated intestinal adenocarcinomas using a retrospective case-control study design. Cases and controls were identified among 443 primary adenocarcinomas that had undergone next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) with the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, which evaluates 50 cancer-related genes. Twenty-eight SMAD4-mutated (SMAD4m) patients were matched 1:2 with 56 consecutive SMAD4 wild-type (SMAD4wt) control patients from the same analysis stream. Compared with the SMAD4wt controls, the SMAD4m tumors were of higher stage (P = 0.026) and were more likely to feature mucinous differentiation (P = 0.0000), to occur in the setting of Crohn's disease (P = 0.0041), and to harbor concurrent RAS mutations (P = 0.0178). Tumor mucin content was significantly correlated with mutations involving the MH2 domain of the SMAD4 protein (P = 0.0338). Correspondence between mutation sites and morphology was demonstrated directly in a mixed adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumor where SMAD4 mutations involving different protein domains were found in histologically disparate tumor regions despite both containing identical KRAS and TP53 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2914896824,"Multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) is the second largest machinery for protein synthesis in human cells and also regulates multiple nontranslational functions through its components. Previous studies have shown that the MSC can respond to external signals by releasing its components to function outside it. The internal assembly is fundamental to MSC regulation. Here, using crystal structural analyses (at 1.88 A resolution) along with molecular modeling, gel-filtration chromatography, and co-immunoprecipitation, we report that human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) forms a tighter assembly with the scaffold protein aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) than previously observed. We found that two AIMP2 N-terminal peptides form an antiparallel scaffold and hold two LysRS dimers through four binding motifs and additional interactions. Of note, the four catalytic subunits of LysRS in the tightly assembled complex were all accessible for tRNA recognition. We further noted that two recently reported human disease-associated mutations conflict with this tighter assembly, cause LysRS release from the MSC, and inactivate the enzyme. These findings reveal a previously unknown dimension of MSC subcomplex assembly and suggest that the retractility of this complex may be critical for its physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2914095076,"The facilitation mechanism maintains ecosystem richness by increasing seedling recruitment. Overgrazed grasslands of northwestern Patagonia are invaded by shrubs that could promote the seedling recruitment of forage species. We investigated the role of Acaena splendens shrubs on the maintenance of diversity and its usefulness as a nurse shrub in the recruitment of Festuca pallescens, a grass of high forage value present with a low cover in degraded grasslands. To test the performance of A.splendens as a nurse plant in non-degraded grassland, we recorded the species richness four years inside of A. splendens senescent shrubs and in gaps among dominant tussock grasses. Species were grouped in four functional groups: annual and biannual herbs and grasses, perennial herbs, perennial grasses and shrubs. To test the usefulness of A. splendens in the restoration of degraded grassland, we monitored the seedling emergence and survival of F. pallescens inside A. splendens and in gaps. We related seedling survival to meteorological and microenvironmental conditions. Species richness was higher in Acaena nurse plants than in gaps. The frequency of functional groups, with exception of annual and biannual herbs and grasses, were higher in Acaena than in gaps. Seedling emergence and survival of F. pallescens were higher in Acaena, but the seedlings died in summer in both microsites. Mean maximum temperature was higher and mean minimum humidity lower in gaps than in Acaena during spring. However, the spring-summer season in which we monitored F. pallescens survival, was exceptionally dry and hot, affecting the survival of F. pallescens seedlings. Our results show that A. splendens act as a nurse species increasing the richness in the non-degraded grassland and facilitating the seedling recruitment of an important forage species in the degraded grassland. Nevertheless, the facilitation mechanism will fail in drought conditions, indicating that this restoration tool is limited by climate."

Here, we describe the neuroethical issues of the project that have arisen from clinical data collection and the use of biological models of neuropsychiatric disorders. The Brain/MINDS project aims to further understand the human brain and neuropsychiatric disorders through “translatable” biomarkers. Here, we describe the neuroethical issues of the project that have arisen from clinical data collection and the use of biological models of neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite significant research into neuropsychiatric disorders, linking data from genetic, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies with the real-world behaviors and distress experienced by individuals remains limited. The Brain/MINDS (brain mapping by integrating neurotechnologies for disease studies) project of Japan aims to better understand the human brain by integrating research on the marmoset with clinical research on neuropsychiatric disorders (Okano et al., 2016Okano H. Sasaki E. Yamamori T. Iriki A. Shimogori T. Yamaguchi Y. Kasai K. Miyawaki A. Brain/MINDS: A Japanese National Brain Project for Marmoset Neuroscience.Neuron. 2016; 92: 582-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The research organization of the Brain/MINDS project involves four major groups. Three of these groups are related to the structural and functional mapping of the marmoset brain and the development of brain-mapping-related technologies. Macroscopic-level mapping using structural and functional MRI-based techniques, mesoscopic-level mapping using tracer injections and light microscopy, and microscopic-level mapping using serial electron microscopy are being developed and utilized in marmoset research. The fourth group focuses on human brain mapping and clinical research (Figure 1A). The clinical research group conducts human brain mapping of neuropsychiatric disorders. Its missions include: (1) the exploration of disease-related neural circuits using neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and behavioral data obtained from large-scale clinical data; (2) the discovery and development of “translatable” biomarkers that can be measured using techniques common to both nonhuman primates and humans from these neural circuits; (3) the application of these candidate translational biomarkers to the neural circuits of marmoset models; and (4) the application of these findings to establish neural-circuit-oriented re-classification strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders and to develop innovative treatments for these disorders (Figure 1A). Thus far, research has been conducted in three teams focusing on neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, or cerebrovascular diseases and neuro-rehabilitation. Example projects include neurophysiological studies in schizophrenia, early detection of a change in neurocircuits of Alzheimer’s disease and diffuse Lewy body disease, and the identification of impaired and compensatory circuits in Parkinson’s disease (Okano et al., 2016Okano H. Sasaki E. Yamamori T. Iriki A. Shimogori T. Yamaguchi Y. Kasai K. Miyawaki A. Brain/MINDS: A Japanese National Brain Project for Marmoset Neuroscience.Neuron. 2016; 92: 582-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The clinical research management team aimed to encourage close cooperation between the groups through meetings and the development of guidelines for responsible conduct of research (RCR). Neuroethics was one of the key matters discussed in the Brain/MINDS project by the central institutes and the clinical research management team. The strategic research program for brain sciences (SRPBS, launched in 2008), which preceded the Brain/MINDS project, has addressed general RCR issues, and the bioethics project of the SRPBS has been managing RCR issues specific to the neuroscientific research encountered in the clinical research group (Figure 1B). The translational research approach taken by the Brain/MINDS project to establish biological models of neuropsychiatric disorders has two main aspects relevant to the Neuroethics Questions for Neuroscientists that were agreed on at the Global Neuroethics Summit in Daegu, South Korea (NeQN; Rommelfanger et al., 2018Rommelfanger K.S. Jeong S.J. Ema A. Fukushi T. Kasai K. Ramos K.M. Salles A. Singh I. Global Neuroethics Summit DelegatesNeuroethics questions to guide ethical research in the international brain initiatives.Neuron. 2018; 100: 19-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar): (1) data collection with research participants and (2) the social and individual impacts of the neuroscience disease model. In Japan, discussions and early legal efforts concerning personal information started in the early 2000s, but the actual development of legislation regarding personal information handling as data was established in 2016 (the Act on the Protection of Personal Information). In the Brain/MINDS project, two types of personal information are associated with the clinical research group: (1) “the individual identification code” and 2) “special-care-required personal information” as outlined in the 2016 act. Individual identification codes are specified as any type of information sufficient to identify the individual. This includes information on facial features, such as the position of the eyes, mouth, and nose, which would be reconstructable from 3D structural MRI data. Special-care-required personal information is anything ranging from race to criminal records that requires special care so as not to cause discrimination or any other harms to the individual. Clinical information shared among researchers of this project in order to conduct clinical research is an important example of special-care-required personal information. The Brain/MINDS project focuses on connecting translatable biomarkers such as MRI data (individual identification codes) with clinical and functional features specifying neuropsychiatric disorder phenotypes (special-care-required personal information). Thus, both types of data are required. Yet handling both types of data at once increases the risk of unintentionally revealing personal information such as medication use and the severity of the neuropsychiatric disorder to the public, which can lead to discrimination. Data management in the Brain/MINDS project needed to facilitate data sharing while protecting the individual’s personal information. The construction of a human MRI database that could harmonize ethical personal information management and the sharing of clinical data among multiple research sites is a priority issue in the Brain/MINDS project. The neuroethical framework constructed by the preceding national brain projects (Figure 1B) in Japan needed to be extended (Fukushi et al., 2017Fukushi T. Isobe T. Nakazawa E. Takimoto Y. Akabayashi A. Sullivan L.S. Sakura O. Neuroethics in Japan.in: Johnson L.S.M. Rommelfanger K.S. The Routledge Handbook of Neuroethics. Routledge, New York2017: 442-456Crossref Google Scholar). We constructed an MRI database that allowed multiple levels of information access. At the highest security level, information including clinical data (i.e., “special-care-required information”) linked to the individuals’ MR images was stored. These data were primarily used within the research institutions by the clinical research group or by close joint research facilities with consent from the individual study participants as well as approval from both research facilities’ research ethics committees. De-identified data could be used by applicants with a relatively simple registration. In February 2018, structural MRI data obtained from 20 individuals with schizophrenia, 21 individuals with major depression, 16 individuals with bipolar disorder, and 97 healthy controls have been uploaded to this database (https://www.brainminds.riken.jp/). These data also include simple demographic information such as age and gender, but information about facial features was completely removed in advance. To fully utilize the multilayered structure of this database, both database users and database contributors face different types of ethical issues regarding storage and handling of data containing personal information. In the Brain/MINDS project, the clinical research organizing team summarized important points of transferring, analyzing, and presenting clinical data within the group. The clinical research organizing team has also created guidance for any necessary modifications needed in ethical protocols due to revisions of research guidelines and related legislation concerning personal information handling, which also included recent changes regarding data sharing with international institutions. The guidance is necessary because ethical approval should be obtained from the ethics committee of each research institute. This guidance provides information about considerations regarding clinical and MRI data sharing for non-clinical basic research institutes using this kind of data collected within the Brain/MINDS project. The Brain/MINDS project’s integration of clinical and basic research aims to find translatable disease biomarkers. These will be used to establish a biological basis of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the etiology behind neuropsychiatric disorders remains unknown, and many neuropsychiatric disorders either include heterogeneous syndromes or exist on a continuum between normal and disease. Thus, it is difficult to draw a line between risk factors or traits (which may or may not lead to disease onset) and occult signs of illness. While such an endeavor promises great strides for clinical diagnosis and care, potential biomarker candidates gleaned from clinical data should be carefully interpreted given the potential impact that a neuropsychiatric diagnosis may have for the individual and society. When studying biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders, special care must be taken not to create “labels of risk” (Ando et al., 2013Ando S. Yamaguchi S. Aoki Y. Thornicroft G. Review of mental-health-related stigma in Japan.Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 2013; 67: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). An example is the at-risk mental state (ARMS), which was originally created for early detection and treatment of psychosis. However, it is now known that the transition rate from ARMS to full-blown psychosis within the first few years is about 10%–30%, resulting in high false positives. Many guidelines, such as the UK-based National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), now recommend against the preventive use of antipsychotics because the high risk of side effects overweighs potential benefits. This is also recognized in Japan, and the Japanese Society for Prevention and Early Intervention in Psychiatry is currently working on a Japanese version of the guidance. Furthermore, psychosis is not associated with functional outcomes, whereas symptoms of depression and anxiety cause significant distress. Thus, at present, broad cross-diagnostic and/or trans-diagnostic interventions for symptoms and for mental wellbeing in general are believed to be a more efficient strategy for functional outcome and personal recovery in individuals “labeled” as ARMS than a focus on early psychosis-based interventions, improving quality of life and recovery (McGorry et al., 2018McGorry P.D. Hartmann J.A. Spooner R. Nelson B. Beyond the “at risk mental state” concept: transitioning to transdiagnostic psychiatry.World Psychiatry. 2018; 17: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Discovery of the biological correlates of neuropsychiatric disorders might also have strong social impacts. In Japan, like many parts of the world, stigma is a major obstacle to seeking help from a mental health professional. Some people still believe that individuals with mental illness do not recover (Ando et al., 2013Ando S. Yamaguchi S. Aoki Y. Thornicroft G. Review of mental-health-related stigma in Japan.Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 2013; 67: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Research into neuropsychiatric disorders may affect public understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders in both positive and negative directions. Evidence suggests that increased public understanding of the biological basis of neuropsychiatric disorders does not change the amount of stigma and may sometimes even increase stigma (Schomerus et al., 2012Schomerus G. Schwahn C. Holzinger A. Corrigan P.W. Grabe H.J. Carta M.G. Angermeyer M.C. Evolution of public attitudes about mental illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Acta Psychiatr. Scand. 2012; 125: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Two strategies taken in the Brain/MINDS project turned out to be advantageous in confronting the obstacles overlaid in the research of neuropsychiatric disorders. One is the approach of using translatable biomarkers and the other is the collection of cross-diagnostic and/or trans-diagnostic data. Although most clinical research projects are based on clinical diagnoses, having a brain-biomarker-based approach might enable faster and more efficient translation between the laboratory and the clinic. Neuropsychiatric diagnoses are based on the phenotypes of behavior and cognition, most of which are difficult to study in nonhuman animal models. Brain biomarkers enable us to look for neurophysiological or neuroimaging “endophenotypes” that are measurable and comparable between humans and non-human primates. This approach is similar to that of the research domain criteria (RDoC) initiative (https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml) of the US National Institute of Mental Health and holds the advantage of being able to conduct more neurobiologically oriented research in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our clinical research team also focused on collecting data from individuals with different diagnoses. Cross-diagnostic and/or trans-diagnostic data enables the exploration of the findings throughout the spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. There has been much debate on the consequences of categorical diagnoses, yet at the moment, drifting too far from the categorical system would be disadvantageous in terms of clinical application. A difficult aspect of studying neuropsychiatric disorders is that, while the etiology lies within the brain, the disability experienced by the individual is embedded in a psychosocial environment. Much of the clinical science, treatment, and social support available in this field are still based on the categorical diagnosis. Therefore, the introduction of a new diagnostic system will require a gradual transition to avoid a problematic “gap” between research and clinical practice. A similar argument has also arisen in the framework of the RDoC initiative. Emphasis has been placed on the need for interdisciplinary engagement in the field of science as well as its political, commercial, and public counterparts. This leaves much to be worked on before clinical implementation. However, regardless of the diagnostic system utilized, research participants deserve a thorough explanation of the research project and its motives upon recruitment, as well as careful interpretation and non-declarative presentation of the findings. The next step will be a focus on the clinical implications of the findings. The clinical research teams are focusing on the relationships between brain circuit biomarkers and everyday functioning in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders. Examples would be the associations between eye movement characteristics and work hours or between subcortical volume differences and socio-cognitive function in schizophrenia. Both eye movements and subcortical volumes are key focuses as translatable biomarkers and are currently being researched in marmosets as well. Non-human primate models, with appropriate ethical consideration, will be necessary for this step to improve our understanding of the neurobiological aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders and, in light of the recent advances in genetics and regenerative medicine, may lead to new targets for novel treatments such as precision medicine. Further research linking “micro-level” neurobiological findings to everyday life in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders would thus provide a significant advance in the field of neuropsychiatry. The increasing trend of collection and analysis of “big data” has led to the enactment of legislation governing the systematic and government-led de-identification of medical data in Japan, which will enable the use of medical big data for non-medical users and researchers by 2020. Along with the change of medical big data regulation, R&D projects in Japan, including the Brain/MINDS project, will need to adjust their own data management plans and explain them to patients and public, since there is less awareness of that change. The R&D community will also need to promote understanding of the utilization of medical big data to the public. On the one hand, the collection of large, heterogeneous, and longitudinal data may allow for more accurate predictions of life course and more personalized intervention approaches, which could provide value to healthcare even beyond neuropsychiatric diagnosis. On the other hand, such big data analysis may enable re-identification of the initial participants in the disease database (Rommelfanger et al., 2018Rommelfanger K.S. Jeong S.J. Ema A. Fukushi T.

If de-identification procedures are transparent and strictly defined, Japanese citizens who are concerned about information leakage and privacy (Nakazawa and Tsuchiya, 2018Nakazawa E. Tsuchiya A. Polarity of Public Perception over General Consent : Survey on Consciousness of Healthy Japanese Participants in Brain Database Projects.Ann. Bioeth. Clin. Appl. 2018; 1: 1-8Google Scholar), particularly around brain imaging data, will feel more secure. However, to ensure the ethical legitimacy of consent (by opt-out), appropriate information disclosure is required. Even if the connection between data and individuals is de-identified, some disenfranchised groups in society may become further stigmatized and unintended biases may occur if study design and analyses are not done carefully. This potential is highlighted by NeQN 1b: Is it possible that social or cultural bias has been introduced in research design or in the interpretation of scientific results? Human brain samples are crucial to the investigation of human neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on the tradition of autopsy research in Japan, the Japan brain bank net (JBBN) was launched in 2016 and is supported by SRPBS by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); it is a network of brain banks of Japanese universities and research centers (https://www.jpbrain.net/, in Japanese). JBBN contributes to the neuroscience community, including research for the Brain/MINDS project, by providing human brain samples donated by deceased Japanese people with a high-quality diagnosis. Its activity follows the ethics guidelines of brain banks established by the Japanese Society for Neuropathology and the Japanese Society of Biological Psychiatry in 2015 (http://www.jsnp.jp/pdf/brainbank.pdf, in Japanese), which states that the banking should be based on a pathological autopsy. The percentage of pathological autopsies in Japan, which had been high in the past, has recently declined. This may be caused by re-allocation pressure of medical resources, in part due to the belief that medical imaging data might be sufficient to establish etiology (Iritani et al., 2018Iritani S. Habuchi C. Sekiguchi H. Torii Y. Brain research and clinical psychiatry: establishment of a psychiatry brain bank in Japan.Nagoya J. Med. Sci. 2018; 80: 309-315PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to neurologists and psychiatrists, biostatisticians and bioethicists are also participating in the JBBN to promote the project in a scientifically and ethically sound manner. Key issues are the promotion of donor registrations by individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders during their lifetime and the construction of close relationships to promote mutual communication with bereaved family members. The effort is ongoing, with a promising response. International collaboration to share expertise into handling these issues would be helpful. Research into human brain function and mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders for the Brain/MINDS project and other national brain projects may lead to the development of new treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. One distinct example is neurofeedback using real-time fMRI (Watanabe et al., 2017Watanabe T. Sasaki Y. Shibata K. Kawato M. Advances in fMRI real-time neurofeedback.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21: 997-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, for review) largely funded by SRPBS. Neurofeedback is an innovative technique that uses fMRI not only for observation but also for intervention. Targets of fMRI neurofeedback interventions are conditions such as refractory depression and neurodevelopmental disorders. The Brain/MINDS project aims to play an important role in developing fMRI neurofeedback treatment by supplying biologically defined connectome information. Neurofeedback technology could be an intervention tool to enhance cognitive capacity and social communication skills by controlling the plasticity of the neural network system. In 2015, the research ethics consultation team at SRPBS created a project, which is still ongoing, about the ethics of fMRI neurofeedback. It required that the clinical trials of fMRI neurofeedback, in their early phase, should be performed with a limited number of participants and in appropriate research settings, with monitoring by the safety review committee established by SRPBS specific to fMRI neurofeedback research. Since fMRI neurofeedback is an innovative treatment for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and one that could undermine patient autonomy and agency, additional consideration is needed for potentially vulnerable research participants. The SRPBS ethics working group recommended that institutional review boards review considerations of autonomy and agency that could be compromised by such an intervention. The shortage of pre-clinical data and the uncertainty surrounding the mechanism of fMRI neurofeedback treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders are ethical concerns. Potential irreversibility of neurofeedback is a drawback as an enhancement tool, and the ethical implications of neuroenhancement are still being explored in Japan (Nakazawa et al., 2016Nakazawa E. Yamamoto K. Tachibana K. Toda S. Takimoto Y. Akabayashi A. Ethics of decoded neurofeedback in clinical research, treatment, and moral enhancement.AJOB Neurosci. 2016; 7: 110-117Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, more research in this area is needed, and we will be exploring NeQN 5—In which contexts might a neuroscientific technology/innovation be used or deployed?—as we develop this technology. Brain/MINDS Beyond is a new brain science project launched in September 2018 and built upon the framework of Brain/MINDS. In this project, studies using translatable biomarkers in human and non-human primate research continue, but with further extensions. One such extension is to advance international collaborations with other brain science projects such as the Human Connectome Project; research will also be conducted on the harmonization of heterogeneous MRI data collected from different scanners and vendors. As we expand our collaborations, we are dedicated to deeply exploring the ethical issues, particularly with a cross-cultural lens through collaborations with the International Brain Initiative’s neuroethics workgroup, as an integral part of our research program. In so doing, we hope to develop better treatment and related technologies for individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and society more broadly with high ethical standards."
https://openalex.org/W2911238890,"Acquisition of fresh water (FW) is problematic for FW-dependent animals living in marine environments that are distant from sources of FW associated with land. Knowledge of how marine vertebrates respond to oceanic rainfall, and indeed the drinking responses of vertebrates generally following drought, is extremely scant. The Yellow-bellied Sea Snake (Hydrophis platurus) is the only pelagic species of squamate reptile and ranges across the Indo-Pacific oceans, having one of the largest geographic distributions of any vertebrate species. It requires FW and dehydrates at sea during periods of drought. Here we report drinking behaviors of sea snakes precisely at the transition from dry to wet season when rainfall first impacted the ocean following 6 months of seasonal drought. We show that the percentage of sea snakes that voluntarily drank FW in the laboratory when captured over eight successive days decreased from 80% to 13% before and after rainfall commenced, respectively. The percentage of snakes that drank immediately following capture exhibited a significant linear decline as the earliest rains of the wet season continued. Drinking by snakes indicates thirst related to dehydration, and thus thirsty snakes must have dehydrated during the previous six months of drought. Hence, the progressive decline in percentage of thirsty snakes indicates they were drinking from FW lenses associated with the first rainfall events of the wet season. These data reinforce the importance of accessing oceanic FW from precipitation, with implications for survival and distribution of pelagic populations that might be subjected to intensifying drought related to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2912648607,"Background The absence of implementation cost data constrains deliberations on consigning resources to community-based health programs. This paper analyses the cost of implementing strategies for accelerating the expansion of a community-based primary health care program in northern Ghana. Known as the Ghana Essential Health Intervention Program (GEHIP), the project was an embedded implementation science program implemented to provide practical guidance for accelerating the expansion of community-based primary health care and introducing improvements in the range of services community workers can provide. Methods Cost data were systematically collected from intervention and non-intervention districts throughout the implementation period (2012–2014) from a provider perspective. The step-down allocation approach to costing was used while WHO health system blocks were adopted as cost centers. We computed cost without annualizing capital cost to represent financial cost and cost with annualizing capital cost to represent economic cost. Results The per capita financial cost and economic cost of implementing GEHIP over a three-year period was $1.79, and $1.07 respectively. GEHIP comprised only 3.1% of total primary health care cost. Health service delivery comprised the largest component of cost (37.6%), human resources was 28.6%, medicines was 13.6%, leadership/governance was 12.8%, while health information comprised 7.5% of the economic cost of implementing GEHIP. Conclusion The per capita cost of implementing the GEHIP program was low. GEHIP project investments had a catalytic effect that improved community-based health planning and services (CHPS) coverage and enhanced the efficient use of routine health system resources rather than expanding overall primary health care costs."
https://openalex.org/W2911299915,"Background Intestinal permeability can be assessed by monitoring renal excretion of orally administered radioactively 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA). Although considered safe, patient participation in using radio-labeled tracers is low. Here, we used orally administered 52Cr-EDTA as non-radioactive alternative to assess intestinal permeability in CD and analyzed the association with disease activity, disease location and gut microbial dysbiosis. Materials and methods 60 CD patients with low (n = 25) and increased (n = 35) fecal calprotectin levels (cut-off: 100 μg/g feces) ingested 20 mL 52Cr-EDTA (20 mmol/L) solution whereafter 24-h urine was collected. Urinary 52Cr-EDTA concentrations were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Fecal Enterobacteriaceae and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were quantified using FISH. Correlations between urinary 52Cr-EDTA excretion and other parameters were established using nonparametric Spearman’s correlation coefficients (ρ). Results CD patients with increased fecal calprotectin levels (> 100 μg/g) demonstrated an elevated urinary 52Cr-EDTA/creatinine ratio (772 vs. 636 μmol/mol, P = 0.132). Patients with primarily colonic disease showed the highest 52Cr-EDTA excretion. Importantly, a positive correlation was observed for the urinary 52Cr-EDTA/creatinine ratio and fecal calprotectin levels (ρ = 0.325, P < 0.05). Finally, urinary 52Cr-EDTA/creatinine ratio negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (ρ = -0.221, P = 0.092), while positively correlating with Enterobacteriaceae (ρ = 0.202, P = 0.126). Conclusions Orally administered and renal excreted 52Cr-EDTA may be used to assess intestinal permeability in CD and correlates with fecal calprotectin levels and bacterial species relevant to CD. This test may improve non-invasive detection of disease exacerbations and help monitor disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W2911990653,"Objective Opportunity exists to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations for children with anaphylaxis given wide variation in admission rates across U.S. emergency departments (EDs). We sought to identify children hospitalized with anaphylaxis at low risk of receiving epinephrine and other acute inpatient therapies, as these patients may be candidates for ED discharge rather than inpatient hospitalization. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of children 1–21 years of age hospitalized with anaphylaxis from 2009 to 2016. Acute inpatient therapies included intramuscular (IM) or racemic epinephrine, bronchodilators, fluid boluses, vasopressors, non-invasive ventilation, or intubation. We derived age-specific (pre-verbal [<36 months] vs. verbal [≥ 36 months]) prediction rules using recursive partitioning to identify children at low risk of receiving acute inpatient therapies. Results During the study period 665 children were hospitalized for anaphylaxis, of whom 108 (16.2%) received acute inpatient therapies. The prediction rule for patients < 36 months (no wheezing, no cardiac involvement [hypotension or wide pulse pressure]) had a sensitivity of 90.5% (CI 69.6–98.8%) and a negative predictive value of 98.3% (CI 94.1–99.8%) for identifying children at low risk of receipt of acute inpatient therapies during hospitalization. For children ≥ 36 months, the prediction rule (no wheezing, no cardiac involvement, presence of gastrointestinal symptoms) had a sensitivity of 90.8% (CI 82.7–96.0%) and a negative predictive value of 92.4% (CI 85.6–96.7%). Conclusions We derived age specific prediction rules for children hospitalized with anaphylaxis at low risk of receiving epinephrine and other acute inpatient therapies. These children may be candidates for ED discharge rather than inpatient hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W2912908666,"Acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (AKI-D) is associated with high mortality. Information about its epidemiology is nonetheless sparse in some countries. The objective of this study was to assess its epidemiology and prognosis in metropolitan France.Using the French hospital discharge database, the study focused on adults hospitalized in metropolitan France between 2009 and 2014 and diagnosed with AKI-D according to the codes of the French common classification of medical procedures. Crude and standardized incidence rates (SIR) by gender and age were calculated. We explored the changes in patients' characteristics, modalities of renal replacement therapy (RRT), in-hospital care, and mortality, along with their determinants. Trends over time in the SIR for AKI-D, its principal diagnoses, and comorbidities were analyzed with joinpoint models.Between 2009 and 2014, the AKI-D SIR increased from 475 (95% CI, 468 to 482) to 512 per million population (95% CI, 505 to 519). AKI-D was twice as high in men as women. Median age was 68 years. Over the study period, the AKI-D SIR steadily increased in all age groups, particularly in the elderly. The most common comorbidities were cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (64.8%), pulmonary disease (42.2%), CKD (33.8%), and diabetes (26.0%); all of these except CKD increased significantly over time. In 2009, heart failure (17.2%), sepsis (17.0%), AKI (13.0%), digestive diseases (10.7%), and shock (6.6%) were the most frequent principal diagnoses, with a significant increase in heart failure and digestive diseases. The proportion of patients with at least one ICU stay and continuous RRT increased from 80.3% to 83.9% and from 56.9% to 61.8% (p<0.001), respectively. In-hospital mortality was high but stable (47%) and higher in patients with an ICU stay.This is the first exhaustive study in metropolitan France of the SIR for AKI-D. It shows this SIR has increased significantly over 6 years, together with ICU care and continuous RRT. In-hospital mortality is high but stable."

https://openalex.org/W2914142081,"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important high protein crop grown worldwide. North Dakota and Minnesota are the largest producers of common beans in the USA, but crop production is threatened by soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) because most current cultivars are susceptible. Greenhouse screening data using SCN HG type 0 from 317 plant introductions (PI's) from the USDA core collection was used to conduct a genome wide association study (GWAS). These lines were divided into two subpopulations based on principal component analysis (Middle American vs. Andean). Phenotypic results based on the female index showed that accessions could be classified as highly resistant (21% and 27%), moderately resistant (51% and 48%), moderately susceptible (27% and 22%) and highly susceptible (1% and 3%) for Middle American and Andean gene pools, respectively. Mixed models with two principal components (PCs) and kinship matrix for Middle American genotypes and Andean genotypes were used in the GWAS analysis using 3,985 and 4,811 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers, respectively which were evenly distributed across all 11 chromosomes. Significant peaks on Pv07, and Pv11 in Middle American and on Pv07, Pv08, Pv09 and Pv11 in Andean group were found to be associated with SCN resistance. Homologs of soybean rhg1, a locus which confers resistance to SCN in soybean, were identified on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv08 in the Middle American and Andean gene pools, respectively. These genomic regions may be the key to develop SCN-resistant common bean cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2914641827,"We present a questionnaire-based measure of four animal ethics orientations. The orientations, which were developed in light of existing empirical studies of attitudes to animal use and ethical theory, are: animal rights, anthropocentrism, lay utilitarianism, and animal protection. The two latter orientations can be viewed as variants of animal welfarism. Three studies were conducted in Denmark in order to identify the hypothesised orientations, evaluate their concurrent validity, and report their prevalence and relevance in animal-related opinion formation and behaviour. Explorative factor analysis (Study 1) and confirmative factor analysis (Study 2) successfully identified the four orientations. Study 2 revealed good measurement invariance, as there was none or very modest differential item functioning across age, gender, living area, and contrasting population segments. Evaluation of concurrent validity in Study 2 found that the orientations are associated with different kinds of behaviour and opinion when the human use of animals is involved in the hypothesised directions. In Study 3, a representative population study, the animal protection orientation proved to be most prevalent in the Danish population, and as in study 2 the four orientations were associated with different behaviours and opinions. Remarkably, the animal protection orientation does not lead to increased animal welfare-friendly meat consumption, the main reason for this being non-concern about the current welfare status of farm animals. We argue that the developed measure covers a wide range of diversity in animal ethics orientations that is likely to exist in a modern society such as Denmark and can be used in future studies to track changes in the orientations and to understand and test hypotheses about the sources and justifications of people's animal-related opinions and behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2911392754,"Building on Canada’s strong traditions in neuroscience and ethics, neuroethics provides a backbone for the evolving Canadian Brain Research Strategy (CBRS) that, from the outset, incorporates ethically responsible discoveries in brain science into clinical, societal, educational, and commercial innovation. Building on Canada’s strong traditions in neuroscience and ethics, neuroethics provides a backbone for the evolving Canadian Brain Research Strategy (CBRS) that, from the outset, incorporates ethically responsible discoveries in brain science into clinical, societal, educational, and commercial innovation. One in three Canadians will be affected by a brain or nervous system illness, disorder, or injury within their life. These conditions span the life cycle. Mental health conditions often affect young Canadians in the prime of life, with an estimated 75% of mental illnesses beginning before the age of 24. Injuries to the nervous system, such as concussion, occur frequently in adult life and can lead to lifelong disability. Age-associated dementia has surpassed other conditions as the largest financial burden on the Canadian healthcare system today. A 2016 report from the Evaluation Panel from the CIHR Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction (INMHA) placed the overall cost of neurological and mental health disorders to the Canadian economy at $61B CAD annually. In addition to a high economic cost, brain disorders impose staggering personal and societal tolls. Canadians firmly support the need for ethical health research, innovation and economic advancement in neuroscience. This commitment is underpinned by Canada’s multi-million-dollar investment in dedicated funding for neuroethics teams, operating grants, and research chairs and fellowships beginning in early 2000 and carrying on today (Quirion, 2002Quirion R. A Canadian experiment: the Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction. How to link up the brain via a virtual institute.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 268-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The embedding of an already strong neuroethics platform into the new Canadian Brain Research Strategy (CBRS; www.canadianbrain.ca) is the latest and most exciting step forward. The building of CBRS was initiated in 2015 and has been nurtured under the leadership of INMHA. Following a consensus meeting of directors of neuroscience programs across Canada and other key stakeholders in Halifax in September 2018, the CBRS is moving forward as an organizing entity independent of INMHA, with an intersectoral steering committee that will work in continuous liaison with the conference leaders and participants and with a strategic eye on developing and situating Canada as a neuroscience-driven nation. Here we discuss the proposed key pillars—Understand, Address, Apply, and Build—inspired by the distinguishing and central question of the unfolding CBRS—how does the brain learn, remember, and adapt?—a question that seeks to understand the most fundamental aspects of what defines the self (Figure 1). The powerful ability of the brain to change or rewire itself in response to experience is the foundation of human identity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this plasticity is at the root of any effort to treat neurological and mental disorders. Neuroethics is a necessary anchor into this question. It intersects with all pillars and forms an explicit foundation for the Apply pillar on which we focus in this paper. The Apply pillar draws upon Canada’s long tradition of pioneering work in neuroethics, beginning with Canadian neurosurgeon and neuroscientist Dr. Wilder Penfield, who founded the Montreal Neurological Institute. Penfield’s writings may be viewed as a precursor to neuroethical deliberation. Penfield was a student of Sir William Osler, to whom Canada attributes deep insights into science and the biomedical sciences. Physician-bioethicist Joseph J. Fins quotes a 1919 address by Osler, “The Old Humanities and the New Sciences,” to Oxford’s Classical Association, in which he “admonished the divide between the sciences and the humanities, observing that … the so-called Humanists have not enough Science, and Science sadly lacks the Humanities” (Fins, 2008Fins J.J. A leg to stand on: Sir William Osler and Wilder Penfield’s “neuroethics”.Am. J. Bioeth. 2008; 8: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We provide specific examples of neuroethics leadership in this country that bridge the divide that Osler described, highlighting this country’s advances in neuroscience and law, mental health and addiction, public outreach, and knowledge mobilization through patient engagement. We conclude with a look to the future of international collaboration with the International Brain Initiative (IBI) and Neuroethics Global Summit colleagues and partners. The CBRS aims to be an integrated national research effort that builds on Canada’s strengths and current investments in cutting-edge collaborative neuroscience to drive transformative outcomes in neurological and mental health for Canadians. Its final design will enable Canada to:•Accelerate the understanding of the brain and translation to clinical treatments that address grand challenges in brain and mental health for Canadians.•Increase collaboration, data sharing, and technology development and dissemination among Canadian researchers and build on collective strengths.•Identify targets and milestones for strategic and coordinated investment in Canadian neuroscience and mental health.•Train the next generation in interdisciplinary brain research, bridging diverse disciplines spanning the physical and computational sciences to anthropology, sociology, and economics.•Develop meaningful collaborations with other Brain Initiatives on the international stage. To achieve these goals, the four pillars on which the CBRS is building are collectively supported by six enabling principles: collaboration, interdisciplinarity, open science, career development, education, and commercialization. These principles both guide how research within the CBRS is conducted and set targets to advance a sustainable mission and vision. The principles are interwoven with five specifically identified technology development areas to probe, manipulate, decode how the brain functions—imaging, stimulation, photonics, genomics, and neuroinformatics—that, together with embedded and rigorous experimental trial designs and outcome measurements, serve as platforms for a competitive Canadian neuroscience research world today. The first pillar, Understand, focuses on normal brain development and functioning, from synapses to circuits to behavior, and neuroplasticity across the lifespan. Important insights by Canadian neuroscientists have come from explorations of plasticity in a wide range of species, studies of human memory, discoveries in neural stem cells and regenerative medicine, pain research, and interactions among genes and environments during early childhood that guide human development. From the outset, the Understand pillar embraces the change in culture needed—from traditional siloed disciplines of genetics, neurophysiology, neurocomputing, psychology, ethics, and sociology to cross-disciplinary collaboration—to reveal how the brain evolves over a lifetime. This approach in turn allows fundamental knowledge to be translated to health challenges arising from dysfunction of these basic brain processes (Address) and informs technology development as well as methods such as artificial intelligence and computational modeling that may have transformative industrial applications and economic impact (Build). For these three pillars, neuroethics is implicit, encompassing both simple and complex phenomena that include, for example, the responsible conduct of research, limiting the numbers and suffering of animals in research, respecting persons and protecting their autonomy and rights, data and privacy protections, and anticipating both beneficial and consequential outcomes. In Apply, the approach focuses on societal and cultural well-being, making it the pillar for which neuroethics plays the most explicit role. The Apply pillar recognizes the imperative of the CBRS to promote individual and societal well-being; evidence-based, informed social and health policy; and education. The scope of the efforts supported by this pillar are broad: developing best practices in early childhood education, enabling the active participation of older adults in society, helping teenagers make smart choices about drug and alcohol use, and supporting people as they navigate escalating demands in the workplace and at home. It includes consideration of the critical role that new regulatory policies or technology play in how people interact, learn, and contribute. It includes, as well, the evolution of new tools and the way that they are adapted to human capabilities to support productive, socially cohesive, and healthy lives on the one hand and to mitigate triggers of distraction, alienation, and burnout on the other. Learning is possible because brains are plastic and capable of change. Education, therefore, must be tailored to the mechanisms that both enable and constrain underlying brain plasticity. Reciprocally, techniques in cognitive neuroscience allow neuroscientists to study in ever greater depth how human factors, such as education and culture, shape the structure and function of the brain. As scientists and scholars gain a more in-depth understanding of these mechanisms, targeted educational practice and policies that optimize learning can be applied in the classroom and other settings. For example, one program has led paradigm-shifting research in the areas of gene-environment interplay and critical periods of brain development (Anreiter et al., 2017Anreiter I. Sokolowski H.M. Sokolowski M.B. Gene-environment interplay in behavior.Mind Brain Educ. 2017; (Published online December 18, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1111/mbe.12158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This effort is now focusing on the understanding of broad group differences in outcomes toward a predictive understanding of individual response to experience. A number of large school-based trials led by Canadian researchers have shown that targeted neurodevelopmental interventions also promote mental health and well-being, indirectly by promoting academic success and directly by supporting important executive and other cognitive functions (e.g., Conrod et al., 2013Conrod P.J. O’Leary-Barrett M. Newton N. Topper L. Castellanos-Ryan N. Mackie C. Girard A. Effectiveness of a selective, personality-targeted prevention program for adolescent alcohol use and misuse: a cluster randomized controlled trial.JAMA Psychiatry. 2013; 70: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Canadian-led studies of brain plasticity have also revealed the interactive effects of early experience, stress, nutrition, sleep, and exercise on learning outcomes, all of which have important implications for how educational environments are structured. In adulthood, new doors are open to optimizing education in the workplace and to ensuring an environment that supports peak human performance, whether through social supports and technological innovations or general health measures that promote resilience in the adult brain. The transformation of the fields of psychiatry and neurology with the discovery of biomarkers has led to opportunities for detection and early intervention around vulnerability before disease emerges, advanced diagnostics, and improved follow-up of response to treatment. Canadians have been pioneers in developing novel neurodevelopmental and adult biomarkers for diseases for which diagnosis has historically relied largely on interview data and patient reports. With this transformation comes the significant responsibility both for deliberation and action, especially when applied to pediatric populations, for which prediction is not 100% accurate, and for cases where interventions might modify outcomes. The management of unexpected interventional consequences or abnormal findings in research and clinical medicine can pose unique human rights challenges for researchers, research participants, healthcare recipients, and third parties. Canadian neuroethicists and others have made pioneering contributions to this landscape (Illes et al., 2006Illes J. Kirschen M.P. Edwards E. Stanford L.R. Bandettini P. Cho M.K. Ford P.J. Glover G.H. Kulynych J. Macklin R. et al.Working Group on Incidental Findings in Brain Imaging ResearchEthics. Incidental findings in brain imaging research.Science. 2006; 311: 783-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and continue to review and refine related processes through an open and democratic initiative led by Canada’s Secretariat on Responsible Conduct of Research, of the Tri-Agency (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council) Framework on Responsible Conduct of Research. Systematic neuroethical analyses have also yielded guidance for disclosure of educational and health events that integrate practical and legal considerations with explicit appreciation of human rights along the continuum of decisional capacity. Canadian neuroethics researchers have further created innovative models for conveying critical brain health information that accounts for age, individual values, cross-cultural considerations, variation in ability, and vulnerability. In an era of big data and the growing implementation of open science approaches in Canadian neurosciences (Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform; www.conp.ca), new strategies are continuously needed to ensure scientific standards and cultural sensitivity and to retain scientific, ethical, and legal relevance and responsiveness. To advance the goals of the CBRS, scholars and scientists working with the Apply pillar have adopted a spiral model of translation to enable iterative, rapid, and positive interactions between researchers and end-users: clinicians, policy-makers, trainees, affected clinical populations and their advocacy, science writers, and news and social media. The spiral approach per se is novel for neuroethics, but it is well aligned with the pragmatic orientation of Canadian neuroethics that endeavors to:1.Harness neuroscience insights to maximize the potential of every individual at every life stage.2.Identify and promote factors that enhance individual and population resilience, prevent brain insults and health vulnerabilities, and promote recovery from brain disorders.3.Deliver innovative ethical and social frameworks needed to catalyze and protect advances in all aspects of neuroscience that pertain to the CBRS.4.Encourage the sharing of data, accelerated and systematized discovery, and the implementation, translation, and democratization of technology within the nation and eventually outside. Overall, the model embraces an evidence-informed approach to determine how research can be optimally synthesized and prioritized for the utmost ethical and social benefit of the citizens of our diverse country. Since approximately 2010, Canadian neurolaw scholarship has taken a comprehensive approach to issues related to the application of the law to neuroscience and to the incorporation of neuroscience evidence in legal disputes. Key neurolaw questions relate, for example, to legal concepts of responsibility, privacy, disability, mental health, human rights, intellectual property rights, and the regulation of healthcare (Chandler et al., 2018Chandler J.A. Harrel N. Potkonjak T. Neurolaw today - A systematic review of the recent law and neuroscience literature.Int. J. Law Psychiatry. 2018; (S0160-2527(18)30019-0)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2018.04.00Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence related to the brain is cited in the context of Canadian civil, criminal, and human rights cases in support of legal arguments about a broad range of matters. Neurolaw implications inform the strategic trajectories of the CBRS Apply pillar today as in, for example, a recent medicolegal dispute over end-of-life decision-making in a patient with a disorder of consciousness. The intersection of law with neuroscience in Canada is also illustrated with the continued debate over the concept of brain death, now 50 years after the landmark Harvard Committee report. This concept is fundamental to high-technology medicine that can now maintain at least some physiological functions artificially for long periods of time. Canadian courts are presently wrestling with multiple challenges to brain death as a purely biomedical concept and in the ways that neuroscience and neurotechnology may alter, but are unlikely to settle, the social, cultural, philosophical, and religious questions at the heart of this issue. Further providing deep roots for the CBRS Apply pillar, Canadian neuroethics scholarship has delved into the nature and impact of public discourse about neuroscience both in traditional and online media. This scholarship has applied new knowledge to a call for a cultural shift in academic institutions to promote and reward public and policy engagement (Illes et al., 2010Illes J. Moser M.A. McCormick J.B. Racine E. Blakeslee S. Caplan A. Hayden E.C. Ingram J. Lohwater T. McKnight P. et al.Neurotalk: improving the communication of neuroscience research.Nat. Rev.

Research on the seductive allure of neuroimages in the media, sometimes called neuro-realism, has investigated the effect of visual information on people’s judgments, including in the context of addiction (Racine et al., 2017Racine E. Sattler S. Escande A. Free will and the brain disease model of addiction: The not so seductive allure of neuroscience and its modest impact on the attribution of free will to people with an addiction.Front. Psychol. 2017; 8: 1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Much remains to be explored in this area, and it has special salience for the understanding and dissemination of knowledge about substance-use disorders, the far-reaching impact of the opioid crisis across Canada, and this country’s harm-reduction strategies in the face of stigma, blame, and fluctuating political views. Finally, a uniquely Canadian initiative, the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR), emphasizes support, mutual respect, and a collaborative approach to the generation of knowledge for health and illness. In developing social policy that is responsive to recent advances in sciences, SPOR fosters inclusiveness of patients and their families, caregivers, and healthcare providers in research. Innovative research in ethics and the practice of brain science has harnessed novel tools to support engagement, for example, of participants with Alzheimer’s disease and uncovered critical tensions between research ethics board requirements and the values and priorities of patient communities. Research on brain science and social discourse and, in particular, Canadian studies on the representations of brain health and neurotechnologies in social media (Robillard et al., 2015Robillard J.M. Cabral E. Hennessey C. Kwon B.K. Illes J. Fueling hope: Stem cells in social media.Stem Cell Rev. 2015; 11: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have laid the foundational work for opportunities in the CBRS to co-build resources with patient communities and apply them to ensure that the needs of end-users are met. At the first meeting of the Global Neuroethics Summit in Daegu, South Korea, the Working Group identified five questions for neuroethicists in the respective Brain Initiatives to take home, contemplate, and address (Global Neuroethics Summit Delegates, 2018Rommelfanger K.S. Jeong S.J. Ema A. Fukushi T. Kasai K. Ramos K.M. Salles A. Singh I. Global Neuroethics Summit DelegatesNeuroethics questions to guide ethical research in the brain projects: A cross-cultural approach.Neuron. 2018; 100: 19-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As we have described in the framework for the CBRS and through the three specific themes of neurolaw, public discourse, and patient engagement as examples, four questions are in direct sight of the CBRS and its focus on learning, remembering, and adapting: (1) What is the potential impact of a biological model or neuroscientific account of disease on individuals, communities, and society? (2) What are the ethical standards of data collection, and how do local standards compare to those of global collaborators? (3) How could brain interventions impact or reduce autonomy? (4) In which contexts beyond the laboratory bench might an innovative technology be deployed? We emphasize the importance of cross-cultural considerations of privacy, consent, and responsibility as well as training and outreach among many other principles and goals relevant to this neuroethics conversation. We defer the fifth question, pertaining to capabilities that neural cells in vitro might reflect or acquire, to later phases of work and ongoing engagement with the International Brain Initiative. As the full implementation and governance plan of the CBRS unfolds in 2019, it will align with the government of Canada’s priorities of knowledge mobilization and translation, innovation capacity building, and a knowledge-based economy. It will build on our existing and many planned global collaborations: for example, with Australia for neurotechnology; with the U.S. for neurodegenerative diseases and disorders in neurodevelopment, including pediatric epilepsy; and with the ERA-NET Neuron Consortium and Human Brain Project for psychiatric neurosurgery and neuromodulation, among others. Dynamic new initiatives such as the recent Tri-Agency initiative on artificial intelligence and society are on the horizon. The evolution and refinement of the CBRS will follow in the historical footsteps of Canadian neuroethics and be guided actively and collaboratively by the robust and dedicated efforts of contemporary Canadian neuroethics leadership.

https://openalex.org/W2911801201,"Objective Research on serious infections/sepsis has focused on the hospital environment, while potentially the most delay, and therefore possibly the best opportunity to improve quality of care, lies in the prehospital setting. In this study we investigated the prehospital phase of adult emergency department (ED) patients with an infection. Methods In this prospective pilot study all adult (≥18y) patients with a suspected/proven infection, based on the notes in the patient’s ED chart, were included during a 4-week period in 2017. Prehospital course, ED findings, presence of sepsis and 30-day outcomes were registered. Results A total of 440 patients were identified, with a median symptom duration before ED visit of 3 days (IQR 1–7 days). Before arrival in the ED, 23.9% of patients had used antibiotics. Most patients (83.0%) had been referred by a general practitioner (GP), while 41.1% of patients had visited their GP previously during the current disease episode. Patients referred by a GP were triaged as high-urgency less often, while vital parameters were similar. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) transported 268 (60.9%) of patients. Twenty-two patients (5.0%) experienced an adverse outcome (30-day all-cause mortality and/or admission to intensive care). Conclusions Patients with a suspected infection had symptoms for 3 (IQR 1–7) days at the moment of presentation to the ED. During this prehospital phase patients often had consulted, and were treated by, their GP. Many were transported to the ED by EMS. Future research on severe infections should focus on the prehospital phase, targeting patients and primary care professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2912958796,"Knowledge on the relationships between species functional traits and environmental filters is key to understanding the mechanisms underlying the current patterns of biodiversity loss from a multi-taxa perspective. The aim of this study was to identify the main environmental factors driving the functional structure of a terrestrial vertebrate community (mammals, breeding birds, reptiles and amphibians) in a temperate mountain system (the Cantabrian Mountains; NW Spain). Based on the Spanish Inventory of Terrestrial Vertebrate Species, we selected three functional traits (feeding guild, habitat use type and daily activity) and defined, for each trait, a set of functional groups considering vertebrate species with common functional characteristics. The community functional structure was evaluated by means of two functional indexes indicative of functional redundancy (species richness within each functional group) and functional diversity. Ordinary least squares regression and conditional autoregressive models were applied to determine the response of community functional structure to environmental filters (climate, topography, land cover, physiological state of vegetation, landscape heterogeneity and human influence). The results revealed that both functional redundancy and diversity of terrestrial vertebrates were non-randomly distributed across space; rather, they were driven by environmental filters. Climate, topography and human influence were the best predictors of community functional structure. The influence of land cover, physiological state of vegetation and landscape heterogeneity varied among functional groups. The results of this study are useful to identify the general assembly rules of species functional traits and to illustrate the importance of environmental filters in determining functional structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities in mountain systems."
https://openalex.org/W2914796785,"The global population growth of the bed bug, Cimex lectularius (L.), is attributed to their cryptic behavior, diverse insecticide resistance mechanisms, and lack of public awareness. Bed bug control can be challenging and typically requires chemical and non-chemical treatments. One common non-chemical method for bed bug management is thermal remediation. However, in certain instances, bed bugs are known to survive heat treatments. Bed bugs may be present after a heat treatment due to (i) abiotic factors associated with the inability to achieve lethal temperatures in harborage areas for a sufficient time period, (ii) re-infestation from insects that escaped to cooler areas during a heat treatment or (iii) development of physiological resistance that allows them to survive heat exposure. Previous research has investigated the optimal temperature and exposure time required for either achieving complete mortality or sublethally affecting their growth and development. However, no research has examined bed bug populations for their ability to develop resistance to heat exposure and variation in thermo-tolerance between different bed bug strains. The goals of this study were: i) to determine if bed bugs could be selected for heat resistance under a laboratory selection regime, and ii) to determine if bed bug populations with various heat exposure histories, insecticide resistance profiles, and geographic origins have differential temperature tolerances using two heat exposure techniques (step-function and ramp-function). Selection experiments found an initial increase in bed bug survivorship; however, survivorship did not increase past the fourth generation. Sublethal exposure to heat significantly reduced bed bug feeding and, in some cases, inhibited development. The step-function exposure technique revealed non-significant variation in heat tolerance between populations and the ramp-function exposure technique provided similar results. Based on these study outcomes, the ability of bed bugs to develop heat resistance appears to be limited."
https://openalex.org/W2913715380,"Introduction To design effective policy and interventions, public health officials must have an accurate and granular picture of the state of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) in their region. The objective of this research is to describe the prevalence and distribution of MCC in New York State. Methods We performed a secondary data analysis of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2011 through 2016 for New York adults (n = 76,186). We analyzed the self-reported prevalence of individuals having 0, 1, 2, or ≥ 3 chronic conditions by sex, race/ethnicity, age, health insurance type, annual household income, and whether respondents lived in New York City. We also examined the most common condition dyads and triads. Finally, we assessed the prevalence of MCC (2 or more chronic conditions) by county across New York State, and neighborhood within New York City. Results During 2011–2016, 25.2% of adults in New York State had zero chronic conditions, 24.1% had 1 condition, 18.4% had 2 conditions, and 32.4% had 3 or more. The most prevalent dyad was hypertension and high cholesterol in 17.0% of individuals. The most prevalent triad was hypertension, high cholesterol, and arthritis in 4.5% of individuals. County prevalence of MCC ranged from 42.6% in Westchester County to 66.1% in Oneida County. The prevalence of MCC in New York City neighborhoods ranged from 33.5% in Gramercy Park—Murray Hill to 60.6% in High Bridge—Morrisania. Conclusion This research contributes to the field’s understanding of multiple chronic conditions and allows policy and public health leaders in New York to better understand the prevalence and distribution of MCC."

The China Brain Project is in development. Integrating an ethical framework to identify and assess ethical challenges and plan for solutions is a priority. Here Wang et al. discuss ethical questions emerging from brain research in the context of traditional Chinese culture and juxtapose the legacy of Confucianism with contemporary thinking. Research into the brain has grown globally in recent years, and the same is true in China. Highlighted in two important national policy documents of China—the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020) and Innovation of Science and Technology Forward 2030—the developing China Brain Project aims to understand the neural basis of human cognition, develop early diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for brain diseases, and develop brain-inspired intelligence technology (Poo et al., 2016Poo M.M.

China has the largest number of citizens suffering from brain diseases—it is estimated that about one-fifth of China’s current population of more than 1.3 billion suffers from chronic neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders (Chan et al., 2013Chan K.Y. Wang W. Wu J.J. Liu L. Theodoratou E. Car J. Middleton L. Russ T.C. Deary I.J. Campbell H. et al.Global Health Epidemiology Reference Group (GHERG)Epidemiology of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia in China, 1990–2010: a systematic review and analysis.Lancet. 2013; 381: 2016-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, Phillips et al., 2009Phillips M.R.

The China Brain Project focuses on three neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases: autism in children, depression in adults, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the aged population. The health burden associated with autism is high—more than a million people are suffering from autism in China, and a majority of them are mentally disabled (Li et al., 2011Li N. Chen G. Song X.

Outcomes Res. 2016; 16: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and more than half of the diagnosed patients have had suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation, plan, attempt, and completed suicide) during their lifetimes (Dong et al., 2018Dong M.

According to the National Statistics Bureau of China, more than 15% of China’s population was older than 60 years in 2014, and this percentage will keep increasing. Given the high incidence of AD in the elderly population, the health problems of AD are pressing. Urgent needs and strong government and public support have led to rapid development of brain science and technology in recent years. Scientific breakthroughs and the emergence of innovative technology can enable further understanding of brain functions. Yet with rapid development come legal, ethical, and social concerns. If not properly and adequately addressed, these ethical and social questions could undermine the achievement of neuroscience and may, in the long run, undermine societal prosperity and human well-being. Therefore, as the China Brain Project develops it also aims to integrate methods to address the ethical concerns raised by neuroscience research. In China, there is broad agreement that every important decision and action ought to be based on the common goal to improve the well-being of people and society. There is a saying from The Analects of Confucius that concisely summarizes what were considered “responsible actions”: do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire (己所不欲,勿施于人) (Figure 1). We have the responsibility to make every effort to avoid any potential harm that might be imposed upon people in society. Potential harms include but are not limited to threats to safety, privacy, and autonomy. Responsible research with goals oriented toward human well-being sets up the basis for the sustainability of brain science and technology. Recognizing the importance of neuroethics for brain science and technology, Chinese scientists and ethicists have been advocating for the integration of ethical, legal, and social issues into the planning phases and future implementation of the China Brain Project. We assessed the five neuroethics questions for neuroscientists (NeQNs) proposed at the 2017 Global Neuroethics Summit (October 17 and 18, 2017, Daegu City, Korea) (Rommelfanger et al., 2018Rommelfanger K.S. Jeong S.J. Ema A. Fukushi T. Kasai K. Ramos K.M. Salles A. Singh I. Global Neuroethics Summit DelegatesNeuroethics questions to guide ethical research in the international brain initiatives.Neuron. 2018; 100: 19-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in the context of traditional Chinese culture and juxtaposed the legacy of Confucianism with contemporary thinking. In this paper, we summarize ethical issues more relevant to the China Brain Project and explain our plans to address them. Note that opinions and suggestions in this paper are from scientists and ethicists and do not represent official standpoints of the Chinese government. The long and distinct history of China enabled this nation to develop its unique culture. Nurtured within the nation with the largest population in the world through thousands of years, faith in the power of people is deep-rooted in Chinese culture. So, Chinese values are people oriented. In Chinese, the character “人” represents one human being. Two “人”s form “从,” which means people follow or conform with each other. By adding one more “人” we get “众,” which refers to a large group of people together. This group of people can be family members, team members, residents of a community, or all the citizens in a country (Figure 1). The essence of a nation’s prosperity is the well-being of its people; thus, “people-oriented missions and goals” have been widely adopted by Chinese culture and philosophy. This “people-follow-society” philosophy enabled Chinese people to gain strengths in promoting goals for the common good, which set the basis for numerous great achievements. However, in extreme cases this philosophy may fall short regarding the value of individual personhood. Under the guidance of this philosophy, people can be encouraged to restrain their personal values to further benefit common good. However, this emphasis can move toward coercion and may at least partly explain why the importance of privacy, autonomy, or agency has been historically underemphasized in China. Rapid development in neuroscience can impose risks to human personhood. We must pay more and closer attention to issues of privacy, autonomy, and agency. The developing China Brain Project aims to understand the neural basis underlying cognition and to develop early diagnosis and therapeutics for brain diseases. Brain banks that contain healthy and diseased samples are important to these aims and will provide valuable benefits to the neuroscience community. However, in China, promoting organ donation is a difficult job and perhaps an even tougher one in terms of brain donation. NeQN 2b—Should special regard be given to brain tissue and its donors, given the origin of the tissue and its past?—is a particularly important question for us to address. A considerably large number of Chinese people believe that an organ or tissue of a person does not ultimately belong to him or her, but rather to his or her parents, and thus the individual himself or herself does not have the right to donate organs (from “The Classics of Filial Piety,” “身体发肤,受之父母,不可毁伤” in Chinese characters). The Red Cross Society of China and the nation’s health authorities have been promoting organ donation on a large scale since 2010 with little success, as only a little over 80,000 people had registered as donors by 2016 (http://www.cotdf.org). That number is disappointing, especially when compared to donor-registration rates in other countries—for example, some 130 million organ donors were registered in the United States by 2016. However, new initiatives in China to encourage organ donation appear more promising, and we will discuss these further below. One planned aim of the China Brain Project is to achieve early diagnosis and prediction of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, concerns exist around the extent to which prediction studies might increase social stigma about “diseased brains” or “brains that are prone to develop mental illnesses,” as mentioned in NeQN 1a: What are the possible consequences of neuroscience research on social stigma and self-stigma? In China, interpersonal relationships are of vital importance. Traditionally, people tend to view personal issues as issues that concern the whole family or community. Neuropsychiatric disease prediction might have a broader and more profound impact in China than in other more individualistic societies. In July 2018, residents of a community in Shenzhen boycotted cohabitation with 15 families with autistic children (http://news.163.com/18/0726/07/DNKFNNTQ0001875P.html). Major reasons for this boycott were worries and fears that mentally disabled residents would threaten community safety. Likewise, there have been cases where parents opposed autistic children attending classes with their children (http://health.sohu.com/20120918/n353436592.shtml), with similar worries. Solutions to these social problems are imperative. For research projects, adherence to ethical guidelines requires examination of the study purpose to avoid inhumane uses, regulation of methods and strategies for safety and validity, and precautionary measures on applications and deployments of research findings to avoid unintended consequences and impact. There are strict rules at the level of government agencies on general ethical standards on research involving human subjects or animals (Zhou and Poo, 2018Zhou Z. Poo M. Ethics in pace with scientific progress.Natl. Sci. Rev. 2018; 5: 299Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Yet particular ethical standards on neuroscience studies involving the human nervous system and human brain-inspired artificial intelligence are lacking at present in China. Worldwide, these standards are in development and vary internationally in scope. In our country, we are now working toward a series of interdisciplinary research projects on neuroethics. For example, a national-level interdisciplinary research project aiming at evaluating ethical issues of converging technology is ongoing (Wang and Ma, 2016Wang G.Y. Ma S.W. The ethical challenges of converging technologies and their solutions.Chinese Sci. Bull. 2016; 61: 1632-1639Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) in which ethical issues relevant to cognitive neuroscience will play a major part as the China Brain Project comes online. Communicating with and learning from other countries at the International Neuroethics Society meetings (https://www.neuroethicssociety.org/) is of great importance to us. Hosting and participation in international workshops and conferences like the International Workshop on Minding Neurotechnology: Delivering Responsible Innovation for Health and Well-being (http://www.oecd.org/sti/emerging-tech/workshop-on-minding-neurotechnology.htm) and the Global Neuroethics Summit (https://globalneuroethicssummit.com/) allow us to learn from other national brain initiatives, particularly on their infrastructure and integration measures of neuroethics into neuroscience and technology development agendas. Specific steps, such as how to incorporate a neuroethics committee into a brain initiative, who is expected to be in the committee, how to select committee members, what activities are planned, principles for evaluation of ethical problems, implementation of education and training programs on neuroethics, and practical strategies to increase public engagement are very inspiring and have provided us with excellent examples to learn from and follow. We will continue this collaboration, not only by continually taking part in international neuroethics conferences but also by inviting neuroethics experts to institutions, universities, and hopefully government agencies in China to share their knowledge and experience, and hopefully by sending Chinese students and scholars for overseas study and exchange on neuroethics through support from the China Scholarship Council. By learning from worldwide expertise and experience, we are confident that we will improve the ethical system in neuroscience and strengthen respect for personhood, autonomy, and privacy. We have seen strides with regards to data protection. Recognizing the necessity to enhance patient safety and standardization of clinical trials regulation, the China Food and Drug Administration in its recently published amendment to laws and regulations on clinical trials of medicine and medical devices in 2017 strengthened the encryption of patient information and emphasized that comprehensive informed consent is a prerequisite for all clinical trials (http://eng.sfda.gov.cn/WS03/CL0758/) unless an exemption of conformed consent application has been pre-approved. As we mentioned, establishing brain banks may be met with great difficulty in China because traditional filial piety culture is against organ donation. Public campaigns promoting organ donation that started in 2010 had limited impact before 2016. The turning point occurred in December 2016, when the China Organ Transplantation Development Foundation (COTDF) began to team up with Alipay, an online payment platform, to provide direct registration service for donors. The first day was immediately a big success: more than 3,000 new donors registered within 12 hr (http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1729/alipay-organ-donation-just-few-taps-away). Alipay had more than 450 million registered users by December 2016 who only needed to confirm their names and identification card numbers for registration, and the registration could be canceled anytime if they changed their minds later. The simple and quick registration process via Alipay lowered the threshold for potential donors. Before that, donors had to answer more than 20 questions to register. Jiefu Huang, the chief of COTDF, said he feared that each additional question drove away 1 million potential donors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), two major reasons for the reluctance of potential donors to register are that they have no idea where to register and that they find the process too laborious. By the end of 2017, the number of registered donors exceeded 350,000, among which 280,000 registered via the online and mobile registry Love&Hope, which can be directly accessed through Alipay (2017 Annual Report of COTDF, http://www.cotdf.org/uploadfile/2018/0608/20180608031750257.pdf). The majority of active Alipay users are young people, who more easily accept new ideas than the older generation. The average age of active Alipay users is 28 years, with only 2% older than 50 years up to 2016 (https://ab.alipay.com/index.htm?Nummain=13). Opinions from the younger generation are more diverse, and their attitudes are more open and inclusive. Promoting organ donation among this group of people is likely more effective than among older groups. This successful experience can be generalized to other activities. For instance, as well as creating neuroethics curriculums in institutions and schools, we are planning to launch training programs on mobile and online social media, e.g., WeChat, which has more than 1 billion registered users (http://tech.sina.com.cn/roll/2018-03-05/doc-ifyrztfz8050525.shtml). Posts from popular WeChat official accounts can easily have more than 100,000 reads. We have started and will continue posting education programs on facts of mental health problems through mobile and online social media. Lack of knowledge and understanding of these diseases among the public are major causes for social stigma and fear. Education programs run by neuropsychiatrists or neuroscientists through social media are very promising strategies to pass on facts and basic knowledge, improve public understanding and acceptance of mental problems such as autism or depression, and hopefully decrease social stigma about these mental problems in the future. Further public campaigns to promote organ donation could also be launched to reach more potential donors. It is likely that collaborations with social media will help to increase public awareness and engagement in neuroethical issues. It may also promote institutional efforts to implement supporting facilities and services for neuropsychiatric disease patients, who are in desperate need. Collaborations with mobile or online social media may work for certain purposes, such as general education and public campaigns, but may not reach groups of people who do not spend much time online. Innovation for plans to cover larger scopes of problems and demands such as strengthening supervisions and regulations on emerging tehcnology should never stop. These methodologies also might prove useful in engaging the public about other complex NeQNs, such as those related to exploring the moral significance of neural systems (NeQN 3), the relationship between brain interventions and autonomy (NeQN 4), and in which contexts neurotechnologies should be used beyond the laboratory (NeQN 5). While many scientists might think that we are nothing more than the neural activities of our brains, some philosophers hold the view that our brains are neither us nor our minds. Neuroreductionism tends to reduce complex mental phenomena to brain states, viewing the brain as the sufficient cause for cognition, emotion, and perception. However, the existence and features of qualia (subjective, conscious experience) shows that a reductionist account of consciousness lacks explanatory power. Our consciousness and mental contents are not shaped or caused by the brain alone but rather by the interaction of brain, body, and environment. While the interaction between body and brain has been ignored by reductionists, the interaction of mind and external environment has been simplified as well. As sentient and cognitive beings, we are both embodied and embedded bodies. Thus, a robust discussion among scientists and humanities scholars regarding neuroethics will have to go beyond mere discussion on the brain, especially in China, where the education and training between humanities and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors have long been separated and the conceptual understanding gap remains to be bridged."
https://openalex.org/W2911611212,"Government funding accounts for a large proportion of conservation and environmental improvements, and is often the result of citizen votes on state ballot measures. A key concern surrounding public investments in the environment is whether that funding serves lower-income communities, which are often the communities of greatest need. We applied three statistical methods to analyze the spatial distribution of conservation funding derived from California’s Proposition 84, which distributed nearly $4 billion across California between 2006 and 2015. First, we used hurdle models to ask if income, population density, urban coverage, or pollution could explain receipt of grants or magnitude of funding. Second, we compared the income levels of funded and unfunded communities for each chapter of the proposition. Finally, we examine two sections of the proposition that were intended to fund parks around the state and compare the attributes of funded and unfunded communities. Proposition 84 offers lessons for environmental legislation and future research. While there were general tendencies for more funding to flow to poor areas and areas with pollution problems, the language in Proposition 84 as a whole was vague with respect to the funding of disadvantaged areas, and as a result the targeting of these areas overall was at best modest. However, when enabling legislation (AB 31) defined specific “metrics of disadvantage” that had to be met by communities to receive funds from some sections of Proposition 84, the funds did flow much more selectively to poorer communities. This suggests that future ballot measures should be very explicit in their language if they want to promote equity in conservation investments, and that future research should investigate the extent to which technical workshops and outreach could further increase the number of funded grant proposals from low-income communities."

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of closeness to death on the utilization of acute hospital-based healthcare services and some primary healthcare services and compare differences in gender, age groups and major causes of death disease specific mortality. Methods A matched case-control study, nested in a cohort of 411,812 subjects, linked to administrative databases was conducted. All subjects were residents in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Italy), born before 1946, alive in January 2000 and were followed up to December 2014. Overall, 158,571 decedents/cases were matched by gender and year of birth to one control, alive at least one year after their matched case’s death (index-date). Hospital admissions, emergency department visits, drug prescriptions, specialist visits and laboratory tests that occurred 365 days before death/index-date, have been evaluated. Odds Ratios (ORs) for healthcare utilization were estimated through conditional regression models, further adjusted for Charlson Comorbidity Index and stratified by gender, age groups and major causes of death. Results Decedents were significantly more likely of having at least one hospital admission (OR 7.0, 6.9–7.1), emergency department visit (OR 5.2, 5.1–5.3), drug prescription (OR 2.8, 2.7–2.9), specialist visit (OR 1.4, 1.4–1.4) and laboratory test (OR 2.7, 2.6–2.7) than their matched surviving counterparts. The ORs were generally lower in the oldest age group (95+) than in the youngest (55–74). Healthcare utilization did not vary by sex, but was higher in subjects who died of cancer. Conclusion Closeness to death appeared to be strongly associated with healthcare utilization in adult/elderly subjects. The risk seems to be greater among younger age groups than older ones, especially for acute based services. Reducing acute healthcare at the EOL represents an important issue to improve the quality of life in proximity to death."
https://openalex.org/W2913502190,"Background We aimed to investigate the values and the changes of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin in pregnant women. Methods and results We prospectively collected the data of 405 pregnant women who were treated at Japanese general hospital between 2012 and 2013. We analyzed their laboratory data and echocardiographic findings during the third trimester (28–30 weeks’ gestation) and within 4 days of delivery. In addition, we evaluated the factors associated with elevation of BNP and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels. The pregnant women were 33.8 ± 5.0 years old and the prevalence of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and placental abnormality was 4.2% and 2.5%, respectively. BNP levels increased after delivery (13.2 pg/mL vs. 23.5 pg/mL; P <0.001), correlated with increased left ventricular diastolic dimension (P = 0.035), left atrial dimension (P <0.001), and decreased hemoglobin (P <0.001). Moreover, cTnI levels increased to over 0.015 ng/mL after delivery in 4.0% of pregnant women. In multivariate analysis, PIH (OR: 18.71, P = 0.003), placental abnormality (OR: 26.78, P = 0.007), and decreased hemoglobin after delivery (OR: 2.59, P <0.001) were the factors associated with elevated cTnI. Conclusions BNP levels increased in association with cardiac chamber enlargement and decreased hemoglobin after delivery. Additionally, the factors affecting elevated cTnI levels were related to labor and delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2912571778,"Dengue is a national priority disease in Cambodia. The Cambodian National Dengue Surveillance System is based on passive surveillance of dengue-like inpatients reported by public hospitals and on a sentinel, pediatric hospital-based active surveillance system. This system works well to assess trends but the sensitivity of the early warning and time-lag to usefully inform hospitals can be improved. During The ECOnomic development, ECOsystem MOdifications, and emerging infectious diseases Risk Evaluation (ECOMORE) project’s knowledge translation platforms, Cambodian hospital staff requested an early warning tool to prepare for major outbreaks. Our objective was therefore to find adapted tools to improve the early warning system and preparedness. Dengue data was provided by the National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) and are routinely obtained through passive surveillance. The data were analyzed at the provincial level for eight Cambodian provinces during 2008–2015. The R surveillance package was used for the analysis. We evaluated the effectiveness of Bayesian algorithms to detect outbreaks using count data series, comparing the current count to an expected distribution obtained from observations of past years. The analyses bore on 78,759 patients with dengue-like syndromes. The algorithm maximizing sensitivity and specificity for the detection of major dengue outbreaks was selected in each province. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 73% and 97%, respectively, for the detection of significant outbreaks during 2008–2015. Depending on the province, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 50% to 100% and 75% to 100%, respectively. The final algorithm meets clinicians’ and decisionmakers’ needs, is cost-free and is easy to implement at the provincial level."
https://openalex.org/W2913251092,"Globally, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in newborns, young children, and the elderly for which there is no vaccine. The RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is a major target for vaccine development. Here, we describe a novel monoclonal antibody (designated as R4.C6) that recognizes both pre-fusion and post-fusion RSV F, and binds with nanomole affinity to a unique neutralizing site comprised of antigenic sites II and IV on the globular head. A 3.9 Å-resolution structure of RSV F-R4.C6 Fab complex was obtained by single particle cryo-electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction. The structure unraveled detailed interactions of R4.C6 with antigenic site II on one protomer and site IV on a neighboring protomer of post-fusion RSV F protein. These findings significantly further our understanding of the antigenic complexity of the F protein and provide new insights into RSV vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2914391924,"Background Due to the increasing numbers of revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures being carried out, the frequency of major acetabular defects is also rising. A combination of an anti-protrusio cage and a dual mobility cup has been used in our department since 2007 in order to reduce the dislocation rate associated with complex defects. Although both implants have an important place in endoprosthetics, there are as yet limited data on the dislocation and complication rates with this combination. Methods This retrospective study included all patients in whom a Burch–Schneider cage and a dual mobility cup were implanted in our department between 2007 and 2014 and who had a minimum follow-up period of 24 months. Results The study included 79 patients with a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years. The implant survival rate was 85% at 65 months. Postoperative dislocation occurred in two cases (2.1%), with the first dislocation taking place within the first 3 weeks in both of these patients. Conclusions The present study shows a promising dislocation rate with a combination of an anti-protrusio cage and a dual mobility cup. Particularly in the medium-term follow-up, no further dislocations occurred in the study. A maximum cup inclination of 45° in revision cases was associated with a lower dislocation rate in this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2912218763,"In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is of high importance both for diagnostics, since drug resistance is primarily caused by the acquisition of SNPs in multiple drug targets, and for epidemiological studies in which strain typing is performed by SNP identification. To provide the necessary coverage of clinically relevant resistance profiles and strain types, nucleic acid-based measurement techniques must be able to detect a large number of potential SNPs. Since the Mtb problem is pressing in many resource-poor countries, requiring low-cost point-of-care biosensors, this is a non-trivial technological challenge. This paper presents a proof-of-concept in which we chose simple DNA-DNA hybridization as a sensing principle since this can be transferred to existing low-cost hardware platforms, and we pushed the multiplex boundaries of it. With a custom designed probe set and a physicochemical-driven data analysis it was possible to simultaneously detect the presence of SNPs associated with first- and second-line drug resistance and Mtb strain typing. We have demonstrated its use for the identification of drug resistance and strain type from a panel of phylogenetically diverse clinical strains. Furthermore, reliable detection of the presence of a minority population (<5%) of drug-resistant Mtb was possible."
https://openalex.org/W2911307959,"Plasmodium falciparum thymidylate kinase (PfTMK) showed structural and catalytic distinctions from the host enzyme rendering it a hopeful antiprotozoal drug target. Despite the comprehensive enzymologic, structural, inhibitory and chemical synthesis approaches targeting this enzyme, the elucidation of the exact mechanism underlying the recognition of the atypical purine substrates remains to be determined. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a broad range of substrates and inhibitors as well as the inhibitory properties of deoxyguanosine (dG) derivatives were used to assess the PfTMK substructure molecular rearrangements. The estimated changes during the favourable binding of high affinity substrate (TMP) include lower interaction with P-loop, free residue fluctuations of the lid domain and the average RMSD value. The RMSD of TMP complex was higher and more rapidly stabilized than the dGMP complex. The lid domain flexibility is severely affected by dGMP and β-thymidine derivatives, while being partially fluctuating with other thymidine derivatives. The TMK-purine (dGMP) complex was slowly and gradually stabilized with lower over all structure flexibility and residue fluctuations especially at the lid domain, which closes the active site during its catalytic state. Thymidine derivatives allow structure flexibility of the lid domain being highly fluctuating in α- and β-thymidine derivatives and TMP. dG derivatives remains less efficient than thymidine derivatives in inhibiting TMK. The variations in the structural dynamics of the P-loop and lid domain in response to TMP or dGMP might favour thymidine-based compounds. The provided MD simulation strategy can be used for predicating structural changes in PfTMK during lead optimization."
https://openalex.org/W2912950561,"Background Osteoporosis is a chronic disease whose prevention is more effective than treatment, but it may be necessary to change people’s self-efficacy to prevent this condition. This article aimed to study the pathway among information, beliefs and self-efficacy in osteoporosis prevention, and support further intervention. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among community residents over 40 years old from two volunteer communities in urban Shanghai, China. Of 450 middle-aged and older community residents who volunteered to participate in the study, 421 (93.5%) finished the field survey effectively. Results 62.9% of the residents were females. Their mean age was 64.4 ± 11.2 years. The residents showed low knowledge of osteoporosis-related information, and the mean percentage of correct response was just 61.2%. In univariate analysis, information (univariate β = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.15–0.38) and beliefs (univariate β = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.25–0.38) were associated with self-efficacy. Multivariate analysis showed that information (multiple β = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.09–0.36) and belief (multiple β = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.23–0.36) remained significant. And in the path analysis, self-efficacy was significantly predicted by beliefs (β = 0.81, p<0.001). Conclusions The study highlighted the urgency of conducting the osteoporosis preventive health promotion among middle-aged and older people as their lack of information and low level of beliefs and self-efficacy about osteoporosis prevention. Future interventions should focus on improving beliefs, especially perceived benefits, perceived threats, and action clues, on osteoporosis prevention in this group."
https://openalex.org/W2913482270,"While an ischemic insult poses a lethal danger to myocardial cells, a significant proportion of cardiac myocytes remain viable throughout the ischemic episode and die, paradoxically, only after the blood flow is reinstated. Despite decades of research, the actual chronology of critical events leading to cardiomyocyte death during the reperfusion phase remains poorly understood. Arguably, identification of the pivotal event in this setting is necessary to design effective strategies aimed at salvaging the myocardium after an ischemic attack. Here we used neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) subjected to 20-30 min of simulated ischemia followed by 1 hour of ""reperfusion"". Using different combinations of spectrally-compatible fluorescent indicators, we analyzed the relative timing of the following events: (1) abnormal increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] (TCaCy); (2) abnormal increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+] (TCaMi); (3) loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm) indicating mitochondrial permeability transitions (TMPT); (4) sacrolemmal permeabilization (SP) to the normally impermeable small fluorophore TO-PRO3 (TSP). In additional experiments we also analyzed the timing of abnormal uptake of Zn2+ into the cytoplasm (TZnCy) relative to TCaCy and TSP. We focused on those NRVMs which survived anoxia, as evidenced by at least 50% recovery of ΔΨm and the absence of detectable SP. In these cells, we found a consistent sequence of critical events in the order, from first to last, of TCaCy, TCaMi, TMPT, TSP. After detecting TCaCy and TCaMi, abrupt switches between 1.1 mM and nominally zero [Ca2+] in the perfusate quickly propagated to the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial [Ca2+]. Depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with ryanodine (5 μM)/thapsigargin (1 μM) accelerated all events without changing their order. In the presence of ZnCl2 (10-30 μM) in the perfusate we found a consistent timing sequence TCaCy < TZn ≤ TSP. In some cells ZnCl2 interfered with Ca2+ uptake, causing ""steps"" or ""gaps"" in the [Ca2+]Cy curve, a phenomenon never observed in the absence of ZnCl2. Together, these findings suggest an evolving permeabilization of NRVM's sarcolemma during reoxygenation, in which the expansion of the pore size determines the timing of critical events, including TMPT."
