The primary problems in fresh-water fisheries today concern interrelations between species, and population balance. In the ocean, interest centers on the effect environment exerts on population numbers. If, through careful study, the uncertainties can be eliminated, at least in large part, then the road is clear to measure the influence of the fishery on the maintenance of a high economic level of production. All this investigational subject matter goes by a variety of names, but I can think of none more appropriate than applied ecology. The time has come to crystallize our thinking in regard to these particular categories of knowledge, to encourage a uniform terminology, and to utilize an old and well-established concept-namely, the application of science to human affairs."

https://openalex.org/W1968321914,"HAGDAHL1 has described an improvement in adsorption technique of Tiselius and Claesson2, whereby much clearer fronts are obtained by the use of small filters which are easily packed. These can be coupled together by means of short distance-pieces with narrow bore which act as front straighteners. The parts of the column are entirely of stainless steel, which combines the necessary degree of rigidity with resistance to attack from solvents. It has, however, been found that in the presence of certain adsorbent materials such as carbon, such steel is not completely resistant to solutions buffered at very low pH."
