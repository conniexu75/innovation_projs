https://openalex.org/W1993888207,"Rates of morphological evolution documented in laboratory selection experiments, historical colonization events, and the fossil record are inversely related to the interval of time over which they are measured. This inverse relationship is an artifact of comparing a narrow range of morphological variation over a wide range of time intervals, and it is also a product of time averaging. Rates measured over different intervals of time must be scaled against interval length before they can be compared."

https://openalex.org/W2077381422,Oxygen isotopes were equilibrated between carbon dioxide and calcite at four temperatures in the range 350 degrees to 610 degrees C and between carbon dioxide and dolomite at 350 degrees and 400 degrees C. Carbon of unusual isotopic composition was used as a tracer to demonstrate the nature and extent of the exchange process. Extrapolation of these data at lower temperatures indicates that at 25 degrees C dolomite is enriched in oxygen-18 by 6.8 per mil with respect to calcite. This result indicates that those natural dolomite-calcite assemblages which show very small fractionations were not formed in isotopic equilibrium.

In responding to these volatile terpenes the bettles are directed to favorable breeding material."
https://openalex.org/W1994380053,Soft-bodied and lightly sclerotized Burgess shale fossils have been found at more than a dozen new localities in an area extending for 20 kilometers along the front of the Cathedral Escarpment in the Middle Cambrian Stephen Formation of the Canadian Rockies. Five different fossil assemblages from four stratigraphic levels have been recognized. These assemblages represent distinct penecontemporaneous marine communities that together make up a normal fore-reef faunal complex.

https://openalex.org/W2060003049,"A shear press has been used to determine the mechanical behavior of serpentinized dunite and forsterite at normal pressures to 50 kilobars, temperatures to 900째 C; and strain rates from 10-1 to 10-4 per second. The shear strength of dunite, containing less than 5 percent by volume of serpentine, is reduced by at least 30 percent as the temperature is raised from 300째 to 520째 C. Abundant kink bands develop at normal pressures above 35 kilobars at 27째 C and at lower pressures as the temperature is increased."

The complex could be disrupted by digestion with proteolytic enzymes. No electron transfer was observed when the complex was irradiated."

Using recent theoretical results concerning the nature of ejecta from impact craters in ice, the author concludes that the ratio of amorphous to crystalline ice surfaces should be lower than 1.0."
https://openalex.org/W1982929209,"Alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus, wash ashore from Onondaga Lake, N.Y., in the form of combustible concretions in which the mnuscles are replaced by calcium salts of fatty acids. In both distribution pattern and total concentration of fatty acids the concretions differ strikingly from normal carcasses. Carbon-13: carbon-12 ratios indicate that the concretions may have formed from lipids of terrestrial or freshwater organisms or from organic pollutants of nonmarine origin, or from lipids and pollutants."

https://openalex.org/W1970638224,"The equations of motion for the rotation of Mercury are solved for the general case by an asymptotic expansion. The findings of Liu and O'Keefe, obtained by numerical integration of a special case, that it is possible for Mercury's rotation to be locked into a 2:3 resonance with its revolution, are confirmed in detail. The general solution has further applications."

There was no localization in the abscission layer per se. Similar distribution patterns were observed in the abscission zone after naphthaleneacetic acid applications, which either delayed (10(-3)M) or accelerated (10(-5)M) abscission."

https://openalex.org/W2081718858,"Despite widespread concern about lagging productivity growth rates and renewed interest in research, federal support for the review and packaging of hard-won new knowledge continues to languish. Yet accurate, accessible data are critical, not only in every R&D project but also in the most advanced manufacturing processes. Ensuring reliable, retrievable data is not a function that can be left to the professional societies, the publishing industry, or the private sector. In this article a six-point national science and technology data policy is proposed, and it is suggested that progress ultimately will depend on an overall science and technology policy, the first priority of which is to make available existing knowledge."
