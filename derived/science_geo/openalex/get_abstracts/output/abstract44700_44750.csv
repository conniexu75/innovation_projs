https://openalex.org/W2014212152,"In rats, an environmental manipulation occurring early in life resulted in changes in the adrenocortical axis that persisted throughout the entire life of the animals and attenuated certain deficits associated with aging. Rats handled during infancy had a permanent increase in concentrations of receptors for glucocorticoids in the hippocampus, a critical region in the negative-feedback inhibition of adrenocortical activity. Increased receptor concentrations led to greater hippocampal sensitivity to glucocorticoids and enhanced negative-feedback efficacy in the handled rats. Thus, at all ages tested, rats that were not handled secreted more glucocorticoids in response to stress than did handled rats. At later ages, nonhandled rats also showed elevated basal glucocorticoid levels, with the result that there was a greater cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids in nonhandled rats. Increased exposure to adrenal glucocorticoids can accelerate hippocampal neuron loss and cognitive impairments in aging. Hippocampal cell loss and pronounced spatial memory deficits emerged with age in the nonhandled rats, but were almost absent in the handled rats. Previous work showed that glucocorticoid hypersecretion, hippocampal neuron death, and cognitive impairments form a complex degenerative cascade of aging in the rat. The present study shows that a subtle manipulation early in life can retard the emergence of this cascade."

https://openalex.org/W1971942838,"Two forms of protein-membrane anchor have been described for the externally disposed glycoproteins of eukaryotic plasma membranes; namely, the hydrophobic transmembrane polypeptide and the complex glycosylphosphatidylinositol (G-PI) moiety. The chemical structures of the major species of G-PI anchors found on a single variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei were determined by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical modification, and exoglycosidase digestions. The G-PI anchor was found to be heterogeneous with respect to monosaccharide sequence, and several novel glycosidic linkages were present. The results are pertinent to the mechanism of the biosynthesis of G-PI anchors."
https://openalex.org/W2955844533,"The human visual system can rapidly and accurately derive the three-dimensional orientation of surfaces by using variations in image intensity alone. This ability to perceive shape from shading is one of the most important yet poorly understood aspects of human vision. Here we present several findings which may help reveal computational mechanisms underlying this ability. First, we find that perception of shape from shading is a global operation which assumes that there is only one light source illuminating the entire visual image. This implies that if two identical objects are viewed simultaneously and illuminated from different angles, then we would be able to perceive three-dimensional shape accurately in only one of them at a time. Second, three-dimensional shapes that are defined exclusively by shading can provide tokens for the perception of apparent motion, suggesting that the motion mechanism is remarkably versatile in the kinds of inputs it can use. Lastly, the occluding edges which delineate an object from its background can also powerfully influence the perception of three-dimensional shape from shading."
https://openalex.org/W2001548627,"We show that Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) selectively affects a subset of skeletal muscle fibers specialized for fast contraction. Muscle fiber types were characterized immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies that distinguish isoforms of fetal and adult-fast or adult-slow myosin heavy chain present in the same fiber. Fetal myosin expression increased with patient age and was not due to arrested development but rather to de novo synthesis, which served as a sensitive indicator of muscle regeneration. A subset of fast fibers were the first to degenerate (type IIb). Extensive fast fiber regeneration occurred before slow fibers were affected. These results suggest that the DMD gene product has a specific function in a subpopulation of muscle fibers specialized to respond to the highest frequency of neuronal stimulation with maximal rates of contraction."

https://openalex.org/W2077090706,"By the end of 1987, nearly 50,000 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had been reported since 1981, 20,745 in the past year alone. Black and Hispanic adults and children have reported rates 3 to 12 times as high as whites. This can be largely attributed to higher reported rates in black and Hispanic intravenous (IV) drug abusers, their sex partners, and infants. In 1986, reported AIDS deaths increased adult male and female mortality in the United States by an estimated 0.7 and 0.07%, respectively, with much greater increases in selected age groups or areas of the country. The greatest variation in infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (0 to 70%) has been found in surveys of IV drug abusers, while surveys of homosexual men reveal infection rates of 20 to 50%. Infection with HIV ranged from 0 to 2.6% in limited sexually transmitted disease clinic surveys of heterosexual men and women without a history of IV drug abuse or known sexual contact with persons at increased risk. The modes of HIV transmission are now well understood, but a large amount of biologic variability in efficiency of transmission remains to be explained. The period between initial infection with HIV and the development of AIDS is variable, but the risk for disease progression increases with duration of infection."

https://openalex.org/W2095346194,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent growth and angiogenic factor that is found in abundance in tissues such as brain, hypothalamus, kidney and cartilage1,2. Despite this copious production of bFGF, most of these tissues are not undergoing either active growth or angiogenesis, suggesting that bFGF activity must be regulated so as to prevent autostimulation of cell growth. In cultured cells, bFGF is associated mainly with cells and basement membranes and is not released into the medium3,4. Prevention of release could be a mechanism for regulation of bFGF activity and may be a consequence of the apparent absence of a secretory-signal sequence in the bFGF protein5. Here we investigate whether this regulation can be overridden through the forced secretion of bFGF. Such secretion might provide the bFGF access to its receptor and in turn lead to autocrine transformation of the cell. We report that bFGF, as specified by a recombinant plasmid, is itself unable to induce such transformation, but acquires this ability after fusion with a secretory-signal sequence. The resulting transformants undergo unusual morphological alteration and display tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1980284247,"Recent reports of stratospheric ozone depletion have prompted concerns about the levels of solar ultraviolet radiation that reach the earth's surface. Since 1974 a network of ground-level monitoring stations in the United States has tracked measurements of biologically effective ultraviolet radiation (UVB, 290 to 330 nanometers). The fact that no increases of UVB have been detected at ground levels from 1974 to 1985 suggests that meteorological, climatic, and environmental factors in the troposphere may play a greater role in attenuating UVB radiation than was previously suspected."

https://openalex.org/W2074747188,"A sequencing method called genomic amplification with transcript sequencing (GAWTS) is described that is based on amplification with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). GAWTS bypasses cloning and increases the rate of sequence acquisition by at least fivefold. The method involves the attachment of a phage promoter onto at least one of the PCR primers. The segments amplified by PCR are transcribed to further increase the signal and to provide an abundance of single-stranded template for reverse transcriptase-mediated dideoxy sequencing. An end-labeled reverse transcriptase primer complementary to the desired sequence generates the additional specificity required to generate unambiguous sequence data. GAWTS can be performed on as little as a nanogram of genomic DNA. The rate of GAWTS can be increased by coamplification and cotranscription of multiple regions as illustrated by two regions of the factor IX gene. Since GAWTS lends itself well to automation, further increases in the rate of sequence acquisition can be expected."
https://openalex.org/W1988921746,"DNA packaging in vivo is very tight, with volume concentrations approaching 70% w/v in sperm heads, virus capsids and bacterial nucleoids. The packaging mechanisms adopted may be related to the natural tendency of semi-rigid polymers to form liquid crystalline phases in concentrated solutions. We find that DNA forms at least three distinct liquid crystalline phases at concentrations comparable to those in vivo, with phase transitions occurring over relatively narrow ranges of DNA concentration. A weakly birefringent, dynamic, 'precholesteric' mesophase with microscopic textures intermediate between those of a nematic and a true cholesteric phase forms at the lowest concentrations required for phase separation. At slightly higher DNA concentrations, a second mesophase forms which is a strongly birefringent, well-ordered cholesteric phase with a concentration-dependent pitch varying from 2 to 10 micron. At the highest DNA concentrations, a phase forms which is two-dimensionally ordered and resembles smectic phases of thermotropic liquid crystals observed with small molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2039697728,"A number of obstacles thwart effective education to prevent AIDS in the United States. These include the biological basis and social complexity of the behaviors that must be changed, disagreement about the propriety of educational messages to prevent AIDS, uncertainty about the degree of risk to the majority of Americans, and dual messages of reassurance and alarm from responsible officials. Long-term protection of an individual from infection requires extreme changes in risk-taking behavior. Partial shifts toward safer practices may be epidemiologically important in retarding the rate and extent of spread of infection. Though some striking changes in behavior have occurred, especially in homosexual populations in areas with high prevalence of AIDS, educational efforts to date have succeeded more in raising awareness and knowledge about AIDS than in producing sufficient changes in behavior. The United States has yet to mount a nationwide comprehensive, intensive, and targeted education program to prevent AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1818627611,"Using low-light digitized video microscopy, the onset, progression, and reversibility of anoxic injury were assessed in single hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats. Cell-surface bleb formation occurred in three stages over 1-3 h after anoxia. Stage I was characterized by formation of numerous small blebs. In stage II, small blebs enlarged by coalescence and fusion to form a few large terminal blebs. Near the end of stage II, cells began to swell rapidly, ending with the apparent breakdown of one of the terminal blebs. Breakdown of the bleb membrane initiated stage III of injury and was coincident with a rapid increase of nonspecific permeability to organic cationic and anionic molecules. On reoxygenation, stages I and II were fully reversible, and plasma membrane blebs were resorbed completely within 6 min of reoxygenation without loss of viability. Stage III, however, was not reversible, and no morphological changes occurred on reoxygenation. The results indicate that onset of cell death owing to anoxia is a rapid event initiated by a sudden increase of nonspecific plasma membrane permeability caused by rupture of a terminal bleb. Anoxic injury is reversible until this event occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1508072274,"A spectrophotometric method has been developed that uses extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) to trap nitric oxide (NO) released during denitrification as nitrosyl hemoglobin (HbNO). The rate of complexation of NO with Hb is about at the diffusion controlled limit for protein molecules and the product, HbNO, is essentially stable. Hb was added to an anaerobic bacterial suspension and denitrification was initiated with either KNO2 or KNO3. HbNO formation was observed for six species of denitrifying bacteria and showed isosbestic points at 544, 568, and 586 nm. Cellular NO production, presumably by nitrite reductase, was kinetically distinct from the much slower chemical reaction of Hb with KNO2 to form methemoglobin and HbNO. The rate of HbNO formation was proportional to cell density, essentially independent of pH from 6.8 to 7.4, nearly zero order in [Hb] and, at least with Paracoccus denitrificans, strongly inhibited by rotenone and antimycin A. The Cu chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate, had no effect on HbNO formation by Pa. denitrificans, but abolished that by Achromobacter cycloclastes which uses a Cu-containing nitrite reductase known to be inactivated by the chelator. HbNO formation did not occur with non-denitrifying bacteria. The stoichiometry at high [Hb] for conversion of Hb to HbNO was 1.3-1.8 KNO2 per Hb for Pa. denitrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and A. cycloclastes and about 3.4 for Pseudomonas stutzeri. The former range of values corresponds to a partition of about 2 N atoms in 3 toward trapping and 1 in 3 toward reduction on the pathway to N2. Nitrogen not trapped appeared largely as N2O in presence of acetylene. The results are consistent with a model in which NO is a freely diffusible intermediate between nitrite and N2O, providing that nitric oxide reductase is or nearly is a diffusion controlled enzyme."

After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, phosphorylation was apparent in many proteins, must abundantly in 42-, 47-, 50-, 60-, and 80-kDa proteins. In neutrophil cytoplasts from autosomal chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients that were stimulated with PMA, the phosphorylation of a 47-kDa protein is absent. The localization of this protein in PMA-activated control cytoplasts is mainly in the cytosol and, to a lower and more variable extent, in the membrane. After addition of purified protein kinase C to lysates of nonstimulated control cytoplasts, phosphorylation occurred at the 47-kDa level in both the cytosol and the membrane fraction. With lysates of autosomal CGD cytoplasts, in vitro phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein was completely absent. After separation of cytoplast proteins on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and excision of the 47-kDa protein(s), phosphorylation of the isolated 47-kDa band was observed in the presence of purified protein kinase C. This reaction was again absent when autosomal CGD cytoplasts were used as starting material. Our studies have identified the 47-kDa protein in neutrophil cytoplasts as a true substrate for protein kinase C and indicate that the defect in phosphorylation at the 47-kDa level in autosomal CGD cytoplasts is due to a defective protein."

https://openalex.org/W1525176931,"Type IX collagen in cartilage consists of molecules composed of three genetically distinct polypeptide subunits. One of the subunits, alpha 2(IX), contains a covalently attached glycosaminoglycan side chain whereas a second subunit, alpha 1(IX), contains a large noncollagenous, amino-terminal domain called NC4. In this report, we describe for the first time the complete primary structure of this noncollagenous domain, based on cloning and sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA as well as amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides. Analysis of genomic clones has also allowed determination of the exon structure of NC4. Our results demonstrate that the noncollagenous, amino-terminal domain of alpha 1(IX) chains contains 266 amino acid residues (including the signal peptide) with 5 cysteinyl residues forming two disulfide bridges. The domain is basic with an estimated pI of 9.7, thus supporting the idea that it may participate in ionic interactions with polyanionic glycosaminoglycans in cartilage. Both the sequence and exon structure of the NC4 domain is unique among collagens and there is no obvious homology with the noncollagenous domains of other types of collagen, including the propeptides of fibrillar collagens."

https://openalex.org/W1521606569,"When Vero cells with surface-bound 125I-labeled, nicked diphtheria toxin were exposed to pH 4.5, two polypeptides of Mr 20,000 and 25,000 became protected against externally applied Pronase E. The 20-kDa polypeptide appears to be the toxin A-fragment, whereas the 25-kDa polypeptide must be derived from the B-fragment. Permeabilization of the cells with saponin allowed efflux of the 20-kDa fragment to occur, whereas most of the 25-kDa polypeptide remained associated with the cells. A number of compounds and conditions which protect cells against diphtheria toxin prevented the protection against Pronase E. Protection of the 25-kDa polypeptide occurred even when the transmembrane proton gradient (delta pH) was dissipated by acidification of the cytosol, whereas protection and release of the A-fragment were prevented under these conditions. Electrical depolarization and ATP depletion of the cells did not inhibit protection and release of the A-fragment. The data indicate that delta pH is required for the transfer of the A-fragment to the cytosol, whereas the insertion of part of the B-fragment into the membrane occurs at low pH, even in the absence of a delta pH."
https://openalex.org/W1600304302,"The site density of the Na2+-Ca2+ exchanger in bovine cardiac sarcolemma was estimated from measurements of the fraction of reconstituted proteoliposomes exhibiting exchange activity. Sarcolemmal vesicles were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of either 100 mM NaCl or 100 mM KCl; after a 20-40-min incubation period on ice, sufficient KCl, NaCl, CaCl2, and soybean phospholipids were added to each extract to give final concentrations of 40 mM NaCl, 120 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 10 mg/ml phospholipid. These mixtures were then reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and the rate of 45Ca2+ isotopic exchange was measured under equilibrium conditions. Control studies showed that Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity was completely lost if Na+ was not present during solubilization. The difference in 45Ca2+ uptake between vesicles initially solubilized in the presence or absence of NaCl therefore reflected exchange activity and corresponded to 3.1 +/- 0.3% of the total 45Ca2+ uptake by the entire population of vesicles, as measured in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Assuming that each vesicle with exchange activity contained 1 molecule of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange carrier, a site density of 10-20 pmol/mg of protein for the exchanger was calculated. The Vmax for Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity in the proteoliposomes was approximately 20 nmol/mg of protein.s which indicates that the turnover number of the exchange carrier is 1000 s-1 or more. Thus, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is a low density, high turnover transport system."
https://openalex.org/W2093492928,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. The research process will raise challenging ethical questions."

Electron microscopy of sections of Lowicryl K4M-embedded tissue reacted successively with antibodies and protein A-gold complexes showed apomucin exclusively in mucous cells within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, transitional elements of the endoplasmic reticulum, and vesicles at the cis side of the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus, forming mucous droplets, and mucous droplets contained no apomucin. Although the rough endoplasmic reticulum contained most of the apomucin in mucous cells, some cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope were devoid of apomucin. Examination of tissue sections treated with the glycosidases used to prepare apomucin revealed immunolabel for apomucin throughout the secretory pathway. Colloidal gold coated with Helix pomatia lectin was used to detect nonreducing N-acetylgalactosamine residues. In mucin-producing cells lectin-gold was found in the mucous droplets, the forming mucous droplets, and throughout the Golgi apparatus but mostly in the cis portion of this organelle. In tissue sections reacted successively with lectin-gold and anti-apomucin/protein A-gold, both types of gold complex could be found in the cis side of the Golgi apparatus. These data indicate that the O-glycosylation of mucin is a posttranslational event that occurs in the Golgi apparatus and begins in the cis side of the Golgi apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W1494048992,"Monocytes were isolated and established in vitro at different cell densities. The incorporation of [35S]sulfate into macromolecules in monocytes (day 1 in culture) and monocyte-derived macrophages (day 5 in culture) was found to increase with decreasing cell density in approximately the same way in both day 1 and day 5 cell cultures. [35S]Sulfate was found to be incorporated almost exclusively into chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) in both high and low density monocyte and monocyte-derived macrophage cultures. The molecular size of the [35S]CSPGs produced by the high and low cell density cultures were not found to differ as judged by gel chromatography elution patterns. The molecular size and the structure of the glycosaminoglycan chains were found to be almost similar in high and low density day 1 and day 5 cultures. Only a small degree of proteoglycan degradation could be observed in both high and low density cultures. Furthermore, cell density-dependent differences in CSPG biosynthesis could be observed already 2 h after the establishment of the cultures, indicating that a process of down-regulation in high density cultures was already in operation. The glycosaminoglycan synthesis in high cell density day 1 cultures could be increased slightly following exposure to 0.5 mM benzyl-beta-D-xyloside, but not to the same level as that observed in untreated low cell density cultures. By contrast, the expression of 35S-macromolecules by cells cultured at high cell density for 5 days could be increased by xyloside treatment almost to the same level as that observed in the low density cultures."

https://openalex.org/W1594040544,"The murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene gives rise to multiple polyadenylated mRNAs displaying heterogeneity in the length of the 3' untranslated region. These species are present in the cytoplasm at levels that vary over 2 orders of magnitude, suggesting that certain poly(A) sites are preferred over others. Previous observations have shown that three out of the four major sites of polyadenylation do not display consensus hexanucleotide (AATAAA, ATTAAA) signals. We have further analyzed the sequences involved in directing multiple polyadenylation events on the DHFR gene by focusing our attention on the 4.1- and 5.6-kilobase mRNAs, the lowest abundance DHFR species observed on RNA blot analysis. Identification and sequence analysis of the poly(A) addition sites corresponding to these species revealed appropriately positioned consensus hexanucleotide signals; additional nearby poly(A) sites were also detected which apparently do not use consensus hexanucleotides to direct poly(A) addition to DHFR mRNAs of relatively lower abundance. We have also identified polyadenylation sites downstream of the 4.1- and 5.6-kilobase sites which display consensus hexanucleotide signals and correspond to messenger species too rare for detection by routine RNA blot analysis. Our data bring to 11 the number of known functional poly(A) addition sites associated with the DHFR gene."

https://openalex.org/W1528486881,"The microheterogeneity of androgen-binding protein (ABP) from rat serum and epididymis was examined by subjecting purified native or deglycosylated preparations to analysis by one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose and immunochemical localization. Analysis of native ABP by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE confirmed earlier observations that it is composed of subunits and that the subunits of serum ABP had higher apparent molecular weights than those of epididymal ABP. Treatment with neuraminidase, N-glycanase, or O-glycanase, alone or in combination, resulted in decreases in the apparent molecular weight of the subunits. These analyses indicated that terminal sialic acid residues and Asn-linked oligosaccharides were present on both subunits of ABP from the two sources. The fact that the greatest reduction in the Mr of the heavy subunit occurred following treatment with all three enzymes provides evidence that O-linked sugars are present on it. While enzyme treatment did not result in the appearance of a single subunit, chemical deglycosylation did (Mr 39,600). The carbohydrate composition of the heavy and light subunits of intact serum and epididymal ABP was 22 and 9% and 19 and 8%, respectively. Analysis by two-dimensional PAGE indicated that both subunits of the ABPs were composed of isoelectric variants. Although ABP from the two sources had several variants in common, differences were also observed. Treatment of the ABPs with the enzymes resulted in a shift of the pI values to a more basic pH range, indicating that carbohydrate removal also removed charged moieties. The most dramatic shift in the pI values of the isoforms occurred when O-glycanase was present in the enzyme mixture, providing further evidence for the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides on ABP. Isoelectric variants were present even after chemical deglycosylation of ABP."
https://openalex.org/W1536232044,"A cytosolic receptor protein for oxygenated sterols, postulated to be involved in the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol biosynthesis, can be labeled covalently by photoactivation of 7,7‘-azo-[5,6-3H]cholestane-3 beta,25-diol. Other compounds tested for their potential as photoaffinity reagents were: 25-hydroxycholesta-4,6-dien-3-one, 3 beta,25-dihydroxycholest-5-en-7-one, and 3 beta-hydroxycholesta-8(14),9(11)-dien-15-one. These sterols did not bind to the receptor with adequate affinity, were not readily photolyzed, or did not react covalently with the receptor during photolysis. The successful photoaffinity label, 7,7‘-azocholestane-3 beta,25-diol, binds to the receptor with high affinity (Kd = 9.1 nM). After activation of the partially purified oxysterol-receptor complex with UV light (greater than 300 nm), several covalently labeled proteins were found upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Labeling of one protein, Mr approximately 98,000, was much reduced when the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of an excess of unlabeled oxysterol. Under the reaction conditions investigated so far, approximately 1% of the specifically bound sterol was covalently linked after photolysis. These results are consistent with previous information suggesting that the Mr of the receptor subunit is approximately 97,000. The covalent labeling of the receptor reported herein should facilitate its further purification and characterization."

Cultures were labeled with [32P]phosphate for 24 h and extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation using affinity-purified anti-serum directed against the carboxyl terminus of Peptide B. A 4.6-kDa-labeled peptide was observed in autoradiograms of immunoprecipitates separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis; this peptide was not observed when excess antigen was present during the immunoprecipitation. Radioimmunoassay of extracts prepared from adrenal medullary tissue and separated by isoelectric focusing revealed the presence of four isoelectric forms of Peptide B-immunoreactive peptides; these peptides also exhibited Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe immunoreactivity. The isoelectric points of these peptides (4.5, 4.3, 4.1, and 3.9) were consistent with the predicted pI values for phosphorylated derivatives of Peptide B. Treatment of samples with alkaline phosphatase prior to isoelectric focusing resulted in the conversion of the more acidic forms to the least acidic form. The presence of phosphate in the more acidic peaks was additionally verified by isoelectric focusing of 32P-labeled immunoprecipitates; the pI values of the radioactive peptides corresponded precisely to the peaks of immunoreactivity. In adrenal medullary tissue, the relative contributions of the various phosphorylated species to the total Peptide B immunoreactivity were as follows: unphosphorylated form, 13%; singly phosphorylated, 31%; doubly phosphorylated, 37%; and triply phosphorylated, 17%.

Both reactions are biphasic. The slow phase in CO-combination and the fast phase in CO-dissociation are due to the reactions of alpha CO2 beta T2 or alpha 2 beta 2CO,T. The fast phase in CO-combination reaction has two components, one due to the dimers of the hybrid and the other due to the R-state tetramer. Immediately after the reduction of the valency hybrids, the overall system is represented by the equation: 2 alpha CO beta in equilibrium alpha 2CO beta 2R in equilibrium alpha 2CO beta 2T or (formula: see text) If the solutions are aged for 3-11 s, the R-state population is reduced gradually to a very small size, and the main species after 11 s of aging are dimers and T-state tetramers. Analysis of the kinetic data indicates slow R in equilibrium T equilibria in the absence of phosphates and significant dissociation of the T-state tetramer. It is concluded that the subunit contacts alpha 1-beta 2 (or alpha 2-beta 1) are impaired seriously in the hybrids. Very slow R in equilibrium T relaxation makes these hybrids unlikely intermediates in the sequential binding of CO to Hb tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1520577861,"Two mechanisms have been postulated for the formation of bound alpha-iminoglutarate intermediate during the glutamate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reductive amination of alpha-ketoglutarate; one involves the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on a covalently bound Schiff base in the enzyme-NADPH-alpha-ketoglutarate complex, and the other involves the reaction of ammonia with the carbonyl group of alpha-ketoglutarate in the ternary complex. We have measured the rates of carbonyl oxygen exchange in the complex to unambiguously distinguish between these two mechanisms. We find that the loss of label in the carbonyl oxygen-labeled ternary complex is at least 10(5) times slower than the rate of the reductive amination reaction. Therefore, the former mechanism cannot be operative. We also find that (i) the carbonyl oxygen exchange in free alpha-ketoglutarate proceeds without any significant catalysis by its gamma-carboxylate group; (ii) this exchange reaction has energy parameters which are comparable to those observed for the hydration of simple aliphatic ketones; and (iii) the carbonyl oxygen exchange in bound alpha-ketoglutarate is slower than that in the free keto acid over a wide pH range. We conclude that the oxygen exchange in the free and bound alpha-ketoglutarate must occur via a gem-diol intermediate. The observation that the enzyme inhibits the reaction of water with alpha-ketoglutarate while it catalyzes the reaction of ammonia with the same keto acid points to an extraordinary recognition of ammonia by the enzyme. We interpret this observation by assuming that the enzyme-NADPH-alpha-ketoglutarate complex exists in two forms, a predominant form which is produced rapidly upon mixing the components together and an unstable form which is produced in trace amounts from the predominant form via a gem-diol intermediate. These two forms are presumed to differ in the spatial relationship of the carbonyl group to the enzyme functional groups. The carbonyl group in the unstable form is assumed to be surrounded by the same enzyme groups as the iminium ion is in the bound iminoglutarate complex. We ascribe the remarkable catalysis of the ammonia reaction and the inhibition of the water reaction by the enzyme to the opposing interactions of the iminium and carbonyl groups with these surrounding enzyme groups."
