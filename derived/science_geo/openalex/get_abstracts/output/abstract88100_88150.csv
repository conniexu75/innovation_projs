https://openalex.org/W1550499229,"Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells are associated with an unusually stable fibrinolytic inhibitor (Loskutoff, D.J., van Mourik, J.A., Erickson, L.A., and Lawrence, D. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 2956-2960). This inhibitor was purified to apparent homogeneity from medium conditioned by these cells by a combination of concanavalin A affinity chromatography and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is a single-chain glycoprotein of apparent Mr 50,000 +/- 2,500 and isoelectric point of 4.5-5.0, and inhibits the ability of both urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator to cleave and active plasminogen. This inhibition of plasminogen activator activity is associated with the formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex which can be detected after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The purified inhibitor retains full activity after incubation in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, or at pH 2.7, two treatments which rapidly destroy the activity of protease nexin, another cellular inhibitor of fibrinolysis. The inhibitor purified from cloned endothelial cells cultured in the presence of L-[3,4,5-3H]leucine represented 2.5-12% of the total radiolabeled protein released by the cells in a 24-h period. These results indicate that cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells synthesize and secrete a protein which inhibits plasminogen activators and is distinct from protease nexin. It is a major endothelial cell product, and, as such, probably plays an important role in regulating the fibrinolytic system of these cells."

https://openalex.org/W1600409420,"Abstract In clonal rat pituitary cells (GH cells), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) induced a pattern of changes in cytosolic free calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) composed of two phases: an acute to micromolar levels which decayed (t1/2 = 8 s) to a near-basal concentration and then rose to a prolonged of elevated [Ca2+]i (as measured using Quin 2). Closely following these changes in [Ca2+]i, TRH stimulated a rapid spike phase of pronounced, but brief, enhancement of the rate of prolactin and growth-hormone secretion and then a plateau phase of prolonged enhancement. These two phases were dissociated using two classes of pharmacologic agents: the ionophore ionomycin, and a calcium channel antagonist nifedipine. Ionomycin (100 nM) specifically blocked (less than 90%) the of TRH action by rapidly emptying the TRH-regulated reservoir of cellular Ca2+ to generate a TRH-like in [Ca2+]i; nifedipine inhibited (less than 50%) the of TRH-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and hormone secretion by preventing Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. These agents demonstrated that the TRH-induced in [Ca2+]i in GH cells is caused by release of an ionomycin-sensitive pool of cellular Ca2+ with a small component (10%) due to influx of extracellular Ca2+. The TRH-induced in [Ca2+]i is due to influx of extracellular Ca2+, about half of which enters through voltage-dependent calcium channels and half of which enters via nifedipine/verapamil-insensitive influx. The TRH-induced in [Ca2+]i led to a burst in hormone secretion, and the in [Ca2+]i produced a prolonged enhancement of secretion; the and phases were generated independently by TRH. A in [Ca2+]i is necessary, but not sufficient, to induce burst release of hormone, while the prolonged rate of hormone secretion is intimately related to the steady-state [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W2004162860,"Immunocytochemistry revealed that synapsin I is preferentially (and possibly exclusively) associated with small (40- to 60-nanometer) synaptic vesicles and not with large (greater than 60-nanometer) dense-core vesicles in bovine hypothalamus. These observations may explain why synapsin I is found exclusively in neurons, since small synaptic vesicles are specific to neurons whereas large dense-core vesicles in neurons may be considered the equivalent of secretory organelles in endocrine cells."

https://openalex.org/W2062927712,Chromosome 14 breakpoints in malignant human lymphocytes cluster on the long (q) arm near bands q11 and q32. An inversion of chromosome 14 due to breaks in q11.2 and q32.3 has now been found in a newly established childhood T-cell lymphoma cell line and confirmed in T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A translocation was also found between chromosomes 10 and 14 with a breakpoint at 14q11.2 in another T-cell lymphoma cell line. It is proposed that a proximal region on chromosome 14 in or near sub-band q11.2 is related to T-cell function. Rearrangements in this region may affect the growth of T lymphocytes and be involved in the development of T-cell malignancies.
https://openalex.org/W1507441545,"Substoichiometric concentrations of cytochalasin D inhibited the rate of polymerization of actin in 0.5 mM MgCl2, increased its critical concentration and lowered its steady state viscosity. Stoichiometric concentrations of cytochalasin D in 0.5 mM MgCl2 and even substoichiometric concentrations of cytochalasin D in 30 mM KCl, however, accelerated the rate of actin polymerization, although still lowering the final steady state viscosity. Cytochalasin B, at all concentrations in 0.5 mM MgCl2 or in 30 mM KCl, accelerated the rate of polymerization and lowered the final steady state viscosity. In 0.5 mM MgCl2, cytochalasin D uncoupled the actin ATPase activity from actin polymerization, increasing the ATPase rate by at least 20 times while inhibiting polymerization. Cytochalasin B had a very much lower stimulating effect. Neither cytochalasin D nor B affected the actin ATPase activity in 30 mM KCl. The properties of cytochalasin E were intermediate between those of cytochalasin D and B. Cytochalasin D also stimulated the ATPase activity of monomeric actin in the absence of MgCl2 and KCl and, to a much greater extent, stimulated the ATPase activity of monomeric actin below its critical concentration in 0.5 mM MgCl2. Both above and below its critical concentration and in the presence and absence of cytochalasin D, the initial rate of actin ATPase activity, when little or no polymerization had occurred, was directly proportional to the actin concentration and, therefore, apparently was independent of actin-actin interactions. To rationalize all these data, a working model has been proposed in which the first step of actin polymerization is the conversion of monomeric actin-bound ATP, A . ATP, to monomeric actin-bound ADP and Pi, A* . ADP . Pi, which, like the preferred growing end of an actin filament, can bind cytochalasins."
https://openalex.org/W1490211977,"NADH:ubiquinone reductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial inner membrane respiratory chain binds a number of mitochondrial matrix NAD-linked dehydrogenases. These include pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. No binding was detected between complex I and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, or fumarase. The dehydrogenases that bound to complex I did not bind to a preparation of complex II and III, nor did they bind to liposomes. The binding of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase to complex I is a saturable process. Based upon the amount of binding observed in these in vitro studies, there is enough inner membrane present in the mitochondria to bind the dehydrogenases in the matrix space. The possible metabolic significance of these interactions is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1550774611,"The oxygen-labile, activating enzyme for iron protein from the photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum, was purified 11,800-fold using a combination of chromatophore washing, DE52-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, reactive red-120 cross-linked agarose chromatography, reactive red-120 cross-linked agarose chromatography, and Sephadex G-75 gel filtration. Activating enzyme appeared homogeneous on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and the staining intensity of the activating-enzyme band was correlated with the activating-enzyme activity observed in in vitro assays. Either formaldehyde fixation or higher acrylamide concentration was required to accurately assess the purity of activating enzyme on silver-stained gels. Activating enzyme was stable for 30 days at 4 degrees C. Dithiothreitol was a necessary component for the stability of partially purified activating enzyme. NaCl inhibited the coupled assay for activating enzyme. The pI of activating enzyme was determined to be 6.5. Activating enzyme is composed of a minimum of 336 amino acids and a minimum calculated Mr is 32,032. The Mr of activating enzyme was estimated to be 21,700 by analytical gel filtration and 32,800 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An absorption maximum at 280 nm was observed for the activating enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1527640586,"Abstract In our previous study, a Burkitt lymphoma-associated antigen defined by a monoclonal antibody, designated 38.13, was characterized as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, Gal alpha 1----4 Gal beta 1----4 Glc beta 1----1 Cer) (Nudelman, E., Kannagi, R., Hakomori, S., Parsons, M., Lipinski, M., Wiels, J., Fellous, M., and Tursz, T. (1983) Science (Wash. D.C.) 220, 509-511). Consequently, we have studied the enzymatic basis and organization of Gb3 expression in Burkitt as compared with non-Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines. Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (Ramos, Daudi, Put) were characterized by a high chemical quantity of Gb3, high enzyme activity for synthesis of Gb3 (UDP-Gal:LacCer alpha-galactosyltransferase), and a high degree of surface exposure of Gb3, as determined by galactose oxidase/NaB[3H]4 and by cytofluorometry with the monoclonal antibody to Gb3 (38.13). Non-Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines (Priess, Remb1, and ARH77) were characterized by the absence of Gb3 at the cell surface detected by cytofluorometry or cell-surface labeling. The cell lines Priess and Remb1 did not contain Gb3 and showed a low alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis. However, the cell line ARH77, though it did not express Gb3 at the cell surface, was found to contain a large chemical quantity of Gb3 and a high level of alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis. However, Gb3 of ARH77 cells was exposed by sialidase treatment, but not by protease treatment, although Gb3 itself was not sialylated. The crypticity of Gb3 in ARH77 cells could be associated with an adjacent sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate at the cell surface, in the same way as Gg3 in mouse lymphoma L5178 (Urdal, D. L., and Hakomori, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6869-6874). Thus, the expression in Burkitt and non-Burkitt lymphoma is dependent on (i) Gb3 synthesis due to alpha-galactosyltransferase activity and (ii) membrane organization of Gb3, which may be controlled through interaction with the sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate."

https://openalex.org/W1623935262,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum intrinsic fluorescence level was closely correlated with the ATPase functional state, from pH 5.5 to 8.5. The fluorescence signal was used in stopped flow measurements for direct study of transient pump kinetics after calcium binding or removal. The signal change time course, which depends solely on the free calcium concentration in the observation chamber, was analyzed as a single exponential. Rate constants (kobs) were relatively slow (5 to 20 s-1), indicating multistep interaction between calcium and the transport protein. At pH 7 and 20 degrees C, and in the presence of 100 mM potassium and 1 to 20 mM MgCl2, kobs first decreased, and then increased as the calcium concentration rose. Similar experiments were performed at pH 6. Data were analyzed according to a scheme in which sarcoplasmic reticulum . calcium complex formation is controlled by a slow isomerization step occurring either before or after the rapid calcium binding to the high affinity site. The results are discussed with reference to published rapid quenching experiments. Under our conditions, i.e. in the absence of a calcium gradient across the membrane, the calcium pump cycle step in which reorientation of the calcium binding sites occurs cannot be identified with the isomerization step mentioned above."
https://openalex.org/W1531053494,"PC12, a clonal line of rat pheochromocytoma, accumulates newly synthesized acetylcholine in storage granules. The accumulation of acetylcholine in PC12 granules, but not acetylcholine synthesis, was inhibited by treatment of the cells with any of several inhibitors of energy metabolism. These included nigericin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and iodoacetate. Valinomycin alone and oligomycin were without effect. Except for iodoacetate, these agents did not exert their effects on acetylcholine storage by depleting the cells of ATP."

https://openalex.org/W71541723,"Regulatory circuits have been defined in Neurospora cmsa within which multiple unlinked genes are controlled in a positive fashion by major regulatory genes. It has been suggested that repetitive DNA sequences situated adjacent to structural genes may serve as regulatory sites. Experiments are presented which examine the amount and organization of the repetitive sequences of Neurospora. The genome consists of 2.7 X 10’ base pairs and is composed of 2% foldback, 8% repetitive, and 90% single copy sequences. Our results indicate that the repeated DNA sequences are organized in stretches of 10,000 base pairs or longer. Experiments using pure ribosomal DNA isolated from cloned recombinant DNA demonstrated that rDNA represents 7% of total nuclear DNA and 88% of the repetitive component. The rDNA sequence is repeated about 185 times per nucleus. Since the ribosomal DNA units are believed to be tandemly repeated many times, their clustering can largely account for the long repetitive stretches and their lack of interspersion with single copy DNA. These results argue that repetitive DNA sequences identified by renaturation experiments do not serve a regulatory function in Neurospora. About 350 foci of inverted repeat, or foldback, DNA sequences occur in the genome and are interspersed with single copy DNA. The relatively small number of foldback foci suggest that inverted repeats also cannot be the primary recognition elements for control of gene expression in Neurospora. We suggest that very short repeated sequences, undetected by renaturation experiments, may serve as recognition sites for eukaryotic gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1585224973,"Heart mitochondria depleted of endogenous divalent cations by treatment with A23187 and EDTA swell in (a) K+ acetate or (b) K+ nitrate when an uncoupler is present. These mitochondria also exchange matrix 42K+ with external K+, Na+, or Li+ in a reaction that does not require respiration and is insensitive to uncouplers. Untreated control mitochondria do not swell in either medium nor do they show the passive cation exchange. Both the swelling and the exchange reactions are inhibited by Mg2+ and by quinine and other lipophilic amines. Swelling and exchange are both strongly activated at alkaline pH, and the exchange reaction is also increased markedly by hypotonic conditions. All of these properties correspond to those reported for a respiration-dependent extrusion of K+ from Mg2+-depleted mitochondria, a reaction attributed to a latent Mg2+- and H+-sensitive K+/H+ antiport. The swelling reactions are strongly inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide reacted under hypotonic conditions, but the exchange reaction is not sensitive to this reagent. Heart mitochondria depleted of Mg2+ show marked increases in their permeability to H+, to anions, and possibly to cations, and the permeability to each of these components is further increased at alkaline pH. This generalized increase in membrane permeability makes it likely that K+/H+ antiport is not the only pathway available for K+ movement in these mitochondria. It is concluded that the swelling, 42K+ exchange, and K+ extrusion data are all consistent with the presence of the putative K+/H+ antiport but that definitive evidence for the participation of such a component in these reactions is still lacking."

https://openalex.org/W1484115451,"1. Incubation of soluble spinach Coupling Factor 1 (CF1) with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) results in the inactivation of the ATPase. The DCCD inactivation is time- and concentration-dependent. Complete inactivation of the CF1-ATPase activity requires the binding of 2 mol of DCCD/mol of CF1. The binding sites of DCCD are located on the beta subunit of CF1. 2. DCCD modification of soluble CF1 eliminates one adenine nucleotide binding site which is exposed by dithiothreitol activation or by incubation with tentoxin. The inactivation of both the ATPase activity and the adenine nucleotide binding site are pH-dependent. The inactivation of both the ATPase activity and the adenine nucleotide binding site are pH-dependent. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at about pH 7.5. 3. The DCCD-modified CF1, reconstituted with EDTA-treated chloroplasts, is fully active is restoring proton uptake but not in restoring ATP synthesis or light-dependent adenine nucleotide exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1517307386,"In order to identify the physiological regulator of calcium dependent myosin light chain kinases of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles, the effects of the three homologous calciproteins, calmodulin, troponin C, and parvalbumin, on the kinases isolated from bovine myocardium, rabbit skeletal muscle, and turkey gizzard were examined. Only calmodulin was effective in stimulating the cardiac, skeletal, or smooth muscle kinase; troponin C and parvalbumin exhibited no activation of any of the three kinases, even when examined at concentrations as high as 10-(5) M. It is concluded that calmodulin is the specific regulator of myosin light chain kinase in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1594644076,"Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used to selectively label the rabbit intestinal brush-border imino carrier, identify the binding protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and monitor the effect of ions on fluorescein quenching. FITC inhibits Na+-dependent L-proline transport irreversibly, but transport is protected by physiological concentrations of Na+ and L-proline. About 1 nmol of FITC/mg of protein binds specifically to the transporter, which was identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 100 +/- 5-kDa peptide. Na+ produced a specific, saturable quench in the fluorescence of FITC bound to the proline carrier. Both transport and FITC quenching are inhibited by n-acetylimidazole, and membranes are protected from acetylation by Na+. We conclude that Na+ binds to the proline carrier (100-kDa peptide) to produce a change in conformation that results in an increase in the affinity of the carrier for proline."
https://openalex.org/W1483449743,"The localization of carbon monoxide oxidase (CO oxidase), the key enzyme in CO metabolism of Pseudomonas carboxydovorans, was examined using modified immunoferritin and protein A-gold techniques. Cell extracts were incubated with specific immunoglobulin G antibodies raised against CO oxidase, followed by treatment with ferritin-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies (pre-embedding labeling). Electron microscopic examination of ultrathin sections showed cytoplasmic membranes and inside-out vesicles labeled at the inner aspect, whereas the outer sides of protoplasts and membrane vesicles remained completely unlabeled. The highly sensitive protein A-gold method has been modified to allow labeling of CO oxidase with good ultrastructural preservation of the bacterial cell. Glutaraldehyde-fixed cells of P. carboxydovorans were osmificated and embedded in glycol methacrylate. Etched ultrathin sections were treated with sodium metaperiodate and incubated with the specific antibodies against CO oxidase. These antibodies were then allowed to react with protein A-gold complexes (postembedding labeling). Exponentially grown cells showed 87% of CO oxidase associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and 13% of the enzyme in the cytoplasm. The results indicate that CO oxidase is attached in vivo to the inner aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane and suggest interaction of the enzyme with a membrane-bound electron acceptor. The ratio of enzyme associated with the cytoplasmic membrane decreased to 50% in the stationary growth phase."
https://openalex.org/W1522745504,"The membrane-bound enzyme of microsomes that catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of the 14-double bond of conjugated delta 8,14- and delta 7,14-sterols has been studied both as collected in microsomes from broken cell preparations of rat liver and after solubilization. Optimal incubation conditions for assay of the membrane-bound enzyme have been determined, and properties of the microsomal enzyme have been established with respect to cofactor requirements, kinetics, pH, addition of inhibitors, addition of glycerol phosphatides, and sterol substrate specificity. The 14-reductase is readily solubilized with a mixture of octylglucoside and taurodeoxycholic acid. The solubilized enzyme has been enriched by precipitation with polyethylene glycol and chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxylapatite columns. The resulting partially purified enzyme has been obtained free of other microsomal enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis: 4-methyl sterol oxidase, delta 5,7-sterol 7-reductase, delta 8,24-sterol 24-reductase, 3-ketosteroid reductase, and steroid 8----7-ene isomerase, plus microsomal cytochrome P-450, cytochrome P-450 reductase, cytochrome b5 reductase, and cytochrome b5. The partially purified enzyme is stimulated by addition of phospholipids. All of the properties exhibited by partially purified 14-reductase are consistent with the suggestion that the solubilized and enriched enzyme catalyzes the microsomal reduction of the 14-double bond of the sterol-conjugated dienes. However, presence of the enzyme does not prove that the sterol-conjugated dienes are obligatory precursors of cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1679107190,"Acute treatment of rats with glucagon increased the Vmax but did not change the Km (ATP) of uncoupler-activated ATPase in subsequently isolated hepatic mitochondria. The hormonal stimulation was evident in mitoplasts but not in submitochondrial particles nor after lysis of the mitochondria. The rate of Pi-ATP exchange of intact mitochondria was also increased by glucagon treatment. The hormonal stimulation of ATPase was dependent on concentration of the uncouplers, being absent at minimally effective concentrations while high concentrations inhibited the ATPase. Inhibitors of adenine nucleotide transport decreased ATPase activity without evidence of sigmoidicity in the response curves and produced linear Dixon plots indicating that the ATPase was limited by the rate of adenine nucleotide transport. Glucagon treatment did not change the number of binding sites for transport inhibitors. Glucagon stimulated the rate of transport of ATP as measured by accumulation of labeled nucleotide. This was found to be the consequence of an enlarged pool of exchangeable adenine nucleotides within mitochondria from glucagon-treated animals. This increase in mitochondrial nucleotides appears to explain a number of the effects of hormones on mitochondrial functions including the stimulation of uncoupler-activated ATPase activity."

A novel method was used based on acetolysis of the bi[14C,3H] galactosylated oligosaccharide products formed by the enzymes in vitro and analysis of the acetolysis fragments by high-pressure liquid chromatography. It could be established that the galactosylation of different oligosaccharide branches occurred in a preferred order. No difference in branch specificity was observed between the soluble bovine colostrum galactosyltransferase and the enzyme that had been solubilized from calf thymus membranes. A preferential pathway for the biosynthesis of bisialylated biantennary glycans is proposed."

The amounts of total ATP, MgCl2, and CaCl2 required to yield particular concentrations of MgATP2-, free Mg2+, and free Ca2+ were determined mathematically, and the final concentration of free Ca2+ was confirmed using the calcium indicator dye arsenazo III. Calcium accumulation was linear for 40 min in the presence of ATP and for at least 60 min in the presence of ATP and oxalate. When the calcium ionophore A-23187 was added at the end of an uptake experiment, 95% of accumulated calcium was released. There was a single affinity for calcium with a Km of 3.4 +/- 0.4 microM. Rduced glutathione in the assay medium increased the Vmax but did not alter the Km. The optimal pH was 6.9 to 7.3, and the optimal temperature was 40 degrees C with an Ea of 14.3 kcal/mol. The dependence of calcium accumulation on [MgATP2-] and [ATP4-] could not be measured separately in this assay system. At half-maximal transport rate [MgATP2-] = 1.0 MM and [ATP4-] = 0.1 mM. The data suggest a complex kinetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1967013126,"The correlation between histochemical properties of muscle fibers and the pattern of innervation by the two motor neurons was studied in the asymmetric claw closer muscles of the lobster. The closer muscle of the cutter claw is composed of 65 percent fast muscle fibers and 35 percent slow muscle fibers, whereas that in the crusher claw has all slow muscle fibers. In both claws, myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase activity was independent of the pattern of innervation. Oxidative capacity, as measured by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide activity, was correlated with motor axon presence: Muscle fibers innervated solely by the ""fast"" motor axon had low oxidative capacity, muscle fibers receiving only the slow motor axon had very high oxidative capacity, and fibers innervated by both axons had intermediate properties. The data suggest that the motor neurons may exert trophic influences that control certain muscle fiber properties but not others."

The enzyme hydrolyzes peptides that have a low number of D- or L-amino acids. Proteins, polypeptides, and amino acid derivatives are not hydrolyzed. The enzyme acts as a carboxypeptidase with specificity toward small peptides. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing, and gel filtration showed the enzyme to be homogeneous. The native enzyme has Mr = 140,000 and consists of two subunits of Mr = 106,000 and 36,000, respectively. The enzyme has an isoelectric point at pH 6.1. The extinction coefficient is 336,000 at 278 nm and the absorption spectrum reveals no chromophoric cofactors. The apparent Km values for Gly-D-Ala, Gly-L-Ala, L-Ala-D-Ala, L-Ala-L-Ala, D-Leu-D-Leu, and L-Leu-L-Leu are 5.2, 7.7, 2.5, 2.8, 5.4, and 8.6 mM, respectively. The enzyme also hydrolyzes Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin, and [D-Ala2] X Met-enkephalin. It has a broad pH optimum from 7.2 to 8.8 with a maximum at pH 8.0. The enzyme activity is not inhibited or increased by Co2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+ at a concentration of 1 mM or by guanidine chloride (50 mM)urea (3 M), and EDTA (50 mM). 50 mM CaCl2, 1 mM CdCl2, and 1 mM Pb(CH3COO)2 inhibited the enzyme activity by 5-10%. Amino acid analysis of the purified enzyme revealed an abundance of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, and valine.

The specific activity was very low, but the activity was restored by drug treatment as well as adrenalectomy. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from one of the patients. With respect to its antigenicity and zinc content, the low-activity form was not distinguishable from the normal enzyme. On the other hand, the inhibition constant and binding affinity to acetazolamide of the low-activity enzyme were lower than those of normal enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1608453954,"The mechanism of host shut-off following virus T1 infection was studied using Escherichia coli wild type and ATPase deficient (unc-) cells. Host protein synthesis measured either as amino acid incorporation into proteins or as enzyme synthesis is immediately inhibited in T1-infected wild type cells. In contrast, host repression in the ATPase-deficient cells is almost unaffected after T1 infection. The continuation of host macromolecule synthesis in the unc- cells is due to constant ATP concentrations after infection, whereas an immediate drop in intracellular ATP levels in T1-infected wild type cells causes repression of host protein synthesis. This result is confirmed when host protein synthesis is determined at decreasing ATP concentrations following the starvation of cells."

Phosphate was found to have a dual effect on ADP binding; at low light intensities Pi enhanced the rate of binding and the total amount of tightly bound ADP, while at saturating light intensities, it decreased the level of bound nucleotides. Half-maximal stimulation or inhibition of ADP binding occurred at about 30 microM phosphate. 2. Phosphate inhibition of ADP binding at saturating light intensities is prevented in the presence of an ADP-regenerating system. Pi had no effect on the amount of ATP bound to chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1), which was lower than the amount of ADP bound. 3. Arsenate acted similarly to phosphate at low light intensities but not at saturating light intensities. 4. At low light intensities the interaction of phosphate with the membrane-bound CF1 increased the binding affinity for ADP about 8-fold. 5. Kinetic analysis of the ADP binding showed that phosphate increased the rate constant for ADP binding to the adenine nucleotide-depleted form of CF1."
