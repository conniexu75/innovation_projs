Numerous methods, gravimetric, turbidimetric, and calorimetric (l), have been tried and found wanting. Fischer (2) first introduced diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone) for the analysis of metals with relation to industrial processes. This organic dye combines with a number of the heavy metals (Sandell (3)). The combination is selective for any one metal, depending upon the pH of the solution containing the metals, and the presence of salts which form complexes with other metals in solution. It was not until 1937 that Fischer and Leopoldi (4) adapted the dithizone method to the analysis of inorganic zinc. Holland and Ritchie (5) and Cowling and BIiller (6) used this dye for zinc analyses in plants, and Hove et al. (7) in the measurement of carbonic anhydrase. The procedure employed by these authors, however, involved a preliminary extraction of other metals, principally copper, and a final extraction of zinc. Gettler (8) simplified the method by the use of a buffered solution of complex-forming salts, obviating the preliminary separation. We have further refined the method to obtain greater accuracy in the analysis of the zinc content of samples of whole blood, plasma, erythrocytes, and leucocytes and samples of tissue. Samples of the size which can be practicably obtained may contain as little as 1 to 5 y of zinc. Diphenylthiocarbazone has the following structural formula:"

https://openalex.org/W127683036,The present procedures were developed prior to a study of the changes in arginase activity in epidermal carcinogenesis because none of the existing methods was found to meet the minimal requirements for a good assay (1). Recent advances in the determination of arginase activity of purified liver extracts (2) and in the knowledge of metallic activation of arginase (3) have served as the basis for the modifications described herein.

However, with urease solutions stabilized with hydrogen sulfide or cysteine (1) we have observed that the specific activity of a given urease preparation, when determined under the above conditions, increases with decreasing apparent enzyme concentration over a wide range of concentrations and that this increase in specific activity proceeds with a measurable velocity at temperatures above 15°. This phenomenon was observed with crude urease preparations, such as jack bean meal, and with two, three, and seven times recrystallized urease. Since little or no difference was observed in the behavior of three and seven times recrystallized urease, the data presented in this paper are limited to those obtained with thrice recrystallized preparations. Urease activity was determined by a modification of the procedure described by Van Slyke and Cullen (3). The precision of the modified procedure was ±2 to 3 per cent."

Communications previously published on this subject1,2 appeared at an early stage of the study of myosin, that is, before Szent-Gyorgyi and his school3 had shown that myosin consists of at least two different proteins, actin and myosin proper. In connexion with work in this laboratory4 on the interaction between high-energy phosphate compounds and the different components of myosin, the investigations have been extended to monolayers of these proteins."
