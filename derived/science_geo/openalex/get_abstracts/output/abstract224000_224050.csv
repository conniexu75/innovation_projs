https://openalex.org/W2006141160,"THE wild hexaploid (2n = 72) species Solanum demissum Lindl. has been widely used in breeding for blight (Phytophthora infestans) resistance in potatoes. Crossed with cultivated S. tuberosum varieties (tetraploids with a chromosome number of 2n = 48) it gives pentaploid (2n = 60) hybrids which can be back-crossed by S. tuberosum. An alternative method of breeding has been suggested by Black1. This consists of crossing S. demissum with a diploid (2n = 24) species such as S. Rybinii to get a tetraploid (2n = 48) F1 hybrid, which is then crossed with S. tuberosum varieties. This latter method appears to have much to recommend it, particularly as Thomas2 states that, in the hybrid S. demissum × S. Rybinii and in the triple hybrid (S. demissum × S. Rybinii) × S. tuberosum, “chromosome differentiation between these related species is not sufficient to affect pairing to any extent”. This presumably means that, at least in the triple hybrid, about twenty-four bivalents are formed at meiosis."

https://openalex.org/W2093910599,"CYTOLOGISTS and others commonly refer to parthenogenesis as asexual reproduction. This usage is, for example, to be found in the books of Wilson1, Darlington2, and White3, along with the facts that indicate that parthenogenesis is a derivative of normal sexual reproduction. To an elementary student of these phenomena, parthenogenesis appears to have much more in common with other types of sexual reproduction, and to refer it to asexual reproduction puts it in the same general category as budding and fission, to which parthenogenesis has little or no significant resemblance. The fact that parthenogenetic eggs develop without fertilization is no doubt responsible for this usage, a fact which, however, need not carry the entire weight of the decision as between sexual and asexual reproduction. True enough the biological significance of sexual reproduction is in part dependent upon fertilization ; but most of this significance also relates to cross-fertilization, which is by no means co-extensive with sexual reproduction."

The technical methods used in this investigation consisted, briefly, in plating the samples directly on to Leifson's agar, and also after preliminary enrichment in selenite F medium and in tetrathionate broth. Wolff, Henderson and McCallum2 examined faecal specimens from a hundred city dogs in Michigan by preliminary incubation in tetrathionate broth followed by plating on S.S. agar. They found 18 (18 per cent) to be positive for salmonellae. Most of the positive samples were obtained from dogs suffering from distemper or from dogs maintained in a kennel where outbreaks of distemper and enteritis had occurred in the six months previous to sampling. Kintner3, simply by direct plating on S.S. agar, found 13 of 71 dogs (18 per cent) brought to the Ohio State Veterinary Clinic for treatment to be excreting salmonellae in their faeces. Of the dogs in this investigation, 50 per cent of those suffering from distemper were positive for salmonellae, as were 10 per cent of the non-distemper cases."

https://openalex.org/W1991602924,"THE periodical revivals of attempts at rearing harvest mites during the past half-century have led to few successes, and Trombicula autumnalis, the British harvest mite, has evaded the efforts of Hirst1, Andre2, Keay3, and others to rear it further than the nymphal stage. In view of the permanent hypogean existence of the nymphs and adults at some considerable depth below the surface of the soil (Cookings)4, it is not surprising that difficulties have been encountered in trying to discover the food and environmental requirements of the post-larval stages."
