https://openalex.org/W3197025106,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has enormously affected the psychological well-being, social and working life of millions of people across the world. This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress, fear and coping strategies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among Malaysian residents. Methods Participants were invited to an online cross-sectional survey from Aug-Sep 2020. The study assessed psychological distress using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, level of fear using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to adjust for potential confounders. Results The mean age (±SD) of the participants (N = 720) was 31.7 (±11.5) years, and most of them were females (67.1%). Half of the participants had an income source, while 216 (30%) identified themselves as frontline health or essential service workers. People whose financial situation was impacted due to COVID-19 (AOR 2.16, 95% CIs 1.54–3.03), people who drank alcohol in the last four weeks (3.43, 1.45–8.10), people who were a patient (2.02, 1.39–2.93), and had higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (2.55, 1.70–3.80) were more likely to have higher levels of psychological distress. Participants who self-isolated due to exposure to COVID-19 (3.12, 1.04–9.32) and who had moderate to very high levels of psychological distress (2.56, 1.71–3.83) had higher levels of fear. Participants who provided care to a family member/patient with a suspected case of COVID-19 were more likely to be moderately to highly resilient compared to those who did not. Conclusion Vulnerable groups of individuals such as patients and those impacted financially during COVID-19 should be supported for their mental wellbeing. Behavioural interventions should be targeted to reduce the impact of alcohol drinking during such crisis period."

Since organic foods developed, studies on consumer behavior and organic foods have contributed significantly to its development. The presesent study aims to identify the factors affecting consumer buying behaviour toward organic foods in the United States. Survey data are collected from 770 consumers in the Midwest, United States. ANOVA, multiple linear regression, factor analysis, independent t-tests, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis are used to analyze the collected primary data. This research confirms health consciousness, consumer knowledge, perceived or subjective norms, and perception of price influence consumers’ attitudes toward buying organic foods. Availability is another factor that affected the purchase intentions of consumers. Age, education, and income are demographic factors that also impact consumers’ buying behavior. The findings help marketers of organic foods design strategies to succeed in the US’s fast-growing organic foods market."
https://openalex.org/W3197672697,"China’s agricultural economy is developing rapidly, but the unbalanced regional development is still a key issue that needs to be discussed today. By studying the total factor productivity of green agriculture and its factors, this paper analyzes the regional differences in time and space changes between the eastern, central and western parts of China. In this paper, the total factor productivity of green agriculture is calculated and decomposed by Metafrontier Malmquist-Luenberger index based on directional distance function. The results are as follows: First, the total factor productivity level of green agriculture in China is increasing year by year, but the overall level is still at a low level and has greater volatility; Second, although the total factor productivity of green agriculture shows an upward trend, the three regions show a downward trend in turn, which has great differences; Third, there are obvious differences in technological efficiency, optimal production potential and technological gap between the eastern, central and western regions, and there are great differences in productivity among regions and provinces. Based on the results, this paper puts forward policy recommendations, according to the regional heterogeneity, from a number of angles to rely on the joint efforts of many parties to improve the level of total factor productivity of green agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3197493762,"Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV, ages 10-19) experience complex challenges to adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and remain in care, and may be vulnerable to wide-scale disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed for a range of effects of the pandemic on ALHIV in western Kenya, and whether effects were greater for ALHIV with recent histories of being lost to program (LTP).ALHIV were recruited from an ongoing prospective study at 3 sites in western Kenya. The parent study enrolled participants from February 2019-September 2020, into groups of ALHIV either 1) retained in care or 2) LTP and traced in the community. Phone interviews from July 2020-January 2021 assessed effects of the pandemic on financial and food security, healthcare access and behaviors, and mental health. Responses were compared among the parent study groups.Phone surveys were completed with 334 ALHIV or their caregivers, including 275/308 (89.3%) in the retained group and 59/70 (84.3%) among those LTP at initial enrollment. During the pandemic, a greater proportion of LTP adolescents were no longer engaged in school (45.8% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.017). Over a third (120, 35.9%) of adolescents reported lost income for someone they relied on. In total, 135 (40.4%) did not have enough food either some (121, 36.2%) or most (14, 4.2%) of the time. More LTP adolescents (4/59, 6.8% vs. 2/275, 0.7%, p = 0.010) reported increased difficulties refilling ART. Adolescent PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were ≥3 for 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively.The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating socioeconomic effects for Kenyan ALHIV and their households. ALHIV with recent care disengagement may be especially vulnerable. Meanwhile, sustained ART access and adherence potentially signal resilience and strengths of ALHIV and their care programs. Findings from this survey indicate the critical need for support to ALHIV during this crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3197058433,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of morbidity and disability worldwide and a healthcare burden. TBI is an important risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases hallmarked by exacerbated neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation in the cerebral cortex plays a critical role in secondary injury progression following TBI. The NOD-like receptors (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a key player in initiating the inflammatory response in various central nervous system disorders entailing TBI. This current study aims to investigate the role of NLRP3 in repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) and identify the potential neuroprotective effect of saffron extract in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. 24 hours following the final injury, rmTBI causes an upregulation in mRNA levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin-1Beta (IL-1β), interleukin 18 (IL-18), nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). Protein levels of NLRP3, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), and neuronal nuclei (Neu N) also increased after rmTBI. Administration of saffron alleviated the degree of TBI, as evidenced by reducing the neuronal damage, astrocyte, and microglial activation. Pretreatment with saffron inhibited the activation of NLRP3, caspase-1, and ASC concurrent to reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Additionally, saffron extract enhanced SIRT1 expression, NRF2, and HMOX1 upregulation. These results suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the subsequent inflammatory response in the mice cortex are involved in the process of rmTBI. Saffron blocked the inflammatory response and relieved TBI by activating detoxifying genes and inhibiting NLRP3 activation. The effect of saffron on the NLRP3 inflammasome may be SIRT1 and NF-κB dependent in the rmTBI model. Thus, brain injury biomarkers will help in identifying a potential therapeutic target in treating TBI-induced neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3170763809,"Equol, an isoflavone derivative whose chemical structure is similar to estrogen, is considered a potentially effective agent for relieving climacteric symptoms, for the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases, and for aging care in postmenopausal women. We investigated the effect of an equol-containing supplement on metabolism and aging and climacteric symptoms with respect to internally produced equol in postmenopausal women.A single-center, randomized controlled trial (registration number: UMIN000030975) on 57 postmenopausal Japanese women (mean age: 56±5.37 years) was conducted. Twenty-seven women received the equol supplement, while the remaining received control. Metabolic and aging-related biomarkers were compared before and after the 3-month intervention. Climacteric symptoms were assessed every month using a validated self-administered questionnaire in Japanese postmenopausal women.Three months post-intervention, the treatment group showed significant improvement in climacteric symptoms compared to the control group (81% vs. 53%, respectively, p = 0.045). We did not observe any beneficial effect on metabolic and aging-related biomarkers in the intervention group. However, in certain populations, significant improvement in skin autofluorescence, which is a measurement of AGE skin products, and visceral fat area was observed, especially among equol producers.Women receiving equol supplementation showed improved climacteric symptoms. This study offered a new hypothesis that there may be a synergy between supplemented equol and endogenously produced equol to improve skin aging and visceral fat in certain populations."
https://openalex.org/W3198305863,"Globally, millions of animals are rescued and rehabilitated by wildlife carers each year. Information gathered in this process is useful for uncovering threats to native wildlife, particularly those from anthropogenic causes. However, few studies using rehabilitation data include a diverse range of fauna, cover large geographical areas, and consider long-term trends. Furthermore, few studies have statistically modelled causes of why animals come into care, and what are their chances of survival. This study draws on 469,553 rescues reported over six years by wildlife rehabilitators for 688 species of bird, reptile, and mammal from New South Wales, Australia. For birds and mammals, ‘abandoned/orphaned’ and ‘collisions with vehicles’ were the dominant causes for rescue, however for reptiles this was ‘unsuitable environment’. Overall rescue numbers were lowest in winter, and highest in spring, with six-times more ‘abandoned/orphaned’ individuals in spring than winter. Of the 364,461 rescues for which the fate of an animal was known, 92% fell within two categories: ‘dead’, ‘died or euthanased’ (54.8% of rescues with known fate) and animals that recovered and were subsequently released (37.1% of rescues with known fate). Modelling of the fate of animals indicated that the likelihood of animal survival (i.e. chance of: being released, left and observed, or permanent care), was related to the cause for rescue. In general, causes for rescue involving physical trauma (collisions, attacks, etc.) had a much lower likelihood of animals surviving than other causes such as ‘unsuitable environment’, ‘abandoned/orphaned’, and this also showed some dependence upon whether the animal was a bird, reptile, or mammal. This suggests rehabilitation efforts could be focused on particular threats or taxa to maximise success, depending on the desired outcomes. The results illustrate the sheer volume of work undertaken by rehabilitation volunteers and professionals toward both animal welfare and to the improvement of wildlife rehabilitation in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3134499503,"Background Epidemiological features characterization of COVID-19 is highly important for developing and implementing effective control measures. In Saudi Arabia mortality rate varies between 0.6% to 1.26%. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether demographic characteristics (age and gender) and non-communicable diseases (Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus) have a significant association with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods Prior to data collection, an expedite approval was obtained from Institutional Review Board (IRB Log No: RC. RC20.09.10) in Al Habib Research Center at Dr. Sulaiman Al-Habib Medical Group, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This is a retrospective design where we used descriptive and inferential analysis to analyse the data. Binary logistic regression was done to study the association between comorbidities and mortality of COVID-19. Results 43 (86%) of the male patients were non-survivors while 7 (14%) of the female patients were survivors. The odds of non-survivors among hypertensive patients are 3.56 times higher than those who are not having a history of Hypertension (HTN). The odds of non-survivors among diabetic patients are 5.17 times higher than those who are not having a history of Diabetes mellitus (DM). The odds of non-survivors are 2.77 times higher among those who have a history of HTN and DM as compared to those who did not have a history of HTN and DM. Conclusions Those patients that had a history of Hypertension and Diabetes had a higher probability of non-survival in contrast to those who did not have a history of Diabetes and hypertension. Further studies are required to study the association of comorbidities with COVID-19 and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3197912265,"In this study, we report on a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) on how the quality of the quantitative instruments used to measure digital competencies in higher education is assured. 73 primary studies were selected from the published literature in the last 10 years in order to 1) characterize the literature, 2) evaluate the reporting practice of quality assessments, and 3) analyze which variables explain such reporting practices. The results indicate that most of the studies focused on medium to large samples of European university students, who attended social science programs. Ad hoc, self-reported questionnaires measuring various digital competence areas were the most commonly used method for data collection. The studies were mostly published in low tier journals. 36% of the studies did not report any quality assessment, while less than 50% covered both groups of reliability and validity assessments at the same time. In general, the studies had a moderate to high depth of evidence on the assessments performed. We found that studies in which several areas of digital competence were measured were more likely to report quality assessments. In addition, we estimate that the probability of finding studies with acceptable or good reporting practices increases over time."
https://openalex.org/W3196615344,"Background Due to the many restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 emergency, the normal clinical activities have been stopped abruptly in view of limiting the circulation of the virus. The extraordinary containment measures have had a dramatic impact on the undertaking and follow-up of ophthalmic outpatients. Objective In order to guarantee proper monitoring and routine care, the Pediatric Ophthalmology equipe of Rovereto Hospital (North-East of Italy) supported by the Competence Center on Digital Health TrentinoSalute4.0, designed and implemented a digital platform, TreC Oculistica, enabling teleophthalmology. We report our innovative—albeit restricted—experience aiming at testing and maximizing the efficacy of remote ophthalmic and orthoptic visits. Methods A multidisciplinary team created the TreC Oculistica platform and defined a teleophthalmology protocol. The system consists of a clinician web interface and a patient mobile application. Clinicians can prescribe outpatients with the App and some preliminary measurements to be self-collected before the televisit. The App conveys the clinician’s requests (i.e. measurements) and eases the share of the collected information in a secure digital environment, promoting a new health care workflow. Results Four clinicians took part in the testing phase (2 ophthalmologists and 2 orthoptists) and recruited 37 patients (mostly pediatric) in 3 months. Thanks to a continuous feedback between the testing and the technical implementation, it has been possible to identify pros and cons of the implemented functionalities, considering possible improvements. Digital solutions such as TreC Oculistica advance the digitalization of the Italian health care system, promoting a structured and effective reorganization of the workload supported by digital systems. Conclusions The study tested an innovative digital solution in the teleophthalmology context and represented the first experience within the Italian healthcare system. This solution opens up new possibilities and scenarios that can be effective not only during the pandemic, but also in the traditional management of public health services."

There was a gap regarding P. knowlesi acquisition risk factors related to practice specifically in working age group. The main objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for acquiring P. knowlesi infection in Sabah among the working age group.This retrospective population-based case-control study was conducted in Ranau district to assess sociodemographic, behavioural and medical history risk factors using a pretested questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23. Bivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression whereas multivariate analysis was conducted using multivariable logistic regression. We set a statistical significance at p-value less than or equal to 0.05.A total of 266 cases and 532 controls were included in the study. Male gender (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.63-4.50), spending overnight in forest (AOR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.20-3.06), not using mosquito repellent (AOR = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.36-4.56) and history of previous malaria infection (AOR = 49.34; 95% CI: 39.09-78.32) were found to be independent predictors of P. knowlesi infection.This study showed the need to strengthen the strategies in preventing and controlling P. knowlesi infection specifically in changing the practice of spending overnight in forest and increasing the usage of personal mosquito repellent."
https://openalex.org/W3197043288,"Although the Trans-Himalayan region (THR) is an important endemic and rendezvous area of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), monitoring and prevention measurements are difficult to execute because of the rough geographical conditions. Besides, a heterogeneous breeding system and the poor veterinary service of susceptible animals compound the existing problems. Here, we propose a forecasting system to define the key points of PPR prevention and aid the countries in saving time, labor, and products to achieve the goal of the global eradication project of PPR. The spatial distribution of PPR was predicted in the THR for the first time using a niche model that was constructed with a combination of eco-geographical, anthropoid, meteorological, and host variables. The transboundary least-cost paths (LCPs) of small ruminants in the THR were also calculated. Our results reveal that the low-elevation area of the THR had a higher PPR risk and was mainly dominated by human variables. The high-elevation area had lower risk and was mainly dominated by natural variables. Eight LCPs representing corridors among India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and China were obtained. This confirmed the potential risk of transboundary communication by relying on PPR contamination on the grasslands for the first time. The predicted potential risk communication between the two livestock systems and landscapes (high and low elevation) might play a role in driving PPR transboundary transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3197617566,"Background Bleaching is widely accepted for improving the appearance of discolored teeth; however, patient compliance is affected by bleaching-related complications, especially bleaching sensitivity. This study aimed to investigate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytotoxicity and pain conduction activated by experimental tooth bleaching. Methods Dental pulp stem cells with or without N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, were cultured on the dentin side of the enamel/dentin disc. Subsequently, 15% (90 min) and 40% (30 min) bleaching gels were painted on the enamel surface. Cell viability, intracellular ROS, Ca 2+ , adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and extracellular ATP levels were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, CellROX, fura-3AM fluorescence assay, and ATP measurement kit. The rat incisor model was used to evaluate in vivo effects after 0, 1, 3, 7, and 30 days of bleaching. Changes in gene and protein expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), and Pannexin1 (PANX1) in dental pulp stem cells and pulp tissue were detected through RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Results The bleaching gel suppressed dental pulp stem cell viability and extracellular ATP levels and increased intracellular ROS, Ca 2+ , and intracellular ATP levels. The mRNA and protein expression of IL-6, TNFα, TRPA1, and PANX1 were up-regulated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the 40% gel had a stronger effect than the 15% gel, and NAC ameliorated the gel effects. Conclusions Our findings suggest that bleaching gels induce cytotoxicity and pain conduction in dental pulp stem cells via intracellular ROS, which may provide a potential therapeutic target for alleviating tooth bleaching nociception."
https://openalex.org/W3197901668,"Tidal marshes have been recognized globally for their ability to sequester “blue carbon” but there is still a need for studies investigating the marsh response to restoration, particularly in the Pacific Northwest United States. Here we report carbon stocks and accumulation rates for restored and natural tidal marshes in the Stillaguamish River estuary in Puget Sound, Washington, where a 60-hectare marsh was reintroduced to the tidal regime from its previous use as diked and drained farmland. We found that the restoration not only maximized carbon accumulation but also enhanced resilience to rising sea levels. Four years after restoration, mean sediment carbon stocks in the upper 30 cm within the restored marsh (4.43 kg C m -2 ) were slightly lower than those measured in the adjacent natural marshes (5.95 kg C m -2 ). Mean carbon accumulation rates, however, were nearly twice as high in the restored marsh (230.49 g C m -2 yr -1 ) compared to the natural marshes (123.00 g C m -2 yr -1 ) due to high rates of accretion in the restored marsh (1.57 cm yr -1 ). Mean elevation change rates were nearly twice that of corresponding 210 Pb accretion rates, but all were greater than the current rate of sea level rise."
https://openalex.org/W3196413675,"Aspergillus niger metabolites exhibited a wide range of biological properties including antioxidant and neuro-protective effects and some physical properties as green synthesis of silver nanoparticles AgNP. The present study presents a novel evidence for the various biological activities of green synthesized AgNPs. For the first time, some isolated naphtho-γ-pyrones from marine-derived Aspergillus niger , flavasperone ( 1 ), rubrofusarin B ( 2 ), aurasperone A ( 3 ), fonsecinone A ( 4 ) in addition to one alkaloid aspernigrin A ( 7 ) were invistigated for their inhibitory activity of acetylcholine esterase AChE, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ability to synthesize AgNPs by compounds 3 , 4 and 7 has been also tested for the first time. Green synthesized AgNPs were well-dispersed, and their size was ranging from 8–30 nm in diameter, their morphology was obviously spherical capped with the organic compounds. Further biological evaluation of their AChE inhibitory activity was compared to the parent compounds. AgNps dramatically increased the inhibitory activity of Compounds 4, 3 and 7 by 84, 16 and 13 fold, respectively to be more potent than galanthamine as a positive control with IC 50 value of 1.43 compared to 0.089, 0.311 and 1.53 of AgNPs of Compounds 4, 3 and 7 , respectively. Also compound 2 showed moderate inhibitory activity. This is could be probably explained by closer fitting to the active sites or the synergistic effect of the stabilized AgNPs by the organic compouds. These results, in addition to other intrinsic chemical and biological properties of naphtho-γ-pyrones, suggest that the latter could be further explored with a view towards other neuroprotective studies for alleviating AD."
https://openalex.org/W3196473013,"The Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) has previously been standardized in thirteen countries on three continents, confirming its status of gold standard test to detect minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). In the meantime, performance has also been shown to vary with variables such as age, education, and barely sex. The present study aimed at standardizing the PHES in a French population. One hundred and ninety-six French healthy participants completed a French version of the paper-and-pencil PHES, involving five tests and six measures. Importantly, the balance was perfect between all levels of the three controlled factors, which were sex, age (seven decade-levels from 20–29 to 80–89 years), and education (two levels below or above 12 years of education). Raw measures were transformed to fit the normal distribution. ANOVAs on transformed variables showed no effect of sex, but an effect of age on all measures, and of education on five measures. Multiple or simple regressions were completed to build up normograms. Thorough analysis of variability within each test failed to find outliers that may bias the results. Comparison between French and seminal German data showed that they highly fitted though cultural and cognitive style specificities could be observed. This is the first study to standardize the PHES in a French population and to extensively explore the effects of sex, age and education using perfectly balanced samples. Subtle differences between countries of the same continent emphasize the need to build up normative data in each country to get accurate PHES in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3197255058,"Diaporthe species are fungal plant pathogens of many important crops. Seed decay is one of the most important diseases on soybean. It is caused by various species of the genus Diaporthe and responsible for significant economic damage. In central Europe the four species D . longicolla , D . caulivora , D . eres , and D . novem are considered the principal species of Diaporthe on soybean. Fast and accurate detection of these pathogens is of utmost importance. In this study four species-specific TaqMan primer-probe sets that can be combined into a quadruplex assay were designed based on TEF sequences. The specificity and efficiency of the primer-probe sets were tested using PCR products and genomic DNA from pure cultures of the four Diaporthe species and other soybean fungal pathogens. Our results indicate that the primer-probe sets DPCL, DPCC, DPCE, and DPCN allow discrimination of D . longicolla , D . caulivora , D . eres , and D . novem , respectively, and can be used to detect and quantify these four Diaporthe species in parallel using quadruplex real-time PCR. In addition, the quadruplex real-time PCR assay was evaluated on different plant materials including healthy and infected soybean seeds or seed lots, soybean stems, and soybean leaves. This assay is a rapid and effective method to detect and quantify Diaporthe species from samples relevant for disease control."
https://openalex.org/W3197407404,"Autoimmune coagulation factor XIII deficiency is a bleeding disorder caused by the formation of autoantibodies against the coagulation factor XIII (FXIII); however, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate this mechanism by performing whole-exome sequencing analysis of 20 cases of autoimmune FXIII deficiency. We identified approximately 21,788-23,916 variants in each case. In addition to their ability to activate T cells, present antigens, and immune tolerance, the candidate alleles were further narrowed down according to their allelic frequencies and the magnitude of damage caused by the substitution of amino acids. After selecting 44 candidate alleles, we investigated whether they were associated with the FXIII inhibitory titers and/or the anti-FXIII autoantibodies. We found that two polymorphisms whose variant allele frequencies were significantly lower in the patients tended to decrease FXIII inhibitory titers as the number of variant alleles increased. We also found that five polymorphisms whose variant allele frequencies were significantly higher in the patients tended to increase the levels of the anti-FXIII autoantibodies as the number of variant alleles increased. All of these polymorphisms were found in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II molecules and their associated genes. In particular, the HLA class II molecule and its associated genes were found to be involved in the presentation of foreign antigens as well as the negative regulation of the proliferation of T-cells and the release of cytokines. Polymorphisms in the HLA class II molecules and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 have been reported to be associated with the development of autoantibodies in acquired hemophilia A. Therefore, we hypothesized that these polymorphisms may be associated with the development of autoantibodies in autoimmune FXIII deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3197865296,"Synaptic strengths between neurons in brain networks are highly adaptive due to synaptic plasticity. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a form of synaptic plasticity induced by temporal correlations between the firing activity of neurons. The development of experimental techniques in recent years enabled the realization of brain-inspired neuromorphic devices. Particularly, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) provide a suitable means for the implementation of learning processes in molecular junctions. Here, we first considered a two-neuron motif subjected to STDP. By employing theoretical analysis and computer simulations we showed that the dynamics and emergent structure of the motif can be predicted by introducing an effective two-neuron synaptic conductance. Then, we considered a phenyl-based single-molecule MTJ connected to two ferromagnetic (FM) cobalt electrodes and investigated its electrical properties using the non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) formalism. Similar to the two-neuron motif, we introduced an effective spin-polarized conductance in the MTJ. Depending on the polarity, frequency and strength of the bias voltage applied to the MTJ, the system can learn input signals by adaptive changes of the effective conductance. Interestingly, this voltage-dependent plasticity is an intrinsic property of the MTJ where its behavior is reminiscent of the classical temporally asymmetric STDP. Furthermore, the shape of voltage-dependent plasticity in the MTJ is determined by the molecule-electrode coupling strength or the length of the molecule. Our results may be relevant for the development of single-molecule devices that capture the adaptive properties of synapses in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3198231624,"Squamates are ideal subjects for investigating relationships between diet and dental patterns because they exhibit wide dietary diversity, marked variation in dental shape, and are taxonomically abundant. Despite this, well-established links between diet and dental morphology are primarily qualitative in nature, with specific patterns of squamate dental complexity remaining largely unknown. Here, we use quantitative methods and a broad taxonomic dataset to quantify key patterns in squamate dental morphology, including re-examining the relationship between dentition and diet, testing for differences in complexity between dentigerous elements, and exploring the effect of ontogenetic dietary shifts in dental complexity in two iguanid genera. Our findings support previous research by demonstrating that species consuming more plant material possess more complex teeth. We did not find significant complexity differences between the left and right dentigerous elements nor the upper and lower jaws, with the exception of Amblyrhynchus cristatus , the marine iguana, which possesses significantly more complex dentary teeth than premaxillary and maxillary teeth. We find discordant patterns when testing for dental complexity changes through ontogeny. Amblyrhynchus , which is primarily herbivorous throughout its lifetime, increases dental complexity through ontogeny, whereas Ctenosaura , which is generally insectivorous as juveniles and herbivorous as adults, decreases dental complexity. Although preliminary, this research documents and quantifies novel patterns of squamate dental complexity and exhibits the possibilities for further research on the diversity of squamate dental morphology."
https://openalex.org/W3198459947,"Recent relation extraction models’ architecture are evolved from the shallow neural networks to natural language model, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks to Bert. However, these methods did not consider the semantic information in the sequence or the distance dependence problem, the internal semantic information may contain the useful knowledge which can help relation classification. Focus on these problems, this paper proposed a BERT-based relation classification method. Compare with the existing Bert-based architecture, the proposed model can obtain the internal semantic information between entity pair and solve the distance semantic dependence better. The pre-trained BERT model after fine tuning is used in this paper to abstract the semantic representation of sequence, then adopt the piecewise convolution to obtain semantic information which influence the extraction results. Compare with the existing methods, the proposed method can achieve a better accuracy on relational extraction task because of the internal semantic information extracted in the sequence. While, the generalization ability is still a problem that cannot be ignored, and the numbers of the relationships are difference between different categories. In this paper, the focal loss function is adopted to solve this problem by assigning a heavy weight to less number or hard classify categories. Finally, comparing with the existing methods, the F1 metric of the proposed method can reach a superior result 89.95% on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3198819459,"Adult spinal deformity (ASD) is usually rigid and requires a combined anterior-posterior approach for deformity correction. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) allows direct access to the disc space and placement of a large interbody graft. A larger interbody graft facilitates correction of ASD. However, an anterior approach carries significant risks. Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) through a minimally invasive approach has recently been used for ASD. The present study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) in the treatment of ASD. We performed a retrospective study utilizing the data of 74 patients with ASD. The inclusion criteria were lumbar coronal Cobb angle > 20°, pelvic incidence (PI)-lumbar lordosis (LL) mismatch > 10°, and minimum follow-up of 2 years. Patients were divided into two groups: ALIF combined with posterior spinal fixation (ALIF+PSF) (n = 38) and OLIF combined with posterior spinal fixation (OLIF+PSF) (n = 36). The perioperative spinal deformity radiographic parameters, complications, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes were assessed and compared between the two groups. The preoperative sagittal vertical axis (SVA), LL, PI-LL mismatch, and lumbar Cobb angles were similar between the two groups. Patients in the OLIF+PSF group had a slightly higher mean number of interbody fusion levels than those in the ALIF+PSF group. At the final follow-up, all radiographic parameters and HRQoL scores were similar between the two groups. However, the rates of perioperative complications were higher in the ALIF+PSF than OLIF+PSF group. The ALIF+PSF and OLIF+PSF groups showed similar radiographic and HRQoL outcomes. These observations suggest that OLIF is a safe and reliable surgical treatment option for ASD."

The care seeking trajectory of patients with lung cancer in Bangladesh has not been explored, despite the differences in health systems and structures compared to high income countries. This study investigated the symptoms triggering healthcare seeking, preferred healthcare providers (including informal healthcare providers such as pharmacy retailers, village doctors, and ""traditional healers""), and the duration of intervals in the lung cancer care pathway of patients in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh among diagnosed lung cancer patients through face-to-face interview and medical record review. Time intervals from onset of symptom and care seeking events were calculated and compared between those who sought initial care from different providers using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Among 418 study participants, the majority (90%) of whom were males, with a mean age of 57 ±9.86 years, cough and chest pain were the most common (23%) combination of symptoms triggering healthcare seeking. About two-thirds of the total respondents (60%) went to informal healthcare providers as their first point of contact. Living in rural areas, lower levels of education and lower income were associated with seeking care from such providers. The median duration between onset of symptom to confirmation of diagnosis was 121 days, between confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of treatment was 22 days, and between onset of symptom and initiation of treatment was 151 days. Pre-diagnosis durations were longer for those who had sought initial care from an informal provider (p<0.05). Time to first contact with a health provider was shorter in this study compared to other developed and developing countries but utilizing informal healthcare providers caused delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Encouraging people to seek care from a formal healthcare provider may reduce the overall duration of the care seeking pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3196726237,"Accurate gluteus medius (GMd) volume evaluation may aid in the analysis of muscular atrophy states and help gain an improved understanding of patient recovery via rehabilitation. However, the segmentation of muscle regions in GMd images for cubic muscle volume assessment is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study automated GMd-region segmentation from the computed tomography (CT) images of patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis using deep learning and evaluated the segmentation accuracy. To this end, 5250 augmented pairs of training data were obtained from five participants, and a conditional generative adversarial network was used to identify the relationships between the image pairs. Using the preserved test datasets, the results of automatic segmentation with the trained deep learning model were compared to those of manual segmentation in terms of the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), volume similarity (VS), and shape similarity (MS). As observed, the average DSC values for automatic and manual segmentations were 0.748 and 0.812, respectively, with a significant difference (p < 0.0001); the average VS values were 0.247 and 0.203, respectively, with no significant difference (p = 0.069); and the average MS values were 1.394 and 1.156, respectively, with no significant difference (p = 0.308). The GMd volumes obtained by automatic and manual segmentation were 246.2 cm3 and 282.9 cm3, respectively. The noninferiority of the DSC obtained by automatic segmentation was verified against that obtained by manual segmentation. Accordingly, the proposed GAN-based automatic GMd-segmentation technique is confirmed to be noninferior to manual segmentation. Therefore, the findings of this research confirm that the proposed method not only reduces time and effort but also facilitates accurate assessment of the cubic muscle volume."
https://openalex.org/W3197479334,"The study of security and privacy in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) has become a hot topic that is wide open to discussion. As the quintessence of this aspect, authentication schemes deployed in VANETs play a substantial role in providing secure communication among vehicles and the surrounding infrastructures. Many researchers have proposed a variety of schemes related to information verification and computation efficiency in VANETs. In 2018, Kazemi et al . proposed an evaluation and improvement work towards Azees et al .’s efficient anonymous authentication with conditional privacy-preserving (EAAP) scheme for VANETs. They claimed that the EAAP suffered from replaying attacks, impersonation attacks, modification attacks, and cannot provide unlinkability. However, we also found out if Kazemi et al .’s scheme suffered from the unlinkability issue that leads to a forgery attack. An adversary can link two or more messages sent by the same user by applying Euclid’s algorithm and derives the user’s authentication key. To remedy the issue, in this paper, we proposed an improvement by encrypting the message using a shared secret key between sender and receiver and apply a Nonce in the final message to guarantee the unlinkability between disseminated messages."
https://openalex.org/W3196301314,"In recent years, text sentiment analysis has attracted wide attention, and promoted the rise and development of stance detection research. The purpose of stance detection is to determine the author’s stance (favor or against) towards a specific target or proposition in the text. Pre-trained language models like BERT have been proven to perform well in this task. However, in many reality scenes, they are usually very expensive in computation, because such heavy models are difficult to implement with limited resources. To improve the efficiency while ensuring the performance, we propose a knowledge distillation model BERTtoCNN, which combines the classic distillation loss and similarity-preserving loss in a joint knowledge distillation framework. On the one hand, BERTtoCNN provides an efficient distillation process to train a novel ‘student’ CNN structure from a much larger ‘teacher’ language model BERT. On the other hand, based on the similarity-preserving loss function, BERTtoCNN guides the training of a student network, so that input pairs with similar (dissimilar) activation in the teacher network have similar (dissimilar) activation in the student network. We conduct experiments and test the proposed model on the open Chinese and English stance detection datasets. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the competitive baseline methods obviously."
https://openalex.org/W3196617692,"Our earlier studies in tuberculosis (TB) patients indicate that in those where the process evolves to a larger pulmonary involvement, the immune endocrine response may promote an unfavorable environment. Chronic infectious diseases, and their persistent proinflammatory response, may affect mucosal barriers integrity favoring the translocation of gastrointestinal bacteria, leading to an increase of circulating lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Consequently, we quantified LPS levels in TB patients, with different degrees of pulmonary involvement, and controls (Co) and analyzed the possible relationship between LPS and inflammatory mediators i.e., C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), steroid hormones (Cortisol and Dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA), and inflammatory transcripts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ). LPS was assessed by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay and the ELISA technique was used to quantify hormones and cytokines in the plasma samples. Cytokine transcripts from PBMC were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Non-parametric tests were used. LPS levels were increased in TB patients, as did levels of CRP, IL-6, IFN-γ, cortisol and ESR. Severe patients had the highest amounts of circulating LPS; with moderate and severe cases showing much higher levels of CRP, ESR, IL-6, IFN-γ and cortisol/DHEA ratio, as an endocrine imbalance. Only in PBMC from severe cases was mRNA for IL-1β increased. Correlation analysis showed that levels of LPS from severe patients were positively associated with IL-6 and IFN-γ plasma concentrations and with IL-1β transcripts, while IL-6 had a positive correlation with the cortisol/DHEA ratio. The higher levels of circulating LPS during progressive TB may emerge as a contributing factor for the persistence of the greater immune endocrine imbalance distinctive of advanced disease, which might suggest a vicious cycle among LPS, inflammation and endocrine imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W3196744327,"Background Virological failure is under-recognized issue among children living with human immunodeficiency virus in developing countries. This partly may lead to failure to achieve the global goal of 90-90-90 targets in most developing countries including Ethiopia. Objectives This study aimed to assess the virological failure and its predictors among children receiving antiretroviral therapy at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 253 study cohorts from January 2020-April 2021. Socio-demographic characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview, while detailed clinical data of the children were collected by reviewing the medical record. About 5 ml of blood were collected for the analysis of complete blood count and viral load quantification. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and variables at p-value &lt; 0.05 in the multivariable analysis were considered as statistically significant. Results In this study, the viral load suppression rate among antiretroviral therapy experienced children was 68.8%. Meanwhile, the overall virological failure among study participants was 19.4%. Children living without family (AOR = 3.63; 95%CI: 1.27–10.24), children with unemployed family (AOR = 4.95; 95%CI: 1.74–14.12), being wasted (AOR = 3.02; 95%CI: 1.19–7.67) being stunted (AOR = 2.38;95%CI:1.03–5.46), anemia (AOR = 5.50:95%CI;1.37–22.04) and being lymphopenic (AOR = 2.69:95%CI;1.04–7.75) were significantly associated with virological failure among children under treatment. Conclusion Higher virological failure among children was noteworthy in the present study. Caretakers other than immediate family, unemployed family, wasted, stunted, anemia, and lymphopenia were significant independent predictors of virological failure. Hence, standard, and optimal management of children under treatment should be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3197189436,"Ceratitis capitata (medfly) is one of the most devastating crop pests worldwide. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a control method that is based on the mass rearing of males, their sterilization, and release in the field. However, the effectiveness of the technique depends on the quality of the released males and their fitness. We previously isolated and selected a probiotic bacteria ( Enterobacter sp.), from wild-caught medflies, according to criteria that improved biological quality traits of reared medfly males.We firstly evaluated the impact of the irradiation on the expression of different immune and stress genes in the medfly sterile males. Expression was measured at differents time points ranging from 0 to 168 h after irradiation to capture the response of genes with distinct temporal expression patterns. Then, we supplemented the larval diet with previously isolated Enterobacter sp.strain, live and autoclaved at various concentrations to see whether the probiotic treatments affect, through their protective role, the gene expression level, and quality traits. The irradiation had significant effect on the genes attacin , cecropin , PGPR-LC , hsp23 , and hsp70 level expression. The expression of attacin and PGPR-LC was up-regulated while that of cecropin was down-regulated. Hsp genes showed decreased levels between 0 and 18 h to peak at 72 h. However, the supplementation of the probiotic strain, either live or autoclaved, was statistically significant only for attacin gene. However, significant interaction time x probiotic was noticed for attacin , cecropin , hsp23 and hsp70 . The probiotic treatments also improved the quality control parameters like pupal weight. From this work we can conclude that a consortium of parabiotics (autoclaved probiotics) treatment will be recommended in insectaries considering both the beneficial effects on mass reared insects and its general safety for insectary workers and for environment."
https://openalex.org/W3198008095,"Dengue virus (DENV) encodes a unique protease (NS3/NS2B) essential for its maturation and infectivity and, it has become a key target for anti-viral drug design to treat dengue and other flavivirus related infections. Present investigation established that some of the drug molecules currently used mainly in cancer treatment are susceptible to bind non-active site (allosteric site/ cavity) of the NS3 protease enzyme of dengue virus. Computational screening and molecular docking analysis found that dabrafenib, idelalisib and nintedanib can bind at the allosteric site of the enzyme. The binding of the molecules to the allosteric site found to be stabilized via pi-cation and hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen-bond formation and π-stacking interaction with the molecules. Several interacting residues of the enzyme were common in all the five serotypes. However, the interaction/stabilizing forces were not uniformly distributed; the π-stacking was dominated with DENV3 proteases, whereas, a charged/ionic interaction was the major force behind interaction with DENV2 type proteases. In the allosteric cavity of protease from DENV1, the residues Lys73, Lys74, Thr118, Glu120, Val123, Asn152 and Ala164 were involved in active interaction with the three molecules (dabrafenib, idelalisib and nintedanib). Molecular dynamics (MD) analysis further revealed that the molecules on binding to NS3 protease caused significant changes in structural fluctuation and gained enhanced stability. Most importantly, the binding of the molecules effectively perturbed the protein conformation. These changes in the protein conformation and dynamics could generate allosteric modulation and thus may attenuate/alter the NS3 protease functionality and mobility at the active site. Experimental studies may strengthen the notion whether the binding reduce/enhance the catalytic activity of the enzyme, however, it is beyond the scope of this study."
https://openalex.org/W3198061411,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is one of the most prevalent oral mucosal diseases, but there is no cure for OLP yet. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the role of barrier dysfunction and infection in OLP pathogenesis through analysis of transcriptome datasets available in public databases. Two transcriptome datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and analyzed as whole and as partial sets after removing outliers. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upregulated in the dataset of OLP versus healthy epithelium were significantly enriched in epidermal development, keratinocyte differentiation, keratinization, responses to bacterial infection, and innate immune response. In contrast, the upregulated DEGs in the dataset of the mucosa predominantly reflected chemotaxis of immune cells and inflammatory/immune responses. Forty-three DEGs overlapping in the two datasets were identified after removing outliers from each dataset. The overlapping DEGs included genes associated with hyperkeratosis (upregulated LCE3E and TMEM45A), wound healing (upregulated KRT17, IL36G, TNC, and TGFBI), barrier defects (downregulated FRAS1 and BCL11A), and response to infection (upregulated IL36G, ADAP2, DFNA5, RFTN1, LITAF, and TMEM173). Immunohistochemical examination of IL-36γ, a protein encoded by one of the DEGs IL36G, in control (n = 7) and OLP (n = 25) tissues confirmed the increased expression of IL-36γ in OLP. Collectively, we identified gene signatures associated with hyperkeratosis, wound healing, barrier defects, and response to infection in OLP. IL-36γ, a cytokine involved in both wound repair and antimicrobial defense, may be a possible therapeutic target in OLP."
https://openalex.org/W3198164370,"Evaluating liver fibrosis is crucial for disease severity assessment, treatment decisions, and hepatocarcinogenic risk prediction among patients with chronic hepatitis C. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to construct a novel model formula to predict cirrhosis. A total of 749 patients were randomly allocated to training and validation sets at a ratio of 2:1. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was made via transient elastography using FibroScan. Patients with LSM ≥12.5 kPa were regarded as having cirrhosis. The best model formula for predicting cirrhosis was constructed based on factors significantly and independently associated with LSM (≥12.5 kPa) using multivariate regression analysis. Among the 749 patients, 198 (26.4%) had LSM ≥12.5 kPa. In the training set, multivariate analysis identified logarithm natural (ln) type IV collagen 7S, ln hyaluronic acid, and ln Wisteria floribunda agglutinin positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA + -Mac-2 BP) as the factors that were significantly and independently associated with LSM ≥12.5 kPa. Thus, the formula was constructed as follows: score = −6.154 + 1.166 × ln type IV collagen 7S + 0.526 × ln hyaluronic acid + 1.069 × WFA + -Mac-2 BP. The novel formula yielded the highest area under the curve (0.882; optimal cutoff, −0.381), specificity (81.5%), positive predictive values (62.6%), and predictive accuracy (81.6%) for predicting LSM ≥12.5 kPa among fibrosis markers and indices. These results were almost similar to those in the validated set, indicating the reproducibility and validity of the novel formula. The novel formula scores were significantly, strongly, and positively correlated with LSM values in both the training and validation data sets (correlation coefficient, 0.721 and 0.762; p = 2.67 × 10 −81 and 1.88 × 10 −48 , respectively). In conclusion, the novel formula was highly capable of diagnosing cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C and exhibited better diagnostic performance compared to conventional fibrosis markers and indices."
https://openalex.org/W3198283686,"Biodiversity loss is a global ecological crisis that is both a driver of and response to environmental change. Understanding the connections between species declines and other components of human-natural systems extends across the physical, life, and social sciences. From an analysis perspective, this requires integration of data from different scientific domains, which often have heterogeneous scales and resolutions. Community science projects such as eBird may help to fill spatiotemporal gaps and enhance the resolution of standardized biological surveys. Comparisons between eBird and the more comprehensive North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) have found these datasets can produce consistent multi-year abundance trends for bird populations at national and regional scales. Here we investigate the reliability of these datasets for estimating patterns at finer resolutions, inter-annual changes in abundance within town boundaries. Using a case study of 14 focal species within Massachusetts, we calculated four indices of annual relative abundance using eBird and BBS datasets, including two different modeling approaches within each dataset. We compared the correspondence between these indices in terms of multi-year trends, annual estimates, and inter-annual changes in estimates at the state and town-level. We found correspondence between eBird and BBS multi-year trends, but this was not consistent across all species and diminished at finer, inter-annual temporal resolutions. We further show that standardizing modeling approaches can increase index reliability even between datasets at coarser temporal resolutions. Our results indicate that multiple datasets and modeling methods should be considered when estimating species population dynamics at finer temporal resolutions, but standardizing modeling approaches may improve estimate correspondence between abundance datasets. In addition, reliability of these indices at finer spatial scales may depend on habitat composition, which can impact survey accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3192798640,"This paper empirically models the dynamics of Brazilian government bond (BGB) yields based on monthly macroeconomic data, in the context of the evolution of the key macroeconomic variables in Brazil. The results show that the current short-term interest rate has a decisive influence on the long-term interest rate on BGBs, after controlling for various key macroeconomic variables, such as inflation and industrial production. These findings support John Maynard Keynes's claim that the central bank's actions influence the long-term interest rate on government bonds mainly through the current short-term interest rate. These findings have important policy implications for Brazil. This paper relates the findings of the estimated models to ongoing debates in fiscal and monetary policies."
https://openalex.org/W3196767058,"Postural control in quiet standing is often explained by a reflexive response to optical flow, the apparent motion of environmental objects in a visual scene. However, moving room experiments show that even small-amplitude body sway can evoke odd sensations or motion sickness, indicating that a consciousness factor may also be involved. Studies targeting perception of self-motion, vection, typically use rapid visual stimuli moving in a single direction to maintain a constant feeling of vection, and there are few studies of vection using low-speed sinusoidal visual stimuli similar to human pendular movement. In the present study we searched for changes in postural control during periods of vection during quiet standing. Participants (N = 19, age = 20.4 ±1.1 years) were shown dynamic visual stimuli in the form of sinusoidally expanding and contracting random dots, and the stimuli speed and visual field were manipulated. Posture was continually evaluated using Center of Pressure (CoP) measurements. Participants were also asked to report feelings of vection, both by pressing a button during the trial and through an overall rating at the end of each trial. Using repeated-measures ANOVA, we assessed changes in the CoP and vection variables between experimental conditions, as well as possible interactions between the variables. The results show that postural reaction and vection were both affected by the visual stimuli and varied with speed. The peripheral visual field was found to couple to stronger feeling of vection and better quality of postural control. However, no significant relationship between postural control and vection, nor evidence of vection interaction to the relationship between optical flow and postural control, was found. Based on our results we conclude that for postural stability during quiet standing, visual cues dominate over any potential consciousness factor arising due to vection."

We assessed sexual-risk behaviours and HIV and syphilis prevalence among AGYW in Uganda to inform the design of target-specific risk-reduction interventions.This analysis utilizes data from 8,236 AGYW aged 10-24 years, collected in 20 districts, between July and August 2018. AGYW engaged in sexual-risk behaviour if they: a) reported a history of STIs; or b) had their sexual debut before age 15; or c) engaged in sex with 2+ partners in the past 12 months; or c) did not use or used condoms inconsistently with their most recent partners. We diagnosed HIV using DetermineTM HIV-1/2, Stat-PakTM HIV-1/2 and SD Bioline. We used SD Bioline Syphilis test kits to diagnose syphilis and Treponema Pallidum Hemagglutination Assay for confirmatory syphilis testing. Comparison of proportions was done using Chi-square (χ2) tests. Data were analysed using STATA (version 14.1).Of 4,488 AGYW (54.5%) that had ever had sex, 12.9% (n = 581) had their sexual debut before age 15; 19.1% (n = 858) reported a history of STIs. Of those that had ever had sex, 79.6% (n = 3,573) had sex in the 12 months preceding the survey; 75.6% (n = 2,707) with one (1) and 24.2% (n = 866) with 2+ partners. Condom use with the most recent sexual partner was low, with only 20.4% (n = 728) reporting consistent condom use while 79.6% (n = 2,842) reported inconsistent or no condom use. In-school AGYW were significantly less likely to have ever had sex (35.6% vs. 73.6%, P<0.001), to have had sexual debut before age 15 (7.7% vs. 15.5%, P<0.001) or to engage in sex with 2+ partners (5.3% vs. 15.8%, P<0.001). Consistent condom use was significantly higher among in-school than out-of-school AGYW (40.1% vs. 12.7%, P<0.001). Overall, 1.7% (n = 143) had HIV while 1.3% (n = 104) had syphilis. HIV and syphilis prevalence was higher among out-of-school than in-school AGYW (HIV: 2.6% vs. 0.9%; syphilis: 2.1% vs. 0.5%, respectively).In-school AGYW engaged in more protective sexual behaviors and had less HIV and syphilis than their out-of-school counterparts. These findings suggest a need for target-specific risk-reduction interventions stratified by schooling status."
https://openalex.org/W3196743747,"Background Ethnically endogamous populations can shed light on the genetics of type 2 diabetes. Such studies are lacking in India. We conducted this study to determine the genetic and environmental contributions of anthropometric traits to type 2 diabetes risk in the Sindhi families in central India. Methods We conducted a family study in Indian Sindhi families with at least one case of type 2 diabetes. Variance components methods were used to quantify the genetic association of 18 anthropometric traits with eight type 2 diabetes related traits. Univariate and bivariate polygenic models were used to determine the heritability, genetic and environmental correlation of anthropometric traits with type 2 diabetes related traits. Results We included 1,152 individuals from 112 phenotyped families. The ascertainment-bias corrected prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 35%. Waist circumference, hip circumference and the biceps, triceps, subscapular and medial calf skinfold thicknesses were polygenically and significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. The range of heritability of the anthropometric traits and type 2 diabetes related traits was 0.27–0.73 and 0.00–0.39, respectively. Heritability of type 2 diabetes as a discrete trait was 0.35. Heritability curves demonstrated a substantial local influence of type 2 diabetes related traits. Bivariate trait analyses showed that biceps and abdominal skinfold thickness and all waist-containing indexes were strongly genetically correlated with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions In this first study of Sindhi families, we found evidence for genetic and environmental concordance of anthropometric traits with type 2 diabetes. Future studies need to probe into the genetics of type 2 diabetes in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3196950567,"Background While potentially timesaving, there is no program to automatically transform diagnosis codes of the ICD-10 German modification (ICD-10-GM) into the injury severity score (ISS). Objective To develop a mapping method from ICD-10-GM into ICD-10 clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) to calculate the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) and ISS of each patient using the ICDPIC-R and to compare the manually and automatically calculated scores. Methods Between January 2019 and June 2021, the most severe AIS of each body region and the ISS were manually calculated using medical documentation and radiology reports of all major trauma patients of a German level I trauma centre. The ICD-10-GM codes of these patients were exported from the electronic medical data system SAP, and a Java program was written to transform these into ICD-10-CM codes. Afterwards, the ICDPIC-R was used to automatically generate the most severe AIS of each body region and the ISS. The automatically and manually determined ISS and AIS scores were then tested for equivalence. Results Statistical analysis revealed that the manually and automatically calculated ISS were significantly equivalent over the entire patient cohort. Further sub-group analysis, however, showed that equivalence could only be demonstrated for patients with an ISS between 16 and 24. Likewise, the highest AIS scores of each body region were not equal in the manually and automatically calculated group. Conclusion Though achieving mapping results highly comparable to previous mapping methods of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, it is not unrestrictedly possible to automatically calculate the AIS and ISS using ICD-10-GM codes."
https://openalex.org/W3197106781,"To determine the prevalence of crude herbs' use in the self-management of hypertension and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with hypertension.This cross-sectional study was performed among patients with hypertension attending a government health clinic. Socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle modifications, medical history and predictors of crude herbs users were obtained. The diversity of crude herbs used was assessed using a modified international complementary and alternative medicine questionnaire (I-CAM-Q) and the HRQOL was assessed using the SF36 instrument.Out of the 294 patients recruited, 52.4% were female, 41.5% were Malay and 38.8% were within the 60 to69 age category. The prevalence of crude herbs users was 30.6% and the most common herbs used were pegaga (Centella asiatica), peria (Momordica charantia) and betik (Carica papaya). Using the regression analysis, significantly higher odds of using crude herbs are noted among Malay or Indian patients who have these characteristics: attained secondary education, experienced falls or muscle pain, and had systolic blood pressure of more than 140 mmHg. There was no significant difference in HRQOL domains between the crude herb users and non-users (p>0.05).Besides taking allopathic medications, certain patients with hypertension use crude herbs as a form of self-management. Although patients are adamant about integrating crude herbs as a form of self-management, the effects of doing so have not been properly investigated. This implies that the healthcare staff members need to communicate with the patients regarding the use of crude herbs together with conventional drugs."

The effect of polymorphisms on antibody responses is fairly well studied while much fewer studies have assessed this for T cell responses. This study investigated the effect of allelic polymorphisms in the malarial antigen apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) on ex vivo T cell-specific IFN-γ responses in subjects with lifelong exposure to malaria. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-restricted peptides from the 3D7 clone AMA1 were bioinformatically predicted and those with variant amino acid positions used to select corresponding allelic sequences from the 7G8, FVO, FC27 and tm284 parasite strains. A total of 91 AMA1 9-10mer peptides from the five parasite strains were identified, synthesized, grouped into 42 allele sets and used to stimulate PBMCs from seven HLA class 1-typed subjects in IFN-γ ELISpot assays. PBMCs from four of the seven subjects (57%) made positive responses to 18 peptides within 12 allele sets. Fifty percent of the 18 positive peptides were from the 3D7 parasite variant. Amino acid substitutions that were associated with IFN-γ response abrogation were more frequently found at positions 1 and 6 of the tested peptides, but substitutions did not show a clear pattern of association with response abrogation. Thus, while we show some evidence of polymorphisms affecting T cell response induction, other factors including TCR recognition of HLA-peptide complexes may also be at play."
https://openalex.org/W3197070859,"Purpose To compare the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children conceived via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and those conceived naturally. Materials and methods A population-based cohort study using data retrieved from the Taipei Medical University Research Database (TMURD) from January, 2004 to August, 2016. The data included maternal pregnancy history, perinatal history and developmental follow up of their babies up to 5 years of age. The study included 23885 children, of whom 23148 were naturally conceived and 737 were conceived via ICSI. Neurodevelopmental disorders defined by 21 ICD-9-CM codes. Results Of the 23885 children enrolled for analysis, 2778 children were included for further subgrouping analysis after propensity matching to reduce bias from maternal factors. The single-birth group included 1752 naturally conceived (NC) children and 438 ICSI children. The multiple-birth group included 294 NC and 294 ICSI children. The risk of neurodevelopmental disorders was not increased for ICSI children in both groups (single birth: adjusted hazard ratio aHR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.39–1.27, p = 0.243; multiple-birth group aHR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.43–1.35, p = 0.853). In the single-birth group, multivariate analyses showed that male sex (aHR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.29–2.54, p &lt; 0.001), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (aHR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.64–5.86, p &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. In the multiple-birth group, multivariate analyses demonstrated that ICU admission (aHR = 3.58, 95% CI = 1.82–7.04, p &lt; 0.001), was risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion Our study indicated that the use of ICSI does not associated with higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring. But male sex, and ICU admission do have increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, long term follow up of this cohort on health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood will strengthen the conclusions that ICSI is safe regarding offspring long term outcome."

This is the first study investigating the reliability of the novel Imperial Joint Line Congruency Measurement (IJLCM) technique for the assessment of joint line height using plain radiographs. Methods The reliability of two techniques used to measure joint line height on pre-operative and post-operative plain radiographs is presented. 120 patients that underwent TKA from 6 different international centres were included. Measurements were performed using each technique by two senior orthopaedic surgeons at two different timepoints (test-retest). Two undergraduate medical students performed joint line measurements using the most reproducible of the two techniques on 40 pre-operative and post-operative images to establish the reliability of the measurement technique. Results The IJLCM demonstrated an average absolute difference of 1.83mm (CI 1.56–2.10mm) and excellent inter and intra-rater reliability between senior orthopaedic surgeons (&gt;0.92 (CI 0.88–0.94) when measuring joint line height on plain radiographs. Overall Crohnbach’s alpha over 0.92 confirmed internal consistency. Measurements performed using the control technique as previously described by Figgie et al. had an average absolute difference of 5.75mm (5.17–6.32mm). Comparison of measurements by senior orthopaedic surgeons and medical students using the IJLCM technique with ANOVA and student’s t-test demonstrated acceptable agreement and inter-rater reliability of &gt;0.92 (0.87–0.95). Conclusion This study shows excellent accuracy, precision, and reliability of the novel IJLCM technique. Furthermore, excellent agreement between senior orthopaedic surgeons and medical students when using the IJLCM could be shown. The IJLCM technique is reliable for joint line assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3197640394,"Background Despite improvements in maternal mortality globally, hundreds of women continue to die daily. The World Health Organisation therefore advises all women in low-and-middle income countries to give birth in healthcare facilities. Barriers to seeking intrapartum care have been described in Thaddeus and Maine’s Three Delays Model, however these decisions are complex and often unique to different settings. Loreto, a rural province in Peru has one of the highest homebirth rates in the country at 31.8%. The aim of this study was to explore facilitators and barriers to facility births and explore women’s experiences of intrapartum care in Amazonian Peru. Methods Through purposive sampling, postnatal women were recruited for semi-structured interviews (n = 25). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. A combination of deductive and inductive coding was used. Analytical triangulation was undertaken, and data saturation was used to determine when no further interviews were necessary. Results Five themes were generated from the data: 1) Financial barriers; 2) Accessing care; 3) Fear of healthcare facilities; 4) Importance of seeking care and 5) Comfort and traditions of home. Generally, participants realised the importance of seeking skilled care however barriers persisted, across all areas of the Three Delays Model. Barriers identified included fear of healthcare facilities and interventions, direct and indirect costs, continuation of daily activities, distance and availability of transport. Women who delivered in healthcare facilities had mixed experiences, many reporting good attention, however a selection experienced poor treatment including abusive behaviour. Conclusion Despite free care, women continue to face barriers seeking obstetric care in Amazonian Peru, including fear of hospitals, cost and availability of transport. However, women accessing care do not always receive positive care experiences highlighting implications for changes in accessibility and provision of care. Minimising these barriers is critical to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in rural Peru."
https://openalex.org/W3198244318,"Syphilis is one of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality and is one of the most important public health problems. There was no study showing syphilis serostatus and its related factors among pregnant women in the current study area. This study was aimed to assess the magnitude of syphilis serostatus and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jinka town public health facilities.Institution based cross-sectional study design was conducted in Jinka town public health facilities, southern Ethiopia from the 1st July to the 1st September, 2020. A systematic sampling technique was used to select 629 study subjects. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire through face-to-face interviews and records were reviewed to check syphilis test results. Data were coded and entered by using Epi-data version 4.432 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. The binary logistic regression model was used to investigate factors associated with syphilis. A p-value of < 0.05 at multivariable analysis was considered statistically significant.In this study, syphilis sero-prevalence among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics was 4.8% (95% CI: 3.12, 6.48). Rural residence [AOR: 2.873; 95%CI (1.171, 7.050)], alcohol use [AOR: 3.340; 95% CI (1.354, 8.241)] and having multiple sexual partner [AOR: 5.012; 95% CI (1.929, 13.020)] were statistically significantly associated with syphilis.Sero-prevalence of syphilis was high. Being a rural residence, having multiple sexual partners, alcohol use were factors associated with syphilis. Therefore, substantial efforts have to be made to provide regular health education for pregnant women at the antenatal clinic on the avoidance of risky behaviors and the risk of syphilis on their pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3198446608,"Peptide microarrays consisting of defined phosphorylation target sites are an effective approach for high throughput analysis of cellular kinase (kinome) activity. Kinome peptide arrays are highly customizable and do not require species-specific reagents to measure kinase activity, making them amenable for kinome analysis in any species. Our group developed software, Platform for Integrated, Intelligent Kinome Analysis (PIIKA), to enable more effective extraction of meaningful biological information from kinome peptide array data. A subsequent version, PIIKA2, unveiled new statistical tools and data visualization options. Here we introduce PIIKA 2.5 to provide two essential quality control metrics and a new background correction technique to increase the accuracy and consistency of kinome results. The first metric alerts users to improper spot size and informs them of the need to perform manual resizing to enhance the quality of the raw intensity data. The second metric uses inter-array comparisons to identify outlier arrays that sometimes emerge as a consequence of technical issues. In addition, a new background correction method, background scaling, can sharply reduce spatial biases within a single array in comparison to background subtraction alone. Collectively, the modifications of PIIKA 2.5 enable identification and correction of technical issues inherent to the technology and better facilitate the extraction of meaningful biological information. We show that these metrics demonstrably enhance kinome analysis by identifying low quality data and reducing batch effects, and ultimately improve clustering of treatment groups and enhance reproducibility. The web-based and stand-alone versions of PIIKA 2.5 are freely accessible at via http://saphire.usask.ca ."
https://openalex.org/W3198566349,"Background Kaizen—a management technique increasingly employed in health care—enables employees, regardless of their hierarchy level, to contribute to the improvement of their organization. The approach puts special emphasis on frontline employees because it represents one of their main opportunities to participate directly in decision making. In this study, we aimed to (1) understand the experiences of nurses in two hospitals that had recently implemented kaizen, and (2) identify factors affecting the implementation of the technique. Methods By means of purposeful sampling, we selected 30 nurses from different units in two private acute care hospitals in Switzerland in May 2018. We used the Organizational Transformation Model to conduct semi-structured interviews and perform qualitative content analysis. Lastly, originating from Herzberg’s motivation theory, we suggest two types of factor influencing the implementation of kaizen—hygiene factors that may prevent nurses from getting demotivated, and motivational factors that may boost their motivation. Results Nurses generally experienced kaizen as a positive practice that enabled them to discuss work-related activities in a more comprehensive manner. In some cases, however, a lack of visible improvement in the workplace lowered nurses’ motivation to make suggestions. Nurses’ attitudes towards kaizen differed across both hospitals depending on the available managerial support, resources such as infrastructure and staffing levels. Conclusions From our findings, we derived several coping strategies to help health practitioners implement kaizen for the benefit of their organization and employees: Strong managerial support, appropriate use of kaizen tools, and a greater sense of team cohesion, among other factors, can influence how effectively hospital teams implement kaizen. To reap the benefits of kaizen, hospital managers should promote the exchange of opinions across hierarchy levels, allocate the necessary resources in terms of personnel and infrastructure, and show nurses how the technique can help them improve their workplace."
https://openalex.org/W3198776423,"We aimed to compare the volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans with or without multi-criteria optimization (MCO) on commercial treatment-planning systems (Eclipse, Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA, USA) for patients with prostate cancer. We selected 25 plans of patients with prostate cancer who were previously treated on the basis of a VMAT plan. All plans were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System version 15.6, and re-calculation and re-optimization were performed. The MCO plan was then generated. The dosimetric quality of the plans was evaluated using dosimetric parameters and dose indices that account for target coverage and sparing of the organs at risk (OARs). We defined the rectum, bladder, and bilateral femoral heads. The VMAT-MCO plan offers an improvement of gross treatment volume coverage with increased minimal dose and reduced maximal dose. In the planning treatment volume, the D mean and better gradient, homogeneity, and conformity indexes improved despite the increasing hot and cold spots. When implemented through the MCO plan, a steeper fall off the adjacent OARs in the overlap area was achieved to obtain lower dose parameters. MCO generated better sparing of the rectum and bladder through a tradeoff of the increasing dose to the bilateral femoral heads within the tolerable dose constraints. Compared with re-optimization and re-calculation, respectively, significant dose reductions were observed in the bladder (241 cGy and 254 cGy; p &lt;0.001) and rectum (474 cGy and 604 cGy, p &lt;0.001) with the MCO. Planning evaluation and dosimetric measurements showed that the VMAT-MCO plan using visualized navigation can provide sparing of OAR doses without compromising the target coverage in the same OAR dose constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3197419832,"Recent studies have revealed presence of fungus-originated genes in genomes of cool-season grasses, suggesting occurrence of multiple ancestral gene transfer events between the two distant lineages. The current article describes identification of glucanase-like and monooxygenase-like genes from creeping bent grass, as lateral gene transfer candidates. An in silico analysis suggested presence of the glucanase-like gene in Agrostis , Deyeuxia , and Polypogon genera, but not in other species belonging to the clade 1 of the Poeae tribe. Similarly, the monooxygenase-like gene was confined to Agrostis and Deyeuxia genera. A consistent result was obtained from PCR-based screening. The glucanase-like gene was revealed to be ubiquitously expressed in young seedlings of creeping bent grass. Although expression of the monooxygenase-like gene was suggested in plant tissues, the levels were considerably lower than those of the glucanase-like gene. A phylogenetic analysis revealed close relationships of the two genes between the corresponding genes in fungal endophyte species of the Epichloë genus, suggesting that the genes originated from the Epichloë lineage."
https://openalex.org/W3197643677,"Background In order to manage a protracted second stage of labor, “eminence-based” birth positions have been suggested by some healthcare professionals. Recent biomechanical studies have promoted the use of an optimized supine birthing position in this setting. However, uncertainty exists regarding the feasibility of this posture, and its acceptability by women. This pilot study primarily aimed to assess these characteristics. Objective and methods In this monocentric prospective study, 20 women with a protracted second stage of labor were asked to maintain a biomechanically-optimized position for at least 20 minutes at full dilatation. This posture is similar to the McRoberts’ maneuver. Maintaining the position for 20 minutes or more was considered clinically relevant and indicative of feasibility and acceptability. Satisfaction with the position was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A sub-group analysis was performed to assess eventual differences between more and less satisfied patients, according to the median of patients’ satisfaction scores. Results Seventeen patients (85%) maintained the optimized position for at least 20 minutes. The median satisfaction score of these participants was 8 (interquartile range: 1) out of 10. No significant differences were found between the two sub-groups (satisfaction score &lt;8 vs satisfaction score ≥8) regarding general and obstetric characteristics, as well as obstetrical and fetal outcomes. Conclusion The optimized position is acceptable and feasible for women experiencing a protracted second stage of labor. Further clinical studies are needed to assess the efficiency of such positions when women undergo an obstructed labor."
https://openalex.org/W3198782070,"Several methods have been proposed for analyzing differences between test scores, such as using mean scores, cumulative deviation, and mixed-effect models. Here, we explore the pooled analysis of retested Progress Test items to monitor the performance of first-year medical students who were exposed to a new curriculum design. This was a cross-sectional study of students in their first year of a medical program who participated in the annual interinstitutional Progress Tests from 2013 to 2019. We analyzed the performance of first-year students in the 2019 test and compared it with that of first-year students taking the test from 2013 to 2018 and encountering the same items. For each item, we calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals; we also performed meta-analyses with fixed effects for each content area in the pooled analysis and presented the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). In all, we used 63 items, which were divided into basic sciences, internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and public health. Significant differences were found between groups in basic sciences (OR = 1.172 [CI95% 1.005 CI 1.366], p = 0.043) and public health (OR = 1.54 [CI95% CI 1.25-1.897], p < 0.001), which may reflect the characteristics of the new curriculum. Thus, pooled analysis of pretested items may provide indicators of different performance. This method may complement analysis of score differences on benchmark assessments."
