https://openalex.org/W2122520859,"Background The effects of systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum total cholesterol (TC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body mass index (BMI) on the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been established in epidemiological studies, but consistent estimates of effect sizes by age and sex are not available. Methods We reviewed large cohort pooling projects, evaluating effects of baseline or usual exposure to metabolic risks on ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), stroke, diabetes, and, as relevant selected other CVDs, after adjusting for important confounders. We pooled all data to estimate relative risks (RRs) for each risk factor and examined effect modification by age or other factors, using random effects models. Results Across all risk factors, an average of 123 cohorts provided data on 1.4 million individuals and 52,000 CVD events. Each metabolic risk factor was robustly related to CVD. At the baseline age of 55–64 years, the RR for 10 mmHg higher SBP was largest for HHD (2.16; 95% CI 2.09–2.24), followed by effects on both stroke subtypes (1.66; 1.39–1.98 for hemorrhagic stroke and 1.63; 1.57–1.69 for ischemic stroke). In the same age group, RRs for 1 mmol/L higher TC were 1.44 (1.29–1.61) for IHD and 1.20 (1.15–1.25) for ischemic stroke. The RRs for 5 kg/m2 higher BMI for ages 55–64 ranged from 2.32 (2.04–2.63) for diabetes, to 1.44 (1.40–1.48) for IHD. For 1 mmol/L higher FPG, RRs in this age group were 1.18 (1.08–1.29) for IHD and 1.14 (1.01–1.29) for total stroke. For all risk factors, proportional effects declined with age, were generally consistent by sex, and differed by region in only a few age groups for certain risk factor-disease pairs. Conclusion Our results provide robust, comparable and precise estimates of the effects of major metabolic risk factors on CVD and diabetes by age group."
https://openalex.org/W2003423696,"Research on practices to share and reuse data will inform the design of infrastructure to support data collection, management, and discovery in the long tail of science and technology. These are research domains in which data tend to be local in character, minimally structured, and minimally documented. We report on a ten-year study of the Center for Embedded Network Sensing (CENS), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. We found that CENS researchers are willing to share their data, but few are asked to do so, and in only a few domain areas do their funders or journals require them to deposit data. Few repositories exist to accept data in CENS research areas.. Data sharing tends to occur only through interpersonal exchanges. CENS researchers obtain data from repositories, and occasionally from registries and individuals, to provide context, calibration, or other forms of background for their studies. Neither CENS researchers nor those who request access to CENS data appear to use external data for primary research questions or for replication of studies. CENS researchers are willing to share data if they receive credit and retain first rights to publish their results. Practices of releasing, sharing, and reusing of data in CENS reaffirm the gift culture of scholarship, in which goods are bartered between trusted colleagues rather than treated as commodities."
https://openalex.org/W2022294588,"The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) is a critical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for vertebrate physiology, including the balance of water and sodium ions. It is unclear how its two native hormones, vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT), both stimulate the same cAMP/PKA pathway yet produce divergent antinatriuretic and antidiuretic effects that are either strong (VP) or weak (OT). Here, we present a new mechanism that differentiates the action of VP and OT on V2R signaling. We found that vasopressin, as opposed to OT, continued to generate cAMP and promote PKA activation for prolonged periods after ligand washout and receptor internalization in endosomes. Contrary to the classical model of arrestin-mediated GPCR desensitization, arrestins bind the VP-V2R complex yet extend rather than shorten the generation of cAMP. Signaling is instead turned off by the endosomal retromer complex. We propose that this mechanism explains how VP sustains water and Na+ transport in renal collecting duct cells. Together with recent work on the parathyroid hormone receptor, these data support the existence of a novel “noncanonical” regulatory pathway for GPCR activation and response termination, via the sequential action of β-arrestin and the retromer complex.Background: It remains unclear why vasopressin induces greater antidiuresis through V2R than does oxytocin.Results: Vasopressin sustains cAMP signaling during V2R internalization, a process promoted by β-arrestins, and is halted by the retromer complex.Conclusion: This new noncanonical model of GPCR signaling differentiates the actions of vasopressin and oxytocin.Significance: This emerging model may explain the physiological bias between ligands.

This model of arrestin-mediated desensitization has been supported with extensive work on several GPCRs such as rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor, among others, and is considered a universal and “canonical” mechanism for GPCR desensitization (5.Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. The role of β-arrestins in the termination and transduction of G-protein-coupled receptor signals.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

We do not know how many GPCRs exhibit this noncanonical form of signaling. Several factors led us to investigate the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R), a GS-coupled receptor that controls water and sodium ion homeostasis by regulating their reuptake in the collecting duct of the kidney (12.Brown D. Breton S. Ausiello D.A. Marshansky V. Sensing, signaling and sorting events in kidney epithelial cell physiology.Traffic. 2009; 10: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These include the following: 1) a high affinity complex between V2R and its native ligand, vasopressin (VP), which remains stable and active (cAMP production) under acidic conditions, pH 5.5, characteristic of early endosomes (13.Zalyapin E.A. Bouley R. Hasler U. Vilardaga J.P. Lin H.Y. Brown D. Ausiello D.A.

Kortenoeven M.L. Sze M. Yae C. Milligan G. Oorschot V.M. Klumperman J. Knoers N.V. Deen P.M.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12195-12200Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations raised the hypothesis that internalized VP-V2R complexes could access the machinery for signaling from membranes inside the cell to continue to stimulate the cAMP/PKA pathway via a noncanonical signaling model of GPCR. To address this hypothesis, we used a series of biochemical, optical, and physiological assays to study V2R signaling in response to its two native ligands: vasopressin and oxytocin (13.Zalyapin E.A. Bouley R. Hasler U. Vilardaga J.P. Lin H.Y. Brown D. Ausiello D.A.

These experiments employed cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing recombinant V2R and a line derived from renal principal cells of the mouse collecting duct, mpkCCDC14, which expresses V2R and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (19.Gumz M.L.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We found that vasopressin induces a V2R-active state that promotes cAMP generation not only at the plasma membrane but also after β-arrestin1/2-mediated receptor internalization to endosomes. Oxytocin, however, did not induce significant β-arrestins binding or V2R internalization, and cAMP generation ended rapidly after ligand washout. Sustained cAMP generation triggered by VP was inhibited by the endosomal retromer complex. As in HEK293 cells, VP induced greater cAMP generation than OT in mpkCCDC14 cells and caused a sustained activation of ENaC on the apical plasma membrane, whereas OT did not. In both HEK293 and mpkCCDC14 cells, increased expression of β-arrestins augmented rather than attenuated the duration of cAMP production. These results indicate that noncanonical actions of β-arrestins and retromer can be extended to the regulation of V2R signaling in kidney cells, which may account for the biological differences between VP and OT on water and electrolyte homeostasis. Vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged V2R (HA-V2R) cDNAs were purchased from Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). V2R was amplified using AccuPrime Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) to introduce flanking 5′-BglII and 3′-AgeI restriction enzyme sites. The digested product was ligated into pECFP-N1 (Clontech) vector to generate V2R C-terminally tagged with enhanced CFP (V2RCFP). Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-V2R were grown in selection medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 500 μg/ml neomycin). Culturing of mpkCCD-C14 collecting duct-derived cells was done as described previously (21.Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A.

AQP2-MDCK cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (500 μg/ml) (23.Yui N. Lu H.A. Chen Y. Nomura N. Bouley R. Brown D.

For transient expression, cells were transfected with the appropriate cDNAs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions unless otherwise mentioned. We have optimized expression conditions to ensure moderate expression levels of fluorescent arrestins. We performed Western blots to verify the levels of fluorescent β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 expression relative to native β-arrestin1/2 in our experiments. We also ensured that the expression of fluorescent-labeled β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 was similar in the examined cells by performing experiments in cells displaying comparable fluorescence levels. We depleted the retromer subunit Vps35 from HEK293 cells using a pre-validated quartet of siRNA duplex nucleotides (SmartPool, Dharmacon). Control transfections were done with a scrambled siRNA (OriGene). Briefly, 24 h after plating, cells were transferred to serum- and antibiotic-free medium and transfected with X-TremeGene reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. Medium was supplemented with serum and antibiotics 24 h after transfection, and experiments were performed between 72 and 96 h after transfection. Plasmid transfections were done using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and maintained in FRET buffer were imaged using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with an oil immersion ×60 NA 1.49 plan-apo TIRF objective and a TIRF excitation arm with motorized critical angle control (Nikon). Critical angles for CFP and YFP excitation were determined in advance, and identical angles were used in every experiment. In-line neutral density filters were used to minimize bleaching. Excitation light came from a 442-nm solid-state laser (CFP, Melles Griot) and the 514-nm line of an argon gas laser (YFP, Melles Griot) using appropriate dichroic filters. YFP was detected using 500 ± 20 nm (excitation) and 535 ± 30 nm (emission) filters; CFP was detected using 436 ± 20 nm (excitation) and 480 ± 40 nm (emission); and FRET was detected using a 436 ± 20 mm (excitation) and a 535 ± 30 nm (emission). The experiments were performed from membrane preparations of HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-V2R. Briefly, confluent cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) for 15 min on ice. Swollen cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation (100 × g for 10 min), and resuspended in 5 volumes of 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors. Cells were disrupted with 30–40 strokes with a tissue grinder on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and large cell debris. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Membranes were stored at −80 °C until used. A small volume of membrane preparation was kept to determine protein concentration. Frozen membrane aliquots (50 μg/tube) were incubated with 100 μl of assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 5 μm GDP, with or without 100 nm purified β-arrestin2 (see below) for 45 min at room temperature. Then, either 100 nm vasopressin (AVP) and 10 nm [35S]GTPγS were added for different periods of time at 30 °C. Incubations were terminated by addition of 800 μl of ice-cold assay buffer and 100 μm GTPγS and transferred on ice. Cell membranes were recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was removed. Membrane pellets were solubilized, and 2 μl of anti-GαS antibody (Millipore) was added to immunoprecipitate [35S]GTPγS-bound GαS. Samples were under agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. Then 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times, suspended with 200 μl of 0.5% SDS, and incubated at 90 °C for 2–3 min. The entire contents of each tube were transferred to a vial containing 5 ml of scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was counted by β-emission spectrometry. Note that purified β-arrestin2 used in these experiments was prepared as described previously (24.Wehbi V.L. Stevenson H.P. Feinstein T.N. Calero G. Romero G. Vilardaga J.P.

Transepithelial resistance was measured by periodically applying a 2.5-mV bipolar pulse and calculated by Ohm's law. The bathing Ringer's solution composition, gassing, and washing techniques have been described previously (25.Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A.

AQP2 stably transfected MDCK cells (AQP2-MDCK) were plated on 6-well filt ers (32 × 104 cells/well). Cells were grown on filters for 5 days to be fully polarized and treated with 50 mm indomethacin overnight to lower endogenous cAMP levels (26.van Balkom B.W. Graat M.P. van Raak M. Hofman E. van der Sluijs P. Deen P.M. Role of cytoplasmic termini in sorting and shuttling of the aquaporin-2 water channel.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C372-C379Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Culture medium was replaced with serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM for 2 h before stimulation. Then cells were treated with or without VP or OT for 10 min. For washout experiments, cells were washed and cultured in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM for 20 min. Filters were cut from plastic supports and incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 containing 10 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4) for 20 min. Cell were scraped, and cell lysate was then transferred into Eppendorf tubes, rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and 12 μl of reduced samples (6 μg of protein) per lane were run on a NuPAGE 1.0-mm 15-well 4–12% BisTris gel and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). Transferred PVDF membranes were incubated in 5% skimmed milk in PBS/Tween 0.05% buffer for blocking, then incubated with primary antibody, diluted 1:5000–1:10,000 in PBS/Tween 0.05% buffer overnight (Ser(P)-256 and Ser(P)-269 AQP2 antibody) for 1 h (AQP2 polyclonal antibody). Then PVDF membranes were washed four times for 15 min in PBS/Tween 0.05% buffer (PBST), incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 for 30 min, and washed in 0.05% PBST four times for 15 min. Signals were visualized using Western Lightning ECL and Biomax XAR film. The same PVDF membranes were stripped in stripping buffer (0.2 m glycine, 0.05% Tween 20, pH was adjusted to 2.5 by adding HCl) for 1 h, and then re-probed with the next antibody. Complete removal of the first primary antibody was confirmed by incubating the stripped membrane with secondary antibody (donkey anti rabbit IgG HRP conjugated). The order of detection was Ser(P)-269, Ser(P)-256, and then total AQP2. HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-V2R were studied by a confocal microscope using methods described in previous studies (6.Feinstein T.N. Wehbi V.L. Ardura J.A. Wheeler D.S. Ferrandon S.

The microscope was encased in a microscope cage incubator to maintain the temperature at 37 °C. HEK293 cells expressing HA-V2R were grown in a Multiwell 12-well plate (BD Biosciences). Upon reaching 70% confluency, cells were transfected using 3.75 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 1 μg of cDNA of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged β-arrestin 2 (βarr2-GFP), GαS (GαS-GFP), or retromer (Vps29-YFP). 24 h later, cells were trypsinized and seeded in glass bottom FluoroDishes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). 24–48 h later, the cells were washed and imaged in Hanks' Buffer (Invitrogen) with 10 mm Hepes, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 10 mm glucose added to the solution. After the control picture was taken, 1 μm VPTMR was incubated with cells for 10 min, and then ligand was washed out, and images were taken at the designated time intervals. FRET analysis was performed as described previously (8.Ferrandon S. Feinstein T.N. Castro M. Wang B. Bouley R. Potts J.T. Gardella T.J. Vilardaga J.-P. Sustained cyclic AMP production by parathyroid hormone receptor endocytosis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Cells plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and maintained in FRET buffer were placed on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with an oil immersion ×60 NA 1.49 plan-apo objective and a dichroic beam splitter to allow simultaneous imaging of CFP and YFP fluorescence channels (DualView2, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). The emission fluorescence intensities were determined at 535 ± 15 nm (YFP) and 480 ± 20 nm (CFP) with a beam splitter DCLP of 505 nm. The FRET ratio for single experiments was corrected according to Equation 1, Ratio(FYEPFCFP)=FYEPex436/em535×a−FCEPex436/em480−b×FYEPex500/em535FCEPex436/em480(Eq. 1) where FYFPex436/em535 and FCFPex436/em480 represent, respectively, the emission (em) intensities of YFP (recorded at 535 nm) and CFP (recorded at 480 nm) upon excitation (ex) at 436 nm; a and b represent correction factors for the bleed through of CFP into the 535-nm channel (a = 0.35) and the cross-talk due to the direct YFP excitation by light at 436 nm (b = 0.06). FYFPex500/em535 represents the emission intensity of YFP (recorded at 535 nm) upon direct excitation at 500 nm, and was recorded at the beginning of each experiment. Note that bleed through of YFP into the 480-nm channel was negligible. For each measurement, changes in fluorescence emissions due to photobleaching were subtracted. To ensure that CFP- and YFP-labeled molecule expression were similar in examined cells, we performed experiments in cells displaying comparable fluorescence levels. The means of intermolecular FRET experiments were calculated according to Equation 2, which normalizes for different expression levels of CFP and YFP molecules, NFRET=FYEPex436/em535−a×FCEPex436/em480−b×FYEPex500/em535FCEPex436/em480×FYEPex500/em535(Eq. 2) LLC-PK1 cells expressing V2R C-terminally tagged with enhanced GFP (V2R-GFP) (28.Bouley R.

After 48 h, cells were incubated with 1 μm VP for different times of incubation (30, 60, 120, or 240 min). Cells were then lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Before Western blot analysis, protein concentrations were measured with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Reduced samples from cell lysates (20 μg) were loaded onto each lane of a standard NUPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel and then electroblotted on Immobilon transfer membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The filters were blocked with Li-Cor blocking buffer by shaking for 1 h at room temperature before the incubation (1 h) of the polyclonal anti-GFP (0.4 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) and monoclonal anti-actin antibody in Li-Cor blocking buffer, Tween 0.1%. After being washed three times in PBS/Tween 0.1% buffer, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse IRdye 800CW and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680 diluted in Li-Cor blocking buffer. After 1 h of incubation, membranes were washed three times with PBS/Tween 0.1% buffer. After two rinses in distilled water, fluorescence in the membranes was recorded by using a Li-Cor infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Density of protein bands was quantified using IP Lab Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Vienna, VA). Western blot analyses were performed according to standard procedures.

Significance: FANCJ has a unique role in DNA metabolism to prevent G4 accumulation that causes genomic instability. DNA sequences that form alternate DNA structures such as hairpins, triplexes, Z-DNA, and G-quadruplexes (G4) 2The abbreviations used are: G4G-quadruplexTMStelomestatinFANCJFanconi anemia group J proteinTOthiazole orangeFIDfluorescence-induced displacementMMCmitomycin C. can be difficult to replicate and pose a source of genomic instability. In addition, they may have effects on transcription, recombination, or DNA repair. Increasing evidence suggests that G4 structures indeed form in vivo and have readily detectable effects on cellular nucleic acid metabolism (1.Bochman M.L. Paeschke K. Zakian V.A. DNA secondary structures. Stability and function of G-quadruplex structures.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). G-quadruplexes are composed of planar stacks of four guanine residues interacting with each other by noncovalent Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and stabilized by a monovalent cation (typically Na+ or K+) residing in the central cavity. G-quadruplexes, which have the ability to self-assemble in G-rich sequences of the genome, can assume different topologies (uni-, bi-, or tetramolecular). A growing number of mammalian DNA helicases (e.g. WRN, BLM, FANCJ, PIF1) have been shown to unwind G4 DNA substrates in vitro; however, not all DNA helicases are able to do so efficiently (e.g. RECQ1) or remain uncharacterized at the biochemical level (e.g. RTEL) (2.Wu Y. Brosh Jr., R.M. G-quadruplex nucleic acids and human disease.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 3470-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). G-quadruplex telomestatin Fanconi anemia group J protein thiazole orange fluorescence-induced displacement mitomycin C. It was only recently that cellular evidence was obtained demonstrating that the ability of certain DNA helicases to resolve G-quadruplexes in vitro had any relevance in vivo. A role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 to resolve G4 structures to preserve replication fork progression and suppress chromosomal breakage was determined (3.Paeschke K. Capra J.A. Zakian V.A. DNA replication through G-quadruplex motifs is promoted by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 DNA helicase.Cell. 2011; 145: 678-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Pif1, but not the RecQ homolog Sgs1, destabilized a G-rich human subtelomeric CEB1 mini-satellite inserted into a yeast chromosome (4.Ribeyre C. Lopes J. Boulé J.B. Piazza A. Guédin A. Zakian V.A. Mergny J.L. Nicolas A. The yeast Pif1 helicase prevents genomic instability caused by G-quadruplex-forming CEB1 sequences in vivo.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000475Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Treatment of Pif1-deficient cells with G4 binding compounds exasperated CEB1 instability but not tandem repeats lacking G4-forming sequences (5.Piazza A. Boulé J.B. Lopes J. Mingo K. Largy E. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Nicolas A. Genetic instability triggered by G-quadruplex interacting Phen-DC compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4337-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The hCEB1 array is unstable in Pif1-deficient cells or yeast exposed to the G4 binding compound Phen-DC3 only when the G-rich strand is the template of leading-strand replication (6.Lopes J. Piazza A. Bermejo R. Kriegsman B. Colosio A. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Foiani M. Nicolas A. G-quadruplex-induced instability during leading-strand replication.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4033-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This result was not entirely predictable as the lagging strand template has more extensive single-stranded character as a consequence of discontinuous DNA synthesis. Earlier work had suggested that deletions in G-rich sequences of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome due to the mutation of the Fe-S helicase DOG-1 was the consequence of structural blocks (secondary structures) to lagging strand synthesis (7.Cheung I. Schertzer M. Rose A. Lansdorp P.M. Disruption of dog-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans triggers deletions upstream of guanine-rich DNA.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The findings that G4-induced instability can occur during leading or lagging strand replication raises the question of how the division of labor between G4-resolving DNA helicases occurs and potential differences in substrate specificity or underlying mechanism. Human cells depleted of the Fe-S cluster helicase FANCJ, a DOG-1 ortholog, were found to be sensitive to the G4-specific DNA binding compound telomestatin (TMS) (8.Wu Y. Shin-ya K. Brosh Jr., R.M.

Telomerase inhibitor, telomestatin, a specific mechanism to interact with telomere structure.Nippon Rinsho. 2004; 62: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar). Patient-derived FANCJ mutant cells accumulate deletions at genomic sequences with a G4 DNA signature (11.London T.B. Barber L.J. Mosedale G. Kelly G.P. Balasubramanian S. Hickson I.D. Boulton S.J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 36132-36139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These findings suggested a model in which FANCJ suppresses genomic instability by resolving G-quadruplexes to enable smooth replication fork progression. Transcription profiling of chicken DT40 mutants suggested that FANCJ maintains epigenetic stability at G4 DNA motifs by collaborating independently with the REV1 translesion polymerase or the RecQ helicases WRN and BLM defective in the genetic disorders Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome, respectively (12.Sarkies P. Murat P. Phillips L.G. Patel K.J. Balasubramanian S. Sale J.E. FANCJ coordinates two pathways that maintain epigenetic stability at G-quadruplex DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 1485-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that in chicken cells, FANCJ promotes replication through TMS-stabilized DNA sequences predicted to form G4 and suppresses heterochromatin spreading (13.Schwab R.A. Nieminuszczy J. Shin-ya K. Niedzwiedz W. FANCJ couples replication past natural fork barriers with maintenance of chromatin structure.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cumulative evidence implicates FANCJ in G4 biology; however, it is still unclear how FANCJ is unique from other DNA helicases, including those that share sequence homology in the helicase core domain. In the current study our efforts were focused on the Fe-S family of DNA helicases and their potential differences in substrate specificity based on G4 topology. FANCJ was determined to be unique among the Fe-S helicases tested for its ability to unwind unimolecular G4 DNA. The G4 ligand TMS induced DNA damage in human cells in a manner dependent on the status of FANCJ but not the Fe-S DNA helicases DDX11 or XPD. These results suggest that FANCJ is specialized among the Fe-S helicases to resolve G4 DNA structures that threaten genomic stability. Recombinant human FANCJ (14.Wu Y. Sommers J.A. Loiland J.A.

For expression and purification of Escherichia coli DinG, the entire DinG open reading frame was inserted into the pETM11 (EMBL) plasmid with sequence encoding His-tag resulting in pDING1. pDING1 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Expression was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the bacterial culture reached an A600 of 0.6 and incubated at 15 °C for 15 h. Cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 30% glycerol, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and DNase (Invitrogen). DinG was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel IDA beads (Macherey & Nagel). DinG protein was eluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 250 mm imidazole. For further purification, a size exclusion chromatography step was applied using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol as the buffer system. Finally the protein was concentrated to concentrations between 5 and 10 mg/ml using a Centricon filter with 30-kDa cutoff (Sartorius). The four-stranded (tetramolecular) parallel TP-G4 substrate and two-stranded (bimolecular) anti-parallel OX-1-G2′ DNA substrate were prepared from gel-purified oligonucleotides purchased from Loftstrand Labs (Gaithersburg, MD) as previously described (8.Wu Y.

Helicase reactions for XPD and DinG were performed in buffer that contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml BSA. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mm ATP, the DNA substrates mentioned above, and the indicated helicase protein concentrations. For the unimolecular Poly(A) Zic1-G4 DNA substrate, helicase reactions were performed in reaction buffer containing a 20-fold excess of peptide-nucleic acid complementary oligonucleotide (17.Giri B.

G4 helicase reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of stop buffer (74% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10 mm KCl, 20 mm EDTA). Forked-duplex helicase reactions were terminated as described previously (18.Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. Biochemical characterization of the DNA substrate specificity of Werner syndrome helicase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Reaction products were resolved on nondenaturing 8 and 12% (19:1 acrylamide-bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels for the G4 and forked-duplex substrates, respectively, and quantitated as described previously (18.Brosh Jr., R.M.

Briefly, the percentage of helicase substrate unwound was calculated using the formula: % unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate controls, respectively.

Compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. For helicase assay, various concentrations of ligands as indicated were added to the reaction mixture containing DNA substrate on ice before the addition of helicase. A schematic principle of the fluorescence-induced displacement (FID) assay is shown in Fig. 7A (20.Largy E. Hamon F. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Development of a high-throughput G4-FID assay for screening and evaluation of small molecules binding quadruplex nucleic acid structures.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2011; 400: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, G4 substrate (OX-1-G2′, 3′-Poly(A) Zic1-G4, or 5′-Poly(A) Zic1-G4) was labeled with thiazole orange (TO), enabling the DNA substrate-TO complex to fluoresce. TO displacement by the G4 ligand (Phen-DC3 or Phen-DC6) results in a decrease in fluorescence. To label the G4 substrate with TO, fluorimetric titrations were performed in a 1-ml quartz cell in cacodylate buffer/Li+-K+ buffer in a total volume of 1 ml. The temperature (20 °C) was kept constant with a thermostatted cell holder. Titrations were performed with a solution of the fluorescent probe (TO 0.5 μm) in the corresponding buffer in which the gradual addition of oligonucleotides was carried out (up to 10 mol eq). After each addition, a fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded with excitation wavelength fixed at 495 nm. The fluorescence emission area was measured between 510 and 750 nm with 1.0-nm increments, 0.1-s integration times, and (excitation/emission) 10/10-nm slits. The titration curves were obtained by plotting the fluorescence emission area enhancement against the oligonucleotide concentration. To perform the G4-FID experiments, the TO-labeled G4 substrates were titrated with increasing concentrations of Phen-DC3 or Phen-DC6, and the fluorescence decrease upon TO displacement was indicative of G4 ligand binding. Each experiment was performed in a 1-ml cell in 10 mm lithium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) with 100 mm KCl in a total volume of 1 ml. The G4-FID assay was designed as follows; 0.25 μm prefolded G4-DNA target was mixed with thiazole orange (0.50 μm). Each ligand addition (from 0.5 to 10 eq, stock solution 0.125 mm in DMSO) was followed by a 3-min equilibration period after which the fluorescence spectrum was recorded at 495-nm excitation wavelength. The fluorescence emission area was measured between 510 and 750 nm with 1.0-nm increments, 0.1 s integration times, (excitation/emission) 10/10-nm slits. The displacement of TO was calculated as follows: TO displacement (%) = 100 − [(FA/FA0) × 100], where FA and FA0 stand for the fluorescence emission area of TO bound to DNA after each ligand addition and before ligand addition, respectively. The percentage of fluorescence variation was then plotted as a function of the concentration of added ligand. The DC50 (concentration necessary to decrease the fluorescence by 50%) is assumed to correspond to 50% probe displacement, thus reflecting the ligand binding strength and was determined after non-linear fitting of the displacement curve. The immortalized skin fibroblast cell line, XP6BE (SV40) (GM08207), established from a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D is referred to as XPD−/−. The XPD+/+ cell line (D6BE-ER2–9) is a derivative of XP6BE (SV40) (GM08207) cell line by subsequent transfection with p2E-ER2, a complementary DNA expression construct of the ERCC2 (XPD) gene, to correct the abnormal phenotype (21.Gözükara E.M. Parris C.N. Weber C.A. Salazar E.P. Seidman M.M. Watkins J.F. Prakash L. Kraemer K.H.

These cell lines were obtained from Coriell Cell depository and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. D6BE-ER2–9 cell line was grown in the same media in the presence of 0.6 mg/ml of Geneticin. FANCJ was depleted from human osteosarcoma U2 OS cells (ATCC HTB-96) by RNA interference (RNAi). The sequence of FANCJ small interfering RNA (siRNA) was 5′-GUACAGUACCCCACCUUAU-3′ (22.Litman R. Peng M. Jin Z. Zhang F. Zhang J. Powell S. Andreassen P.R. Cantor S.B. BACH1 is critical for homologous recombination and appears to be the Fanconi anemia gene product FANCJ.Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and that of the control siRNA was 5′-AGUUACUCAGCCAAGAACGA-3′ (23.Kumaraswamy E. Shiekhattar R. Activation of BRCA1/BRCA2-associated helicase BACH1 is required for timely progression through S phase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6733-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). siRNA transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were plated to 40% confluence in 10-cm dishes 24 h before transfection. siRNA (0.6 nmol) was mixed with 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 3 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The mixture was added to cells that were subsequently incubated for 6 h. After 24 h, a second transfection was performed similarly. Seventy-two hours after the initial transfection, cells were harvested or treated as indicated below. Cell lysate preparation and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (24.Gupta R. Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Kenny M.K. Cantor S.B. Brosh Jr., R.M. FANCJ (BACH1) helicase forms DNA damage-inducible foci with replication protein A and interacts physically and functionally with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein.Blood. 2007; 110: 2390-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). DDX11 was depleted from U2 OS cells by siRNA transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 with two DDX11 siRNA sequences (5′-UCCUGCAUGGCUGAGAGCCAGGCUU-3′ and 5′-CCUGUGUCUGUCUUCUUCCUGCGAA-3′) as described previously (25.Leman A.R.

Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Due to the low abundance of DDX11 in human cells, DDX11 immunoprecipitation from whole cell lysates of cells transfected with control siRNA or DDX11 siRNA was performed, and immunoprecipitated DDX11 protein was detected by Western blot. Briefly, whole cell lysates (400 μg of protein) were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Pierce protease phosphatase inhibitor) with 2 μg of rabbit DDX11antibody (Santa Cruz). Rabbit DDX11 antibody was preincubated with protein AG magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific) and washed, and antibody-bound protein AG beads were used for binding with whole cell lysates. Binding was allowed for 2 h at 4 °C and washed twice with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were separated in magnetic stand. Bound proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% acrylamide gels. DDX11 was detected by Western blot using a 1:250 dilution of mouse DDX11 antibody (Sigma). Seventy-two hours after the first siRNA transfection, U2 OS cells were treated with either 5 μm TMS or 100 nm mitomycin C (MMC) for 3 h, subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), returned to complete medium for 16 h, and fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.7%) at room temperature for 15 min. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton solution (Sigma), 1% BSA, 0.2 mg/ml EDTA, and 100 mm glycine) on ice for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and treated for 100 ng/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and blocked with 10% goat serum (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. Indirect immunostaining was performed by first incubating cells with a mouse anti-γ-H2AX monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Upstate) for 1 h at room temperature. After 4 washes in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (1:1000; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and coated with Prolong Gold antifade reagent containing DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen). Coverslips were placed on chamber slides, and cells were cured at room temperature in the dark for 24 h. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META inverted Axiovert 200M laser scan microscope. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera and identically processed using Adobe Photoshop CS6 to adjust brightness and contrast. The XPD−/− and XPD+/+ cell lines were treated with 5 μm TMS for 3 h or UV light (2.5 J/m2) followed by fixation, permeabilization, and processing for γ-H2AX immunofluorescence as described above for the U2 OS cells. To gain a better understanding of the FANCJ role in G4 DNA metabolism, we examined its potential uniqueness from other Fe-S DNA helicases implicated in DNA repair processes that might involve G-quadruplex DNA structures. Because G-quadruplexes are known to assume different topologies based on Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between G-rich strands in distinct orientations, we tested FANCJ to unwind an entropically favored unimolecular G4 structure and compared its activity to multistranded G4 substrates that have been more conventionally used to evaluate DNA unwinding by various DNA helicases in vitro. FANCJ unwound the unimolecular Poly(A) Zic1-G4 DNA substrate in the presence of ATP in a kinetic manner to near completion by the end of the 45-min incubation as evidenced by the co-migration of the unwound product with the radiolabeled duplex marker (Fig. 1A). Quantitative assessment of FANCJ unwinding of the unimolecular G4 substrate during the first 15 min was used to determine its initial linear rate of 10 pm uni-G4 substrate unwound per min under multiturnover conditions (Fig. 1B). FANCJ failed to unwind the unimolecular G4 substrate in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ADP or ATPγS (Fig. 1C), indicating that FANCJ helicase activity on the unimolecular G4 substrate required nucleotide hydrolysis. FANCJ bound the unimolecular G4 substrate irrespective of nucleotide (data not shown), indicating that its inability to unwind was not attributed to its inability to interact with the G4 substrate. To determine if the observed helicase activity on the unimolecular G4 substrate was dependent on ATP hydrolysis intrinsic to FANCJ, we tested an engineered FANCJ ATPase-dead mutant (K52R) purified in a manner identical to that of the normal FANCJ recombinant protein for unwinding Poly(A) Zic1-G4. The K52R mutant protein failed to resolve the G4 substrate (Fig. 1D), confirming that FANCJ helicase activity on the unimolecular G4 substrate is dependent on FANCJ ATP hydrolysis. Similarly, a p"

CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) encode small RNAs (crRNAs) that together with CRISPR-associated (cas) genes constitute a sequence-specific prokaryotic immune system for anti-viral and anti-plasmid defense. crRNAs are subject to multiple processing events during their biogenesis, and little is known about the mechanism of the final maturation step. We show that in the Staphylococcus epidermidis type III CRISPR-Cas system, mature crRNAs are measured in a Cas10·Csm ribonucleoprotein complex to yield discrete lengths that differ by 6-nucleotide increments. We looked for mutants that impact this crRNA size pattern and found that an alanine substitution of a conserved aspartate residue of Csm3 eliminates the 6-nucleotide increments in the length of crRNAs. In vitro, recombinant Csm3 binds RNA molecules at multiple sites, producing gel-shift patterns that suggest that each protein binds 6 nucleotides of substrate. In vivo, changes in the levels of Csm3 modulate the crRNA size distribution without disrupting the 6-nucleotide periodicity. Our data support a model in which multiple Csm3 molecules within the Cas10·Csm complex bind the crRNA with a 6-nucleotide periodicity to function as a ruler that measures the extent of crRNA maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2156189675,"Placebo treatments and healing rituals have been used to treat pain throughout history. The present within-subject crossover study examines the variability in individual responses to placebo treatment with verbal suggestion and visual cue conditioning by investigating whether responses to different types of placebo treatment, as well as conditioning responses, correlate with one another. Secondarily, this study also examines whether responses to sham acupuncture correlate with responses to genuine acupuncture. Healthy subjects were recruited to participate in two sequential experiments. Experiment one is a five-session crossover study. In each session, subjects received one of four treatments: placebo pills (described as Tylenol), sham acupuncture, genuine acupuncture, or no treatment rest control condition. Before and after each treatment, paired with a verbal suggestion of positive effect, each subject's pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain ratings to calibrated heat pain were measured. At least 14 days after completing experiment one, all subjects were invited to participate in experiment two, during which their analgesic responses to conditioned visual cues were tested. Forty-eight healthy subjects completed experiment one, and 45 completed experiment two. The results showed significantly different effects of genuine acupuncture, placebo pill and rest control on pain threshold. There was no significant association between placebo pills, sham acupuncture and cue conditioning effects, indicating that individuals may respond to unique healing rituals in different ways. This outcome suggests that placebo response may be a complex behavioral phenomenon that has properties that comprise a state, rather than a trait characteristic. This could explain the difficulty of detecting a signature for “placebo responders.” However, a significant association was found between the genuine and sham acupuncture treatments, implying that the non-specific effects of acupuncture may contribute to the analgesic effect observed in genuine acupuncture analgesia."

The morphological and clinical consequences of stroke were investigated in a mouse model with a one hour-occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.Thrombus formation was significantly decreased after endothelial injury by 1 mg/kg Revacept i.v., compared to Fc only. 1 mg/kg Revacept i.v. applied in mice with ischemic stroke immediately before reperfusion significantly improved functional outcome, cerebral infarct size and edema compared to Fc only. Also treatment with 10 mg/kg rtPA was effective, and functional outcome was similar in both treatment groups. The combination of Revacept with rtPA leads to increased reperfusion compared to treatment with either agent alone. In contrast to rtPA, however, there were no signs of increased intracranial bleeding with Revacept. Both rtPA and Revacept improved survival after stroke compared to placebo treatment. Revacept and vWF bind to collagen and Revacept competitively prevented the binding of vWF to collagen.Revacept reduces arterial thrombus formation, reduces cerebral infarct size and edema after ischemic stroke, improves functional and prognostic outcome without intracranial bleeding. Revacept not only prevents GPVI-mediated, but probably also vWF-mediated platelet adhesion and aggregate formation. Therefore Revacept might be a potent and safe tool to treat ischemic complications of stroke."

https://openalex.org/W2069882108,"Hepatoblasts, hepatic stem/progenitor cells in liver development, have a high proliferative potential and the ability to differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In regenerative medicine and drug screening for the treatment of severe liver diseases, human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived mature functional hepatocytes are considered to be a potentially good cell source. However, induction of proliferation of these cells is difficult ex vivo. To circumvent this problem, we generated hepatic progenitor-like cells from human iPS cells using serial cytokine treatments in vitro. Highly proliferative hepatic progenitor-like cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using antibodies against CD13 and CD133 that are known cell surface markers of hepatic stem/progenitor cells in fetal and adult mouse livers. When the purified CD13highCD133+ cells were cultured at a low density with feeder cells in the presence of suitable growth factors and signaling inhibitors (ALK inhibitor A-83-01 and ROCK inhibitor Y-27632), individual cells gave rise to relatively large colonies. These colonies consisted of two types of cells expressing hepatocytic marker genes (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and α-fetoprotein) and a cholangiocytic marker gene (cytokeratin 7), and continued to proliferate over long periods of time. In a spheroid formation assay, these cells were found to express genes required for mature liver function, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, and secrete albumin. When these cells were cultured in a suitable extracellular matrix gel, they eventually formed a cholangiocytic cyst-like structure with epithelial polarity, suggesting that human iPS cell-derived hepatic progenitor-like cells have a bipotent differentiation ability. Collectively these data indicate that this novel procedure using an in vitro expansion system is useful for not only liver regeneration but also for the determination of molecular mechanisms that regulate liver development."
https://openalex.org/W2115814152,"Menthol is a common compound in pharmaceutical and commercial products and a popular additive to cigarettes. The molecular targets of menthol remain poorly defined. In this study we show an effect of menthol on the α7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor function. Using a two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, menthol was found to reversibly inhibit α7-nACh receptors heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Inhibition by menthol was not dependent on the membrane potential and did not involve endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channels, since menthol inhibition remained unchanged by intracellular injection of the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA and perfusion with Ca(2+)-free bathing solution containing Ba(2+). Furthermore, increasing ACh concentrations did not reverse menthol inhibition and the specific binding of [(125)I] α-bungarotoxin was not attenuated by menthol. Studies of α7- nACh receptors endogenously expressed in neural cells demonstrate that menthol attenuates α7 mediated Ca(2+) transients in the cell body and neurite. In conclusion, our results suggest that menthol inhibits α7-nACh receptors in a noncompetitive manner."
https://openalex.org/W2093461208,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) was an emerging viral infectious disease in recent years in Shenzhen. The underlying risk factors have not yet been systematically examined. This study analyzed the short-term effect of El Niño-Southern Oscillation on pediatric HFMD in Shenzhen, China. Daily count of HFMD among children aged below 15 years old, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and weather variables were collected to construct the time series. A distributed lag non-linear model was applied to investigate the effect of daily SOI on pediatric HFMD occurrence during 2008-2010. We observed an acute effect of SOI variation on HFMD occurrence. The extremely high SOI (SOI = 45, with 0 as reference) was associated with increased HFMD, with the relative risk (RR) being 1.66 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.34-2.04). Further analyses of the association between HFMD and daily mean temperature and relative humidity supported the correlation between pediatric HFMD and SOI. Meteorological factors might be important predictors of pediatric HFMD occurrence in Shenzhen."
https://openalex.org/W2032594368,"Recent evidence suggests that transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) expressed in immune cells plays an important role in immune and inflammatory responses. We recently reported that TRPM2 expressed in macrophages and spinal microglia contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and neuropathic pain aggravating peripheral and central pronociceptive inflammatory responses in mice. To further elucidate the contribution of TRPM2 expressed by peripheral immune cells to neuropathic pain, we examined the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain and the infiltration of immune cells (particularly macrophages) into the injured nerve and spinal cord by using bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice by crossing wildtype (WT) and TRPM2-knockout (TRPM2-KO) mice. Four types of BM chimeric mice were prepared, in which irradiated WT or TRPM2-KO recipient mice were transplanted with either WT-or TRPM2-KO donor mouse-derived green fluorescence protein-positive (GFP+) BM cells (TRPM2BM+/Rec+, TRPM2BM–/Rec+, TRPM2BM+/Rec–, and TRPM2BM–/Rec– mice). Mechanical allodynia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation observed in TRPM2BM+/Rec+ mice was attenuated in TRPM2BM–/Rec+, TRPM2BM+/Rec–, and TRPM2BM–/Rec– mice. The numbers of GFP+ BM-derived cells and Iba1/GFP double-positive macrophages in the injured sciatic nerve did not differ among chimeric mice 14 days after the nerve injury. In the spinal cord, the number of GFP+ BM-derived cells, particularly GFP/Iba1 double-positive macrophages, was significantly decreased in the three TRPM2-KO chimeric mouse groups compared with TRPM2BM+/Rec+ mice. However, the numbers of GFP–/Iba1+ resident microglia did not differ among chimeric mice. These results suggest that TRPM2 plays an important role in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, particularly macrophages, into the spinal cord, rather than the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the injured nerves and activation of spinal-resident microglia. The spinal infiltration of macrophages mediated by TRPM2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain."

The networks were analysed with graph theoretical measures. Our results give reference maps of hub distribution measured with betweenness centrality and node degree. The loci of the hubs correspond with key areas from known overlapping cognitive networks. Several hubs were asymmetrically organized across hemispheres. Furthermore, females have hubs with higher betweenness centrality and males have hubs with higher node degree. Female networks have higher small-world indices."
https://openalex.org/W2007421882,"Background The PALB2 gene, also known as FANCN, forms a bond and co-localizes with BRCA2 in DNA repair. Germline mutations in PALB2 have been identified in approximately 1% of familial breast cancer and 3–4% of familial pancreatic cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of PALB2 mutations in a population of BRCA1/BRCA2 negative breast cancer patients selected from either a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer. Methods 132 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast/ovarian cancer families with at least one pancreatic cancer case were included in the study. PALB2 mutational analysis was performed by direct sequencing of all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries, as well as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Results Two PALB2 truncating mutations, the c.1653T>A (p.Tyr551Stop) previously reported, and c.3362del (p.Gly1121ValfsX3) which is a novel frameshift mutation, were identified. Moreover, several PALB2 variants were detected; some of them were predicted as pathological by bioinformatic analysis. Considering truncating mutations, the prevalence rate of our population of BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer patients with pancreatic cancer is 1.5%. Conclusions The prevalence rate of PALB2 mutations in non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast/ovarian cancer families, selected from either a personal or family pancreatic cancer history, is similar to that previously described for unselected breast/ovarian cancer families. Future research directed towards identifying other gene(s) involved in the development of breast/pancreatic cancer families is required."
https://openalex.org/W2122768930,"We reported that iron influx drives the translational expression of the neuronal amyloid precursor protein (APP), which has a role in iron efflux. This is via a classic release of repressor interaction of APP mRNA with iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) whereas IRP2 controls the mRNAs encoding the L- and H-subunits of the iron storage protein, ferritin. Here, we identified thirteen potent APP translation blockers that acted selectively towards the uniquely configured iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of APP mRNA. These agents were 10-fold less inhibitory of 5′UTR sequences of the related prion protein (PrP) mRNA. Western blotting confirmed that the ‘ninth’ small molecule in the series selectively reduced neural APP production in SH-SY5Y cells at picomolar concentrations without affecting viability or the expression of α-synuclein and ferritin. APP blocker-9 (JTR-009), a benzimidazole, reduced the production of toxic Aβ in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells to a greater extent than other well tolerated APP 5′UTR-directed translation blockers, including posiphen, that were shown to limit amyloid burden in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RNA binding assays demonstrated that JTR-009 operated by preventing IRP1 from binding to the IRE in APP mRNA, while maintaining IRP1 interaction with the H-ferritin IRE RNA stem loop. Thus, JTR-009 constitutively repressed translation driven by APP 5′UTR sequences. Calcein staining showed that JTR-009 did not indirectly change iron uptake in neuronal cells suggesting a direct interaction with the APP 5′UTR. These studies provide key data to develop small molecules that selectively reduce neural APP and Aβ production at 10-fold lower concentrations than related previously characterized translation blockers. Our data evidenced a novel therapeutic strategy of potential impact for people with trisomy of the APP gene on chromosome 21, which is a phenotype long associated with Down syndrome (DS) that can also cause familial Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2050299046,"This study shows that the expression of yjcC, an in vivo expression (IVE) gene, and the stress response regulatory genes soxR, soxS, and rpoS are paraquat inducible in Klebsiella pneumoniae CG43. The deletion of rpoS or soxRS decreased yjcC expression, implying an RpoS- or SoxRS-dependent control. After paraquat or H2O2 treatment, the deletion of yjcC reduced bacterial survival. These effects could be complemented by introducing the ΔyjcC mutant with the YjcC-expression plasmid pJR1. The recombinant protein containing only the YjcC-EAL domain exhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity; overexpression of yjcC has lower levels of cyclic di-GMP. The yjcC deletion mutant also exhibited increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, oxidation damage, and oxidative stress scavenging activity. In addition, the yjcC deletion reduced capsular polysaccharide production in the bacteria, but increased the LD50 in mice, biofilm formation, and type 3 fimbriae major pilin MrkA production. Finally, a comparative transcriptome analysis showed 34 upregulated and 29 downregulated genes with the increased production of YjcC. The activated gene products include glutaredoxin I, thioredoxin, heat shock proteins, chaperone, and MrkHI, and proteins for energy metabolism (transporters, cell surface structure, and transcriptional regulation). In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that YjcC positively regulates the oxidative stress response and mouse virulence but negatively affects the biofilm formation and type 3 fimbriae expression by altering the c-di-GMP levels after receiving oxidative stress signaling inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2088819870,"Background The razor clam Sinonovacula constricta is a benthic intertidal bivalve species with important commercial value. Despite its economic importance, knowledge of its transcriptome is scarce. Next generation sequencing technologies offer rapid and efficient tools for generating large numbers of sequences, which can be used to characterize the transcriptome, to develop effective molecular markers and to identify genes associated with growth, a key breeding trait. Results Total RNA was isolated from the mantle, gill, liver, siphon, gonad and muscular foot tissues. High-throughput deep sequencing of S. constricta using 454 pyrosequencing technology yielded 859,313 high-quality reads with an average read length of 489 bp. Clustering and assembly of these reads produced 16,323 contigs and 131,346 singletons with average lengths of 1,376 bp and 458 bp, respectively. Based on transcriptome sequencing, 14,615 sequences had significant matches with known genes encoding 147,669 predicted proteins. Subsequently, previously unknown growth-related genes were identified. A total of 13,563 microsatellites (SSRs) and 13,634 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNPs) were discovered, of which almost half were validated. Conclusion De novo sequencing of the razor clam S. constricta transcriptome on the 454 GS FLX platform generated a large number of ESTs. Candidate growth factors and a large number of SSRs and SNPs were identified. These results will impact genetic studies of S. constricta."
https://openalex.org/W2016523414,"HP (2-20) is a 19-aa, amphipathic, α-helical peptide with antimicrobial properties that was derived from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1. We previously showed that increasing the net hydrophobicity of HP (2-20) by substituting Trp for Gln(17) and Asp(19) (Anal 3) increased the peptide's antimicrobial activity. In hydrophobic medium, Anal 3 forms an amphipathic structure consisting of an N-terminal random coil region (residues 2-5) and an extended helical region (residues 6-20). To investigate the structure-activity relationship of Anal 3, we substituted Pro for Glu(9) (Anal 3-Pro) and then examined the new peptide's three-dimensional structure, antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action. Anal 3-Pro had an α-helical structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). NMR spectroscopic analysis of Anal 3-Pro's tertiary structure in SDS micelles confirmed that the kink potential introduced by Pro(10) was responsible for the helix distortion. We also found that Anal 3-Pro exhibited about 4 times greater antimicrobial activity than Anal 3. Fluorescence activated flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that incorporating a Pro-hinge into Anal 3 markedly reduced its membrane permeability so that it accumulated in the cytoplasm without remaining in the cell membrane. To investigate the translocation mechanism, we assessed its ability to release of FITC-dextran. The result showed Anal 3-Pro created a pore <1.8 nm in diameter, which is similar to buforin II. Notably, scanning electron microscopic observation of Candida albicans revealed that Anal 3-Pro and buforin II exert similar effects on cell membranes, whereas magainin 2 exerts a different, more damaging, effect. In addition, Anal 3-Pro assumed a helix-hinge-helix structure in the presence of biological membranes and formed micropores in both bacterial and fungal membranes, through which it entered the cytoplasm and tightly bound to DNA. These results indicate that the bending region of Anal 3- Pro peptide is prerequisite for effective antibiotic activity and may facilitate easy penetration of the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane."

Each of 290 GPs provided data for about 30 consecutive patients (total 8,707) indicating diagnosed chronic conditions, using their knowledge of the patient, patient self-report, and patient's health record.Estimates of prevalence of chronic conditions among patients surveyed, adjusted prevalence in patients who attended general practice at least once that year, and national population prevalence.Two-thirds (66.3%) of patients surveyed had at least one chronic condition: most prevalent being hypertension (26.6%), hyperlipidaemia (18.5%), osteoarthritis (17.8%), depression (13.7%), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (11.6%), asthma (9.5%) and Type 2 diabetes (8.3%). For patients who attended general practice at least once, we estimated 58.8% had at least one chronic condition. After further adjustment we estimated 50.8% of the Australian population had at least one chronic condition: hypertension (17.4%), hyperlipidaemia (12.7%), osteoarthritis (11.1%), depression (10.5%) and asthma (8.0%) being most prevalent.This study used GPs to gather information from their knowledge, the patient, and health records, to provide prevalence estimates that overcome weaknesses of studies using patient self-report or health record audit alone. Our results facilitate examination of primary care resource use in management of chronic conditions and measurement of prevalence of multimorbidity in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2023870030,"Increased serum uric acid (SUA) levels may be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in men presenting with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and/or insulin resistance. We aimed to determine the independent relationship between SUA and NAFLD in non-diabetic Chinese male population, and to explore the determinants of SUA levels among indexes of adiposity, lipid, and genotypes pertaining to triglycerides metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and SUA concentrations. A total of 1440 men, classified depending on the presence of ultrasonographically detected NAFLD, underwent a complete healthy checkup program. Genotypes were extracted from our previously established genome-wide association study database. After adjusting for age, smoking, drinking, body mass index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and components of metabolic syndrome, the odds ratio for NAFLD, comparing the highest with the lowest SUA quartile, was 2.81 (95% confidence interval 1.66–4.76). A stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis (R2 = 0.238, P<0.001) retained age, waist circumference, serum creatinine, triglycerides, the Q141K variant in ABCG2 (rs2231142) and NAFLD as significant predictors of SUA levels (all P<0.001). Besides, ALT and Met196Arg variant in TNFRSF1B (rs1061622) additionally associated with SUA among individuls with NAFLD. Our data suggest that in Chinese men, elevated SUA is significantly associated with NAFLD, independent of insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders, such as central obesity or hypertriglyceridemia. Meanwhile, among subjects with NAFLD, index of liver damage, such as elevated ALT combined with genetic susceptibility to inflammation associated with increased SUA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2115697554,"Post mortem studies have shown volume changes of the hypothalamus in psychiatric patients. With 7T magnetic resonance imaging this effect can now be investigated in vivo in detail. To benefit from the sub-millimeter resolution requires an improved segmentation procedure. The traditional anatomical landmarks of the hypothalamus were refined using 7T T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. A detailed segmentation algorithm (unilateral hypothalamus) was developed for colour-coded, histogram-matched images, and evaluated in a sample of 10 subjects. Test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities were estimated in terms of intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and Dice's coefficient (DC). The computer-assisted segmentation algorithm ensured test-retest reliabilities of ICC≥.97 (DC≥96.8) and inter-rater reliabilities of ICC≥.94 (DC = 95.2). There were no significant volume differences between the segmentation runs, raters, and hemispheres. The estimated volumes of the hypothalamus lie within the range of previous histological and neuroimaging results. We present a computer-assisted algorithm for the manual segmentation of the human hypothalamus using T1-weighted 7T magnetic resonance imaging. Providing very high test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities, it outperforms former procedures established at 1.5T and 3T magnetic resonance images and thus can serve as a gold standard for future automated procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2056036605,"Mycobacterial siderophores are critical components for bacterial virulence in the host. Pathogenic mycobacteria synthesize iron chelating siderophores named mycobactin and carboxymycobactin to extract intracellular macrophage iron. The two siderophores differ in structure only by a lipophilic aliphatic chain attached on the ε-amino group of the lysine mycobactin core, which is transferred by MbtK. Prior to acyl chain transfer, the lipophilic chain requires activation by a specific fatty acyl-AMP ligase FadD33 (also known as MbtM) and is then loaded onto phosphopantetheinylated acyl carrier protein (holo-MbtL) to form covalently acylated MbtL. We demonstrate that FadD33 prefers long chain saturated lipids and initial velocity studies showed that FadD33 proceeds via a Bi Uni Uni Bi ping-pong mechanism. Inhibition experiments suggest that, during the first half-reaction (adenylation), fatty acid binds first to the free enzyme, followed by ATP and the release of pyrophosphate to form the adenylate intermediate. During the second half-reaction (ligation), holo-MbtL binds to the enzyme followed by the release of products AMP and acylated MbtL. In addition, we characterized a post-translational regulation mechanism of FadD33 by the mycobacterial protein lysine acetyltransferase in a cAMP-dependent manner. FadD33 acetylation leads to enzyme inhibition, which can be reversed by the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, MSMEG_5175 (DAc1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that bacterial siderophore synthesis has been shown to be regulated via post-translational protein acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2149109380,"The question of how affective processing is organized in the brain is still a matter of controversial discussions. Based on previous initial evidence, several suggestions have been put forward regarding the involved brain areas: (a) right-lateralized dominance in emotional processing, (b) hemispheric dominance according to positive or negative valence, (c) one network for all emotional processing and (d) region-specific discrete emotion matching. We examined these hypotheses by investigating intrinsic functional connectivity patterns that covary with results of the Positive and Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS) from 65 participants. This approach has the advantage of being able to test connectivity rather than activation, and not requiring a potentially confounding task. Voxelwise functional connectivity from 200 regions-of-interest covering the whole brain was assessed. Positive and negative affect covaried with functional connectivity involving a shared set of regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, the visual cortex and the cerebellum. In addition, each affective domain had unique connectivity patterns, and the lateralization index showed a right hemispheric dominance for negative affect. Therefore, our results suggest a predominantly right-hemispheric network with affect-specific elements as the underlying organization of emotional processes."
https://openalex.org/W2077672220,"Background Radiation cataracts develop as a consequence of the effects of ionizing radiation on the development of the lens of the eye with an opaque lens reducing or eliminating the ability to see. Therefore, we would expect cataracts to be associated with reduced fitness in free-living animals. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the incidence of lens opacities typical of cataracts in more than 1100 free-living birds in the Chernobyl region in relation to background radiation. The incidence of cataracts increased with level of background radiation both in analyses based on a dichotomous score and in analyses of continuous scores of intensity of cataracts. The odds ratio per unit change in the regressor was 0.722 (95% CI 0.648, 0.804), which was less than odds ratios from investigations of radiation cataracts in humans. The relatively small odds ratio may be due to increased mortality in birds with cataracts. We found a stronger negative relationship between bird abundance and background radiation when the frequency of cataracts was higher, but also a direct effect of radiation on abundance, suggesting that radiation indirectly affects abundance negatively through an increase in the frequency of cataracts in bird populations, but also through direct effects of radiation on other diseases, food abundance and interactions with other species. There was no increase in incidence of cataracts with increasing age, suggesting that yearlings and older individuals were similarly affected as is typical of radiation cataract. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that cataracts are an under-estimated cause of morbidity in free-living birds and, by inference, other vertebrates in areas contaminated with radioactive materials."
https://openalex.org/W2131769527,"Cytokine responsiveness is a critical component of the ability of cells to respond to the extracellular milieu. Transcription factor-mediated regulation of cytokine receptor expression is a common mode of altering responses to the external environment. We identify the transcription factor Twist1 as a component of a STAT3-induced feedback loop that controls IL-6 signals by directly repressing Il6ra. Human and mouse T cells lacking Twist1 have an increased ability to differentiate into Th17 cells. Mice with a T cell-specific deletion of Twist1 demonstrate increased Th17 and T follicular helper cell development, early onset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and increased antigen-specific antibody responses. Thus, Twist1 has a critical role in limiting both cell-mediated and humoral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2000979049,"Five different physiological conditions have been used interchangeably to establish the sequence of molecular events needed to achieve nitrogen-responsive down-regulation of TorC1 and its subsequent regulation of downstream reporters: nitrogen starvation, methionine sulfoximine (Msx) addition, nitrogen limitation, rapamycin addition, and leucine starvation. Therefore, we tested a specific underlying assumption upon which the interpretation of data generated by these five experimental perturbations is premised. It is that they generate physiologically equivalent outcomes with respect to TorC1, i.e. its down-regulation as reflected by TorC1 reporter responses. We tested this assumption by performing head-to-head comparisons of the requirements for each condition to achieve a common outcome for a downstream proxy of TorC1 inactivation, nuclear Gln3 localization. We demonstrate that the five conditions for down-regulating TorC1 do not elicit physiologically equivalent outcomes. Four of the methods exhibit hierarchical Sit4 and PP2A phosphatase requirements to elicit nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization. Rapamycin treatment required Sit4 and PP2A. Nitrogen limitation and short-term nitrogen starvation required only Sit4. G1 arrest-correlated, long-term nitrogen starvation and Msx treatment required neither PP2A nor Sit4. Starving cells of leucine or treating them with leucyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors did not elicit nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization. These data indicate that the five commonly used nitrogen-related conditions of down-regulating TorC1 are not physiologically equivalent and minimally involve partially differing regulatory mechanisms.

More importantly, we determined, in head-to-head comparisons using Gln3-Myc13 localization as the reporter of nitrogen-responsive TorC1 inactivation, whether the five conditions, in fact, generate equivalent physiological responses.

A second nutrient connection derived from three observations: 1) nutrient-limited cells failed to proceed through “Start” in late G1 and, instead, entered stationary phase (30Werner-Washburne M.

Nutrients, via the Tor proteins, stimulate the association of Tap42 with type 2A phosphatases.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar); and 3) TorC1-dependent Tap42 phosphorylation was required for Tap42-PP2A and Tap42-Sit4 complex formation, and rapamycin treatment caused dephosphorylation of Tap42 (32Schmidt A.

The TOR nutrient signalling pathway phosphorylates NPR1 and inhibits turnover of the tryptophan permease.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The connection between nitrogen limitation or nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) and Tor activity derived from the observations that rapamycin treatment, low concentrations of ammonia, or provision of proline as the sole nitrogen source all triggered the degradation of tryptophan permease (Tat2), whereas this degradation was prevented by the addition of excess nitrogen (19Beck T.

Subsequent genome-wide transcriptional analyses demonstrated that rapamycin treatment elicited a profile of increased NCR-sensitive catabolic gene expression similar to that found during growth with poor nitrogen sources or following the onset of short-term nitrogen starvation (15Bertram P.G.

These observations firmly connected Tor regulation with the well studied control of NCR-sensitive gene expression. Nitrogen limitation gained further acceptance as a way to down-regulate TorC1 with the findings that nitrogen limitation and rapamycin treatment resulted in nuclear localization of Gln3, the GATA family transcription activator responsible for NCR-sensitive gene expression and, thereafter, one of the most often used readouts of TorC1 activity (1Broach J.R.

Msx entered the repertoire of methods to down-regulate TorC1 activity when it was discovered that Msx addition, like rapamycin treatment, induced nuclear Gln3 and retrograde Rtg1 localization as well as increased NCR-sensitive and retrograde gene expression (20Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. The TOR-controlled transcription activators GLN3, RTG1, and RTG3 are regulated in response to intracellular levels of glutamine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It was from these initial correlations and many subsequent studies associated with them that the mechanistic outlines of nitrogen-responsive TorC1 regulation of Gln3 localization and nitrogen catabolic gene transcription arose and were concluded to be exerted through a common regulatory pathway (Refs. 1Broach J.R.

In a broad, abridged outline, the overall conclusion of this combined work was that, in nitrogen, excess active TorC1 phosphorylates Tap42. Phosphorylated Tap42 formed a complex with the PP2A or Sit4 phosphatases, which bound them to the TorC1 complex, thereby maintaining them in an inactive conformation (25Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T.

Interaction with Tap42 is required for the essential function of Sit4 and type 2A phosphatases.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nitrogen limitation or treating cells with rapamycin released the Tap42-phosphatase complexes from TorC1, thereby permitting the phosphatases they contained to become active (33Wang H. Wang X. Jiang Y. Interaction with Tap42 is required for the essential function of Sit4 and type 2A phosphatases.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, freed from TorC1, active Sit4 and PP2A phosphatases could dephosphorylate Gln3 and its negative regulator Ure2 resulting in their dissociation, nuclear import of dephosphorylated Gln3, and subsequent activation of NCR-sensitive transcription (14Beck T.

To better understand the occurrence of monkeypox virus (MPXV), an emerging Orthopoxvirus in humans, under contemporary and future climate conditions, we used ecological niche modeling techniques in conjunction with climate and remote-sensing variables. We first created spatially explicit probability distributions of its candidate reservoir species in Africa's Congo Basin. Reservoir species distributions were subsequently used to model current and projected future distributions of human monkeypox (MPX). Results indicate that forest clearing and climate are significant driving factors of the transmission of MPX from wildlife to humans under current climate conditions. Models under contemporary climate conditions performed well, as indicated by high values for the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), and tests on spatially randomly and non-randomly omitted test data. Future projections were made on IPCC 4th Assessment climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2080, ranging from more conservative to more aggressive, and representing the potential variation within which range shifts can be expected to occur. Future projections showed range shifts into regions where MPX has not been recorded previously. Increased suitability for MPX was predicted in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Models developed here are useful for identifying areas where environmental conditions may become more suitable for human MPX; targeting candidate reservoir species for future screening efforts; and prioritizing regions for future MPX surveillance efforts."

Affymetrix data from the JBR.10 adjuvant chemotherapy study were obtained from a public repository, normalised and mapped for CTAs.NY-ESO-1 was expressed in 50/199 (25%) samples. Expression of NY-ESO-1 in the NAC cohort was associated with significantly increased response rates (P = 0.03), but not overall survival. In the post-operative cohort, multivariate analyses identified NY-ESO-1 as an independent poor prognostic marker for those not treated with chemotherapy (HR 2.61, 95% CI 1.28-5.33; P = 0.008), whereas treatment with chemotherapy and expression of NY-ESO-1 was an independent predictor of improved survival (HR 0.267, 95% CI 0.07-0.980; P = 0.046). Similar findings for MAGE-A were seen, but did not meet statistical significance. Independent gene expression data from the JBR.10 dataset support these findings but were underpowered to demonstrate significant differences.

We reported previously that IL-4 induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase through an increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of IL-4-induced growth inhibition. In four of six human RCC cell lines, including Caki-1, A498, SNU482, and SNU228, IL-4 induced cellular senescence as demonstrated by enlarged and flattened morphology, increased granularity, and senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining. Signal tranducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and p38 MAPK were found to mediate IL-4-induced growth inhibition and cellular senescence. Both of these molecules were activated by 10 min after IL-4 treatment, and inhibition of their activity or expression prevented growth suppression and cellular senescence induced by IL-4. Inhibiting or silencing either STAT6 or p38 MAPK alone partially reduced the effect of IL-4, whereas inhibiting or silencing both molecules exerted an additive effect and almost completely abrogated the effect of IL-4. Thus STAT6 and p38 MAPK appeared to independently mediate IL-4-induced growth inhibition and cellular senescence. The p21WAF1/CIP1 up-regulation that accompanied growth inhibition and cellular senescence by IL-4 was also attenuated additively when p38 MAPK and STAT6 were silenced. Taken together, these results show that IL-4 induces cellular senescence through independent signaling pathways involving STAT6 and p38 MAPK in some human RCC cell lines. IL-4 can directly inhibit growth of several tumor cell types, but the molecular mechanism is not known. Results: IL-4 induces senescence by increasing p21WAF1/CIP1 expression through STAT6 and p38 MAPK. Conclusion: STAT6 and p38 MAPK play important roles in senescence induction by IL-4.

Because nonverbal emotional signals from the face and body are normally seen together, it is important to investigate the mechanism underlying the integration of emotional signals from these two sources. We conducted a study in which the time course of the integration of facial and bodily expressions was examined via analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) while the focus of attention was manipulated. Distinctive integrating features were found during multiple stages of processing. In the first stage, threatening information from the body was extracted automatically and rapidly, as evidenced by enhanced P1 amplitudes when the subjects viewed compound face-body images with fearful bodies compared with happy bodies. In the second stage, incongruency between emotional information from the face and the body was detected and captured by N2. Incongruent compound images elicited larger N2s than did congruent compound images. The focus of attention modulated the third stage of integration. When the subjects' attention was focused on the face, images with congruent emotional signals elicited larger P3s than did images with incongruent signals, suggesting more sustained attention and elaboration of congruent emotional information extracted from the face and body. On the other hand, when the subjects' attention was focused on the body, images with fearful bodies elicited larger P3s than did images with happy bodies, indicating more sustained attention and elaboration of threatening information from the body during evaluative processes."

These transporters are very attractive therapeutic targets in cancer. Elucidations of the functions and structures of MCTs is necessary for the development of effective medicine which targeting these proteins. However, in comparison with MCT1, there is little information on location of the function moiety of MCT4 and which constituent amino acids govern the transport function of MCT4. The aim of the present work was to determine the molecular mechanism of L-lactate transport via hMCT4.Transport of L-lactate via hMCT4 was determined by using hMCT4 cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes. hMCT4 mediated L-lactate uptake in oocytes was measured in the absence and presence of chemical modification agents and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonate (DIDS). In addition, L-lactate uptake was measured by hMCT4 arginine mutants. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed the localization of hMCT4.In hMCT4-expressing oocytes, treatment with phenylglyoxal (PGO), a compound specific for arginine residues, completely abolished the transport activity of hMCT4, although this abolishment was prevented by the presence of L-lactate. On the other hand, chemical modifications except for PGO treatment had no effect on the transport activity of hMCT4. The transporter has six conserved arginine residues, two in the transmembrane-spanning domains (TMDs) and four in the intracellular loops. In hMCT4-R278 mutants, the uptake of L-lactate is void of any transport activity without the alteration of hMCT4 localization.Our results suggest that Arg-278 in TMD8 is a critical residue involved in substrate, L-lactate recognition by hMCT4."
https://openalex.org/W2095703394,"Tropical volcanoes are an important but understudied ecosystem, and the relationships between plant species diversity and compositional change and elevation may differ from mountains created by uplift, because of their younger and more homogeneous soils. We sampled vegetation over an altitudinal gradient on Mt. Rinjani, Lombok, Indonesia. We modeled alpha- (plot) and beta- (among plot) diversity (Fisher's alpha), compositional change, and biomass against elevation and selected covariates. We also examined community phylogenetic structure across the elevational gradient. We recorded 902 trees and shrubs among 92 species, and 67 species of ground-cover plants. For understorey, subcanopy and canopy plants, an increase in elevation was associated with a decline in alpha-diversity, whereas data for ground-cover plants suggested a hump-shaped pattern. Elevation was consistently the most important factor in determining alpha-diversity for all components. The alpha-diversity of ground-cover vegetation was also negatively correlated with leaf area index, which suggests low light conditions in the understorey may limit diversity at lower elevations. Beta-diversity increased with elevation for ground-cover plants and declined at higher elevations for other components of the vegetation. However, statistical power was low and we could not resolve the relative importance to beta-diversity of different factors. Multivariate GLMs of variation in community composition among plots explained 67.05%, 27.63%, 18.24%, and 19.80% of the variation (deviance) for ground-cover, understorey, subcanopy and canopy plants, respectively, and demonstrated that elevation was a consistently important factor in determining community composition. Above-ground biomass showed no significant pattern with elevation and was also not significantly associated with alpha-diversity. At lower elevations communities had a random phylogenetic structure, but from 1600 m communities were phylogenetically clustered. This suggests a greater role of environmental filtering at higher elevations, and thus provides a possible explanation for the observed decline in diversity with elevation."

We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts, derived from Tm7sf2(+/+) and Tm7sf2(-/-) mice, to determine the in vitro effects of thapsigargin on NF-κB activation. Our results show that the Tm7sf2 gene controls the launch of the unfolded protein response and presides an anti-inflammatory loop thus its absence correlates with NF-κB activation and TNFα up-regulation. Our data also show that Tm7sf2 gene regulates liver X receptor activation and its absence inhibits LXR signalling. By expressing the hTm7sf2 gene in KO MEFs and observing a reduced NF-κB activation, we have confirmed that Tm7sf2 gene is linked to NF-κB activation. Finally we used genetically modified mice in an in vivo model of ER stress and of inflammation. Our results show a significant increase in renal TNFα expression after tunicamycin exposure and in the oedematogenic response in Tm7sf2(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we have shown that the Tm7sf2 gene, to date involved only in cholesterol biosynthesis, also controls an anti-inflammatory loop thereby confirming the existence of cross talk between metabolic pathways and inflammatory response."

We implemented the LabTrove blog system as a server process written in PHP, using a MySQL database to persist posts and other research objects. We incorporated a metadata framework that is both extensible and flexible while promoting consistency and structure where appropriate. Our experience thus far is that LabTrove is capable of providing a successful electronic laboratory recording system.LabTrove implements a one-item one-post system, which enables us to uniquely identify each element of the research record, such as data, samples, and protocols. This unique association between a post and a research element affords advantages for monitoring the use of materials and samples and for inspecting research processes. The combination of the one-item one-post system, consistent metadata, and full-text search provides us with a much more effective record than a paper notebook. The LabTrove approach provides a route towards reconciling the tensions and challenges that lie ahead in working towards the long-term goals for ELNs.

In this study, we have used mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as vehicles to deliver klks into the injured kidneys and have measured their therapeutic effect on experimental antibody induced nephritis and lupus nephritis. Human KLK-1 (hKLK1) gene was transduced into murine MSCs using a retroviral vector to generate a stable cell line, hKLK1-MSC, expressing high levels of hKLK1. 129/svj mice subjected to anti-GBM induced nephritis were transplanted with 10(6) hKLK1-MSCs and hKLK1 expression was confirmed in the kidneys. Compared with vector-MSCs injected mice, the hKLK1-MSCs treated mice showed significantly reduced proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and ameliorated renal pathology. Using the same strategy, we treated lupus-prone B6.Sle1.Sle3 bicongenic mice with hKLK1-MSCs and demonstrated that hKLK1-MSCs delivery also attenuated lupus nephritis. Mechanistically, hKLK1-MSCs reduced macrophage and T-lymphocyte infiltration into the kidney by suppressing the expression of inflammation cytokines. Moreover, hKLK1 transduced MSCs were more resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. These findings advance genetically modified MSCs as potential gene delivery tools for targeting therapeutic agents to the kidneys in order to modulate inflammation and oxidative stress in lupus nephritis."

Traditional training in surgery is based on learning by doing. Initially, the use of cadavers and animal models appeared to be a valid alternative for training. However, many conflicts with these training models prompted progression to synthetic and virtual reality models. Fifty volunteer fifth- and sixth-year medical students completed a pretest and were randomly allocated into two groups of 25 students each. The control group was exposed for 5 minutes to a standard text-based print article, while the test group used multimedia software describing how to fashion a rhomboid flap. Each group then performed a cutaneous flap on a training bench model while being evaluated by three blinded BSPS (Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery) board-certified surgeons using the OSATS (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill) protocol and answered a post-test. The text-based group was then tested again using the software. The computer-assisted learning (CAL) group had superior performance as confirmed by checklist scores (p<0.002), overall global assessment (p = 0.017) and post-test results (p<0.001). All participants ranked the multimedia method as the best study tool. CAL learners exhibited better subjective and objective performance when fashioning rhomboid flaps as compared to those taught with standard print material. These findings indicate that students preferred to learn using the multimedia method."

Here we aimed to characterize such effects and to test for and pharmacological means to alleviate a negative impact of hypoxia.Rat and human pancreatic islets were subjected to 5.5 h of hypoxia after which functional and viability parameters were measured subsequent to the hypoxic period and/or following a 22 h re-oxygenation period. Preconditioning with diazoxide or other agents was usually done during a 22 h period prior to hypoxia.Insulin contents decreased by 23% after 5.5 h of hypoxia and by 61% after a re-oxygenation period. Preconditioning with diazoxide time-dependently alleviated these hypoxia effects in rat and human islets. Hypoxia reduced proinsulin biosynthesis ((3)H-leucine incorporation into proinsulin) by 35%. Preconditioning counteracted this decrease by 91%. Preconditioning reduced hypoxia-induced necrosis by 40%, attenuated lowering of proteins of mitochondrial complexes I-IV and enhanced stimulation of HIF-1-alpha and phosphorylated AMPK proteins. Preconditioning by diazoxide was abolished by co-exposure to tolbutamide or elevated potassium (i.e. conditions which increase Ca(2+) inflow). Preconditioning with nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, partly reproduced effects of diazoxide. Both diazoxide and nifedipine moderately reduced basal glucose oxidation whereas glucose-induced oxygen consumption (tested with diazoxide) was unaffected. Preconditioning with diaxoxide enhanced insulin contents in transplants of rat islets to non-diabetic rats and lowered hyperglycemia vs. non-preconditioned islets in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Preconditioning of human islet transplants lowered hyperglycemia in streptozotocin-diabetic nude mice.1) Prior blocking of Ca(2+) inflow associates with lesser hypoxia-induced damage, 2) preconditioning affects basal mitochondrial metabolism and accelerates activation of hypoxia-reactive and potentially protective factors, 3) results indicate that preconditioning by K(+)-ATP-channel openers has therapeutic potential for islet transplantations."
https://openalex.org/W2048870243,"The present study aimed to determine the effects of breed and sex on growth patterns and metabolic features of advanced-pregnancy foetuses exposed to the same environmental conditions. Thus, at Day 62 of pregnancy, swine foetuses from an obese breed with leptin resistance (Iberian breed) were compared to lean crossbred foetuses (25% Large White ×25% Landrace ×50% Pietrain). There were differential developmental patterns in foetuses with leptin resistance, mainly a higher relative weight of the brain resembling “brain-sparing effect”. Prioritization of brain growth may be protective for the adequate growth and postnatal survival of the Iberian individuals, an ancient breed reared in extensive semi-feral conditions for centuries. There were also clear sex-related differences in foetal development and metabolism in the Iberian breed. Female Iberian foetuses were similar in size and weight to male littermates but had a significantly higher relative liver to body weight ratio resembling “liver-sparing effect” and a trend for a higher relative intestine to body ratio. Moreover, the availability of triglycerides, cholesterol and IL-6 in female Iberian foetuses was similar to that of lean crossbred foetuses. Overall, these features may favour a better postnatal survival and development of females, the sex more critical for the species survival. These findings set the basis for future translational studies aimed at increasing the knowledge on the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the early programming of the adult phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2159561237,"Some tropical plant species possess hollow structures (domatia) occupied by ants that protect the plant and in some cases also provide it with nutrients. Most plant-ants tend patches of chaetothyrialean fungi within domatia. In a few systems it has been shown that the ants manure the fungal patches and use them as a food source, indicating agricultural practices. However, the identity of these fungi has been investigated only in a few samples. To examine the specificity and constancy of ant-plant-fungus interactions we characterised the content of fungal patches in an extensive sampling of three ant-plant symbioses (Petalomyrmex phylax/Leonardoxa africana subsp. africana, Aphomomyrmex afer/Leonardoxa africana subsp. letouzeyi and Tetraponera aethiops/Barteria fistulosa) by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacers of ribosomal DNA. For each system the content of fungal patches was constant over individuals and populations. Each symbiosis was associated with a specific, dominant, primary fungal taxon, and to a lesser extent, with one or two specific secondary taxa, all of the order Chaetothyriales. A single fungal patch sometimes contained both a primary and a secondary taxon. In one system, two founding queens were found with the primary fungal taxon only, one that was shown in a previous study to be consumed preferentially. Because the different ant-plant symbioses studied have evolved independently, the high specificity and constancy we observed in the composition of the fungal patches have evolved repeatedly. Specificity and constancy also characterize other cases of agriculture by insects."
https://openalex.org/W1997100298,"The human pulmonary vasculature constricts in response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, with important consequences for homeostasis and adaptation. One function of these responses is to direct blood flow away from poorly-ventilated regions of the lung. In humans it is not known whether the stimuli of hypercapnia and hypoxia constrict the pulmonary blood vessels independently of each other or whether they act synergistically, such that the combination of hypercapnia and hypoxia is more effective than the sum of the responses to each stimulus on its own. We independently controlled the alveolar partial pressures of carbon dioxide (Paco 2) and oxygen (Pao 2) to examine their possible interaction on human pulmonary vasoconstriction. Nine volunteers each experienced sixteen possible combinations of four levels of Paco 2 (+6, +1, -4 and -9 mmHg, relative to baseline) with four levels of Pao 2 (175, 100, 75 and 50 mmHg). During each of these sixteen protocols Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate cardiac output and systolic tricuspid pressure gradient, an index of pulmonary vasoconstriction. The degree of constriction varied linearly with both Paco 2 and the calculated haemoglobin oxygen desaturation (1-So2). Mixed effects modelling delivered coefficients defining the interdependence of cardiac output, systolic tricuspid pressure gradient, ventilation, Paco 2 and So2. No interaction was observed in the effects on pulmonary vasoconstriction of carbon dioxide and oxygen (p>0.64). Direct effects of the alveolar gases on systolic tricuspid pressure gradient greatly exceeded indirect effects arising from concurrent changes in cardiac output."
https://openalex.org/W1999984910,"BRE is a multifunctional adapter protein involved in DNA repair, cell survival and stress response. To date, most studies of this protein have been focused in the tumor model. The role of BRE in stem cell biology has never been investigated. Therefore, we have used HUCPV progenitor cells to elucidate the function of BRE. HUCPV cells are multipotent fetal progenitor cells which possess the ability to differentiate into a multitude of mesenchymal cell lineages when chemically induced and can be more easily amplified in culture. In this study, we have established that BRE expression was normally expressed in HUCPV cells but become down-regulated when the cells were induced to differentiate. In addition, silencing BRE expression, using BRE-siRNAs, in HUCPV cells could accelerate induced chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Hence, we postulated that BRE played an important role in maintaining the stemness of HUCPV cells. We used microarray analysis to examine the transcriptome of BRE-silenced cells. BRE-silencing negatively regulated OCT4, FGF5 and FOXO1A. BRE-silencing also altered the expression of epigenetic genes and components of the TGF-β/BMP and FGF signaling pathways which are crucially involved in maintaining stem cell self-renewal. Comparative proteomic profiling also revealed that BRE-silencing resulted in decreased expressions of actin-binding proteins. In sum, we propose that BRE acts like an adaptor protein that promotes stemness and at the same time inhibits the differentiation of HUCPV cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029702560,"Streptococcus suis (S.suis) is an important emerging worldwide pig pathogen and zoonotic agent with rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance. In this study, we wanted to investigate the effect of licochalcone A on growth and properties of Streptococcus suis. The antimicrobial activity of licochalcone A was tested by growth inhibition assay and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) also were determined. The effect of licochalcone A on S.suis biofilm formation was characterized by crystal violet staining. The effect of licochalcone A on suilysin secretion was evaluated by titration of hemolytic activity. To understand the antimicrobial effect, gene expression profile of S.suis treated by licochalcone A was analyzed by DNA microarray. Our results demonstrated that licochalcone A showed antimicrobial activity on S.suis with MICs of 4 µg/ml for S.suis serotype 2 strains and 8 µg/ml for S.suis serotype 7 strains. Biofilm formation was inhibited by 30–40% in the presence of licochalcone A (3 µg/ml) and suilysin secretion was also significantly inhibited in the presence of licochalcone A (1.5 µg/ml). The gene expression profile of S.suis in the presence of licochalcone A showed that 132 genes were differentially regulated, and we analyzed the regulated genes in the aspect of the bacterial cell cycle control. Among the deregulated genes, the genes responsible for the mass doubling was increased expression, but the genes responsible for DNA replication and cell division were inhibited the expression. So, we think the regulation of the cell cycle genes might provide a mechanistic understanding of licochalcone A mediated antimicrobial effect against S.suis."
https://openalex.org/W1967381124,"Genetic variants of Y chromosome predispose to hypertension in rodents, whereas in humans the evidence is conflicting. Our purpose was to study the distribution of a panel of Y chromosome markers in a cohort from a cross-sectional population-based study on the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in Poland (WOBASZ study). The HindIII, YAP Y chromosome variants, previously shown to influence blood pressure, lipid traits or height, as well as SNPs defining main Y chromosome haplogroups, were typed in 3026, 2783 and 2652 samples, respectively. In addition, 4 subgroups (N∼100 each) representing extremes of LDL concentration or blood pressure (BP) were typed for a panel of 17 STRs. The HindIII and YAP polymorphism were not associated with any of the studied traits. Analysis of the haplogroup distribution showed an association between higher HDL level and hg I-M170 (P = 0.02), higher LDL level and hg F*(xI-M170, J2-M172, K-M9) (P = 0.03) and lower BMI and hg N3-Tat (P = 0.04). Analysis of STRs did not show statistically significant differences. Since all these associations lost statistical significance after Bonferroni correction, we conclude that a major role of Y chromosome genetic variation (defined by HindIII, YAP or main Y chromosome haplogroups) in determining cardiovascular risk in Poles is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2010128238,"Bioactive peptides and peptidomimetics play a pivotal role in the regulation of many biological processes such as cellular apoptosis, host defense, and biomineralization. In this work, we develop a novel structural matrix, Index of Natural and Non-natural Amino Acids (NNAAIndex), to systematically characterize a total of 155 physiochemical properties of 22 natural and 593 non-natural amino acids, followed by clustering the structural matrix into 6 representative property patterns including geometric characteristics, H-bond, connectivity, accessible surface area, integy moments index, and volume and shape. As a proof-of-principle, the NNAAIndex, combined with partial least squares regression or linear discriminant analysis, is used to develop different QSAR models for the design of new peptidomimetics using three different peptide datasets, i.e., 48 bitter-tasting dipeptides, 58 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and 20 inorganic-binding peptides. A comparative analysis with other QSAR techniques demonstrates that the NNAAIndex method offers a stable and predictive modeling technique for in silico large-scale design of natural and non-natural peptides with desirable bioactivities for a wide range of applications."
https://openalex.org/W2049018139,"Vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2 strains strongly divergent from the corresponding vaccine strain, Sabin 2, were repeatedly isolated from sewage in Slovakia over a period of 22 months in 2003–2005. Cell cultures of stool specimens from known immune deficient patients and from an identified putative source population of 500 people failed to identify the potential excretor(s) of the virus. The occurrence of VDPV in sewage stopped without any intervention. No paralytic cases were reported in Slovakia during the episode. According to a GenBank search and similarity plotting-analysis, the closest known relative of the first isolate PV2/03/SVK/E783 through all main sections of the genome was the type 2 poliovirus Sabin strain, with nucleotide identities in 5′UTR, P1, P2, P3, and 3′UTR parts of the genome of 88.6, 85.9, 87.3, 88.5, and 94.0 percent, respectively. Phenotypic properties of selected Slovakian aVDPV strains resembled those of VDPV strains isolated from immune deficient individuals with prolonged PV infection (iVDPV), including antigenic changes and moderate neurovirulence in the transgenic mouse model. One hundred and two unique VP1 coding sequences were determined from VDPV strains isolated from 34 sewage specimens. Nucleotide differences from Sabin 2 in the VP1 coding region ranged from 12.5 to 15.6 percent, and reached a maximum of 9.6 percent between the VDPV strains under study. Most of the nucleotide substitutions were synonymous but as many as 93 amino acid positions out of 301 in VP1 showed substitutions. We conclude that (1) individuals with prolonged poliovirus infection are not as rare as suggested by the studies on immune deficient patients known to the health care systems and (2) genetic divergence of VDPV strains may remain extensive during years long replication in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1980422807,"Many food plants accumulate oxalate, which humans absorb but do not metabolize, leading to the formation of urinary stones. The commensal bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes consumes oxalate by converting it to oxalyl-CoA, which is decarboxylated by oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (OXC). OXC and the class III CoA-transferase formyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase (FCOCT) are widespread among bacteria, including many that have no apparent ability to degrade or to resist external oxalate. The EvgA acid response regulator activates transcription of the Escherichia coli yfdXWUVE operon encoding YfdW (FCOCT), YfdU (OXC), and YfdE, a class III CoA-transferase that is 30% identical to YfdW. YfdW and YfdU are necessary and sufficient for oxalate-induced protection against a subsequent acid challenge; neither of the other genes has a known function. We report the purification, in vitro characterization, 2.1-Å crystal structure, and functional assignment of YfdE. YfdE and UctC, an orthologue from the obligate aerobe Acetobacter aceti, perform the reversible conversion of acetyl-CoA and oxalate to oxalyl-CoA and acetate. The annotation of YfdE as acetyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase (ACOCT) expands the scope of metabolic pathways linked to oxalate catabolism and the oxalate-induced acid tolerance response. FCOCT and ACOCT active sites contain distinctive, conserved active site loops (the glycine-rich loop and the GNxH loop, respectively) that appear to encode substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1992348091,"Hippocampal organotypic cultures are a highly reliable in vitro model for studying neuroplasticity: in this paper, we analyze the early phase of the transcriptional response induced by a 20 µM gabazine treatment (GabT), a GABA-Ar antagonist, by using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray, RT-PCR based time-course and chromatin-immuno-precipitation. The transcriptome profiling revealed that the pool of genes up-regulated by GabT, besides being strongly related to the regulation of growth and synaptic transmission, is also endowed with neuro-protective and pro-survival properties. By using RT-PCR, we quantified a time-course of the transient expression for 33 of the highest up-regulated genes, with an average sampling rate of 10 minutes and covering the time interval [10∶90] minutes. The cluster analysis of the time-course disclosed the existence of three different dynamical patterns, one of which proved, in a statistical analysis based on results from previous works, to be significantly related with SRF-dependent regulation (p-value<0.05). The chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assay confirmed the rich presence of working CArG boxes in the genes belonging to the latter dynamical pattern and therefore validated the statistical analysis. Furthermore, an in silico analysis of the promoters revealed the presence of additional conserved CArG boxes upstream of the genes Nr4a1 and Rgs2. The chip assay confirmed a significant SRF signal in the Nr4a1 CArG box but not in the Rgs2 CArG box."
https://openalex.org/W2038073379,"Objective The goal of this study was to examine specific factors placing young (aged <30) women who inject drugs at higher risk for HIV, and to establish the need for targeted interventions within this population. Methods A national cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in 2004–2005 in six regions in Poland. A snowball sample of ever-injectors was recruited from drug treatment facilities and the surrounding community. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs). Results A total of 491 injection drug users younger than 30 were recruited, of whom 159 were women and 332 were men. The prevalence of HIV was 16.4% and 9.6% among women and men, respectively. In multivariate analysis, young female injectors whose education terminated at the primary level were more likely to be HIV-positive compared to males with a similar level of education (PR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.86–6.00) and more highly educated women (PR = 4.16, 95% CI = 2.21–7.82). Conclusions This study confirms an elevated risk of HIV among under-educated young women. Suggestions for specific interventions to reduce HIV transmission are presented. Additional research is needed to quantify the differential distribution of risk behaviors which amplify their likelihood of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1969721628,"The role of preexisting minority drug-resistance mutations in treatment failure has not been fully understood in chronic hepatitis B patients. To understand mechanisms of drug resistance, we analyzed drug-resistance mutations in 46 treatment-failure patients and in 29 treatment-naïve patients and determined linkage patterns of the drug-resistance mutations in individual viral genomes using a highly sensitive parallel allele-specific sequencing (PASS) method. Lamivudine resistance (LAMr) mutations were predominant in treatment-failure patients, irrespective of the inclusion of LAM in the regimen. The primary LAMr mutations M204V and M204I were detected in 100% and 30% of the treatment-failure patients, respectively. Two secondary LAMr mutations (L180M and V173L) were also found in most treatment-failure patients (87% and 78%, respectively). The linkages containing these three mutations dominated the resistant viruses. Importantly, minority LAMr mutations present in <2% of the viral population were detected in 83% of the treatment-naïve patients. Moreover, the low-frequency same linked LAMr mutations (<0.15%) were detected in 24% of the treatment-naïve patients. Our results demonstrate that the selection of preexisting minority linked LAMr mutations may be an important mechanism for the rapid development of LAM resistance, caution the continuous use of LAM to treat drug-experienced and -naïve hepatitis B patients, and underline the importance of the detection of minority single and linked drug-resistance mutations before initiating antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1970050444,"Barmah Forest virus (BFV) is a mosquito borne (+) ssRNA alphavirus found only in Australia. It causes rash, myalgia and arthralgia in humans and is usually diagnosed serologically. We developed a real-time PCR assay to detect BFV in an effort to improve diagnosis early in the course of infection. The limit of detection was 16 genome equivalents with a specificity of 100%. Fifty five serum samples from BFV-infected patients were tested by the PCR. 52 of 53 antibody-positive samples were PCR negative. Two culture-positive (neutralizing antibody negative) samples were positive on first round PCR, while one sample (IgM and neutralizing antibody strongly positive, IgG negative) was positive on second round PCR, suggesting that viral RNA is detectable and transiently present in early infection. PCR can provide results faster than culture, is capable of high throughput and by sequencing the PCR product strain variants can be characterized."
