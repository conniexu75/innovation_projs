In this report we demonstrate that VEGF or a mutant, selectively binding to the Flk-1/KDR receptor, displayed high levels of survival activity, whereas Flt-1-specific ligands failed to promote survival of serum-starved primary human endothelial cells. This activity was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-kinase)-specific inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Endothelial cells cultured in the presence of VEGF and the Flk-1/KDR-selective VEGF mutant induced phosphorylation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner. Akt activation was not detected in response to stimulation with placenta growth factor or an Flt-1-selective VEGF mutant. Furthermore, a constitutively active Akt was sufficient to promote survival of serum-starved endothelial cells in transient transfection experiments. In contrast, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Akt blocked the survival effect of VEGF. These findings identify the Flk-1/KDR receptor and the PI3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway as crucial elements in the processes leading to endothelial cell survival induced by VEGF. Inhibition of apoptosis may represent a major aspect of the regulatory activity of VEGF on the vascular endothelium.

Angiogenesis and vascular remodeling occur throughout growth and development and involve both proliferation and regression of vascular endothelial cells. Although extensive research has been dedicated to the elucidation of the factors that induce endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation (for review, see Refs. 1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar, 2Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar), surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that regulate regression of blood vessels. Rapid degeneration of vascular structures occurs under various physiological or pathological circumstances. Apoptosis of endothelial cells probably contributes to the maturation of vascular granulation tissue into avascular scar tissue (3Robbins S.L. Angel M. Kumar V. Basic Pathology. Igaku-Shoijn/Saunders, Tokyo1981: 51-53Google Scholar) and to the pruning of retinal vessels during development (4Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Apoptosis-like changes in endothelial cells have been also observed in the involuting corpus luteum, breast (5Walker N.I. Bennett R.E. Kerr J.F. Am. J. Anat. 1989; 185: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), parotid glands undergoing pressure atrophy (6Walker N.I. Gobe G.C. J. Pathol. 1987; 153: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and fibrotic lung lesions (7Polunovsky V.A. Chen B. Henke C. Snover D. Wendt C. Ingbar D.H. Bitterman P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, experiments designed to study blood vessel regression in vivo have not been very successful so far at detecting apoptotic endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. This may be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis tend to lose their attachment to the basement membrane. In addition, apoptotic endothelial cell may become the target of the immune system and thus are eliminated by phagocytes as soon as they manifest early signs of apoptosis (8Augustin H.G. Braun K. Telemenakis I. Modlich U. Kuhn W. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 339-351PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro, apoptosis often follows withdrawal of a critical trophic factor. Accordingly, human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE)1 cells undergo apoptosis after loss of adhesion or serum deprivation (9Araki S. Shimada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Meredeth J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor and phorbol esters reduce the apoptosis of serum-deprived HUVE cells (11Araki S. Simada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and heat shock and endotoxin act together to increase apoptosis in porcine endothelial cells (12Buchman T.G. Abello P.A. Smith E.H. Bulkley G.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H165-H170PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the survival signal mediated by various growth factors and cytokines may be dependent on the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt signal transduction pathway (13Minshall C. Arkins S. Freund G.G. Kelley K.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 15Yao R.

However, not all survival signals require PI3-kinase activity, and Akt (also referred as protein kinase Bα or Racα)-independent survival pathways exist (20Borasio G.D. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1088-1092Google Scholar, 21Nobes C.D. Reppas J.B. Markus A. Tolkovsky A.M. Neuroscience. 1996; 70: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Xia Z. Dickens J. Raingeaud R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can induce PI3-kinase activity in a variety of endothelial cell (23Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 24Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15099-15103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), but so far a specific biological function of PI3-kinase in endothelial cells has not been demonstrated. The endothelial cell-specific mitogen VEGF has been shown to be a key positive regulator of normal and abnormal angiogenesis (2Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 26Mustonen T. Alitalo K. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The critical role of VEGF in the development of the vascular system is emphasized by embryonic lethality after loss of a single VEGF allele. A growing body of evidence indicates that VEGF may also act as a survival factor for newly formed blood vessels. In the developing retina, vascular regression in response to hyperoxia has been correlated with inhibition of VEGF release by glial cells (4Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies results in regression of already established tumor-associated vasculature in xenograft models (27Yuan F. Chen Y. Dellian M. Safabakhsh N. Ferrara N. Jain R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14765-14770Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). More recently, using a tetracycline-regulated VEGF expression system in xenografted C6 glioma cells, it has been shown that decreased levels of VEGF production lead to detachment of endothelial cells from the walls of preformed vessels in the tumor, and detached apoptotic endothelial cells were identified by means of double staining for Van Willebrand factor and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling staining (28Benjamin L.E. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). VEGF exerts its biological effects by binding to its respective transmembrane receptors VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1) and VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1/KDR), both of which are expressed on endothelial cells specifically and contain a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. Knockout studies in mice revealed that both receptors are essential for the development of the embryonic vasculature, and mouse embryos null for either receptor died in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5 (29Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar,30Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF demonstrated that VEGF induces phosphorylation of a variety of proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, p190-rhoGAP, p62, phospholipase C-γ, the oncogenic adaptor protein NcK, p125 focal adhesion kinase, paxilin, and several others (23, 31–37; for review, see Ref. 38Merenmies J. Parada L.F. Henkemeyer M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). Strong experimental evidence links Flk-1/KDR activation to VEGF-induced mitogenesis and angiogenesis (2Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). In contrast, the maintenance and survival function of VEGF has been associated with the Flt-1 receptor, because the Flt-1 mRNA is highly expressed in quiescent endothelium (39Peters K.G. De Vries C. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), whereas Flk-1/KDR is primarily expressed in proliferating vessels (40Quinn T.P. Peters K.G. De Vries C. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7533-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the survival role of VEGF in HUVE cells cultured in serum-free conditions. We found that VEGF potently prevents apoptosis and promotes survival in this system. Using several approaches, we demonstrate the critical role of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway in such effects. We also show that Flk-1/KDR, not Flt-1, is the primary mediator of such a signal. Primary cultures of HUVE cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA). Wortmannin and dimethylsulfoxide were purchased from Sigma. ZVAD-fmk was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Cytomegalovirus-luciferase was purchased from Promega, and pGREEN LANTERN was from Life Technologies, Inc.. The KDR receptor-selective VEGF165 mutant D63A, E64A, E67A has been previously described (41Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The triple mutant R82E, K84E, H86E is a derivative of the Flt-1-selective R82A, K84A, H86A VEGF mutant (41Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), with ∼10-fold higher selectivity, which results in an overall 1000-fold selective binding of Flt-1 over KDR. Wild-type recombinant human (rh) VEGF165 and receptor-selective VEGF mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously. The endotoxin content of the final purified material did not exceed 0.3 endotoxin units/mg of protein. rhPlGF152 was expressed and purified as described previously (42Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were quantified by amino acid analysis. Medium 199 was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. CS-C medium was from Cell Systems. EB medium was from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Flag-Akt179 was generated by mutation of the lysine 179, which is critical for ATP binding to alanine, which resulted in a kinase death Akt construct (43Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Flag-Akt 2D was generated by mutating threonine 308 and serene 473 to asparagine, which results in a constitutively active Akt form (44Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). PlGF used in the Akt phosphorylation assay was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc (Minneapolis, MN). HUVE cells were maintained in CS-C complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and mitogens, according to the instructions of the supplier (Cell Systems). Twenty-four hours before serum starvation, cells were trypsinized and plated to a density of 20–25 × 103 cells/cm2 in 10- or 6-cm dishes for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and in 6-cm dishes for biolistic transfection experiments. Immediately before the experiment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For serum starvation, CS-C medium without serum and without mitogen, complemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, was added during the indicated length of time. After biolostic transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in medium containing 10% serum. After washing the cells twice with Tris-buffered saline, minimum medium (without mitogen and serum) was added, and the levels of apoptosis were analyzed 9 h after induction of serum starvation. For survival assays, HUVE cells were seeded at the density of 2 × 104 cells per well in 48-multiwell plates in the presence of EB medium plus 10% FBS in 0.5 ml of M199 medium containing 10% serum. After 8–12 h, cells were washed twice with serum-free M199, and cells were incubated in serum-free M199 complemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, with or without growth factors. After 4 or 5 days, 25 μl of alamar blue was added to each well. After a 2-h incubation time, plates were read at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Alternatively, cells were dissociated by exposure to trypsin, and the cell number was determined. Gene transfer was performed using the Bio-Rad 500 optimization kit in the Biolistic PDS-1000/He* particle delivery system (Bio-Rad). In a series of pilot experiments using luciferase reporter gene DNA, parameters were established to achieve the highest levels of luciferase activity in primary HUVE cell cultures (data not shown): particle size, 1.6 μm; rupture disc, 1100 p.s.i. bombardment chamber vacuum, 25 mm Hg; the microcarrier launch assembly was positioned in shelf position 1, the target shelf was at position 3 (from the top). Gold particles were prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations and stored as 50-μl aliquots for 3–4 months at −20 °C. Aliquots were coated with DNA immediately before gene transfer following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, for five samples, a 50-μl aliquot of gold particles was vortexed for 3 min. and 15 μl of plasmid DNA (1 mg/ml) was added. Vortexing was continued for 2 min. Thereafter, 50 μl of 2.5 mCaCl2 solution was added to the mix. After 2 min of additional vortexing, 20 μl of a freshly prepared 0.1 mspermidine solution was added, followed by 2 min of constant vortexing. The mixture was allowed to settle for 1 min before tubes were centrifuged for 5 s in a table-top microcentrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the gold pellet was washed first with 140 μl of 70% ethanol followed by 140 μl of 100% ethanol. After removing the supernatant, the gold particles were taken up in 55 μl of 100% ethanol, and 10 μl was used per biolistic transfection. Immediately after bombardment, 5 ml of complemented medium was added. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, cells were stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and by the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI). Cells negative for both PI and annexin V staining are live cells; PI-negative, annexin V-positive staining cells are early apoptotic cells; PI-positive, annexin V-positive staining cells are primarily cells in a late stage of apoptosis (45Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Ruppert S. Donahue C.J. Moore A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12687-12690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Cells of one 6- or 10-cm dish were harvested and incubated on ice in annexin- and PI-containing binding buffer for 10 min and further processed as described previously (46Moore A. Donahue C. Bauer K.D. Mather J.P. Mather J.P. Barnes D. Methods in Cell Biology. 37. Academic Press Ltd, London1998: 265-279Google Scholar). Time lapse video recording was done with an Optronics DEI-470T charge-coupled device video camera hooked up to a Panasonic AG-6730 time lapse cassette recorder and a Nikon Diaphot-300 inverted microscope at a magnification of 20×. The graphics program Adobe Photoshop 4.0 was used to generate the picture. HUVE cells were grown essentially as described in cell culture. Cells were split to a density of 14 × 103 cells/cm2 24 h before start of serum starvation. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and 5 ml of CS medium without serum and mitogen (Cell Systems), complemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, was added. 18–20 h after start of serum starvation, cells were washed with PBS, and 5 ml of fresh starvation medium was added, containing wortmannin (30 nm) where indicated. 2–3 h later, growth factors were added at the indicated amounts, and incubation occurred for 15 min in a tissue culture incubator before lysing the cells with 100 μl of SDS gel loading buffer. For detection of the levels of Akt phosphorylation, whole-cell extracts were treated essentially as described in the instruction manual included in the PhophoPlus Akt (Ser473) antibody kit (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Blocking of the membrane was done by incubation overnight at 4 °C; incubation with the phospho-specific Akt (Ser473) antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG, affinity purified) occurred at room temperature for 3 h; and the incubation with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) was for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The chemiluminescent detection was provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To investigate the survival activity of VEGF relative to that of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which was previously found to be a survival factor for endothelial cells (11Araki S. Simada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we incubated HUVE cells in serum-free medium in the presence of VEGF (100 ng/ml) or bFGF (100 ng/ml). Control cells were cultured in the presence of 10% serum, which stimulated proliferation. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, the number of cells decreased significantly after 24 h of serum starvation, whereas cell numbers remained relatively constant over 48 h of incubation in the presence of VEGF or bFGF. These findings indicated that VEGF can induce a survival response in HUVE cells to similar levels as bFGF. In the absence of VEGF, extensive membrane blebbing, loss of contacts with neighboring cells, shrinking of the cytoplasm, disintegration into small vesicles, also called apoptotic bodies, and ultimately detachment of cells from the culture dish were observed by means of time lapse video recording (Fig. 1 B). These features are indicative of apoptotic cell death. Under such conditions, we did not observe any obvious morphological differences between VEGF-treated cells and cells exposed to 10% serum (data not shown). To determine whether the endothelial cell loss was a consequence of apoptotic cell death, we analyzed HUVE cells for binding to annexin V, which serves as a marker for early apoptosis (46Moore A. Donahue C. Bauer K.D. Mather J.P. Mather J.P. Barnes D. Methods in Cell Biology. 37. Academic Press Ltd, London1998: 265-279Google Scholar). As early as 16 h after growth factor removal, we observed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic, annexin V-positive cells, which continued over time, and after 48 h, 50–80% of the cells had undergone apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2 B and data not shown).Figure 2VEGF is a survival factor for primary HUVE cells in culture. A, HUVE cells were grown for 24 h in the presence of 10% serum and rhVEGF165 was added immediately after changing to serum-free conditions. Apoptotic cell death was determined after 24 h by flow cytometry for annexin V and propidium iodide, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars represent means ± S.E. of two independent experiments conducted with different preparations of endothelial cells.B, HUVE cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of the indicated amounts of rhVEGF165 or PlGF. Apoptotic cell death was determined as described above. C, After 8–12 h in serum-containing media, HUVE cells were washed twice and incubated in 0% serum in the presence of rhVEGF165 (100 ng/ml), Flt-1-sel (100 ng/ml), which is an Flt-1-selective mutant VEGF165 form, or KDR-sel (100 ng/ml), which binds Flk-1/KDR 100-fold more selective than VEGF (for descriptions see “Materials” under “Experimental Procedures”). The relative number of cells was quantified after 4 days in culture by alamar blue staining, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Error bars represent the S.E. of triplicate analysis of one representative experiment.D, HUVE cells were cultured for 36–48 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of VEGF, PlGF, and the receptor-selective mutant VEGF forms Flt-1-sel and KDR-sel. The number of apoptotic cells was determined as described in A. Data points represent the average of three independent experiments with different HUVE cell preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the observed induction of endothelial cell apoptosis was mediated by the universal cell death machinery, we added ZVAD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspases I (interleukin-1 β-converting enzyme) (ICE) and 3 (CPP32) (48Milligan C.E. Prevette D. Yaginuma H. Homma S. Cardwell C. Fritz L.C. Tomasselli K.J. Oppenheim R.W. Schwartz L.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 385-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) to HUVE cells. Apoptosis induced by serum starvation was completely blocked after 24 h by ZVAD-fmk at concentrations as low as 2 μm. These findings indicated that endothelial cells grown in culture underwent caspase-dependent, programmed cell death on serum withdrawal. VEGF reduced the serum starvation-induced apoptosis of HUVE cell with a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with a maximal effect between 10 and 100 ng/ml (Fig. 2 A). Higher concentrations resulted in lower reduction of apoptosis. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells responded at even lower VEGF levels (0.3 ng/ml; data not shown). Similar bell-shaped dose-response curves in response to VEGF in cell-based assays have been reported before (49Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although the cause of this effect is not entirely clear, a current thought is that a vast excess of ligand over receptor results in a reduced effectiveness of receptor dimerization and signaling, such that an increasing number of receptors remain in a monomeric form after ligand binding. However, the percentage of apoptotic cells detected in the presence of 10% serum was usually lower compared with cells grown in the presence of VEGF, at all concentrations tested, suggesting that additional factors present in the serum render the cells more resistant to apoptosis (9Araki S. Shimada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Whether this is a consequence of increased survival activity or is attributable to the ongoing proliferation, or both, remains to be analyzed. We next attempted to determine the role of the two VEGF receptors in mediating the survival activity induced by VEGF. We first tested placenta growth factor (PlGF), a member of the VEGF family of proteins, which binds Flt-1 with high affinity but fails to bind Flk-1/KDR. Previous studies have shown that PlGF induces little or no mitogenic activity on HUVE cells, nor does it induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt-1 (42Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our survival assay, PlGF did not reduce the number of apoptotic HUVE cells at all concentrations tested, as assessed by binding to annexin V (Fig. 2, B and D) or alamar blue staining of cells (Fig. 2 C). To further confirm these findings, we tested receptor-selective VEGF mutants, which bind preferentially to either one of the VEGF receptors, KDR/Flk or Flt-1, respectively. Previous studies have shown that mutants defective in KDR binding lack the ability to induce proliferation, whereas Flt-1 binding-deficient mutants are effective mitogens (41Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We found that the KDR-selective VEGF165 mutant (KDR-sel) exerted a similar survival activity as wild-type VEGF in the 4-day survival assay. However, we could not detect any significant survival effect by the Flt-sel mutant (Fig. 2 C). In agreement with these findings, neither PlGF nor the Flt-sel VEGF mutant led to a reduction in the amount of apoptotic HUVE cells after 36–48 h, as assessed by annexin V binding (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, the KDR-sel mutant was as potent as wild-type VEGF165. From these findings we conclude that activation of Flk-1/KDR is necessary to mediate the survival-promoting activity of VEGF. The PI3-kinase-specific inhibitor wortmannin is known to block the protective action of nerve growth factor (50Gagliardini V. Fernandez P.A. Lee R.K.K. Drexler H.C.A. Rotello R.J. Fishman M.C. Yuan J. Science. 1994; 263: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor in serum-deprived PC12 cells (14Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). These findings implicated an important role of the PI3-kinase pathway in apoptosis prevention by growth factors. To examine the involvement of PI3-kinase in VEGF-mediated protection, we incubated HUVE cells with the two specific inhibitors of PI3-kinase, wortmannin and the structurally unrelated synthetic compound LY294002 (51Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As assessed by the numbers of apoptotic cells, wortmannin (30 nm) and LY294002 (100 nm) almost completely blocked the protective effect of VEGF (Fig. 3, A and B). Both agents slightly enhanced the degree of apoptosis observed in the absence of VEGF, possibly resulting from the inhibition of basal PI3-kinase activity present in serum-starved cells, similarly to what has been observed in other systems (16Dudek H.

We describe use of a convenient “dot-blot” approach to screen 10 different PH domains for those that recognize particular phosphoinositides. Each PH domain bound phosphoinositides in the assay, but only two (from phospholipase C-δ1and Grp1) showed clear specificity for a single species. Using soluble inositol phosphates, we show that the Grp1 PH domain (originally cloned on the basis of its phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) binding) binds specifically tod-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) (the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3headgroup) with K D = 27.3 nm, but bindsd-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) or d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) over 80-fold more weakly. We show that this specificity allows localization of the Grp1 PH domain to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells only when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) is activated. The presence of three adjacent equatorial phosphate groups was critical for inositol phosphate binding by the Grp1 PH domain. By contrast, another PH domain capable of PI 3-K-dependent membrane recruitment (encoded by EST684797) does not distinguish Ins(1,3,4)P3 from Ins(1,3,4,5)P3 (binding both with very high affinity), despite selecting strongly against Ins(1,4,5)P3. The remaining PH domains tested appear significantly less specific for particular phosphoinositides. Together with data presented in the literature, our results suggest that many PH domains bind similarly to multiple phosphoinositides (and in some cases phosphatidylserine), and are likely to be regulated in vivo by the most abundant species to which they bind. Thus, using the same simple approach to study several PH domains simultaneously, our studies suggest that highly specific phosphoinositide binding is a characteristic of relatively few cases.

This finding was subsequently extended to other PH domains, most notably that from phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1), which binds with high affinity and stereospecificity to both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and its soluble headgroup, D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Recent studies have further demonstrated that some PH domains bind specifically to products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-Ks), and that this binding is important in coupling PI 3-K activation (activated by nearly all known cell surface receptors) to downstream signaling events (17Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This has been most well studied for the PH domain of protein kinase B (PKB), also known as Akt and RAC (18Downward J.

PKB is activated upon treatment of cells with insulin or platelet-derived growth factor in a manner that requires both its N-terminal PH domain and PI 3-K activation (22Franke T.F. Yang S.-I.

Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 bind similarly to PKB or its isolated PH domain (24James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R.

PKB is thought to be targeted to the plasma membrane in a signal-dependent manner by binding of its PH domain to PI 3-K products (26Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C.

Once recruited to the plasma membrane, PKB is phosphorylated by other PH domain-containing kinases, notably PDK1 (also regulated by PI 3-K), and becomes activated (19Alessi D.R. Cohen P Curr. Opin.

Each has the same basic architecture, with a core β-sandwich closed off at one splayed corner by an amphipathic C-terminal α-helix, and at the other splayed corner by three interstrand loops. These three loops are the most variable in length and sequence between different PH domains, and lie on a positively charged face of each electrostatically polarized domain (49Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) PH domains bound to Ins(1,4,5)P3 (K D values are 0.21 and 40 μm, respectively) show that Ins(1,4,5)P3 binds largely to variable loops on the positively charged face of these PH domains. Among the major unresolved questions concerning PH domain function are: (a) whether all PH domains bind to phosphoinositides, and (b) whether different PH domains specifically recognize distinct phosphoinositides. Since PI 3-K products are much less abundant than PtdIns(4,5)P2 even in activated cells (51Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), their role in PH domain-mediated signal-dependent membrane recruitment requires that they bind to PH domains much more strongly than do PtdIns(4,5)P2 or other constitutively present membrane phospholipids. We describe a straightforward qualitative blotting approach that can be used for a rapid first analysis of phospholipid-binding specificity by PH domains. We use the approach here to screen 10 different PH domains for those capable of selective phosphoinositide recognition. Although all of the PH domains tested were found to bind phosphoinositides in this assay, few showed strong headgroup specificity, including those from PLCδ1, Akt/PKB, and Grp1. For the PLCδ1 and Akt/PKB PH domains, the specificity indicated by the dot-blot assay agrees with previously reported solution studies (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For the Grp1 PH domain, we describe detailed studies of inositol phosphate-binding specificity. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (the headgroup of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) binds the Grp1 PH domain with a K D of 27 nm, in a highly specific interaction that is sufficient for PI 3-K-dependent plasma membrane recruitment of the PH domain in mammalian cells. Another PH domain that is specifically recruited to the membrane by PI 3-K products (encoded by EST684797; Ref. 52Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) was found to bind Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 with a similar affinity. However, unlike the Grp1 PH domain, this PH domain did not distinguish between Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,3,4)P3, despite selecting strongly against Ins(1,4,5)P3. By contrast with these examples, most of the PH domains tested appeared quite promiscuous in their phosphoinositide binding according to the dot-blot assay. This finding is supported by solution studies presented in the literature for several cases (30Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P.

We therefore suggest that highly specific phosphoinositide recognition may be a characteristic of only relatively few PH domains. Those that bind several phosphoinositides with similar affinities are likely to be regulated in vivoby the most abundant species to which they bind. In some cases, the PH domain may provide only a general attraction for the membrane surface that cooperates with a specific regulated interaction mediated by other regions of the host molecule. All inositol phosphates are named as the d-myo isomer unless otherwise stated. Ins(1,3,4)P3, Ins(1,2,6)P3, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, as well as synthetic dipalmitoyl PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3were purchased from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(3,5,6)P3 (equivalent tol-myo-Ins(1,4,5)P3), Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,2,5,6)P4, PtdSer, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, were purchased from Sigma. PtdIns and PtdCho were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Ins(1,5,6)P3, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, and InsP6 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).3H-Labeled Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was from NEN Life Science Products. The coding region for each PH domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the relevant cDNA clone, incorporating a BamHI site at the end corresponding to the N terminus and either an EcoRI orBamHI site at the opposite end. Appropriately digested polymerase chain reaction products were then subcloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the BamHI site orBamHI/EcoRI sites. The identity of each insert was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. GST-PH fusions were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 and purified using glutathione-agarose as described (54Ausubel F.M.

Proteins were labeled with 32P while bound to glutathione-agarose. For solution studies of inositol phosphate and phosphoinositide binding, PH domains were subcloned between the NdeI and BamHI site of the T7 expression vector pET11a (Novagen), and produced exactly as described previously for PLCδ-PH (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Concentrations of purified protein were determined using A 280, for which extinction coefficients were measured by quantitative amino acid analysis of samples with known absorbance. pGEX-2TK-encoded GST-PH fusions were labeled with 32P essentially as described (55Margolis B.

Approximately 10 μg of purified GST-PH fusion (on beads) was incubated with 0.75 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products; NEG-035C) and 10–20 units of protein kinase A (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.15, containing 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaF, and 4.5 mm DTT, in a reaction volume of 75 μl. Beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and32P-labeled GST-PH fusion protein was eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione in PBS. Eluted32P-labeled protein was filtered (0.22 μm) prior to use in the dot-blot assay. Phosphoinositides at 2 mg/ml in 1:1 chloroform:methanol (containing 0.1% HCl) were spotted (2 μl) onto nitrocellulose (MSI) in the pattern shown in Fig. 1. After drying, nitrocellulose was blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin but no detergent.32P-Labeled GST-PH fusion protein was then added to TBS/3% bovine serum albumin at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, and this solution was used to probe the phosphoinositide-containing nitrocellulose for 30 min at room temperature. Filters were washed five times with TBS (without detergent), dried, and bound radioactivity was visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). ITC experiments employed the MCS ITC instrument (57Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar) from MicroCal (Northampton, MA). PH domain or inositol phosphate was placed in the calorimeter cell (1.39 ml) at the noted concentration, and sequential aliquots (10–16 μl) of the relevant inositol phosphate or protein were injected, under computer control, to cover a range of InsPn:PH molar ratios of 0:1 to 3:1. PH domain was dialyzed exhaustively into 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT prior to the experiment, and all inositol phosphate solutions were generated by dilution of a 10 mm stock solution (in water) into this buffer. Control experiments for heats of dilution of inositol phosphate or protein into buffer and for buffer into PH domain or inositol phosphate were performed in separate titrations, and data were corrected accordingly. Data were analyzed and fit using the ORIGIN software (MicroCal) supplied with the instrument, allowing stoichiometry (n), ΔH, and K B (binding constant) to float in fitting to a single class of sites. The ability of a series of different inositol phosphates to compete with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 for binding to Grp1-PH was assessed using a spin-column binding assay. The specified molar excesses of unlabeled competitor were included in 35-μl samples (final volume) that contained a 1:1 Ins(1,3,4,5)P4:Grp1-PH complex at 5 μm (final concentration), plus 10 nCi (14 nm) of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (NEN Life Science Products; 21 Ci/mmol). To assess the degree of competition, samples were applied to a 1-ml Bio-Gel-P6 (Bio-Rad) spin-column, and spun at 900 × g to allow >95% of the protein to pass through. The number of (bound) counts in the flow-through was determined for each sample by scintillation counting, and this value was plotted as the percentage of maximal binding (in the absence of competitor) against the molar excess of competitor (Fig. 3). The resulting competition curves were fit (with IC50 as the fitted parameter) in ORIGIN (MicroCal) to an isotope dilution model of the form: %comp = {%0 × [IC50/(C + IC50)]} + %∞. In this equation, %comp is the number of counts bound in the presence of competitor at a concentration,C (expressed as a molar excess over the Grp1-PH·Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 complex); %0 is the number of counts bound in the absence of competitor; %∞is the number of residual counts remaining at high excess of competitor (unlabeled Ins(1,3,4,5)P4); and IC50 is the molar excess of competitor required to reduce %comp to half its initial value. IC50 for unlabeled Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was 3-fold in the best fit. Relative affinities of other InsPn tested were then estimated as [(IC50InsPn/3) × 0.027 μm]. All experiments were performed in 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The Grp1 PH domain was subcloned between the BglII and EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) for expression of an EGFP-PH domain fusion protein in mammalian cells. Vectors directing the expression of a hemagglutinin-tagged constitutively active (farnesylated using the signal from c-Ha-Ras) form of the PI 3-K catalytic subunit (p110β) and its kinase-inactive mutant (D919A/D937E), and their effects on phosphoinositide metabolism in HeLa cells, have been described (58Logan S.K.

In both cases, the drugs bind together with NAD at the active site, and resistant enzymes arise from mutations that alter the residues that form the NADH binding pocket (10Rozwarski D. Grant G.

The recent work identifying enoyl-ACP reductase as the target for these therapeutic agents has stimulated research into developing a second generation of antibacterial drugs that inhibit FabI and bacterial fatty acid synthesis. 2-Hydroxydiphenyl ethers are a class of compounds that exhibit broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (Fig. 1). Many of these compounds were initially used in the treatment of textiles, and there have been hundreds of patents filed worldwide for their incorporation into a diverse range of products over the last 30 years. Triclosan (VI) is the most potent and widely used member of this class in contemporary consumer products as a microbicide. For example, triclosan is a component of deodorant soaps, dermatological and topical preparations for skin, oral rinses, toothpastes, and is even incorporated into the plastics of children's toys (12Bhargava H.N. Leonard P.A. Am. J. Infect. Control. 1996; 24: 209-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Triclosan has long been thought to disrupt the cell membrane, rendering bacteria unable to assimilate nutrients and proliferate (13Vischer W.A. Regös J. Zentbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt Orig. A. 1974; 226: 376-389Google Scholar, 14Regös J. Hitz H.R. Zentbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt Orig. A. 1974; 226: 390-401Google Scholar, 15Regös J. Zak O. Solf R. Vischer W.A. Weirich E.G. Dermatologica. 1979; 158: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This view of triclosan acting as a nonspecific biocide has provided the rationale for its use in consumer products and predicts that the emergence of resistant strains is very unlikely. While our work was in progress, a scientific correspondence reported that E. coli strains that were selected for resistance to triclosan had mutations in the fabI gene (16McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). This finding led the authors to propose that FabI was the direct target for triclosan; however, no biochemical analysis was provided and other interpretations were possible. Mutations in FabI could alter the activity of the overall pathway to compensate for triclosan inhibition of another target in fatty acid biosynthesis or FabI mutations could result in an altered membrane fatty acid composition that would blunt the proposed membrane-perturbing effects of triclosan. In this report, we demonstrate that the 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers directly inhibit FabI enzyme activity. A genomic library of strain MC4100 tolC::Tn10 (provided by P. Miller, Parke-Davis) was constructed as follows. Chromosomal DNA was purified from a cell lysate using a chromosomal DNA isolation kit and procedure supplied by Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). The purified DNA was partially digested with Sau3A, and DNA fragments estimated to range in size from 6–12 kilobase pairs were isolated from an agarose gel using a QIAquick kit and procedure supplied by Qiagen Inc. The resulting DNA was ligated to pBR323 that had been digested with BamHI and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The resulting ligation mixture was used to transform strain DH5αF′lacI q and selected for ampicillin resistance at 37 °C. Plasmid DNA was isolated from approximately 12,000 transformants from the genomic library. Plasmids that conferred resistance to DHDPE were isolated by transforming strain MC4100 (tolC::Tn10) with the genomic library and selecting for colonies that grew on LB plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and DHDPE (2 μg/ml) at 37 °C. The spontaneous DHDPE-resistant (DHDPER) mutant, strain EP1424, was isolated by plating approximately 108 cells from an overnight culture of E. coli strain W3110 grown in LB at 37 °C onto LB plates containing 2 μg/ml DHDPE followed by incubation at 37 °C. The triclosan-resistant mutant, strain RJH108, was isolated in a similar fashion by plating strain W3110 on LB plates containing 1 μg/ml triclosan. Strain JP1111 (Hfr galE45 fabI392(Ts) relA1 spot1 thi-1 λ−) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT. The fabI gene was formerly known as envM. The fabI genes from strains W3110, EP1424, and RJH108 were amplified using polymerase chain reaction from chromosomal DNA and sequenced using fabI-specific primers on an ABI Model 373A sequencer. The FabI[G93S] protein was prepared by amplifying the mutantfabI gene from strain EP1424 and cloning the gene into the pET15b expression vector. The sequence of the insert DNA was verified, and purification of the FabI[G93S] protein to homogeneity was accomplished using techniques described previously for the wild-type FabI (3Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Cronan Jr., J.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1996: 35-74Google Scholar). E. coli strain UB1005 (metB1 relA1 spoT1 gyrA216 F−) was grown to a density of 5 × 108 cells per ml in minimal M9 medium at 37 °C. [3H]Acetate (specific activity 6.08 Ci/mmol) was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mCi/ml, and the culture divided into four equal portions. DHDPE was added to a final concentration of 0, 1, 2, or 4 μg/ml, and the cultures were then incubated at 37 °C. At various time intervals, 1 ml of the culture was removed and added into a 15-ml glass tube containing 2.4 ml of methanol and 100 μl of glacial acetic acid to quench further incorporation of label. Total lipids were extracted (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). An aliquot of each lipid extract was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer to quantitate the amount of [3H]acetate incorporated into fatty acids. The experiments with strains W3110 and EP1424 were carried out in a similar manner except that fatty acid biosynthesis was measured in a 20-min [3H]acetate pulse following the addition of 0, 1, or 4 μg/ml triclosan (VI). FabI activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorption at 340 nm as using an adaptation of the spectrophotometric assay used by Bergler et al. (18Bergler H. Fuchsbichler S. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 100 μm 8:1-NAC, 12 μg of homogeneous FabI (5Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), 200 μm NADH, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 300 μl. The reactions were performed at 25 °C in semimicro quartz cuvettes. The change in optical density was continuously monitored for 1 min, and the reaction rate was calculated from the slope of the trace. 2-Hydroxydiphenyl ethers were added to the final concentrations indicated in the figure legend from serially diluted stock solutions in Me2SO. The Me2SO concentration in all assays was maintained at 1.66%, which did not significantly affect FabI activity. The FabI specific activity in the absence of drug was 0.34 μmol/min/mg. Data points were the mean of duplicate assays, and the individual values were within ±5% of the average. Each IC50 was confirmed in a separate independent experiment and was determined from a semilog plot of the data. In a screen of a chemical library, a 2-hydroxydiphenyl ether, DHDPE (I), was identified as an antimicrobial agent with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1 μg/ml against E. coli strain W3110 (Table I). We therefore investigated the mechanism of action of six representative members of this structural class of antimicrobial compounds (Fig. 1). First, a genetic approach was used to identify genes that when overexpressed conferred resistance to DHDPE. A genomic library was constructed and transformed into E. colistrain MC4100/tolC::Tn10, and colonies that grew on plates containing 2 μg/ml DHDPE were identified. Plasmid DNA was isolated from two colonies and when transformed back intoE. coli strain MC4100/tolC::Tn10 again gave resistant colonies whereas empty vector controls did not (Fig. 2 A). The DNA sequence at both ends of two of the resistance-conferring inserts showed that they both contained the same region of the E. coli chromosome, including the complete coding sequences of fabI, ycjD, sapF, sapD, and sapC(Fig. 2 A). A subclone of the resistance insert spanningfabI and a derivative that contained a 4-base pair insertion in the HindIII site situated within fabI were also tested in this assay, along with a plasmid, pfabI, containing only the fabI gene on an 0.8-kilobase insert. Only plasmids that encoded a functional fabI gene conferred resistance to 2 μg/ml DHDPE (Fig. 2 A). These data, therefore, suggested that the protein product of the fabI gene was the target for DHDPE.Table IIC50 and MIC values of 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers against wild-type FabI protein and a panel of E. coli strainsCompoundIC50 FabI assayMIC for E. coli strainsW3110 (wild type)EP1424 (fabIG93S)RJH108 (fabIG93V)SJ53/vectorSJ53/pFabIμg/mlμg/mlI (DHDPE)0.51>64>6428II16>64>64>64>64>64III0.42>64>64432IV1.016>64>6416>64V2.54>64>644>64VI (triclosan)0.60.52320.52Strains EP1424 and RJH108 were spontaneous mutant derivatives of wild-type strain W3110.

MIC determinations were performed twice, with comparable results. A spontaneous DHDPE-resistant mutant of E. coli strain W3110, termed strain EP1424 (DHDPER), was isolated on LB plates containing 2 μg/ml DHDPE. Based on the observation that multiple copies of fabI conferred DHDPE resistance, genetic crosses mediated by bacteriophage P1 transduction were conducted on resistant strain EP1424 to determine if it carried a mutation in thefabI gene. A derivative of strain EP1424 that carried a Tn10kan near fabI was constructed (strain EP1480) and was used as a donor in a cross with strain JP1111 which harbors a temperature-sensitive mutation in fabI. Recombinants were selected on LB-kanamycin plates at 30 °C and scored independently for their ability to grow at 42 °C and for their sensitivity to DHDPE. The co-transduction frequencies between the various elements were: Tn10kan and the fabI(Ts) allele, 50%; Tn10kan and the DHDPER allele, 50%;fabI(Ts) allele and the DHDPER allele, 96%. The conclusion from these crosses is that a mutation in or very nearfabI was sufficient to confer DHDPE resistance. The DNA sequence of the fabI coding region and 230 nucleotides upstream from the fabI start codon was determined from both resistant strain EP1424 and its isogenic DHDPES parent (strain W3110). Comparison of the wild-type and mutant sequences revealed only a single base change between the twofabI alleles. The sequence corresponding to codon 93 of the resistant strain was mutated from GGT to AGT, resulting in a predicted missense mutation of glycine to serine in the mutant protein. Taken together, these genetic data strongly suggested that thefabI gene product was the target for the antibacterial activity of DHDPE in E. coli. We determined whether DHDPE inhibited fatty acid synthesis in intact cells by measuring the effect of the drug on the incorporation of [3H]acetate into fatty acids (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of drug, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis continued at a rate of 3.34 pmol of [3H]acetate incorporated per ml of culture per min. At 1 μg/ml DHDPE, acetate incorporation was decreased to 34% of the untreated control (1.13 pmol/ml/min), and cell growth continued for about 6 h. At higher DHDPE concentrations, acetate incorporation was further reduced to negligible levels (0.53 and 0.34 pmol/ml/min at 2 and 4 μg/ml DHDPE, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). Growth inhibition in these two cases was observed after 90 min of drug treatment, and the cells ceased growth 4 h later. This delayed effect of DHDPE on cell growth was similar to that observed in cells treated with antibiotics known to immediately inhibit essential enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis and in temperature-sensitive mutants in essential pathway enzymes (2Cronan Jr., J.E.

Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These data clearly show that DHDPE had a profound inhibitory effect onde novo fatty acid biosynthesis prior to the cessation of cell growth. The ability of DHDPE to specifically inhibit FabI was addressed in an in vitro spectrophotometric assay using homogeneous FabI and the enoyl-ACP substrate analog,trans-2-octenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine (8:1-NAC) (Fig. 3 A). Addition of increasing concentrations of DHDPE to the reaction potently inhibited the reduction of 8:1-NAC by NADH with an IC50 of 2.5 μm (0.5 μg/ml) (Fig. 3 A). We expanded our analysis to include 5 additional 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers (Fig. 1) to determine if the inhibition of FabI was a characteristic of this class of antimicrobial compound. The antimicrobial activity of all of these compounds was directly related to their ability to inhibit FabI. The MIC values for each compound against the wild-type strain E. coli strain W3110 (Table I) correlated with their potency in the inhibition of FabI in vitro (Fig. 3 A). The three most potent compounds for the inhibition of FabI in vitro(I, III, and VI) had the lowest MICs against strain W3110, whereas the thioether analog (II) exhibited a high IC50 in the FabI assay and was inactive against E. coli. The six compounds were then screened against strain EP1424, which expresses the mutant FabI[G93S] protein (see above), and strain SJ53/pFabI, which overexpresses the wild-type FabI protein. Both strains exhibited significantly increased resistance to the entire panel of 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers (Table I). The 4-fold increase in the MIC for triclosan (VI) in the DHDPE-resistant strain EP1424 was the lowest among the compounds examined (Table I). These data indicated that there was either another target for triclosan or that the FabI[G93S] mutant remained sensitive to triclosan inhibition. Therefore, we tested the ability of the three most potent compounds (I, III, and VI) to inhibit homogeneous FabI[G93S] in vitro (Fig. 3 B). FabI[G93S] was completely refractory to inhibition by compound I (DHDPE) and was only marginally affected by compound III. However, the IC50 for triclosan was 8 μm, corresponding to a 4-fold increase in the IC50 in the mutant compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). The ability of triclosan to inhibit fatty acid synthesis in the sensitive and resistant strains was tested at twice the MIC for the respective strains using a [3H]acetate labeling experiment. Triclosan (1 μg/ml) inhibited the incorporation of acetate into fatty acids by 80% in strain W3110, whereas a concentration of 4 μg/ml triclosan inhibited fatty acid formation by 60% in strain EP1424. As expected, DHDPE did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in strain EP1424. Thus, the 4-fold increase in the IC50 of triclosan for the FabI[G93S] mutant compared with the wild-type protein correlated with the 4-fold increase in the MIC and the increased resistance of fatty acid synthesis to triclosan in strain EP1424. These data suggested that the ability of triclosan to inhibit the growth of the DHDPE-resistant strain EP1424 was due to the residual sensitivity of the FabI[G93S] protein to triclosan. We selected a spontaneous triclosan-resistant mutant to determine if a different alteration in the fabI gene would confer a higher level of resistance to triclosan. Strain RJH108 was a spontaneously arising mutant that exhibited a 64-fold higher resistance to triclosan compared with the parental strain (Table I). DNA sequence analysis of the fabIgene in strain RJH108 showed the presence of a single missense mutation at codon 93 from GGT to GTT, resulting in a predicted change from serine to valine at this position. Strain RJH108 (FabI[G93V]) was also cross-resistant to the other 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers (Table I). Thus, high level resistance to triclosan results from a missense mutation in the fabI gene that substitutes a bulky hydrophobic amino acid side chain for glycine at position 93 of the protein. The antimicrobial activity of DHDPE, triclosan, and other 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers is attributed to their ability to inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis at the FabI step. The essential function of FabI in the type II fatty acid synthase systems of bacteria suggests that inhibitors of this enzyme have the potential to be active against a broad spectrum of organisms. The diazoborines target FabI fromE. coli (1Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the most notable success of FabI inhibitors was revealed by the discovery that the target for isoniazid and ethionamide in M. tuberculosis (InhA) is the FabI homolog in this organism (7Banerjee A.

The sequences of bacterial enoyl-ACP reductase proteins are related, and the three-dimensional structures of FabI fromE. coli (10Rozwarski D. Grant G. Barton D. Jacobs W. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and InhA from mycobacteria (11Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedeinikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have a similar overall pattern of protein folding and a conserved NAD binding pocket. Gly-93 in FabI forms part of the NADH binding pocket (10Rozwarski D. Grant G. Barton D. Jacobs W. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and the finding that a chromosomal G93S mutant in FabI confers resistance to the 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers indicates that the inhibitor either binds to the NADH form of the enzyme or to residues involved in forming the floor of the NADH pocket. It is significant that the DHDPERG93S mutant isolated by us is the same mutation that imparts resistance of FabI to diazoborines (1Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a different alteration at this position (G93V) imparts high level triclosan resistance. Also, InhA resistance to isoniazid arises from an analogous mutation in the NADH pocket of this FabI homolog (7Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 8Quémard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilcheze C. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R.

Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thus, similar mutations in FabI confer resistance to 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers and other enoyl-ACP reductase-targeted drugs suggesting that strains that acquire resistance to one of these compounds may exhibit cross-resistance to other inhibitors. The discovery of a specific intracellular target for 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers contradicts the prevailing view of the mechanism of action of these compounds. Triclosan (VI) is thought to attack the bacterial envelope making it more porous and preventing the uptake of nutrients and growth of the organism (13Vischer W.A. Regös J. Zentbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt Orig. A. 1974; 226: 376-389Google Scholar, 14Regös J. Hitz H.R. Zentbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt Orig. A. 1974; 226: 390-401Google Scholar, 15Regös J. Zak O. Solf R. Vischer W.A. Weirich E.G. Dermatologica. 1979; 158: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mechanism of action has been used to justify the widespread and rapidly increasing use of triclosan in personal care products since target organisms are unlikely to acquire resistance to a compound that acts by nonspecifically disrupting membrane architecture. The first indication that triclosan has a specific cellular target was provided by McMurray et al. (16McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) who report that triclosan-resistant strains have mutations in the fabI gene suggesting that the enoyl-ACP reductase was the target for the compound. Our biochemical analysis of enoyl-ACP reductase inhibition by these compounds provides the definitive evidence that the membrane is not the primary site of action. Indeed, the fact that triclosan-treated bacteria exhibit alterations in membrane permeability and function (13Vischer W.A. Regös J. Zentbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt Orig. A. 1974; 226: 376-389Google Scholar, 14Regös J. Hitz H.R. Zentbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt Orig. A. 1974; 226: 390-401Google Scholar, 15Regös J. Zak O. Solf R. Vischer W.A. Weirich E.G. Dermatologica. 1979; 158: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is consistent with FabI as the cellular target. First, the inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis interferes with membrane assembly and integrity by blocking phospholipid formation. Second, the temperature-sensitivefabI mutant was initially designated envM because it was isolated through a genetic selection for strains with thermosensitive envelope permeability defects (19Egan A.F. Russell R.R.B. Genet. Res. 1973; 21: 3603-3611Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, the diazoborine FabI inhibitors are also known to perturb membrane functions (20Turnowsky F. Fuchs K. Jeschek C. Högenauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6555-6565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the reported effects of triclosan and other 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers on membrane structure and function arise secondarily from its specific inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis at the FabI step. Triclosan is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria (12Bhargava H.N. Leonard P.A. Am. J. Infect. Control. 1996; 24: 209-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), including multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (21Bartzokas C.A. Paton J.H. Gibson M.F. Graham F. McLoughlin G.A. Croton R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Webster J. J. Hosp. Infect. 1992; 21: 137-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) indicating that development of additional FabI inhibitors will supplement the arsenal against multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, the ability of bacteria to acquire genetic resistance to triclosan and related compounds suggests that the widespread use of these chemicals will eventually lead to the appearance of resistant organisms that will compromise the usefulness of FabI inhibitors. Prudence dictates that the uses for this class of compounds be re-evaluated in light of their specific mechanism of action.

https://openalex.org/W2000279901,"Vascular calcification is common in people with diabetes and its presence predicts premature mortality. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, we used low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLR −/−) mice to study vascular calcification in the ascending aorta. LDLR −/− mice on a chow diet did not develop obesity, diabetes, atheroma, or vascular calcification. In contrast, LDLR −/− mice on high fat diets containing cholesterol developed obesity, severe hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemic diabetes, and aortic atheroma. A high fat diet without cholesterol also induced obesity and diabetes, but caused only moderate hyperlipidemia and did not result in significant aortic atheroma formation. Regardless of cholesterol content, high fat diets induced mineralization of the proximal aorta (assessed by von Kossa staining) and promoted aortic expression of Msx2 and Msx1, genes encoding homeodomain transcription factors that regulate mineralization and osseous differentiation programs in the developing skull. Osteopontin(Opn), an osteoblast matrix protein gene also expressed by activated macrophages, was up-regulated in the aorta by these high fat diets. In situ hybridization showed that peri-aortic adventitial cells in high fat-fed mice expressMsx2. Opn was also detected in this adventitial cell population, but in addition was expressed by aortic vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages of the intimal atheroma. High fat diets associated with hyperinsulinemic diabetes activate an aortic osteoblast transcriptional regulatory program that is independent of intimal atheroma formation. The spatial pattern of Msx2 and Opn gene expression strongly suggests that vascular calcification, thought to be limited to the media, is an active process that can originate from an osteoprogenitor cell population in the adventitia."

Leukocyte extravasation is crucial for an appropriate and effective immune response. Interaction with vascular endothelium is a carefully regulated multistep process leading to selective migration of various leukocyte subtypes. Adhesion molecules and activating factors control different steps of this process. Selectins and α4-integrins both mediate the initial interaction and the subsequent rolling along the endothelium, whereas only integrins mediate firm adhesion (1Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). The transition from rolling to firm adhesion requires intracellular biochemical changes, since integrins do not recognize the ligand unless activated. Several factors have been reported to trigger activation of integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion and motility, including phorbol esters, cytokines, and chemoattractants (2Patarroyo M. Yogeeswaran G. Biberfeld P. Klein E. Klein G. Int. J. Cancer. 1982; 30: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Von Andrian U.H. Hansell P. Chambers J.D. Berger E.M. Torres Filho I. Butcher E.C.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 6347-6357PubMed Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin-induced inhibition of lymphocyte homing highlighted the role of Gαi-protein linked receptors and their ligands as physiological activators of integrin-dependent lymphocyte adhesion in vivo(5Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Classical chemoattractants, such as formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP),1 and chemokines, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), trigger α4β1-integrin-dependent lymphocyte adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and αMβ2-integrin-dependent polymorphonuclear neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen through a Pertussis toxin-sensitive signaling pathway previously shown to involve Rho small GTP-binding proteins (6Laudanna C. Campbel J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A well known signaling cascade triggered by chemoattractants involves activation of phosopholipase C, leading to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate accumulation, intracellular calcium increase, and activation of the serine-threonine protein kinase C (PKC) (7Gerard G. Gerard G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PKC is a family of closely related proteins with serine-threonine kinase activity subdivided in subfamilies according to their sensitivity to Ca2+ and DAG. These include the classical, Ca2+-DAG sensitive, isozymes (α, βI, βII, and γ PKC); the novel, Ca2+--independent but DAG-sensitive, isozymes (δ, ε, η, and θ PKC); and the atypical, Ca2+- and DAG-independent, isozymes (ζ and λ/ι PKC). Involvement of PKC in integrin activation has been originally suggested by the capability of the DAG-synthetic analog phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a direct activator of DAG-sensitive PKCs, to activate integrin-dependent leukocyte aggregation and adhesion (2Patarroyo M. Yogeeswaran G. Biberfeld P. Klein E. Klein G. Int. J. Cancer. 1982; 30: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, PMA is not a physiological agonist, and in studies reported earlier (6Laudanna C. Campbel J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), we showed that chemoattractant activation of rapid integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion was not affected by calphostin C, an inhibitor of DAG-sensitive PKC isozymes that interferes with DAG binding to the C1 regulatory domain (8Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). To clarify the involvement of PKC in integrin activation and chemotaxis triggering by chemoattractants in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils, we used PKC inhibitors able to discern among different subfamilies of isozymes. Particularly, we exploited the highly selective inhibitory activity of synthetic peptides with sequence derived from the N-terminal pseudosubstrate region of PKC (9House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). We show evidence suggesting that Ca2+-DAG-sensitive PKC isoforms are not involved in the chemoattractant-triggered signaling pathway leading to integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis. In contrast, inhibitors of the atypical ζ PKC block adhesion and chemotaxis induced by chemoattractants as well as adhesion triggered by phorbol esters. Inhibitors of the atypical ζ PKC also block chemoattractant-induced G-actin assembly. Moreover, chemoattractant and PMA-induced plasma membrane translocation of ζ PKC is selectively blocked by C3 transferase, a specific inhibitor of Rho small GTP-binding protein. Thus, our data suggest a role of ζ PKC as downstream effector of signaling pathways leading to integrin activation and movement in human neutrophils. Furthermore, a potential functional link with Rho small GTPases is proposed. Human blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation and centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (6Laudanna C. Campbel J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Contaminating erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic saline, and then neutrophils were washed with PBS and finally resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. All of the above procedures were done using reagents prepared in endotoxin-free water for clinical use. All peptides (synthesized at the Stanford University Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility) were solubilized immediately before use at a 1 mm concentration in PBS, pH 7.2. In some cases (myristoylated ζ PKC short and long) peptides were heated to 37–40 °C to achieve complete solubility.

Eighteen-well glass slides were coated for 120 min at 37 °C with human fibrinogen (Sigma) (20 μg/well in endotoxin-free PBS). Neutrophils (5 × 104/well; 2.5 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640, containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) were added, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and then stimulated by the addition of the agonists before washing, fixation on ice in 1.5% glutaraldehyde for 60 min, and computer-assisted enumeration of cells bound in 0.2 mm2, as described (6Laudanna C. Campbel J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Neutrophils migration was assessed using 1-μm pore size transwells (Bio-Coat, Becton Dickinson). Neutrophil were in RPMI 1640, containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, at 2 × 106/ml. 100 μl of cell suspension were added to the top well, and 600 μl of medium, containing agonists and inhibitors, were added to the bottom well. After fixation with 1.5% glutaraldehyde, migrated cells were counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using polystyrene beads (Polyscience) as an internal standard (10Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) Activation of neutrophil NADPH-oxidase was evaluated by measuring reduction of dihydrorhodamine induced by superoxide anion-derived hydrogen peroxide, as previously reported (11Vowells S.J.

Biochem. 1993; 217: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Neutrophils, resuspended at 2 × 104/ml in PBS, pH 7.3, containing 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase, 0.5 μm dihydrorhodamine (reaction buffer), were stimulated under stirring at 37 °C. The time course of hydrogen peroxide-induced dihydrorhodamine reduction was evaluated with a spectrofluorimeter with 505 of excitation wavelength and 534 of emission wavelength. Calibration was done using as a standard a defined amount of hydrogen peroxide. F-actin was quantified by methanol extraction of nitrobenzoxadiazole/phallacidin-stained cells, as described previously (66Howard T.H. Oresajo C.O. Cell Motil. 1985; 6: 545-557Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Neutrophils (5 × 106) were pretreated on ice for 30 min with 30 μg/ml IB4 mouse monoclonal antibody anti-human β2-integrins (Fab2fragment) to prevent agonist-triggered integrin-mediated neutrophil aggregation and signaling. The cells were then washed; resuspended in PBS, pH 7.3, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2; stimulated under stirring at 37 °C; fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde; and stained for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.4 μm nitrobenzoxadiazole/phallacidin. After sedimentation at 16,000 × g, the pellet was overlaid with 0.5 ml of absolute methanol and extracted for 6 h in the dark at 4 °C. After cell sedimentation, the supernatant was collected, and the fluorescence intensity was determined with a spectrofluorimeter (excitation at 465 nm; emission at 535 nm). To determine the level of nonspecific binding, a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled phallacidin was included. The value of nonspecific binding was subtracted to yield specific F-actin staining and quantification. Neutrophils were pretreated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (5.8 mm for 20 min on ice) and subsequently pretreated on ice for 30 min with 30 μg/ml IB4 mouse monoclonal antibody anti-human β2-integrins (Fab2 fragment) to prevent agonist-triggered integrin-mediated neutrophil aggregation and signaling. Neutrophils were then washed, resuspended at 4 × 107/ml in PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+, and stimulated with agonists under stirring at 37 °C. Stimulation was stopped with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1% Triton X-100; 0.01% SDS; 150 mm NaCl; 50 mm NaF; 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 2 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 1 μmdithiothreitol; 1 μm phenylarsine oxide; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2.5 mm benzamidine; and 20 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. After 30 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min to remove cell debris. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ζ PKC (1 μg) or control rabbit serum was added to an equal amount of cell lysates, followed by immunoprecipitation with trisacryl protein A. Equal amounts of ζ PKC were immunoprecipitated as confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). After four washings, immunoprecipitates were subjected to the kinase reaction for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the reaction mixture was filtered through phosphocellulose paper. After four rinses with 1% phosphoric acid radioactivity on the filter was determined with a scintillation counter. Neutrophils were pretreated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (5.8 mm for 20 min on ice) and subsequently electroporated in the presence of 25 μg/ml of recombinant C3 transferase, as previously reported (6Laudanna C. Campbel J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of the treatment was tested every time by evaluating C3 transferase-induced inhibition of triggered adhesion, as previously reported (6Laudanna C. Campbel J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) (data not shown). After C3 treatment, neutrophils were pretreated on ice for 30 min with 30 μg/ml of IB4 mouse monoclonal antibody anti-human β2-integrins (Fab2fragment) to prevent agonist-triggered integrin-mediated neutrophil aggregation and signaling. Neutrophils were then washed, resuspended at 3 × 107/ml in PBS containing 1 mmCa2+/Mg2+, and stimulated under stirring with agonists at 37 °C. Stimulation was stopped by diluting the cells in a 10 times larger volume of ice-cold PBS. Cells, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 8% sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor were sonicated, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatant was loaded on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (50% sucrose, 30% sucrose) and centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g. The light membrane fraction (plasma membrane) was collected in the 30% layer (13Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Walker L. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 9% acrylamide, proteins (10 μg/lane) were electroblotted on 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters, probed with rabbit anti-α or -ζ PKC polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by goat polyclonal anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated (Sigma) and developed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specificity of the anti-ζ PKC antibodies was confirmed by the capability to recognize a unique band of approximately 72 kDa on blotted nitrocellulose filters of either rat brain lysates or baculovirus-purified human recombinant ζ PKC (Panvera) (data not shown). The role of PKC in neutrophil integrin activation and chemotaxis was initially investigated using various PKC inhibitors. As previously reported, calphostin C did not block fMLP or IL-8-triggered neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen. Gö6976, a structurally unrelated PKC inhibitor with selectivity for classical (α, β, and γ) isozymes of PKC (14Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marmé D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not interfere with chemoattractant-induced adhesion. Gö6850 (bisindolylmaleimide I), a third structurally unrelated inhibitor of classical and novel (δ, ε, η, and θ) PKC (14Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marmé D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no detectable effect on chemoattractant-induced neutrophil adhesion. (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, adhesion stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, a direct activator of DAG-dependent PKC isozymes, was effectively blocked by all these inhibitors (Fig. 1 A). Staurosporine, a potent but relatively nonselective kinase inhibitor, also inhibited PMA but not chemoattractant-induced neutrophil adhesion (data not shown). Moreover, analysis of neutrophil chemotaxis showed no influence of Gö6976 and Gö6850 on neutrophil migration toward the chemoattractants fMLP and IL-8 (Fig. 1 B); staurosporine was also ineffective (data not shown). Because of its reported light dependence (15Burns R.F. Miller F.D. Merriman R.L. Howbert J.J. Heath W.F. Kobayashi E. Takahashi I. Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), the effect of calphostin C on chemotaxis was not evaluated. These data clearly suggest that chemoattractant activation of neutrophil integrin-dependent adhesion and chemotaxis does not involve DAG-sensitive PKC isozymes. To verify the previous data, we used Chelerythrine chloride, a specific (but not isozyme-selective) PKC inhibitor that represents a unique class of PKC inhibitors that competitively interfere with the phosphate acceptor site and noncompetitively inhibits the ATP binding site (16Herbert M.J. Augereu J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, pretreatment of neutrophils with chelerythrine chloride efficiently blocked fMLP, IL-8, and PMA-induced adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, chelerythrine chloride also inhibited chemotaxis to both agonists in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that a chelerythrine chloride-sensitive but calphostin C-, Gö6976-, Gö6850-, and staurosporine-insensitive PKC isoform is involved in chemoattractant triggering of integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis. Importantly, none of the inhibitors affected expression of β2-integrins, cell viability as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, or intracellular Ca2+ elevation stimulated by fMLP or IL-8 (data not shown). To further address these findings, we took advantage of the ability of synthetic pseudosubstrate peptides, with sequences based on the endogenous PKC pseudosubstrate region (9House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar,17Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), to inhibit PKC kinase activity. Peptides were synthesized with an N-terminal myristic acid to facilitate their diffusion through the plasma membrane, as previously reported. (18Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B.A. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M.J. Ploegh H.L.. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, myristoylated peptides from α PKC, “short,” encompassing amino acids 19–31 (reported to be a more potent inhibitor (9House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar)) and “long,” amino acids 19–35 (encompassing the entire pseudosubstrate region, which is identical in both α and β classical PKC isozymes) had no effect on adhesion stimulated by fMLP and IL-8. In contrast, PMA-induced adhesion was blocked in a dose-dependent manner, whereas nonmyristoylated peptides with the same α PKC sequence and myristoylated peptides with a “scrambled” sequence were ineffective, even at the highest concentrations. Both short and long myristoylated peptides from α PKC were also unable to block neutrophil chemotaxis to fMLP and IL-8 (Fig. 3 B). These data confirm the previous observations and show that myristoylated peptides from PKC pseudosubstrate region are suitable tools to study PKC function in human neutrophils. The previous data show that a DAG-independent PKC isozyme, sensitive to chelerythrine chloride but not to other PKC inhibitors and peptides, is involved in chemoattractant-induced neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis. Western blot analysis revealed that human neutrophils express PKC isozymes of the classical (α, βI, and βII), novel (δ), and atypical (ζ) subfamilies of PKC, also consistent with previous a report (19Kent J.D. Sergeant S. Burns D.J. McPhail L.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4641-4647PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in control rat brain lysates ε, η, and λ/ι PKCs were also expressed (data not shown). Thus, the ζ isozyme was the only atypical PKC expressed in human neutrophils. Since the atypical ζ PKC isozyme has been previously shown to be chelerythrine chloride-sensitive (20Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) but insensitive to staurosporine (21Kochs G. Hummel R. Meyer D. Hug H. Marmé D. Sarre T.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mishak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ζ PKC might be a target of chelerythrine chloride inhibition in our model and thus an effector of chemoattractant-triggered signaling pathways leading to integrin-dependent adhesion and chemotaxis. We tested the effect of peptides derived from the pseudosubstrate region of ζ PKC. Two myristoylated peptides from ζ PKC (short, encompassing amino acids 113–125, and long, amino acids 113–129, encompassing the entire pseudosubstrate region) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner fMLP- and IL-8-stimulated adhesion (Fig. 4 A). The long peptide was the most efficient inhibitor, with more than 90% inhibition at 50 μm. Nonmyristoylated peptides with the same ζ PKC sequence and myristoylated peptides with a scrambled sequence were ineffective, even at the highest concentrations (Fig. 4 A). We then asked whether ζ PKC pseudosubstrate peptides might affect chemoattractant-induced chemotaxis. Myristoylated ζ PKC peptides inhibited in a dose-dependent manner fMLP- and IL-8-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 4 B). As shown for the adhesion, the long peptide was the most efficient inhibitor, whereas peptides that were nonmyristoylated or myristoylated with a scrambled sequence were ineffective (Fig. 4 B). Again, cell viability, expression of β2-integrins, and intracellular Ca2+elevation induced by fMLP and IL-8 were not affected by pretreatment with any of the peptides (data not shown). To verify the specificity of the ζ PKC peptides, we tested their effect on PMA-induced adhesion. Surprisingly, myristoylated ζ PKC pseudosubstrate peptides also blocked in dose-dependent manner PMA-triggered adhesion; again the long peptide was the most efficient inhibitor, with more than 85% inhibition at 50 μm. Peptides that were nonmyristoylated or myristoylated with a scrambled sequence were ineffective (Fig. 5 A). This finding was rather unexpected, since the pseudosubstrate regions of α and ζ PKCs are quite different (23% of homology), and ζ PKC is not activated by PMA. We then evaluated the activation of the superoxide-generating NADPH-oxidase system of neutrophils, another function triggered by PMA. Myristoylated ζ PKC pseudosubstrate peptides did not interfere with PMA-triggered NADPH-oxidase activation, even at low doses of PMA and high doses of peptides (Fig. 5 B), whereas myristoylated α PKC pseudosubstrate peptides effectively blocked NADPH-oxidase activation. These data support the selectivity of ζ PKC peptides, suggesting that atypical ζ PKC may be an effector of PMA-triggered signaling pathways leading to integrin activation. Chemoattractants stimulate in neutrophils rapid cytosolic G-actin polymerization leading to accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin). Although F-actin accumulation does not seem not to be necessary for leukocyte integrin activation, as suggested by the incapacity of cytochalasin B to block lymphocyte function antigen type 1-mediated lymphocyte aggregation (27Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H.. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), actin polymerization is likely to be required for leukocyte shape change, such as polarization and directional movement during chemotaxis. Thus, we asked whether ζ PKC could be involved in signaling events leading to G-actin polymerization triggered by chemoattractants. As shown in Fig. 6, fMLP and IL-8 induced rapid increase of F-actin content. Neutrophil pretreatment with chelerythrine chloride or with myristoylated ζ PKC pseudosubstrate peptides almost completely abolished the increase of F-actin. In contrast, peptide myristoylated with a scrambled sequence did not block F-actin accumulation. Thus, ζ PKC seems to be involved in signaling cascade leading to G-actin polymerization. To characterize further ζ PKC involvement in proadhesive signaling pathways, we measured its kinase activity. In nonstimulated neutrophils, ζ PKC showed constitutive kinase activity (Fig. 7), as also previously reported (25Liyanage M. Frith D. Livneh E. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). fMLP and IL-8 induced a 4.3- and 2.4-fold increase, respectively, of ζ PKC activity. Consistent with the rapid kinetics of chemoattractant-induced cell adhesion, fMLP- and IL-8-induced increase of ζ PKC activity was very rapid, occurring within 10 s, the earliest time point measurable (Fig. 7). However, increase of ζ PKC activity was transient, with a decrease of about 63% (fMLP) and 51% (IL-8) within 30 s. In contrast, PMA did not induce any significant increase of ζ PKC activity even after 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 7). fMLP and IL-8 but not PMA also triggered an increase of ζ PKC autophosphorylating activity, as measured in a kinase assay carried out in the absence of myelin basic protein (data not shown). Translocation of PKC isozymes to different cellular compartments is a hallmark of selective PKC activation (24Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), and it is thought to be as important as or more important than altered kinase activity in regulating PKC functions within the cell (24Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar); translocation is likely to be particularly important in regulating ζ PKC function because, unlike classical PKC isoforms, ζ PKC displays a high level of constitutive kinase activity in in vitro assays (Refs. 25Liyana"

The chromosomal localization and genomic organization of human GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3 (GALNT1, GALNT2, and GALNT3) are different; however, a number of conserved intron/exon boundaries confirm their evolutionary relationships (1Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Meurer J.A. Drong R.F. Homa F.L. Slightom J.L. Elhammer A.P.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, these features strongly suggest that each GalNAc-transferase has distinct functions, and that the large number of members of this gene family has evolved as a consequence of the need for O-glycosylation of different sequences. The fine substrate specificities of GalNAc-transferases may represent a major determining factor for sites of O-glycan attachments. O-Glycosylation of MUC1 has attracted attention because it is altered in cancer cells with smaller and fewer O-glycans (12Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Stewart L. Burchell J. Beverley P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 690: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Brockhausen I. Yang J.M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Eur. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33325-33334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The change in O-glycosylation leads to the exposure of cancer-associated peptide epitopes within the tandem repeat region of MUC1, although the exact molecular nature of this phenomenon is still unknown (15Girling A. Bartkova J. Burchell J. Gendler S. Gillett C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Finn O.J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 105-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Analysis of the in vitro O-glycosylation properties of various GalNAc-transferase preparations including purified recombinant GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3 suggests that only three of the potential five sites in the repeat were glycosylated (AHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA, in vitro glycosylation sites underlined). However, recently Mulleret al. (17Muller S. Goletz S. Packer N. Gooley A. Lawson A.M. Hanisch F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24780-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) elegantly established that all five sites can be occupied in purified milk MUC1. Two explanations for this discrepancy are: 1) that in vitro O-glycosylation assays fail to reflect the in vivo function of GalNAc-transferases, or 2) that additional GalNAc-transferases have substrate specificity for the two last sites in the MUC1 repeat. The present study presents evidence supporting the latter explanation. Previously, a sequence motif shared between GalNAc-T1 and -T2 was used to identify and clone GalNAc-T3 (4Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Two candidate cDNA sequences containing the GalNAc-transferase motif were identified: one was the GalNAc-T3 gene. Here, we report the cloning and expression of the second identified cDNA, which was designated GalNAc-T4 (1Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A putative murine orthologue also designated GalNAc-T4 was recently reported by Hagen et al. (5Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. Beres T.M. Balys M.M. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13843-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The recombinant human GalNAc-T4 had a highly restricted acceptor substrate specificity, which is distinct from that of previously reported GalNAc-transferases. Thus, GalNAc-T4 was found to complement GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3, in O-glycosylation of the MUC1 tandem repeat by transferring GalNAc to two sites in the MUC1 repeat not utilized by other known GalNAc-transferases. Importantly, GalNAc-T4 showed preference for the MUC1 glycopeptide, GalNAc4TAP24, which was previously glycosylated with GalNAc-T2. A cDNA sequence (TE4) with extensive similarity to the GalNAc-transferase motif was previously identified following reverse transcriptase-PCR of MKN45 mRNA using degenerate primers (4Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cleaved by BstNI to remove GalNAc-T1 and -T2 derived products. Uncleaved product was isolated using the prep-A-gene kit (Bio-Rad) and cloned into the pT7T3U19 vector (Pharmacia). A rapid cDNA library screening strategy was performed as described previously (4Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A human salivary gland λgt11 library (CLONTECH) was amplified and aliquoted into 40 sublibraries, which were screened to identify phage clones containing TE4. Fourteen sublibraries found to contain TE4 λgt11 clones were further assayed by PCR using EBHC201 (5′-GCGGATCCGCGGGCACCATATGCTCG) or EBHC203 (5′-GAGCAGTETTCTGTAGGAAATTGG) primers combined with primers based on flanking λgt11 vector sequence to estimate lengths of cDNA inserts for selection of sublibraries with the largest 3′ or 5′ sequences. Amplifications were: 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s; 53 °C for 1 s; 72 °C for 2 min. One sublibrary (number 22) generated a 3′ PCR product (EBHC201/λgt11 REV) of approximately 750 bp, and one sublibrary (number 34) generated a 5′ PCR product (EBHC203/λgt11 REV) of approximately 800 bp. Additional 5′ sequence was obtained by 5′ RACE using a 5′ Ready-RACE Lung cDNA Kit (CLONTECH) in combination with antisense primer EBHC309 (5′-TCAAAAGAACTGCAGGAGAAG): 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s; 60 °C for 15 s; 72 °C for 3 min. The RACE products were blunt-end cloned into pT7T3U19 and multiple clones were sequenced. The longest insert was approximately 550 bp and did not contain the full 5′ coding sequence. Further 5′ RACE failed and the remaining 5′ sequence was obtained by sequencing P1 genomic clones. A P1 human foreskin genomic library (DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., Human Foreskin Fibroblast P1 Library) was screened using primer pairs EBHC302 (5′-GCCACTGAAATGTTAAACGCC)/EBHC304 (5′-ACGAAGCCTGGTCGACTTTGC). Three clones, DPMC-HFF 1-0160-B2 (P1–6211), DPMC-HFF 1-0972-B9 (P1–6212), and DPMC-HFF 1-1275-A10 (P1–6213), were obtained from Genome Systems. DNA from P1 phage was prepared as recommended by Genome Systems. The coding sequence of GalNAc-T4 was sequenced from all P1 clones using automated sequencing (ABI377, Perkin-Elmer) with dye terminator chemistry. A single base substitution was identified in the coding region between P1–6213 (nucleotides 1516 G) and P1–6212 (nucleotide 1516 A) (Figs. 1 and 2). The substitution removes a uniqueKpnI restriction site for the 1516 G allele. A PCR genotyping assay using EBHC300 (5′-AGCGGATCCTGACAACAACCCCACAGG)/EBHC307 (5′-AGCGGATCCGACGAAAGTGCTGTTGTGCTC) (conditions: 35 cycles of 95 °C, 20 s; 55 °C, 1 s; 72 °C, 30 s) followed by KpnI restriction analysis was performed on DNA samples from 206 healthy blood donors, in order to evaluate the allele frequencies.Figure 2Fluorescence in situhybridization of GalNAc-T4 to metaphase chromosomes localized the gene to 12q21.3–22.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fluorescencein situ hybridization was performed on normal human lymphocyte metaphase chromosomes, using procedures described previously (18Suijkerbuijk R.F. van de Veen A.Y. van Echten J.

Briefly, P1 DNA was labeled with digoxigenin-14-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) using the BioNICK labeling system (Life Technologies). The labeled DNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of herring sperm DNA. A total of 200 ng of P1 DNA was precipitated with 50 × human Cot 1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and dissolved in 12 ml of hybridization solution (2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% Tween 20, and 50% formamide, pH 7.0). Prior to hybridization the probe was heat-denatured at 80 °C for 10 min, chilled on ice, and incubated at 37 °C to allow re-annealing of highly repetitive sequences. After denaturation of the slides, probe incubations were carried out under a 18 × 18-mm coverslip in a moist chamber for 45 h. Immunochemical detection of the probe was achieved using sheep anti-digoxigenin (fluorescein isothiocyanate) (Boehringer) and donkey anti-sheep (fluorescein isothiocyanate) (Jackson Laboratories) antibodies. For evaluation of the chromosomal slides, a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters for visualization of fluorescein isothiocyanate was used. Hybridization signals and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-counterstained chromosomes were transformed into pseudo-colored images using image analysis software. For precise localization and chromosome identification 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-converted banding patterns were generated using the BDS-imageTM software package (ONCOR). Seven normal families with an average of 10 children from the Copenhagen Family Bank (19Eiberg H. Nielsen L.S. Klausen J. Dahlen M. Kristensen M. Bisgaard M.L. Moller N. Mohr J. Clin. Genet. 1989; 35: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were analyzed for the G/A polymorphism at bp position 1516 using the PCR assay with EBHC300/EBHC307. To confirm in situ localization on 12q21.3-q22, a set of DNA markers with known physical localization were used. The order and distances for these were drawn from the Généthon Linkage map (20Dib C.

The physical map of these markers are: D12S80, 12p13.2-q21.1; D12S81, 12q21; and D12S101, 12q22. Lod scores were calculated with the LIPED software (21Ott J. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1976; 28: 528-529PubMed Google Scholar). Expression constructs designed to contain amino acid residues 32–578 of the coding sequence of the putative GalNAc-T4 gene were prepared by genomic PCR on the two different P1 clones using the primer pair EBHC318 (5′-AGCGGATCCTTTTCATGCCTCCGCAGGAGCCG) and EBHC307 with BamHI restriction sites (Fig. 1). These PCR products were cloned into aBamHI site of the expression vector pAcGP67 (Pharmingen), and the expression construct was sequenced. The constructs, pAcGP67-GalNAc-T4506Vsol and pAcGP67-GalNAc-T4506Isol, were designed to yield a putative soluble form of the GalNAc-T4 protein with an N-terminal end positioned immediately C-terminal to the potential transmembrane domain and including the entire sequence expected to contain the catalytic domain. Control constructs pAcGP67-GalNAc-T1-sol, pAcGP67-GalNAc-T2-sol, pAcGP67-GalNAc-T3-sol, and pAcGP67-O2-sol were prepared as described previously (3White T. Bennett E.P. Takio K. Sorensen T.

A full coding expression construct was prepared by PCR of P1 clone P1–6213 (GalNAc-T4506V) using primer pair EBHC320 (5′-AGCGGATCCCACCATGGCGGTGAGGTGGACTTGG)/EBHC307. The product was cloned into BamHI sites of the expression vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen). Co-transfection of Sf9 cells with pAcGP67-constructs or pVL-constructs and Baculo-GoldTM DNA was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 0.4 μg of construct was mixed with 0.1 μg of Baculo-Gold DNA and co-transfected in Sf9 cells in 24-well plates. Ninety-six hours post-transfection recombinant virus was amplified in 6-well plates at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:50. Titer of amplified virus was estimated by titration in 24-well plates with monitoring of GalNAc-transferase activities. Initial transferase assays were performed on supernatants of Sf9 cells in 6-well plates infected with first or second amplified virus. Titers representing end point dilutions giving optimal enzyme activities were used. Transferase assays of the full coding expression construct was performed by extracting washed cells in 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (7Sorensen T. White T. Wandall H.H. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

GalNAc-T4506Vwas purified essentially as described previously (8Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Bennett E.P. Nielsen P.A. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J.

Final purification was performed on Mini-S™ (PC 3.2/3, Pharmacia) using the Smart System (Pharmacia), and peak fractions used for immunizing BALB/c mice as described previously (5–10 μg/subcutaneous injection three times with one intravenous boost) (9Mandel, U., Hassan, H., Therkildsen, M. H., Nielsen, P. A., Rygaard, J., Jacobsen, M., Juhl, B. R., Dabelsteen, E., and Clausen, H. (1998) Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were selected and characterized by immunocytology on Sf9 cells infected with various GalNAc-transferase expression constructs and selective immunoprecipitation of active GalNAc-T4 activity. Immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections of submandibular glands was performed as described previously (9Mandel, U., Hassan, H., Therkildsen, M. H., Nielsen, P.

Therkildsen M.H. Clausen H. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 1820-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was used as marker of mucous cells. The insert of pAcGP67-GalNAc-T4506Vsol was excised and cloned into a modified pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), which includes 19 amino acids of the γ-interferon secretion signal sequence (24Gray P.W.

CHO-K1 (ATCC) was transfected using 0.2 μg of DNA and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in subconfluent 6-well plates according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h the medium was changed and 400 μg/ml G418 was added. At 72 h 10–20% of the wells were trypsinized and the percentage of cells expressing GalNAc-T4 was evaluated by immunocytology as described previously (9Mandel, U., Hassan, H., Therkildsen, M. H., Nielsen, P. A., Rygaard, J., Jacobsen, M., Juhl, B. R., Dabelsteen, E., and Clausen, H. (1998) Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar), using a novel anti-GalNAc-T4 monoclonal antibody, UH6. Based on the frequency of positive cells the residual transfectant cells were trypsinized and plated in 96-well plates. Two rounds of screening and cloning by limiting dilution using immunoreactivity with UH6 were performed and clones reaching over 50% positive cells were selected, and tested for level of secreted enzyme in supernatant of confluent cultures. Standard assays were performed in 50-μl total reaction mixtures containing 25 mm cacodylate (pH 7.5), 10 mmMnCl2, 0.1–0.25% Triton X-100, 150–200 μmUDP-[14C]GalNAc (4,000 cpm/nmol) (Amersham), and 0.06–1 mm acceptor peptides. Peptides were synthesized by ourselves, by Carlbiotech (Copenhagen), or Neosystems (Strasbourg), and quality was ascertained by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Peptides Muc1a, Muc1b, and TAP24, were derived from the tandem repeat of human MUC1 (25Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.N.

Products were quantified by scintillation counting after chromatography on Dowex-1, octadecyl silica cartridges (Bakerbond), or HPLC (PC3.2/3 or mRPC C2/C18 SC2.1/10 Pharmacia, Smart System). Products produced byin vitro glycosylation were in most cases also confirmed by mass spectrometry. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) the mass spectra were acquired on either Voyager-DE or Voyager-Elite MALDI time of flight mass spectrometers (Perseptive Biosystem Inc.), equipped with delay extraction. The MALDI matrix was a 9:1 mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHB) 25 g/liter and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid 25 g/liter (Aldrich) dissolved in a 2:1 mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile. Samples dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of approximately 2 pmol/ml were prepared for analysis by placing 1 μl of sample solution on a probe tip followed by 1 μl of matrix. Multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blots were obtained from CLONTECH. The soluble expression construct (contained nucleotides 92–1757) was used as the GalNAc-T4 probe. The probe was random prime labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) and Oligo labeling kit (Pharmacia). Blots were probed as described previously (4Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and washed at 5 × at 42 °C with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, once with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once at 55 °C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, in a mini-hybridization oven (HYBAID). Previously, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on mRNA from a variety of human organs and cell lines, using a pair of degenerate primers (EBHC100/EBHC106) corresponding to sequences flanking a putative GalNAc-transferase motif. Two novel sequences were identified, TE3 and TE4, with approximately 80% similarity in sequence to GalNAc-T1 and -T2 (4Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase-PCR product obtained from the human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN45 was cleaved with BstNI (known to cleave GalNAc-T1 and -T2 sequences at non-conserved restriction sites), and the remaining uncleaved product was subcloned and sequenced. Eight out of 40 independent clones contained sequences similar but not identical to GalNAc-T1 and -T2. Six of these clones were derived from GalNAc-T3 (TE3) (4Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and two clones contained a novel sequence designated TE4. Cloning and sequencing of the complete coding sequence of GalNAc-T4 was achieved by a combination of PCR screening of 40 sublibraries from a human salivary gland λgt11 library, 5′ RACE, and genomic P1 cloning. The combined sequences contained an open reading frame of 1734 bp (GenBank accession number Y08564) (Fig. 1). The entire coding sequence was confirmed by sequencing of P1 clones in both directions. The deduced sequence of GalNAc-T4 is predicted to be a type II transmembrane protein with a hydrophobic retention signal in residues 11–31. A BLAST search of the EST data base (GenBank/NCBI) with the coding region of GalNAc-T4 only detected one human GalNAc-T4 EST, which is in contrast to several other GalNAc-transferases that are highly represented by ESTs. GalNAc-T4 is highly similar to the other GalNAc-transferases in the COOH-terminal region (amino acid residues 85–559, GalNAc-T1; 105–571, GalNAc-T2; 151–633, GalNAc-T3; and 103- 578, GalNAc-T4), and there is conservation of 12 cysteine residues (Fig. 1) (1Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal regions vary considerably in length and have no significant similarity. Three P1 clones each covering the entire coding sequence of GalNAc-T4 were isolated. Sequencing of all three P1 clones showed that the entire coding region of GalNAc-T4 was contained in a single exon. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the GalNAc-T4 gene resides at human chromosome 12q21.3-q22 (Fig. 2). No specific hybridization signals were observed at other chromosomal sites. A total of 20 cells in metaphase were analyzed. Further confirmation of the chromosomal location was achieved by linkage analysis using the PCR assay for the polymorphism at position 1516 combined with chromosome 12 microsatellite markers (Table I). Analysis of 10 families yielded significant Lod score (Z > 3) between D12S80, D12S81, D12S101, and the GalNAc-T4 polymorphism. One recombination to the marker D12S81 was detected in an intercross mating (Z = 10.50 at θ (M=F) = 0.02). A marker D12S7 (12q14-q24.1) showed no recombination with GalNAc-T4, but the marker is not on the Généthon map. The suggested order according to the Généthon map was as follows: D12S90-D12S80-D12S81-(“GalNAc-T4,” D12S7)-D12S101.Table ILinkage analysis of GalNAc-T4 with chromosome 12 markersMarker(θM = θF)0.010.050.100.200.300.40D12S90−18.88−7.1−2.760.371.030.56D12S80−3.262.153.723.992.911.21D12S8110.4210.219.337.094.521.79D1"

Plastids are plant organelles whose diverse functions include photosynthesis, gravity perception, and biogenesis of micro- and macromolecules. These functions do not occur in all plastids but are associated with structurally distinct plastid types. Plastid differentiation is a highly coordinated process involving programmed, multi-phase events that are transduced by a variety of stimuli. These transducers activate numerous morphological and biochemical changes that ultimately affect plastid compartmentalization. This is particularly evident in chloroplasts undergoing the transformation to chromoplasts, an event characterized by the synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids into unique plastid substructures. These changes are accompanied by the yellow to red color shift in flowers, fruits, and roots of certain plants (1Liedvogel B. Sitte P. Falk H. Cytobiologie. 1976; 12: 155-174Google Scholar, 2Camara B. Hugueney P. Bouvier F. Kuntz M. Monéger R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 175-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the molecular events controlling these alterations are largely unknown, emerging evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 may play a vital role in this process (3Bouvier, F. (1996) Induction et Contrôle de la Biosynthése des Caroténoïdes au Cours de la Maturation du Fruit de Poivron(Capsicum annuum L.). Ph.D. thesis, UniversitéLouis PasteurGoogle Scholar). In this paper we present data showing how oxidative stress affects carotenogenesis in plants.Data from several model systems indicate that ROS operate at the molecular level. Homeostatic variations in ROS levels are known to activate normal and pathological events during animal cell development (4Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 5Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that hydrogen peroxide acts as a potent activator of NF-κB, a transcription factor that is involved in inflammation, immune responses, and acute-phase responses in animal cells (4Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Plants are also subject to oxidative stresses (6Foyer C.H. Descourvières P. Kunert K.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 507-523Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 7Thompson J.E. Legge R.L. Barber R.F. New Phytol. 1987; 105: 317-344Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Being immobile and because of oxygenic photosynthesis, they have the highest internal oxygen concentrations of any other organism. The concentration of molecular oxygen in plant leaf cells is 250 μm, which exceeds the concentration of 0.1 μm found in mammalian mitochondria (8Scandalios J.G. Plant Physiol. (Rockv). 1993; 101: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that 1% of the oxygen consumed by plants is diverted into active oxygen (9Asada K. Takahashi M. Kyle D.J. Osmond C.B. Arntzen C.J. Photoinhibition. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 227-287Google Scholar). As a consequence, plant cells have developed an array of nonenzymatic and enzymatic mechanisms for scavenging this toxic component. Neutralization by isoprenoids such as carotenoids and tocopherols (10Krinsky N.I. Pure Appl. Chem. 1979; 51: 649-660Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Fryer M.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1992; 15: 381-392Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar) are examples of nonenzymatic mechanisms. Plants and other organisms also rely on the enzymatic scavenging of ROS by catalase, glutathion peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase (6Foyer C.H. Descourvières P. Kunert K.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 507-523Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar).The damaging effects of ROS have been examined during plant stress (12Elstner E.F. Wagner G.A. Schutz W. Curr. Top.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 334-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Multiple observations also suggest that oxidative stress regulates carotenoid biosynthesis during the chloroplast to chromoplast transition in plants. First, in Reseda odorata leaves, rodoxanthin, a chromoplast-specific carotenoid, shows a de novo accumulation following stembark removal (16Lippmaa T. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1926; 182: 1040-1042Google Scholar). Apparently this procedure causes a transient disruption of turgor pressure, which leads to oxidative stress (17Yahraus T. Chandra S. Legendre L. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. (Rockv). 1995; 109: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Second, in Aloe vera (18Diaz M. Ball E. Lüttge U. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1990; 28: 679-682Google Scholar) and Cryptomeria (19Tôyama S. Funazaki K. Bot. Mag. Tokyo. 1971; 84: 123-136Crossref Google Scholar), stress from drought and high irradiance or low temperatures induces the de novo accumulation of rhodoxanthin in chloroplasts, which subsequently undergo a transformation into photosynthetically active chloro-chromoplasts. Similarly, it is known that drought and low or high temperatures can induce oxidative stress (12Elstner E.F. Wagner G.A. Schutz W. Curr. Top. Plant Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 7: 159-187Google Scholar). These conditions lead to the de novo accumulation of anhydroeschsoltzxanthin, a chromoplast carotenoid in Buxus sempervirens leaves (20Costes C. Bull. Soc. Fr. Physiol. Vég. 1969; 15: 55-70Google Scholar). One explanation is that the extended chromophores of rhodoxanthin and anhydroeschsoltzxanthin provide better photodynamic screens for protection from the oxidative stresses generated under these conditions than do normal leaf carotenoids, in good agreement with data based on model studies (21Di Mascio P. Kaiser S. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 22Hirayama O. Nakamura K. Hamada S. Kobayasi Y.

B Biol. 1997; 41: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). This mechanism is also observed in nonplants, such as the yeast Phaffia rhodozyma, where singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals control the biosynthesis of astaxanthin, another carotenoid with an extended chromophore (24Schroeder W.A. Johnson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18374-18379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).These data point to oxidative stress as a potent driving force for the expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes during the chloroplast to chromoplast transition in plants. To test this, we made use of pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruit system (3Bouvier, F. (1996) Induction et Contrôle de la Biosynthése des Caroténoïdes au Cours de la Maturation du Fruit de Poivron(Capsicum annuum L.). Ph.D. thesis, UniversitéLouis PasteurGoogle Scholar). As pepper fruits ripen and chloroplasts differentiate into chromoplasts, they accumulate large quantities of carotenoids that include capsanthin and capsorubin, compounds responsible for the red color change. Their pathway is shown in Fig. 1. Several cDNAs for enzymes of this pathway have been characterized (for a review, see Ref. 2Camara B. Hugueney P. Bouvier F. Kuntz M. Monéger R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 175-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Using these as molecular probes and the promoter directing the biosynthesis of the chromoplast-specific carotenoid, capsanthin, we show that ROS are potent inducers of carotenogenic gene mRNAs expression during chromoplast development. Plastids are plant organelles whose diverse functions include photosynthesis, gravity perception, and biogenesis of micro- and macromolecules. These functions do not occur in all plastids but are associated with structurally distinct plastid types. Plastid differentiation is a highly coordinated process involving programmed, multi-phase events that are transduced by a variety of stimuli. These transducers activate numerous morphological and biochemical changes that ultimately affect plastid compartmentalization. This is particularly evident in chloroplasts undergoing the transformation to chromoplasts, an event characterized by the synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids into unique plastid substructures. These changes are accompanied by the yellow to red color shift in flowers, fruits, and roots of certain plants (1Liedvogel B. Sitte P. Falk H. Cytobiologie. 1976; 12: 155-174Google Scholar, 2Camara B. Hugueney P. Bouvier F. Kuntz M. Monéger R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 175-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the molecular events controlling these alterations are largely unknown, emerging evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 may play a vital role in this process (3Bouvier, F. (1996) Induction et Contrôle de la Biosynthése des Caroténoïdes au Cours de la Maturation du Fruit de Poivron(Capsicum annuum L.). Ph.D. thesis, UniversitéLouis PasteurGoogle Scholar). In this paper we present data showing how oxidative stress affects carotenogenesis in plants. Data from several model systems indicate that ROS operate at the molecular level. Homeostatic variations in ROS levels are known to activate normal and pathological events during animal cell development (4Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 5Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that hydrogen peroxide acts as a potent activator of NF-κB, a transcription factor that is involved in inflammation, immune responses, and acute-phase responses in animal cells (4Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Plants are also subject to oxidative stresses (6Foyer C.H. Descourvières P. Kunert K.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 507-523Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 7Thompson J.E. Legge R.L. Barber R.F. New Phytol. 1987; 105: 317-344Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Being immobile and because of oxygenic photosynthesis, they have the highest internal oxygen concentrations of any other organism. The concentration of molecular oxygen in plant leaf cells is 250 μm, which exceeds the concentration of 0.1 μm found in mammalian mitochondria (8Scandalios J.G. Plant Physiol. (Rockv). 1993; 101: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that 1% of the oxygen consumed by plants is diverted into active oxygen (9Asada K. Takahashi M. Kyle D.J. Osmond C.B. Arntzen C.J. Photoinhibition. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 227-287Google Scholar). As a consequence, plant cells have developed an array of nonenzymatic and enzymatic mechanisms for scavenging this toxic component. Neutralization by isoprenoids such as carotenoids and tocopherols (10Krinsky N.I. Pure Appl. Chem. 1979; 51: 649-660Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Fryer M.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1992; 15: 381-392Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar) are examples of nonenzymatic mechanisms. Plants and other organisms also rely on the enzymatic scavenging of ROS by catalase, glutathion peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase (6Foyer C.H. Descourvières P. Kunert K.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 507-523Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The damaging effects of ROS have been examined during plant stress (12Elstner E.F. Wagner G.A. Schutz W. Curr. Top. Plant Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 7: 159-187Google Scholar) and senescence (7Thompson J.E. Legge R.L. Barber R.F. New Phytol. 1987; 105: 317-344Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2057239879,"Prior investigations document that proliferative signaling cascades, under some circumstances, initiate apoptosis, although mechanisms that dictate the final outcome are largely unknown. In COS-7 cells, ceramide signals Raf-1 activation through Ras (Zhang, Y., Yao, B., Delikat, S., Bayoumy, S., Lin, X. H., Basu, S., McGinley, M., Chan-Hui, P. Y., Lichenstein, H., and Kolesnick, R.

Ceramide signaled apoptosis in BAD-expressing cells by a pathway involving sequentially kinase suppressor ofRas (KSR)/ceramide-activated protein kinase, Ras, c-Raf-1, and MEK1. Downstream, this pathway linked to BAD dephosphorylation at serine 136 by prolonged inactivation of Akt/PKB. Further, mutation of BAD at serine 136 abrogated ceramide signaling of apoptosis. The present study indicates that when ceramide signals through the Ras/Raf cascade, the availability of a single target, BAD, may dictate an apoptotic outcome.

It is generally accepted that a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine aspartate proteases or caspases serve as effectors of the apoptotic response (1Salvesen G. Dixit V. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). The upstream elements that lead to this committed stage are presently the focus of intensive investigation. For cytokine receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 receptor superfamily, a death domain adaptor protein system, activated upon ligand binding, appears to initiate the apoptotic response by linking directly to caspases. For stresses that signal independent of cytokine receptors, the mechanisms of integration into the effector caspase system are less clear. One pathway that appears to be a generic upstream signaling mechanism for induction of apoptosis is the sphingomyelin signaling system (2Pena L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,3Smyth M.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ceramide is the second messenger of this pathway and is generated by hydrolysis of plasma membrane sphingomyelin through the action of either a neutral or acidic sphingomyelinase, or by de novosynthesis via the enzyme ceramide synthase. The sphingomyelin pathway induces differentiation, proliferation or senescence depending on the cell type. Very often, however, the outcome of signaling through this pathway is apoptosis. Several lines of evidence support the role of ceramide as a signal for the apoptotic response. In a variety of cell types, ceramide generation precedes morphological and biochemical manifestations of apoptosis. Further, specific inhibitors of ceramide synthase, such as the fungal toxin fumonisin B1, antagonize apoptosis mediated by de novoceramide synthesis (4Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Perhaps most convincingly, in systems where the acid sphingomyelinase appears to regulate ceramide signaling of apoptosis such as in peripheral B cells or endothelium, genetic deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase compromises ceramide generation and apoptosis (5Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.

Recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the heat stress response is mediated by synthesis of sphingolipids (7Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J.

The development of thermotolerance is defective in mutants incapable of synthesizing ceramide, and sphingolipid analogs bypass the defect, restoring growth at elevated temperature. These data indicate that ceramide signaling is evolutionarily older than the caspase/apoptotic death response system, and hence these two pathways must have been linked later in development. Ceramide-induced apoptosis occurs via two independent mechanisms. Ceramide signals, perhaps through the Jun kinase cascade, the transcriptional regulation of gene products, such as Fas ligand or TNFα, that mediate the death response (6Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Weinstock C. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22173-22181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Alternately, ceramide induces apoptosis directly through a mechanism inhibitable by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (11Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S. Fassy F.

This transcriptionally independent pathway for induction of apoptosis has been observed in cytoplasts (14Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar) and recently reconstituted in a cell-free system (15Susin S. Zamzami N. Larochette N. Dallaporta B. Marzo I. Brenner C. Hirsch T. Petit P. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The target for ceramide and the signaling system involved in this latter death paradigm are unknown. Recent investigations have begun to elucidate a pathway for induction of apoptosis through the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAD (16Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Bcl-2, originally discovered at the chromosomal breakpoint of t(14;18)-bearing follicular B cell lymphomas, is overexpressed in many tumors, and inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli (20Strasser A. Huang D.C. Vaux D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F151-F178PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 22Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms for the anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-2 family members have been proposed, including the regulation of the opening of the inner mitochondrial pore necessary for permeability transition (23Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B.

Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Whether some or all of these mechanisms predominate is presently unclear. It is established, however, that Bcl-2 family members homo- and heterodimerize, and that this regulates the tendency to undergo apoptosis upon exposure to stress stimuli. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members may act by more than one mechanism. For activation of BAD, phosphorylation at two sites, serine 112 and 136, determines heterodimerization with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL at the mitochondria (16Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 17Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated BAD binds to and inactivates Bcl-xL and to a lesser extent Bcl-2, resulting in a pro-apoptotic state, whereas phosphorylated BAD dissociates from Bcl-2 and is bound and sequestered by 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm, strengthening the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-2. Recent studies showed that the kinase which phosphorylates serine 136 of BAD in primary neurons is Akt/PKB (18Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). The kinase selective for serine 112 has not been identified. The cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation appears relevant to the mechanism by which interleukin-3 depletion signals, and interleukin-3 repletion inhibits, induction of apoptosis in FL5.12 lymphoid progenitor cells (17Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar, 19del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Further, the mechanism by which other pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as BAK or BAX signal apoptosis is fundamentally different from BAD since phosphorylation sites analogous to serine 112 and serine 136 are not present in these proteins. The present studies link phosphorylation of BAD to ceramide signaling of apoptosis. We show that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAD confers ceramide-induced apoptosis onto COS-7 cells, which are ordinarily resistant. Ceramide signals apoptosis in BAD-expressing cells by a pathway involving sequentially kinasesuppressor of Ras (KSR)/ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK), Ras, Raf-1, and MEK1, which links distally to BAD through Akt/PKB. These investigations show that the availability of a single target, in this case BAD, converts the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is usually proliferative and/or anti-apoptotic, into a pro-apoptotic signaling pathway. COS-7 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, as described (28Zhang Y.

COS-7 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in six-well plates and after 24 h transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the indicated quantities of plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated in transfection media for 12–16 h and switched back to growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) containing Me2SO (control) or indicated amounts of C2-ceramide (Biomol). BAD expression was not affected by co-transfection with Ras or kinase constructs. For experiments using the MEK1 inhibitor, cells were pretreated with 50 μm PD98059 (New England Biolabs) or 0.1% Me2SO for 1 h prior to incubation in growth media containing 0.2% Me2SO or 100 μmC2-ceramide. After 6 h, detached and adherent cells were harvested by pooling treatment media, phosphate-buffered saline washes, and trypsinized cells. Pooled cells were pelleted (400 ×g), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were stained with 24 μg/ml bisbenzamide (Hoechst-33258, Sigma), and 600 cells were scored for apoptosis by nuclear morphology as described (29Oberhammer F. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Burch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). To determine Ras dependence of Raf-1 activation by KSR/CAPK, COS-7 cells (3 × 106) were seeded in 150-mm plates and transiently transfected as above with 10 μg each of KSR (pCDNA3-KSR), Raf-1 (pCDNA3-Flag-Raf), RasN17 (pZip H-Ras17N), RasN17N69 (pZip H-Ras17N/69N), or RasN17S186 (pZip H-Ras17N/186S), as indicated. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin/soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mmNaVO4). The lysate was centrifuged at 8000 ×g for 5 min, and Flag-tagged Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from the post-nuclear supernatant at 4 °C using agarose-conjugated anti-Flag (Scientific Imaging Systems). After 4 h, immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged Raf-1 was normalized by Western blot and subjected to an immune complex kinase assay using kinase-inactive MEK1 (K97M-MKK1) as substrate, as described previously (28Zhang Y.

Phosphorylated K97M-MKK1 was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE prior to autoradiography. To investigate the effect of ceramide on Akt/PKB signaling, COS-7 cells (3 × 106), seeded in 150-mm plates and transiently transfected as above with 0.9 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-BAD, were incubated with 0.2% Me2SO or 100 μmC2-ceramide, and harvested after 3–4 h in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Endogenous Akt/PKB was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of pre-cleared post-nuclear supernatants with goat polyclonal anti-Akt sc-1618 (Santa Cruz), and an immune complex kinase assay using histone 2B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as substrate was performed as described (30Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106), seeded in 100-mm plates and transiently transfected with 0.4 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-BAD, were pretreated with 100 μm PD98059 or 0.2% Me2SO prior to incubation with 0.2% Me2SO or 100 μmC2-ceramide. After 6 h, cells were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin/soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mmNaVO4). 200 μg of post-nuclear supernatants were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Western analysis was performed with either anti-BAD sc-943 (Santa Cruz) or anti-BAD136 pAG (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Greenberg) as primary antibodies. Ceramide is a potent activator of apoptosis in a variety of cell systems (2Pena L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Smyth M.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, as much as 100 μm C2-ceramide failed to induce apoptosis in COS-7 cells at any time from 0–24 h (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Since Bcl-2 blocks ceramide-induced apoptosis in many systems (11Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S. Fassy F. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we examined the levels of Bcl-2 family members in COS-7 cells. Western analysis revealed significant levels of endogenous Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax in COS-7 cells, while the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAD was absent (data not shown). Overexpression of BAD induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 1,A and B). For these studies, 2 × 105 COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV2-BAD and after 16 h switched to growth medium. Transfection with as little as 0.01 μg of the BAD expression plasmid increased apoptosis from a basal level of 4–10% within 6 h after removing the transfection media (p < 0.001) and 0.1 μg of the pFLAG-CMV2-BAD construct increased apoptosis to 18% of the total population (Fig. 1 A). Qualitatively similar results were obtained between 6 and 12 h after removing the transfection media. Upon transfection of 0.1 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-BAD, elevated apoptosis was detected as early as 2 h after removing the transfection media (Fig. 1 B), and was statistically significant by 4 h (p < 0.001). Although ceramide itself was ineffective (Fig. 1 B), BAD enabled ceramide to increase apoptosis nearly 3-fold at all transfected doses from 0.01 to 0.1 μg (Fig. 1 A) (p < 0.001 at all doses of BAD greater than 0.01 μg). The optimal time for this effect of ceramide was 6 h after changing of the transfection media (Fig. 1 B). Immunofluorescence studies revealed that apoptosis was restricted to cells staining positive for BAD (data not shown). BAD also conferred ceramide-induced caspase activation onto COS-7 cells as measured using a fluorogenic caspase substrate Z-DEVD-AFC (data not shown) (31Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Lu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar). Apoptosis in BAD-expressing cells was not significantly affected by adding 10 μg/ml cycloheximide 1 h prior to ceramide (data not shown). Similarly, expression of low amounts of BAD enabled ceramide to signal apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown), a cell line in which ceramide normally induces a proliferative response (32Spiegel S. Fishman P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For all subsequent studies, 0.1 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-BAD was arbitrarily selected as it generated a readily detectable base-line level of apoptosis and permitted consistent ceramide enhancement. In contrast to the natural analog of ceramide, C2-ceramide, the natural analog of dihydroceramide, DH-C2-ceramide, did not promote apoptosis (Fig. 1 C). These studies indicate an absolute requirement for the trans-double bond of the sphingoid base backbone for the induction of apoptosis by ceramide. The effect of ceramide to signal apoptosis in BAD-expressing cells was dose-dependent; as little as 30 μmC2-ceramide induced significant apoptosis (p < 0.001 versus BAD alone) and a maximal effect occurred with 100 μm C2-ceramide (Fig. 1 D). The next set of experiments examined the effects of KSR/CAPK, a putative target for ceramide, on BAD-mediated apoptosis. KSR was originally defined in genetic screens as downstream of Ras and either upstream or parallel to Raf-1 (33Kornfeld K. Hom D.B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 34Sundaram M. Han M. Cell. 1995; 83: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 35Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory provided evidence that CAPK (36Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) is the mammalian counterpart of KSR (28Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.H. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We showed that KSR/CAPK phosphorylates c-Raf-1 on Thr269 increasing its activity toward MEK1, leading to increased signaling through the MAPK cascade. Ceramide, but not other lipid second messengers enhanced KSR/CAPK activity in vitro and in vivo. For the present studies, the KSR construct pCDNA3-KSR, which is constitutively active when expressed in COS-7 cells (28Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.H. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), was transfected with or without BAD. At all doses of pCDNA3-KSR up to 3 μg/2 × 105 cells, KSR, like ceramide, failed to initiate apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). However, BAD enabled KSR to signal apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001 at all doses of KSR greater than 1 μg). Co-expression of the kinase-inactive KSR (KI-KSR) construct pcDNA3-KSR(D683A/D700A), generated by substitution of alanine residues for conserved aspartates, failed to stimulate apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). In fact, KI-KSR blocked ceramide-induced apoptosis in BAD-expressing cells (C2-ceramide+KI-KSR+BADp < 0.001 versusC2-ceramide+BAD). Neither KSR construct affected BAD expression (data not shown). Thus, KI-KSR serves dominant-negative function during ceramide signaling of apoptosis mediated by BAD. These studies place KSR/CAPK downstream of ceramide in a pathway leading to apoptosis. Similarly, dominant-positive Raf-BXB (37Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) alone failed to initiate apoptosis in COS-7 cells, but signaled apoptosis when co-expressed with BAD (Fig. 2 C) (Raf-BXB+BAD p < 0.001versus BAD alone). Further, expression of dominant-negative Raf-C4 (37Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) failed to signal apoptosis in BAD-expressing cells, yet blocked the effect of C2-ceramide (Fig. 2 D) (C2-ceramide+Raf-C4+BAD p < 0.001versus C2-ceramide+BAD). Neither Raf construct affected BAD expression (data not shown). Additional studies were performed to molecularly order KSR and Raf-1 in signaling of the apoptotic response. Table I shows that dominant-negative KSR failed to block dominant-positive Raf-BXB-induced apoptosis, whereas dominant-negative Raf-C4 blocked constitutively active KSR-induced apoptosis (BAD+KSR+Raf-C4 p < 0.001versus BAD+KSR). Hence, the target for ceramide, KSR/CAPK, as anticipated, is ordered upstream of Raf-1 in the signaling of apoptosis in BAD-expressing COS-7 cells. Furthermore, the specific chemical inhibitor of MEK1, PD98059 (38Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), completely blocked ceramide-induced apoptosis (n = 2, data not shown). In contrast, dominant negative SEK-1 failed to prevent ceramide-induced apoptosis (data not shown).Table IMolecular ordering of KSR and c-Raf-1 in apoptosisTransfectionApoptotic cellsEmpty vectors30 (5%)BAD119 (19%)BAD + Raf-BXB275 (45%)BAD + Raf-BXB + KI KSR272 (45%)BAD + KSR276 (46%)BAD + KSR + Raf-C4135 (22%)Ceramide → KSR → Raf → MEK → → BADCOS-7 cells were transiently transfected as in Fig. 1 with 0.1 μg of BAD (pFLAG-CMV2-BAD) or (pFLAG-CMV2), and 1 μg each of Raf-BXB (pRSV-BXB Raf), KI KSR (pCDNA3-KSR (D683A/D700A)), or Raf-C4 (pRSV-C4 Raf) or the appropriate empty vectors (pFLAG-CMV2, pCDNA3 and pRSV), to a total of 2.1 μg of plasmid. Apoptosis was quantified in 600 cells as in Fig. 1. These data represent three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells were transiently transfected as in Fig. 1 with 0.1 μg of BAD (pFLAG-CMV2-BAD) or (pFLAG-CMV2), and 1 μg each of Raf-BXB (pRSV-BXB Raf), KI KSR (pCDNA3-KSR (D683A/D700A)), or Raf-C4 (pRSV-C4 Raf) or the appropriate empty vectors (pFLAG-CMV2, pCDNA3 and pRSV), to a total of 2.1 μg of plasmid. Apoptosis was quantified in 600 cells as in Fig. 1. These data represent three independent experiments. To evaluate a requirement for Ras in executing apoptosis through BAD, initial studies determined whether Ras was necessary for KSR/CAPK signaling. For these studies, Raf-1 was co-expressed with the appropriate empty vectors, KSR, and/or Ras constructs for 48 h, and then Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated, and an immune complex kinase assay performed with kinase-inactive MEK1 as substrate (Fig. 3 A). As described previously (28Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.H. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), co-expression of KSR with Raf-1 resulted in marked Raf-1 activation. This effect was blocked by dominant-negative RasN17 (39Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), but not by RasN17N69 (40Quilliam L.A.

Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), mutants which interfere with the dominant negative function of RasN17 and serve as its controls. Similar results were obtained when Raf-1 activity was assessed by reconstituting the entire MAPK cascade (data not shown). These studies indicate that Ras is required for KSR/CAPK activation of Raf-1. Moreover, RasN17, but not RasN17N69 or RasN17S186, blocked ceramide-induced apoptosis in BAD-expressing COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 B) (RasN17+BAD+C2-ceramide p < 0.001 versus BAD+C2-ceramide). These findings indicate that Ras regulates ceramide signaling of apoptosis through the MAPK cascade. Phosphorylation of BAD on serine 112 or 136, canonical 14-3-3 recognition sites, results in dissociation of BAD-Bcl-2/Bcl-XL heterodimers, BAD inactivation by sequestration as a cytoplasmic complex with 14-3-3, and an anti-apoptotic state (16Wang H.-G.

https://openalex.org/W2160906312,"Mononuclear phagocytes play a major role in immune and inflammatory responses. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces monocytes to express a variety of genes by activating the NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factor family. Recently, we have reported that the tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 signaling pathways activate two kinases, IKK1 and IKK2. Phosphorylation of the IkappaB cytoplasmic inhibitors, IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, and IkappaBepsilon, by these kinases triggers proteolytic degradation and the release of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins into the nucleus. At present, the role of the IKKs in LPS signaling has not been investigated. Here, we report that LPS induces IKK activity in human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells. The kinetics of activation of kinase activity in monocytic cells are relatively slow with maximal activity observed at 60 min, which coincides with the degradation of IkappaBs and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. In transfection experiments, overexpression of wild type IKK1, a dominant negative mutant IKK1 (K44M), or wild type IKK2 did not affect LPS-induced kappaB-dependent transcription in monocytic cells. In contrast, a dominant negative mutant of IKK2 inhibited LPS induction of kappaB-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that LPS induction of kappaB-dependent gene expression in human monocytic cells requires activation of IKK2."

In our investigation of mammalian RNase MRP, we have analyzed its specific endoribonuclease activity on model R-loops.

Transcription of mtDNA is directed by cis-acting elements located at the 5′ boundary of the regulatory sequence known as the D-loop, a region which also houses the leading-strand origin of replication, OH (1Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Each of the two strands of the circular mtDNA is transcribed by bacteriophage-like mtRNA polymerase, producing polycistronic transcripts, which are processed into rRNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs (2Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Transcripts from the light (L)-strand promoter yield eight tRNAs, the message for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6, and the primer precursors for leading-strand mtDNA replication. Earlier studies provided strong evidence for transcript-priming at the mtDNA OH in human and mouse organelles (3Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 4Chang D.D. Hauswirth W.W. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, primer RNA species were found to co-purify with mtDNA in CsCl-ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradients (4Chang D.D. Hauswirth W.W. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); this result has been recently extended by the detection of in vivoRNA-primed DNA strands by polymerase chain reaction analysis (5Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In vitro mitochondrial transcription assays have shown that a significant fraction of nascent transcripts in the direction of leading-strand replication remains base-paired at the mtDNA OH (6Xu B. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3135-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that can explain the observed physical association of primer RNAs and mtDNA. Since the L-strand promoter transcripts represent genes located downstream of the DNA replication start sites, a specific RNA processing event was hypothesized for primer RNA 3′-end maturation. RNase MRP was originally identified as an activity in mitochondrial extracts that fulfilled at least one of the criteria for a specific primer maturation endonuclease (7Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that mouse RNase MRP has the capacity to process a model R-loop substrate containing the OH (8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this report, we extend these studies to examine this unusual RNA processing activity in the human mitochondrial system and further demonstrate that such processed RNA primers are capable of initiating DNA replication on a model double-stranded circular mtDNA template in vitro. RNA was synthesized by SP6 transcription generated from pK408SP which was digested with restriction endonuclease FokI. This RNA was radiolabeled with [5′-32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and T4 RNA ligase as described elsewhere (7Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Labeled RNA was purified by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used to assemble the R-loop with the supercoiled pK408SP template by the formamide annealing method described previously (9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24262-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the construction of the RNA-cDNA heteroduplex hybrid, an oligonucleotide that is complementary to position 294–314 on pK408SP (oligo HF314, 5′-d(TTGATTCCTGCCTCATCCTAT)) was annealed onto the purified radiolabeled pK408SP-derived RNA by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooling to 37 °C over 30 min. The reaction mixture was adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm spermidine, and 0.4 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10 units of AMV1 reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid was phenol-extracted, concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and then resolved in a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 45 mm Tris borate-EDTA buffer at pH 8.3. Individual species were located by autoradiography, and full-length products were excised and eluted into 0.5 mammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, overnight at room temperature. The solution containing the hybrid was ethanol-precipitated, redissolved in water, and passed through a Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) spin column. RNase MRP was purified from human KB cells, and assays were carried out as reported previously (7Chang D.D. Clayton D.A.

We detected no deoxyribonuclease activity nor any nonspecific ribonuclease activity in our final RNase MRP preparation. Oligonucleotide LRI, used previously for specific RNase MRP inhibitions (8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A.

Murine and bovine endo G preparations were kindly provided by Dr. Michael J. Lieber. Reaction conditions were identical to those in Lee and Clayton (8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) except endo G was added at various dilutions ranging from 1:1 to 1:1000. Digestion times at 37 °C were also varied for 15–120 min. Reactions were quenched by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the products were resolved as described in Lee and Clayton (8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease treatment of the endo G fractions had no effect on its nonspecific cleavage activity on the R-loop and RNA-cDNA substrates. No reproducible specific cleavage products were observed on either substrate. Sequencing-grade ribonucleases T1 and U2 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase, Escherichia coli RNase H, and RNase T2 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Micrococcal nuclease and DNase I were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Modified bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase® version 2) was purchased from Amersham Life Sciences. 1–10 pmol of radiolabeled RNA or R-loops were incubated in RNase MRP reaction buffer for 15 min at 37 °C in a total reaction volume of 25 μL. Serial dilutions ranging from 1:10 to 1:106 of RNase T1, T2, V1, and U2 were tested to generate a uniform cleavage pattern. 1 μL of appropriately diluted ribonuclease (between 1:103 and 1:104) was added to the sample and incubated at 37 °C for 10 s. RNase H reactions were carried out using 0.03 unit of enzyme and digested at 37 °C for 1 min. All reactions were quenched by phenol extraction, and samples were recovered by ethanol precipitation. Products were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 murea. General methods to generate R-loops via transcription using bacteriophage SP6 RNAP and supercoiled templates were described in Lee and Clayton (9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24262-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5–1.5 nm DNA template, 0.4 mm complete NTP mixture, and 10 units of SP6 RNAP were mixed in a total reaction volume of 100 μL. When the RNA was to be internally radiolabeled, 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (300 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) were included in the transcription mixture. Reactions were quenched by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitated. Dried pellets were redissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and applied onto a 1.5 cm × 3-cm benzoylated-naphthoylated-DEAE cellulose column as described in Lee and Clayton (9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24262-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After the ion-exchange fractionation, the mixture was passed through a 1.5 cm × 6-cm Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl. The substrate concentration was quantitated, aliquoted, and adjusted to standard RNase MRP reaction conditions. RNase MRP digestions were carried out in a total reaction volume of 25 μL; reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μmoligo LRI. Thereafter, the entire reaction mixture was passed through a Sepharose CL-4B (equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl) spin column constructed in a 3-ml syringe barrel. Negative RNase MRP controls were treated in the same manner. Samples were phenol extracted and recovered by ethanol precipitation. For DNA synthesis, the gel-filtered R-loop sample was treated with RNase MRP or mock-treated (negative control) as above; the RNase MRP reactions were inhibited by the addition of 40 μm of oligo LRI. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was adjusted to 125 μm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Pharmacia) and 13 units of modified T7 DNAP was added in a total reaction volume of 100 μL (buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mmdithiothreitol). For synthesis of radioactive DNA, the reaction mixture described above was supplemented with 25 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, after which the entire reaction mixture was passed through a 1.5 cm × 3-cm Sepharose CL4B column. Thereafter, samples were phenol-extracted, concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and resolved in denaturing gels. Primer extension analysis was carried out using oligo HF314 radiolabeled at the 5′ terminus with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Oligo HF314 was annealed, and 10 units of AMV reverse transcriptase were added as described above for the cDNA synthesis reactions. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Ribonuclease digestion of DNA synthesis reaction was carried out by incubation with 10 units of RNase T2, followed by phenol extraction. After ethanol precipitation, samples were analyzed by primer extension as described previously. Deoxyribonuclease treatment was carried out in an analogous manner but with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I. Sequenase-dideoxyribonucleotide DNA sequencing reactions were carried out as described by the kit manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Products were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. Model R-loops were reconstituted using a recombinant plasmid containing the human mtDNA OH sequence (pK408SP) and RNA synthesized in vitro using bacteriophage SP6 RNAP (10Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The reconstituted human R-loop exhibited chromatographic and electrophoretic properties (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with previously observed model R-loops (9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24262-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When the R-loop is digested with E. coli RNase H, an endoribonuclease specific for the RNA strand in an RNA-DNA heteroduplex, a biased cleavage pattern is observed, indicating a specific region of high cleavage frequency (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). These cleavage sites correspond to the mapped positions of the RNA-DNA contacts within R-loops generated by transcription (6Xu B. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3135-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, these RNA-DNA contacts localized to the guanine-rich CSB II, one of three short elements conserved between human and mouse mtDNAs (11Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5411-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Sequence mutations within this element completely abolish all transcription-coupled R-loop formation and prevent the assembly of stable R-loops by the formamide annealing method. 2D. Y. Lee and D. A. Clayton, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, under our transcription reaction and formamide annealing conditions, R-loop formation was not observed with unrelated nucleic acid sequences of comparable size and base content (data not shown). To assess the global structure of this stable R-loop, the RNA strand of the R-loop was systematically digested with ribonucleases of various specificities. In an effort to maintain a cleavage frequency of no more than one nick per RNA molecule, ribonuclease reactions were carried out using dilute enzyme concentrations and brief digestion times (1 min for RNase H reactions; 10 s for all others). Because the structure of the RNA may change after an initial cleavage event, it was important to minimize potential experimental artifacts in obtaining structural information. RNase V1 from cobra venom has been used to probe for regions of potential RNA-RNA base pairing because of its preferential cleavage of RNA in double helical or stacked base conformations (12Lowman H.B. Draper D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5396-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from those regions in RNA-DNA pairings as demonstrated by E. coliRNase H sensitivity (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), much of the full-length of the RNA was digested by RNase V1 in a semiperiodic pattern (Fig. 1 C, lane 5), implicating the participation of those residues in RNA-RNA base-pairing. RNase T2 fromAspergillus oryzae, a ribonuclease which cleaves after any unpaired residue, cleaved the RNA strand in the R-loop at those sites generally protected from RNase V1 cleavage (Fig. 1 C, lane 8), suggesting those regions to be single-stranded. Although the highly reproducible cleavage patterns may reflect a composite of multiple subpopulations of differing RNA conformations, these results indicate that the RNA strand in the R-loop is only partially base paired to the DNA template. The surprisingly complex structure of the RNA strand in the R-loop was compared with the free RNA by probing with two highly specific ribonucleases (Fig. 1 D). The cleavage patterns generated by RNase T1 from A. oryzae (specific for unpaired guanine) and RNase U2 from Ustilago sphaerogena (unpaired adenine ≫ unpaired guanine) revealed that the RNA strand in the R-loop was folded into a structure surprisingly similar to that of the free RNA. For RNase T1, differences between the free RNA and R-loop cleavage patterns were limited to the CSB II-CSB III region, where the RNA is base-paired with the DNA template as judged by the RNase H cleavage pattern. The cleavage sites located at the 3′ boundary of CSB II in the free RNA were reduced in the R-loop; likewise, the relatively efficient cleavage site located between CSB II and CSB III is protected in the R-loop (Fig. 1 D, lane 3 versus lane 4). Interestingly, the guanine residues of CSB II are well protected against RNase T1 cleavage even in the free RNA, implying that this region may be configured in a manner that is sterically occluded from the enzyme. For RNase U2, since there is only one adenine residue in CSB II, which is protected in the free RNA, there is little overall difference between the cleavage patterns of the free RNA and R-loop (Fig. 1 D, lane 6 versus lane 7), a surprising observation that has been previously reported for the mouse mtRNA sequence (9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24262-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hence, for both ribonucleases used in this assay, there is little discernible difference in the cleavage pattern between the free and R-loop form of the RNA. Although the physiological relevance for the extensively folded RNA structure in the R-loop complex is presently under investigation, our initial experimental results suggest it is likely to be important in RNase MRP substrate recognition.2 This similarity in higher order structure may also explain the ability of RNase MRP to cleave the free RNA substrate as previously reported (8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Having obtained gross structural information on the R-loop, we then asked if human RNase MRP can cleave this substrate in a physiologically relevant manner. RNase MRP was purified from human KB cells as described previously (7Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and a standard amount was added to reaction mixtures containing 0.5–1.5 nm R-loop substrate. Digestions were quenched by phenol extraction, and samples were recovered by ethanol precipitation. Reaction products were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 5 m urea and visualized by autoradiography. Addition of the human RNase MRP fraction resulted in multiple cleavage products (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). To confirm that RNase MRP catalyzed this reaction, the ribonucleoprotein composition of the holoenzyme was targeted for selective inhibition. Micrococcal nuclease was previously used to digest the RNA subunit of RNase MRP and thereby abolish enzymatic activity (13Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Science. 1987; 235: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A standard amount of the RNase MRP fraction was treated with micrococcal nuclease in the presence of Ca2+ (an essential metal cofactor), the digestion was quenched with EGTA (a calcium-specific chelator), and then assayed for R-loop processing activity by the addition of the substrate. Consistent with previous results, the observed R-loop processing activity was abolished (Fig. 2 A, lane 7), demonstrating a requirement for RNA in the R-loop cleavage reaction. The requirement for protein subunits in the reaction was tested by heat inactivation or by treatment of the enzyme fraction with proteinase K, a serine protease active on native polypeptides. After digestion of the fraction with proteinase K, all R-loop processing activity was again abolished (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). In contrast, inactivated proteinase K had no inhibitory effect (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). The specificity of the RNase MRP RNA subunit involved in the cleavage reaction was previously shown by using an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the 265-nucleotide MRP RNA (13Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Science. 1987; 235: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Addition of the antisense oligonucleotide, oligo LRI (8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), inhibited the observed R-loop cleavage reaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5). In contrast, an unrelated oligonucleotide of comparable length, oligo 5.8S, had no effect at the concentrations tested (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–10). Since we have previously shown that oligo LRI had no inhibitory effect on the related ribonucleoprotein endonuclease RNase P, these data suggest that the observed R-loop processing reaction is catalyzed specifically by RNase MRP (8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Certain antisera from humans with clinical autoimmune syndromes are known to bind particular ribonucleoproteins selectively. The Th/To human autoantiserum was previously shown to immunoprecipitate the RNase MRP ribonucleoprotein and thereby deplete enzymatic activity (14Gold H.A. Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Craft J. Science. 1989; 245: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Crude Th/To serum was adsorbed onto Staphylococcus aureusprotein A-Sepharose beads (PAS), washed, and incubated with a standard amount of the human enzyme fraction. After centrifugation, the supernatant was assayed for activity. Control experiments were carried out in parallel using serum from a normal subject. While R-loop processing was unaffected by immunoprecipitation with the normal serum (Fig. 2 C, lane 2), the Th/To serum depleted the observed R-loop processing activity (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). To determine whether the unique structure of the R-loop is required for the cleavage reaction, we assayed a simple RNA-DNA heteroduplex constructed with the same RNA substrate and its cDNA made by reverse transcription (see “Experimental Procedures”). This RNA-DNA hybrid was digested by E. coli RNase H in a nonspecific manner, yielding no oligoribonucleotides of significant length (Fig. 2 D, lane 2). In contrast, this substrate was not cleaved by RNase MRP (Fig. 2 D, lane 3), an observation consistent with previous reports (7Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 8Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This experiment also demonstrates the absence of nonspecific RNase H activities in the RNase MRP preparation. Interestingly, this type of RNA-cDNA heteroduplex was reported to be a substrate for endo G, an abundant mitochondrial endonuclease proposed to generate primers for mtDNA replication (15Côté J. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Science. 1993; 261: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, in an effort to rule out contamination of our RNase MRP preparations, purified endo G was used to obtain a cleavage pattern on our model substrates. Under our reaction conditions, endo G efficiently degraded the RNA strand as well as the DNA template of our R-loop and heteroduplex in a nonspecific manner, generating no population of oligoribonucleotides with a distinctive length (data not shown). Thus, the R-loop processing observed with our RNase MRP preparation is not due to the action of endo G. We conclude from these and the above results that the observed R-loop cleavage reaction is an activity of RNase MRP. Mapping of the cleavage sites on the R-loop was achieved by resolving the RNase MRP reaction products next to RNA sequencing ladders in polyacrylamide-urea gels (Fig. 3 A). The cleavage sites, arbitrarily labeled 1 through 7, were then compared with the positions of previously mapped sites of RNA priming and DNA synthesis initiation. Although the human in vivo mapping data are complex with regard to the extensive microheterogeneity of RNA and nascent DNA termini, we observed alignment of the majority of the RNase MRP cleavage sites with a significant number of the in vivopriming sites, most notably the major DNA synthesis initiation site positioned ∼16–20 bases downstream of CSB I, classically defined as the principal OH (Fig. 3 B, cleavage site 6). Remarkably, RNase MRP cleavage site 6 corresponds precisely with the major H-strand 5′ termini more recently mapped by Kanget al. (5Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using a polymerase chain reaction method. By inspection, the cleavage site selection followed no apparent sequence rule. This finding is consistent with previous results in the mouse system, where R-loop cleavage sites do not bear any obvious sequence homology. More importantly, the sites of cleavage for each species, differing in spatial and sequence parameters, reflect the correct placement with respect to mapping of nascent in vivo DNA strands. Conservation of accurate processing across species supports the role of RNase MRP in primer RNA formation. To address the issue of physiological relevance, we have examined whether the RNase MRP cleavage products are functional as replication primers. Although mtRNA polymerase and mtDNA polymerase (pol γ) activities have been biochemically fractionated from mammalian cell extracts, such preparations are not of sufficient purity to characterize sequential in vitro enzymatic reactions on R-loop substrates reliably. Therefore the well defined activities of recombinant bacteriophage SP6 RNAP and T7 DNAP were employed to follow the fate of the transcription-generated RNA primers as a function of RNase MRP activity. Transcription was carried out in the presence of [α-32P]UTP using SP6 RNAP on supercoiled plasmid pK408SP, and the resulting R-loop was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on benzoylated-naphthoylated-DEAE cellulose and gel-filtration (see “Experimental Procedures”). These purification steps were required to remove the abundant amount of variable-length free RNAs from those assembled into R-loops. Hybridized RNAs were demonstrated by their persistence after size-exclusion chromatography and sensitivity to E. coli RNase H (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The same procedure using the parental vector, pSP65, resulted in no detectable hybridized RNA (data not shown). Also, R-loop formation via transcription required superhelical tension in the template plasmid as previously reported (9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24262-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier observations (6Xu B. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3135-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24262-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the nonspecific smear of radioactivity in Fig. 4,lane 1 contains a group of strong transcriptional pause or termination products of ∼130 nt. If we assume that these RNA fragments represent full-length strands initiating from the promoter, their 3′ termini would map to the 5′ boundary of CSB II. A shorter autoradiographic exposure (data not shown) indicated that this cluster of bands is of the same size as those observed in Fig. 4, lane 4, and, less intensely, in lane 5. We have noticed that this effect was dependent on the NTP and enzyme concentrations as well as reaction times (data not shown), suggesting that multiple rounds of transcription may be blocked at the CSB II site perhaps due to the strong RNA-DNA base pairing in that region. It is also possible that these abortive transcripts may have remained hybridized to the DNA template by base pairing at the CSB III region, an element previously reported to influence greatly the stability of the RNA-DNA interaction (6Xu B. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3135-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We also note that due to the high specific radioactivity of the transcript, which was necessary to detect final products after the multiple reaction and purification steps, the RNA was unavoidably subject to radiochemical hydrolysis, contributing to the nonspecific background smear (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3–5). Using the transcription-generated R-loops, we next assessed the fate of the hybridized RNA following the action of RNase MRP. Digestions were carried out as before, but RNase MRP reactions were quenched by the addition of oligo LRI (40 μm) to permit rapid handling steps. Because we wished to know whether the processed RNAs remained base-paired to the DNA template, the reaction samples were passed over a high molecular weight exclusion column (Sepharose CL-4B). Recovered samples were then phenol extracted, ethanol-concentrated, and resolved in denaturing gels as before. As shown in Fig. 4, lane 3, RNase MRP generated only marginally visible discrete-length RNA fragments against the smear of radioactivity. However, the relative amount of the ∼130-nt cluster of bands is significantly reduced, indicating that these RNAs were not of sufficient stab"

Our results demonstrate that IKKs in ECs are activated by shear stress in a rapid and transient manner. This IKK activation is followed by IκB degradation and NF-κB translocation into the nucleus.

Vascular endothelial cells (ECs),1 serving as a barrier between the circulating blood and the vessel wall, are constantly exposed to fluid shear stress. The focal nature of atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial tree demonstrates the critical role of flow conditions in atherogenesis. In vitro experiments using flow channels with cultured ECs have shown that shear stress activates the platelet derived-growth factor gene (1Hsieh H.J. Li N.Q. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H642-H646PubMed Google Scholar), a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. The shear stress activation of the platelet derived-growth factor gene is through the action of the transcription factor NF-κB on the shear stress-responsive element GAGACC (2Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Resnick N. Collins T. Atkinson W. Bonthron D.T. Dewey C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In addition, electrophoresis mobility shift assay showed that nuclear extracts isolated from ECs exposed to shear stress increase their binding to oligonucleotides containing the κB enhancer element (4Lan Q. Mercurius K.O. Davies P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and a luciferase reporter driven by the κB enhancer element was shown to be shear-inducible (5Shyy J.Y.-J Li Y.-S. Lin M.C. Chen W. Yuan S. Usami S. Chien S. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of NF-κB in ECs in response to shear stress is still unclear. The transcription factor NF-κB was first identified as a protein that binds to a specific DNA site in the intronic enhancer of the immunoglobulin κ light chain gene (6Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). It is composed of homo- or heterodimers of members of the Rel family of transcription factors that control the expression of numerous genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, and growth control (see Refs. 7Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholarand 8Baldwin A.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar for review). NF-κB can be activated by many types of extracellular stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1, bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, viral infection, viral proteins, antigen receptor cross-linking of T and B cells, calcium ionophores, phorbol esters, UV radiation, free radicals, hypoxia, etc. (see Ref. 9Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van A.D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar for review). In almost all cell types, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through tight association with the inhibitory IκB proteins, including IκB-α and IκB-β. Activation of NF-κB by a variety of stimuli is dependent upon the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the IκB proteins; this allows the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus to activate various target genes. Phosphorylation of IκB proteins occurs at specific residues, Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκB-α and Ser-19 and Ser-23 of IκB-β (10Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y.

These two proteins (with 52% homology) contain an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain and several putative protein interaction motifs, including a leucine zipper and a helix-loop-helix domain at their C termini (18Zandi E.

Integrins are a family of >20 different transmembrane heterodimers composed of α- and β-subunits that are associated noncovalently. All integrins consist of a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a relatively short cytoplasmic region. The extracellular domain typically binds to an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence that is present in various extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands, e.g.fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen. The cytoplasmic domain, generally consisting of 20–70 amino acids, interacts with cytoskeletal proteins, e.g. actin filaments, and kinases in the focal adhesion sites, e.g. focal adhesion kinase and c-Src (see Refs. 22Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar and 23Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar for review). α4β1 integrin is involved in the NF-κB-mediated gene expression in leukocytes (24McGilvray I.D. Lu Z. Bitar R.

The RGD motif of the ECM appears to be involved in the NF-κB activation during cell-cell interaction (27Faure E. Lecine P. Imbert J. Champion S. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 811-823PubMed Google Scholar). There is ample evidence demonstrating that integrin-mediated signaling regulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (see Ref. 28Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar for review). We have proposed that integrins in ECs can serve as mechanosensors (29Shyy J.Y.-J. Chien S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that integrins such as αvβ3 transduce mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals to activate NF-κB through IKKs in ECs in response to shear stress. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) prior to passage 10 were used in all experiments. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator at 37 °C. BAECs were cultured on glass slides (38 × 76 mm) to confluence. A silicone gasket was sandwiched between the glass slide and an acrylic plate to create a rectangular flow channel (0.025 cm in height, 2.5 cm in width, and 5.0 cm in length). The BAECs in the 12.5-cm2 area was exposed to the applied shear stress, which was generated by circulating the tissue culture medium through a hydrostatic pump connected to the upper and lower reservoirs (30Frangos J.A. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Ives C.L. Science. 1985; 227: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The pH of the system was kept constant by gassing with humidified 95% air and 5% CO2, and the temperature was maintained at 37 °C by keeping the flow system in a temperature-controlled hood. The shear stress, determined by the flow rate perfusing the channel and the channel dimensions, was 12 dynes/cm2, which is comparable to the physiological range in the human major arteries and has been found to induce the expression of many immediately early genes in vitro (31Hsieh H.J. Li N.Q. Frangos J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Shyy J.Y.-J. Hsieh H.J. Usami S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4678-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Static control experiments were performed on BAECs kept on slides for the same duration without being exposed to shear stress. The expression plasmids hemagglutinin (HA)-IKKα and HA-IKKβ, which encode HA epitope-tagged IKKα, and IKKβ, respectively, and their catalytic inactive mutants, HA-IKKα(K44M) and HA-IKKβ(K44A), were described previously (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). HA-IKKα(AS) and HA-IKKβ(AS) are the antisense forms of HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ, respectively (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 19DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). HIV(LTR)-Luc is a luciferase reporter driven by the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat that contains two binding sites for NF-κB (33Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The various DNA plasmids were transfected into BAECs at 80% confluence using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 6 h, the transfected cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to reach confluence. Within 48 h after transfection, the BAEC monolayer was either subjected to shear stress or kept as a static control. BAECs were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with the primary antibody in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The bound primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The translocation of NF-κB was investigated by immunostaining. Confluent monolayers of BAECs were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min and incubated with 100% goat serum at 4 °C overnight. The specimens were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and polyclonal anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (1:100, v/v; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 37 °C. After being washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, the specimens were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, v/v; Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. In the inhibition experiments, BAECs were transfected with HA-IKKα(K44M) or HA-IKKβ(K44A). An anti-HA mAb (Boehringer Mannheim) and anti-NF-κB p65 antibody were used in double immunostaining (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). These antibodies were detected using rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. The immunostaining was observed under an epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescein was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm and detected between 506 and 538 nm, whereas rhodamine was excited at 568 nm and detected between 589 and 621 nm. BAECs transfected with HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate using protein A-Sepharose beads and anti-HA mAb. After centrifugation, the pelleted immunocomplex was washed with the lysis buffer, followed by washing first with a lysis buffer containing 1m urea and then with an IKK assay buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The immunocomplex was then resuspended in 20 μl of the kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μg of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-IκB-α-(1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the kinase reaction mixture was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and phosphorylated GST-IκB-α was detected by autoradiography (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). HIV(LTR)-Luc, HA-IKKα(AS), and HA-IKKβ(AS) were cotransfected into BAECs for the luciferase induction assay. The pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid, which contains a β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer, was also cotransfected to monitor the transfection efficiency. To release the reporter luciferase and β-galactosidase, the cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. ATP and luciferin were then added to the lysate in a luminometer for measuring the total light output. The level of β-galactosidase was assayed by adding the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside to the cell lysate and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of Na2CO3, and the absorbance at 410 nm was recorded. The luciferase activity was normalized with that of β-galactosidase. Khachigian et al. (2Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and Lan et al. (4Lan Q. Mercurius K.O. Davies P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) have previously shown that shear stress increases the binding activity of NF-κB, and we have demonstrated that shear stress increases the transcriptional activity of promoters containing the κB element (5Shyy J.Y.-J Li Y.-S. Lin M.C. Chen W. Yuan S. Usami S. Chien S. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test whether the shear stress induction of NF-κB transcriptional activity results from a degradation of IκB proteins and the ensuing NF-κB translocation into the nucleus, BAECs were subjected to a shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 for various time periods. Immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-IκB-α antibody revealed that shear stress caused IκB-α degradation in ECs in a transient manner (Fig. 1 A). Compared with static controls, the amount of IκB-α decreased in cells after 10 min of shearing, reached a minimal level at 30 min, and began to increase at 60 min. At 2 h after shearing, cellular IκB was at the same level as static controls. Immunostaining of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated that the temporal response of NF-κB translocation was comparable to that of IκB-α degradation. In static ECs, NF-κB was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, but 15 min of shearing caused some of the nuclei to become anti-NF-κB antibody immunostaining-positive, indicating the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. At 30 min after shearing, NF-κB was mainly localized in the nucleus, and at 45 min, NF-κB began to reappear in the cytoplasm. Antibody specificity was verified by the absence of NF-κB immunostaining in control experiments in which nonimmune serum was used instead of the primary antibody (i.e. polyclonal anti-NF-κB p65 antibody). Recent findings indicate that IκB proteins are specifically phosphorylated by IKKs, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation by proteasome (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 19DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). To investigate whether shear stress activates IKKs to up-regulate the NF-κB signaling pathway in ECs, BAECs were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ and subjected to shear stress experiments. Using GST-IκB-α-(1–54) as the substrate, immunocomplex kinase activity assay showed that IKK activity associated with HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ was increased by shear stress, similar to the IKK activity induced by the treatment of TNF-α (Fig. 2). The shear stress activation of IKKs occurred as early as 5 min, peaked at 30 min, and returned to the basal level 2 h after shearing. Densitometric analysis showed that the peak activity was three times the static controls. The temporal change of IKK activity is similar to that of IκB degradation (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that shear stress activates IKKs, which phosphorylate IκB proteins to cause their degradation. To test whether inhibition of IKKs abolishes shear stress-induced NF-κB translocation, BAECs were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-IKKα(K44M) and HA-IKKβ(K44A), the respective mutants of catalytic inactive HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 19DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). In parallel control experiments, cells were transfected with wild-type HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ. The transfected BAECs were subjected to a shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 for 30 min or kept as static controls. Double immunostaining using anti-HA and anti-NF-κB p65 antibodies was performed to detect NF-κB translocation in the plasmid-transfected cells. Whereas anti-HA antibody identified the transfected cells, anti-NF-κB p65 antibody revealed the distribution of NF-κB in these transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3, shear stress induced the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in the non-transfected cells. In contrast, the transfection of HA-IKKα(K44M) and HA-IKKβ(K44A) blocked the NF-κB translocation induced by shear stress. In parallel control experiments, the transfection of wild-type HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ did not affect the shear-induced translocation of NF-κB (data not shown). HA-IKKα(AS) and HA-IKKβ(AS) encode the antisense forms of HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ, respectively (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 19DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). HIV(LTR)-Luc is a shear-inducible construct, with its induction mediated by the κB element (5Shyy J.Y.-J Li Y.-S. Lin M.C. Chen W. Yuan S. Usami S. Chien S. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further confirm that the shear stress-increased NF-κB transcriptional activity is regulated by the IKKs, HIV(LTR)-Luc was cotransfected with HA-IKKα(AS) or HA-IKKβ(AS). As shown in Fig. 4, in BAECs cotransfected with HIV(LTR)-Luc and the pSRα3 parental vector, shear stress caused an increase in luciferase activity to 3.2-fold of the static controls. However, cotransfection with HA-IKKα(AS) or HA-IKKβ(AS) or a combination of both abolished this shear stress induction of luciferase activity. The data presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 show that application of shear stress to ECs activates NF-κB through the induction of IKKs. An important question is what are the upstream molecules that mediate the mechanotransduction to activate IKKs. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by shear stress is similar to that induced by attachment of cells to the ECM or incubation of cells with beads coated with integrin ligands or anti-integrin antibodies (see Ref. 29Shyy J.Y.-J. Chien S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar for review). Thus, we investigated whether integrins regulate the shear stress activation of IKKs in ECs. Confluent monolayers of BAECs transfected with HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ were preincubated for 3 h with LM609, a mAb against the abundant endothelial αvβ3 integrin. With such an incubation, the applied antibody has been shown to gain access to the abluminal side of the cells (35Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy J.Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). A shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 was applied to these LM609-incubated cells for 30 min, followed by immunocomplex kinase assay for HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ. As shown in Fig. 5, preincubation of BAECs with LM609 attenuated shear stress activation of these HA-IKKs, as indicated by the decreased phosphorylation of GST-IκB-α-(1–54) compared with cells that had been exposed to mouse IgG. These results suggest that αvβ3 integrin is involved in the mechanotransduction that mediates the shear stress activation of IKK pathways. Protein-tyrosine kinases in the focal adhesions are commonly involved in integrin-mediated signal transduction (see Ref. 36Parsons J.T. Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J. Leu T.H. Richardson A. Otey C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 18 (suppl.): 109-113Crossref Google Scholar for review). To examine the roles of protein-tyrosine kinases in shear stress activation of IKKs, confluent monolayers of BAECs transfected with HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ were pretreated with a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), followed by shear stress experiments and immunocomplex kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 5, pretreatment of BAECs with genistein attenuated shear stress activation of HA-IKKs. Integrin-mediated signal transduction is usually investigated in cells adhered to the ECM. Many of these signaling events are similar to those involved in cellular responses to shear stress (see Ref. 29Shyy J.Y.-J. Chien S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar for review). To further confirm that IKK can be activated by integrin-mediated signal transduction, HA-IKKα- and HA-IKKβ-transfected BAECs in suspension were allowed to adhere to a fibronectin-coated surface and then subjected to immunocomplex kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 6, the temporal response of these HA-IKKs during EC adhesion was similar to that in ECs exposed to shear stress. The peak activity occurred at 15 min; by 1 h after cell attachment, the activity was at a basal level similar to that in the suspension. In addition to fibronectin, the activation of IKKs was also observed in cells adhered to vitronectin and collagen, but not to poly-l-lysine (data not shown). Reperfusion injury results in many responses, including the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of genes that are mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB (see Ref. 37Blake D.R. Winyard P.G. Marok R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 723: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar for review). The sudden application of shear stress to ECs cultured in a flow channel mimics the reperfusion process in the vessels. Using such an in vitro model, we (5Shyy J.Y.-J Li Y.-S. Lin M.C. Chen W. Yuan S. Usami S. Chien S. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and others (2Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin.

In this investigation on the upstream signal transduction pathway leading to the shear stress induction of NF-κB in ECs, we found that shear stress activates an IKK/NF-κB pathway and that this is at least in part mediated by integrins such as αvβ3 integrin. The recently identified IKKα and IKKβ constitute two components of the IKK complex that phosphorylates the serine residues in IκB (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Specific serine phosphorylation, such as at Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκB-α, leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 19DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The temporal responses of ECs to shear stress in terms of IKK activation, IκB degradation, NF-κB translocation, and NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation reveal the following events. Under static condition, NF-κB in ECs is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the binding of IκB. Shear stress activates IKKs, which phosphorylate IκB to lead to its degradation. As a consequence, the NF-κB released from the NF-κB·IκB complex translocates into the nucleus to activate its target genes. In addition to the augmented expression of the NF-κB-mediated genes, the functional consequences of shear stress activation of the IKK/NF-κB pathway in ECs may also include the modulation of cell survival, apoptosis, and motility. During the preparation of this manuscript, Scatena et al. (38Scatena M. Almerida M. Chasson M.L. Nelson R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) reported that adhesion of ECs to osteopontin activates NF-κB and thus rescues cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. It was further suggested that the NF-κB activation through αvβ3integrin mediates this EC survival since anti-β3 integrin mAb F11 blocks NF-κB activity and induces EC apoptosis. The activation of NF-κB by TNF, ionizing radiation, or the rasproto-oncogene was found to protect cells from apoptosis (39Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers G.K. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 40Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation enhances apoptotic killing by these reagents, but not by apoptotic stimuli that do not activate NF-κB. Recent studies showed that shear stress protects ECs from apoptosis: TNF- or H2O2-induced EC apoptosis is inhibited by preconditioning the EC monolayer with a shear stress of 15 dynes/cm2 (42Hermann C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3588-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 43Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Although the anti-apoptotic effects of shear stress have been linked to the production of nitric oxide (42Hermann C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3588-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to investigate whether the augmented IKK/NF-κB pathway is also involved. αvβ3integrin, in conjunction with activated protein kinase C, promotes the migration of FG carcinoma cells on vitronectin (44Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide-containing κB element, when introduced into FG carcinoma cells, inhibited the NF-κB-mediated cell motility (45Yebra M. Filardo E.J. Bayna E.M. Kawahara E. Becker J.C. Cheresh D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In a disturbed flow field, there is a net EC migration directed away from the region of the high shear stress gradient (46Tardy Y. Resnick N. Nagel T. Gimbrone M.J. Dewey C.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3102-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This organized migration pattern under disturbed flow conditions is accompanied by a >2-fold increase in cell motility. Thus, shear stress activation of the IKK/NF-κB pathway and of protein kinase C (47Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H150-H156PubMed Google Scholar) may regulate EC motility, which would be important for the morphological remodeling of ECs. Many extracellular stimuli activate NF-κB, presumably acting through IKK due to its specificity in phosphorylating IκB (19DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 20Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). However, the upstream signaling events activated by the various stimuli that converge at IKKs have not yet been clearly established. There is increasing evidence to indicate that integrins are important in mechanotransduction in cells in response to mechanical stimuli (see Ref. 29Shyy J.Y.-J. Chien S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar for review). Indeed, the results in Fig. 5 suggest that integrins are directly involved in the shear stress activation of IKKs in ECs. The integrin-mediated signaling during cell adhesion to the ECM often results in an increase in the activity of tyrosine kinases in the focal adhesion sites, including focal adhesion kinase and Src family proteins (see Ref. 28Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar for review). Previous studies have shown that shear stress activates focal adhesion kinase and Src family kinases (35Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy J.Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 48Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin.

Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The inhibition of IKKs by genistein (Fig. 5) and the activation of IKKs when ECs attached to the ECM (Fig. 6) further confirmed that integrins are upstream molecules modulating IKKs. The observations that the isolated IKK complex from unstimulated cells can be activated in vitro by MEKK and that overexpression of MEKK in cells leads to the phosphorylation of IκB-α (50Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) indicate that the IKK/NF-κB pathway can be activated by MEKK. We have previously shown that Ras and MEKK modulate shear stress activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase since dominant-negative mutants of Ras and MEKK block c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in ECs (51Li Y.-S. Shyy J.Y.-J. Li S. Lee J. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Taken together, the previous studies suggest that integrins are activated by shear stress. As a consequence, the Ras/MEKK pathway is activated in a focal adhesion kinase- and c-Src-dependent manner, which in turn causes the activation of IKKs. In addition to integrins, other upstream signaling molecules such as the TNF receptor (TNFR), CD95 (Fas/Apo-1), and ROS may also be involved in the shear stress activation of IKKs. In the TNF induction of NF-κB, the signal transduces through the TNFR, TNFR-associated factor 2, and NF-κB-inducing kinase (52Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 53Hsu H. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Elliott R. Kelley M. Boyle W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13471-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). NF-κB-inducing kinase is an IKK kinase that has been shown to activate IKKs, possibly through a direct interaction (21Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 34Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In addition to the TNFR, NF-κB-inducing kinase is also involved in CD95-mediated NF-κB activation (52Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). We have found that shear stress causes the clustering of membrane-associated proteins such as Flk-1, which is a receptor for the vascular endothelium growth factor. 2K.-D. Chen and J. Y.-J. Shyy, unpublished results. It is likely that shear stress activates the TNFR and CD95 through a similar clustering-dependent mechanism and that this in turn leads to the activation of the NF-κB-inducing kinase/IKK pathway. The NF-κB/IκB pathway is potentiated by ROS, but attenuated by antioxidants (see Ref. 37Blake D.R. Winyard P.G. Marok R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 723: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar for review). Application of shear stress to ECs induces the production of ROS (54Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Shyy J.Y.-J. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although the nature of the shear stress induction of ROS is still unknown, it is likely that the shear-generated ROS also modulates the activation of IKKs."

Vertebrates protect themselves against excessive blood loss by activating blood clotting mechanisms that are induced by platelet aggregation at the site of injury. To feed effectively, blood-sucking arthropods have developed various mechanisms that counteract these host responses (1Ribeiro J.M.C. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar, 2Law J.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 87-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Since ADP released by injured cells and by aggregating platelets is one of the most important physiological mediators of platelet aggregation (3Marcus A.J. Safier L.B. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), saliva of most blood-feeding arthropods contains large amounts of apyrase (ATP:diphosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.5) that hydrolyzes ATP and ADP into AMP and Pi and thus inhibits platelet aggregation (4Ribeiro J.M.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1987; 32: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 5Champagne D.E. Smartt C.T. Ribeiro J.M.C. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies revealed that, despite their common ability to hydrolyze ATP and ADP with approximately the same activity, apyrase preparations from different sources show wide variance in absolute activities, pH optima, and divalent cation requirements (4Ribeiro J.M.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1987; 32: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Moreover, the first two apyrases to be sequenced, those from salivary glands of the mosquitoAedes aegypti (5Champagne D.E. Smartt C.T. Ribeiro J.M.C. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and from the parasitic protozoanToxoplasma gondii (8Asai T. Miura S. Sibley L.D. Okabayashi H. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) turned out to belong to completely different enzyme families. A. aegypti salivary apyrase is a member of the 5′-nucleotidase family of enzymes; unlike vertebrate 5′-nucleotidases, however, this apyrase is a soluble protein and does not hydrolyze the ester linkage of AMP (5Champagne D.E. Smartt C.T. Ribeiro J.M.C. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In contrast, T. gondii apyrase is almost identical to an NTPase (EC 3.6.1.15) from the same organism (8Asai T. Miura S. Sibley L.D. Okabayashi H. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and belongs to a large family of ecto-ATPases, also referred to as E-ATPases (7Plesner L. Int. Rev.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33116-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), this family includes more specialized enzymes, such as chicken gizzard ATPase (16Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1076-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and yeast GDPase (19Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of sequence similarity, apyrases from both families are active with either Mg2+ or Ca2+ and are commonly referred to as (Ca2+, Mg2+)-apyrases (20Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that the apyrase activity from the bed bug Cimex lectularius is strictly dependent upon Ca2+ ions and, unlike any previously described apyrase, cannot be activated by Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ (21Valenzuela J.G. Chuffe O.M. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 557-562Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we report purification, cloning, and heterologous expression of the salivary apyrase from C. lectularius. This enzyme is clearly not homologous to the salivary apyrase from A. aegypti (5Champagne D.E. Smartt C.T. Ribeiro J.M.C. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This means that, just as blood feeding has independently evolved in different groups of insects, salivary apyrase activity that usually accompanies blood sucking has been independently acquired by these two different insects. Moreover, we found no sequence similarity between C. lectularius apyrase and any previously characterized nucleotide-binding enzymes, which indicates that it belongs to a novel type of ATPases. C. lectularius colonies were maintained at 27 °C and 65% humidity. Insects were fed every 10 days by exposing them to the shaved abdomen of an anesthetized rabbit. Salivary glands of insects of 8–10 days after feeding were dissected and stored in Hepes saline (10 mm Hepes at pH 7.0 in 150 mm NaCl) at −75 °C until needed. Before use, salivary glands were thawed and disrupted with a pestle, and the homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Apyrase activity of the fractions from different stages of purification was assayed by measuring the release of Pi from ATP or ADP in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.5), containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 2 mm nucleotides, as described previously (21Valenzuela J.G. Chuffe O.M. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 557-562Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 μmol of orthophosphate/min at 37 °C. ADP hydrolysis was also monitored by a platelet aggregation assay that was performed on a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) with a kinetic module (22Bednar B. Condra C. Gould R.J. Connolly T.M. Thromb. Res. 1995; 77: 453-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with further modifications. Briefly, apyrase preparations were incubated in a 96-well flat-bottom plate (Falcon 3912, Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) in the presence of 5 μm ADP in 50 μl of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), containing 150 mm NaCl. Aggregation was started by the addition of 50 μl of human citrated (0.38%) platelet-rich plasma (23Born G.V.R. Cross M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1963; 168: 178-195Crossref Scopus (1823) Google Scholar). The plate was then stirred continuously at room temperature, and absorbance readings at 650 nm were taken at 60-s intervals. A rapid and sharp decrease in absorbance after a lag phase indicated aggregation of platelets. With this procedure, all of the fractions resulting from a whole chromatographic procedure could be analyzed quickly and simultaneously for anti-platelet activity. Salivary gland homogenate proteins were separated by either chromatofocusing HPLC1or strong cation exchange HPLC, followed in each case by reverse-phase HPLC. Chromatographic protocols were performed using a CM4100 pump and a SM4100 dual wavelength detector (Thermo Separation Products, Riviera Beach, FL). The absorbance at 280 nm was recorded using an 80386-based microcomputer. The chromatofocusing step was performed with a Mono P column (20 × 0.5 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in the range of pH 6.3–4.0 according to the manufacturer's protocol. After equilibration of the column in 25 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.3, homogenate of 300 salivary gland pairs was adjusted to pH 6.3 and injected into the column. The proteins were eluted with Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:10 in water (pH 4.0) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and collected at 1-min intervals. Strong cation exchange HPLC was performed in an Alltech SCX macrosphere column (25 cm × 4.3 mm) (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 20 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) in 60 min with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min; fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Reverse-phase HPLC chromatography was performed with a Hamilton C18 PRP-infinity column (10 cm × 4.3 mm) (Alltech) using a linear gradient from 10 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60 min with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluted fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. An aliquot of each fraction was dried in the presence of 10 μl of BSA (1 mg/ml), resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mm Hepes saline buffer (pH 7.0), and tested for apyrase activity. Amino acid composition analysis, tryptic digestion, and internal and N-terminal sequencing of the purified apyrase were performed at the Harvard University microchemistry facility (Cambridge, MA) under the direction of Dr. William S. Lane. C. lectulariussalivary gland mRNA was isolated from 500 gland pairs using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) yielding a total of 2.8 mg of poly(A)+ mRNA. The cDNA library was made following the instructions for the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The unamplified library has a complexity of 3.5 × 105recombinants. For PCR experiments, mRNA from 100 pairs of C. lectulariussalivary glands was isolated using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). The mRNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the primer 5′-GGGGAGGCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ following the manufacturer's protocol with the exception that no radioactive nucleotides were used for the reaction. The cDNA obtained was then used as a template for the PCR reactions described below. One forward and one reverse (sense and antisense) degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed from the N-terminal sequence of the purified salivary apyrase. The forward primer was 5′-TAYGARITNGGNCAYGCNISIGGNGARAC-3′ (where I represents inosine), and the reverse primer was 5′-TCRTCYTTISINACNGCRTTYTT-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 75 °C for 5 min and then 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 40 °C, 1 min at 72 °C; and finally 5 min at 72 °C in an Ericomp PowerBlock system (San Diego, CA). The reaction mixture included 2.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 0.01% gelatin, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 1.2 units of Ampli-Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, purified using the Sephaglas Bandprep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and cloned into a PCRII vector using the TA cloning system (Invitrogen). Competent cells were transformed following the manufacturer's protocol, and white colonies were isolated and grown overnight in LB plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Plasmids from four independent clones were isolated using the Wizard Miniprep kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and the inserts were sequenced using dye terminator reactions with an automated ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After confirming that the PCR product contained the sequence coding for the N-terminal region of the Cimexapyrase, the PCR insert was excised from the plasmid withEcoRI and cleaned as described above. The PCR insert was then labeled with dUTP-digoxigenin using now specific forward and reverse primers with the following PCR conditions: 75 °C for 5 min; 94 °C for 2 min; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 42 °C, 1 min at 72 °C; and finally 5 min at 72 °C. The reaction mixture included the PCR insert as a template, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 0.01% gelatin, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, DNA labeling mix (Genius system; Boehringer Mannheim), and 2 units of Ampli-Taq polymerase (Life Technologies). The 150-base pair PCR clone labeled with dUTP-digoxigenin was used to screen a C. lectularius salivary gland cDNA library. Phage plaques were lifted with a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with the digoxigenin-labeled PCR probe using the plaque hybridization protocol of the Genius system (Boehringer Mannheim). Positive plaques were picked and plated again for a secondary screening. Well isolated positive plaques were selected, and the phagemid carrying the apyrase clone was isolated from the phage using the in vivo excision protocol from the UNI-ZAP vector manual (Stratagene). White colonies that originated from the phagemid excision protocol were isolated and grown overnight in Luria broth plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Plasmid isolation was performed using the Wizard Miniprep kit (Promega). The inserts of four isolated plasmids were sequenced as described above using the T3 and T7 primers and then by custom primers constructed from the internal sequence of the apyrase clone. A synthetic peptide (KVLIEETKIDDHKYEGVDFV) based on the predicted C-terminal region of the apyrase clone was produced at the Laboratory of Molecular Structure, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (Twinbrook Facility, Rockville, MD). Five milligrams of the synthetic peptide were conjugated to 7 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin at the molar coupling ratio of peptide to carrier of 122 and used to immunize rabbits at Spring Valley Laboratories (Woodbine, MD). Preimmune sample was taken before the first injection, and immune serum samples were taken after two and three injections, respectively. Antibody specificity was verified by ELISA of crude salivary homogenate and prepurified apyrase with immune and preimmune sera. Salivary apyrase was separated from other salivary proteins by isoelectric focusing using the PHAST system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (21Valenzuela J.G. Chuffe O.M. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 557-562Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sample eluted from a molecular sieving HPLC column was added to an applicator designed to hold 4 ml of sample. The applicator delivered the samples to a minigel with a pH range from 3 to 9, and the gel was run as described in the manufacturer's specifications. Apyrase activity was detected by submerging the gel into a solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 20 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm of ADP, ATP, or AMP. The presence of a white precipitate indicated the presence of released phosphate (apyrase activity), which was complexed with calcium in the solution to form calcium phosphate precipitate in the surface of the gel. Salivary gland proteins eluted from a molecular sieving HPLC column were assayed with preimmune and immune serum (anti-apyrase) using conventional ELISA protocols. Dilutions of preimmune and immune serum were 1:500, and dilutions for the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate; Sigma) were 1:2000. Proteins separated by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by diffusion for 40 min at 37 °C, followed by blocking with 6% BSA in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl for 1 h. Primary antibody to C. lectularius salivary apyrase peptide was used at a dilution of 1:200 in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl and was incubated for 2 h at room temperature; preimmune serum was run as a control. After three washes with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl, the membrane was incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times as described above. Bands were visualized using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine membrane peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The expression plasmid pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to express C. lectularius recombinant apyrase. Recombinant protein was made without the removal of the signal peptide to allow secretion of the produced protein into the medium. C. lectularius apyrase gene was synthesized with unique XhoI and NotI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: sense primer, 5′-GCTAGCCTCGAGATGAGGTCATCTTACAGGGTAGGGAAC; antisense primer, 5′-AAGGGAAGCGGCCGCTTATACAAAGTCAACACCTTCATA. After amplification, the PCR product was cloned directly into pCRScript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. After confirmation of the sequence, the apyrase gene was isolated from the pCRScript construct by restriction with XhoI and NotI, gel-purified, and ligated into theXhoI/NotI-restricted pCI-neo (Promega). COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were cultivated in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (complete medium). Subconfluent COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA for Cimex apyrase or with the pCI-neo vector-alone construct. Transfections were performed with the Bio-Rad electroporation system, using 200 V and 1000 millifarads in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette. Briefly, 50 μg of DNA were used for each transfection at a cell density of 107/ml. After electroporation, the cells were allowed to sit for 10 min at room temperature and then placed into 10 ml of complete medium in a 75-cm2 culture flask at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After a 16-h incubation, the supernatants were collected, and 10 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added to the cultures. This procedure was repeated daily up to 3 days after transfection. The resultant supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g 5 min after collection and kept at −20 °C for Western blotting and enzymatic assays. Control cells were transfected with the same pCI-neo plasmid lacking the insert, and supernatants were obtained as for the CL-Apy-transfected cells. COS-7 cell supernatant was concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and dialyzed against Hepes-buffered saline. Concentrated supernatant was assayed for apyrase activity as indicated above, with the modifications indicated in the figure legends. For immunoblotting, concentrated proteins of COS-7 supernatant were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose using the Novex Xcell Blot module. Membranes were blocked with 5% dried skim milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, membranes were incubated in primary polyclonal antiserum at 1:2000 dilution in 5% dried skim milk, PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated in secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate; Sigma) at 1:10,000 dilution in 5% dried skim milk, PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine membrane peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry). The salivary apyrase activity of C. lectularius was previously found (21Valenzuela J.G. Chuffe O.M. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 557-562Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to be exclusively dependent on Ca2+, to have an optimum pH of 8.5, and to hydrolyze ATP and ADP but not AMP. Additionally, the pI of the apyrase activity was determined to be 5.1. Based on this result,C. lectularius salivary homogenates were chromatofocused on a column eluting with a pH gradient from 6.3 to 4.0. A well isolated peak with apyrase activity eluted at pH 5.1, as expected (Fig. 1). The active fractions hydrolyzed ATP (Fig. 1 B) and ADP (Fig. 1 C) but not AMP (Fig. 1 D). The active fractions were further injected into a reverse-phase column, resulting in the separation of two UV-absorbing peaks (Fig. 2 A). Aliquots from the reverse-phase fractions, dried in the presence of 10 μg BSA and resuspended in buffer, allowed apyrase activity to be detected in the small peak eluting at 45 min (Fig. 2 B). An aliquot of the apyrase-containing peak was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and resulted in the presence of only one silver-stained band of approximately 40 kDa (not shown). The remaining material was enzymatically cleaved with trypsin, and three internal peptides with the following sequences were obtained: 1) TVEADDTTETYFTAFDLEGK, 2) KFETQGANVII, and 3) ALSQEAYDSK. No N-terminal sequence was attempted during this purification step.Figure 2Second purification step of C. lectularius salivary apyrase by reverse-phase HPLC. A, active apyrase fractions eluted from a chromatofocusing column were injected into a reverse-phase PRP-infinity Hamilton column and eluted with a gradient from 10 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluent was monitored at 220 nm. B, eluted fractions were dried in the presence of BSA and tested for apyrase activity using 2 mm ADP and 5 mmCaCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Later, we found that using strong cation exchange HPLC at the first step resulted in even more effective purification of C. lectularius salivary apyrase. After cation exchange chromatography, both apyrase and anti-platelet activities co-eluted (Fig. 3). Additionally, this fraction inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation when using a low dose (5 μg/ml) of collagen (not shown). The specific activity for ADP hydrolysis at this step was 379 units/mg protein (Fig. 3). The active apyrase fraction was submitted to reverse-phase chromatography. Aliquots of the fractions were dried in the presence of 10 μg of BSA and tested for apyrase activity. A well isolated peak with the same retention time as in the first purification strategy showed apyrase activity (data not shown). Edman degradation of this protein revealed the sequence YELGHASGETNANSKYPLTTPVEENLKV?FKIGVISDDDKNAVSKDESNT. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified apyrase was used to design oligonucleotide primers for a PCR reaction using as a template cDNA of C. lectularius salivary glands. A single PCR product of 150 base pairs was obtained, and its sequence was found to correspond to the N-terminal region of the native C. lectularius apyrase. This PCR product was then labeled by digoxigenin and used to screen a C. lectularius salivary gland cDNA library. Two positive clones of approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs in length were obtained and sequenced. Their sequences turned out to be identical, and each contained a single open reading frame of 1092 base pairs. We sequenced 1354 base pairs of the isolated apyrase clone, which contained an open reading frame coding for 364 amino acids (Fig. 4). The sequences of three internal tryptic peptides of C. lectularius apyrase were all represented in the deduced protein, and its sequence from Tyr-36 to Thr-85 coincided with the N-terminal sequence of purified C. lectularius apyrase obtained by Edman degradation (Fig. 4,underlined). The first 35 amino acids of the predicted protein were thus considered to form the signal peptide and the remaining 329 amino acids to constitu"
https://openalex.org/W2045371776,"The CD19-CD21-CD81 complex regulates signal transduction events critical for B lymphocyte development and humoral immunity. CD81, a molecule with 4 transmembrane domains, member of the tetraspan superfamily, is engaged, together with other tetraspans such as CD9, CD53, CD63, and CD82, in multimolecular complexes containing β1 integrins and major histocompatibility complex antigens. Here we demonstrate that two other tetraspans, CD82 and the early B cell marker CD9, are coimmunoprecipitated with CD19 from Brij97 lysates of B cell lines. Moreover, CD9 was coprecipitated from lysates of purified CD10+ early B cells. These associations were confirmed by the cocapping of CD19 with CD9 or CD82. The CD9/CD19 association was disrupted in the presence of digitonin, contrary to the CD81/CD19 association, indicating that CD9 and CD81 interact with CD19 in different ways. The CD9/CD81 association is also disrupted in the presence of digitonin, suggesting that CD9 associates with CD19 only through CD81. To characterize the regions involved in the CD81/CD19 association, two reciprocal CD9/CD81 chimeric molecules were tested for the association with CD19, but none of them could be coprecipitated with CD19 in digitonin, indicating that the domain of CD81 responsible for its association with CD19 is complex. Finally, engagement of CD9 could induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of different proteins, including CD19 itself, suggesting that the CD9/CD19 association is functionally relevant. Thus, a physical and functional link is formed between the CD19-CD21-CD81 complex and the integrin-tetraspan complexes, which is dynamically modulated in the process of B cell differentiation.

CD19, the earliest cell surface molecule related to B lineage differentiation, has been shown to provide a costimulatory signal for activation through the B cell receptor. Co-ligation of CD19 with the B cell receptor decreases the threshold for antigen-dependent stimulation by at least 2 orders of magnitude (1Carter R.H. Fearon D.T. Science. 1992; 256: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The important role of CD19 in B lymphoid lineage is further supported by transgenic experiments. CD19-deficient mice have an important reduction in serum immunoglobulins levels and an impaired response to T cell-dependent antigens (2Engel P. Zhou M.-J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Because the ability of CD19-deficient B cells to undergo differentiation, secrete antibodies, and switch isotype in vitro is not overtly impaired, it has been suggested that the hypogammaglobulinemia could result from defects at earlier stages of B cell activation (3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4Sato S. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11558-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Conversely, mice overexpressing CD19 have a dramatic alteration in B cell development in bone marrow, whereas mature B cells demonstrate higher in vitro proliferative response (2Engel P. Zhou M.-J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S.

Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). One way of CD19 cross-linking to the B cell receptor is through its association with CR2 (complement receptor 2/CD21) after preimmune recognition of an immunogen by the complement system (5Fearon D.T. Carter R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The presence of at least 2 other molecules in the CD19-CD21 complex (6Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar, 7Martin P. Papayannopoulou T. Science. 1982; 216: 1233-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Takahashi S.

Immunol. 1990; 145: 2207-2213PubMed Google Scholar), Leu-13/9–27, an interferon-inducible protein and CD81, a member of the tetraspan family, offers alternative or complementary means for the triggering of the CD19 transducing function. Indeed, CD81 mAb1 stimulate peripheral blood B cell proliferation and induce an increase of intracellular calcium concentrations in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of anti-IgM. CD81 antibodies also inhibit proliferation and trigger homotypic aggregation of B cell lines, as do CD19 mAb (1Carter R.H. Fearon D.T. Science. 1992; 256: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 6Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar). The use of chimeric CD19 molecules has provided evidence that CD21, CD81, and Leu-13 are not required for CD19 to trigger a costimulatory signal (9Bradbury L.E. Goldmacher V.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2915-2927PubMed Google Scholar,10Matsumoto A.K. Martin D.R. Carter R.H. Klickstein L.B. Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that CD19 comprises a large, conserved cytoplasmic domain able to bind directly intracellular signaling proteins (3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). By contrast, chimeric CD19 molecules unable to associate with CD81 are no longer able to trigger homotypic aggregation, suggesting that CD81 is responsible for this effect (9Bradbury L.E. Goldmacher V.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2915-2927PubMed Google Scholar,10Matsumoto A.K. Martin D.R. Carter R.H. Klickstein L.B. Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. J. Exp.

On the other hand, a strain of CD81 knock-out mice shows a reduced mobilization of cytoplasmic Ca2+ upon CD19 ligation (11Tsitsikov E.N. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10844-10849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest that CD81 could partially relay or amplify the signal initiated by CD19. We and others (12Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Billard M. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Angelisova P. Hilgert I. Horejsi V.

The components of the tetraspan web, tetraspan or non-tetraspan, are recognized by mAbs that induce similar effects such as the inhibition of cell migration in Transwell chambers (12Rubinstein E.

Lymphoid B cells express the tetraspan molecules CD53, CD81, and CD82 at all stages of ontogeny and CD9 or CD37 at specific stages of differentiation. CD37 is not detected before the appearance of surface immunoglobulins and is lost upon terminal differentiation into plasma cells. By contrast CD9 is expressed during the early stages of differentiation, lost, and reexpressed after B cell activation. These data raise the question of the roles of CD37 and CD9 in the differentiation of B cells. Because ectopic expression of CD9 stimulates the integrin-dependent migration of the Burkitt cell line Raji on fibronectin and laminin substrates (22Shaw A.R.E. Domanska A. Mak A. Gilchrist A. Dobler K. Visser L. Poppema S. Fliegel L. Letarte M. Willett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24092-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that CD9 could interfere with B cell differentiation by modulating integrin activity. We now demonstrate that together with CD81, 2 other tetraspans, CD9 and CD82, which associate with integrins in B cells (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), also associate with CD19. Consequently, a physical and functional link is formed between the CD19-CD21 complex and the tetraspan web, which is dynamically modulated in the process of B cell differentiation. The anti-tetraspan mAbs used for this study were SYB-1 and ALB-6 (CD9) (12Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Billard M. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Eur. J.

The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). The FITC-labeled CD40 mAb was from Serotec (Oxford, United Kingdom) and the FITC-labeled CD38 mAb from Becton-Dickinson (San Jose, CA). An anti-CD9 polyclonal antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a portion of the small extracellular loop of CD9, RFDSQTKSIFEQETN, cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Immunofluorescence and fluorescein labeling of mAbs were performed as described previously (12Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Billard M. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of mAbs with EZ-link-Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a Facscalibur (Becton-Dickinson). The CD19 plasmid in pCDM8 was a generous gift from Dr. B. Seed (26Stamenkovic I. Seed B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 168: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The two chimeric molecules CD81 × 9 and CD9 × 81 have been previously described (17Lagaudrière-Gesbert C. Le Naour F. Lebel-Binay S. Billard M. Lemichez E. Boucheix C. Conjeaud H. Rubinstein E. Cell Immunol. 1997; 182: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The megakaryocytic cell line HEL and the pre-B cell line NALM-6 cells have previously been described with respect to CD9 association with integrins (12Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Billard M. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Daudi and Raji are CD9-negative Burkitt cell lines. COS-7 cells are fibroblast-like kidney monkey cells that strongly express CD9. Monkey CD9 is recognized by most anti-human CD9 mAbs, including the mAb SYB-1 used in this study. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (all from Life Technologies, Cergy-Pontoise, France). Transient transfection of COS-7 cells and stable expression of CD9 and chimeric molecules in Raji and Daudi cells were performed as described previously (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Bone marrow samples were obtained from healthy individuals undergoing hip prosthesis surgery. All samples were collected on preservative-free heparin. Mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (density: 1.077 g/ml) (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Light-density mononuclear cells were washed several times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA to avoid platelet aggregation, resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated overnight in plastic culture flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air to remove accessory adherent cells. CD34+ cells were first recovered for other studies, and the remaining CD10+ cells were purified by the immunomagnetic bead (MACS) technique according to the description of the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergish Gladbach, Germany) by using a combination of biotin-labeled mAb ALB-1 and streptavidin coupled to submicroscopic magnetic beads. Surface labeling of cells with EZ-link-Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was performed as described previously (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Labeled or unlabeled cells were lysed in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% detergent, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 kallikrein inhibitory units/ml aprotinin. The detergents Brij97 (Sigma) and CHAPS (Boehringer, Meylan, France) were directly dissolved in the lysis buffer. Digitonin (Boehringer Mannheim) was first dissolved in methanol at the concentration of 10% (w/v) and then diluted in lysis buffer without CaCl2 and MgCl2. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated as described previously (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). They were then separated by 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions to obtain a better separation of CD9 and CD81 on the one hand and of the α and β chains of β1integrins on the other hand and transferred to a PVDF membrane (NEN Life Science Products). Biotinylated molecules were probed by incubation with a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham, Rainham, UK). Specific antigens were probed by a combination of biotin-labeled mAb and the streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex and revealed by chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with biotinylated mAb at 20 μg/ml, washed 3 times with RPMI 1640, and then incubated in the presence of Texas Red-labeled streptavidin (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL) for 2 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640. They were then washed three times with ice-cold medium and resuspended in cold medium containing 0.1% NaN3. Other surface antigens were probed with fluorescein-labeled mAbs. Fluorescence staining was visualized using a Leica DMR HC microscope equipped with discriminating sets of excitation and barrier filters. Appropriate controls were run to ensure the specificity of the staining observed with each set of filters. The cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640, resuspended at 107/ml, and incubated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml mAbs at 4 °C. After three washings, they were resuspended at the same concentration and exposed for various times at 37 °C to 20 μg/ml F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG. The cells were then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmsodium orthovanadate and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and proteases inhibitors. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred as described above to a PVDF membrane that was then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.6)), incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (UBI), which was probed with a peroxidase-labeled F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG and revealed by chemiluminescence. CD81 has been shown to be associated with CD19 in Burkitt B cell lines, such as Raji and Daudi, that do not express CD9. Because CD9 is the tetraspan that has the highest level of homology with CD81, with about 45% identity at the amino acids level, it was interesting to check whether CD9 could also associate with CD19. CD9-transfected Raji (Raji/CD9, Table I) cells that had been surface-labeled with biotin were solubilized in buffer containing different detergents, and the different kinds of complexes were analyzed by immunoprecipitation.Table IExpression of tetraspans and CD19 by B cell linesCell lineCD9CD81CD82CD19NALM-6++++++++++Raji−+++++++Raji/CD9+++++++++++Daudi−+++++++Daudi/CD9++++++++++Cell surface antigen expression was determined by flow cytometry.

As described previously (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), the pattern of proteins coprecipitated with CD81 or CD9 in the presence of CHAPS or Brij97 is similar and complex (Fig. 1 A). In the CD9-transfected Raji cell line, CD9 coprecipitated associated molecules with a higher intensity compared with the CD81 mAb. This is due to the presence of CD9, which hampers the precipitation of CD81 by specific mAbs (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Some of the proteins coprecipitated have been identified as HLA-DR and integrins (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Moreover, in CD9-transfected cells, CD9 and CD81 coprecipitated each other in these conditions. The patterns of precipitation were strikingly different after lysis with digitonin, since most of the complexes were disrupted, including the CD9-CD81 complexes. As described previously, CD19 was not present in CD81 immunoprecipitates collected from digitonin extracts (27Matsumoto A.K. Kopicky-Burd J. Carter R.H. Tuveson D.A. Tedder T.F. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). By contrast, CD81 (≈22 kDa) was present in CD19 immunoprecipitates of digitonin and Brij97 extracts of Raji cells, but not in CHAPS extracts. In accordance with data from the literature (6Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matsumoto A.K. Kopicky-Burd J. Carter R.H. Tuveson D.A. Tedder T.F. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), CD21 (≈140 kDa, unreduced) was clearly coimmunoprecipitated with CD19 after lysis with digitonin, but was barely detected in the presence of CHAPS or Brij97. Fig. 1 shows that a band comigrating with CD9 (≈24 kDa) is present in CD19 immunoprecipitates from Brij97 extracts of Raji/CD9 cells. This association is specific because it was not observed in the CD45 immunoprecipitate. Neither this 24-kDa protein nor CD81 was coprecipitated by CD19 mAbs in 1% CHAPS. Contrary to CD81, the 24-kDa band was not detected in the CD19 immunoprecipitates collected from digitonin extracts. Similar results were obtained when using CD9-transfected Daudi cells (Daudi/CD9, not shown). Interestingly, molecules comigrating with β1 integrins and HLA-DR antigens were also present at low levels in the CD19 immunoprecipitates of Brij97 lysates. To check that the 24-kDa band coprecipitated with CD19 was actually CD9, immunoblottings were performed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, CD19 coprecipitated CD9 after lysing the cells in Brij97 but not in digitonin or CHAPS buffer. This was observed with both Raji/CD9 (Fig. 1 B) and Daudi/CD9 cells (not shown). It was also confirmed by Western blotting that CD19 coprecipitated CD81 in the presence of digitonin or Brij97, but not in the presence of CHAPS (not shown). To check for the specificity of the CD19/CD9 association, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with CD19. These cells express both CD9 and CD81. The CD19 mAb B4 could precipitate CD9 from Brij97 extracts of CD19-transfected cells but not from untransfected cells (Fig. 2). CD9 was not coprecipitated with CD19 in the presence of digitonin. This also shows that the CD9/CD19 association can occur in a non-lymphoid environment. CD9 is constitutively expressed at high levels in the pre-B cell line NALM-6 (which does not express CD21). We wanted to determine whether a CD9/CD19 association could be detected in this cell line. Similar to the results obtained with Raji/CD9 and Daudi/CD9 cells, CD19 immunoprecipitated CD81 from both digitonin and Brij97 extracts and CD9 only from Brij97 extracts (Fig. 3). These results were obtained after surface labeling with biotin (Fig. 3 A) or after Western blotting with a CD9 mAb (Fig. 3 B). As a control, no CD9 was coprecipitated by the control CD45 mAb. CD10+ early B cells purified from normal human bone marrow express both CD9 and CD19, as shown in Fig. 4 A. Fig. 4 B shows that, in these cells, CD9 and CD81 are associated. Moreover, the CD19 mAb, but not the CD45 mAb, could also coprecipitate CD9 in Brij97 buffer, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B). CD82 is another tetraspan expressed by mature B cell lines. We attempted to determine whether this tetraspan could also associate with CD19. As shown in Fig. 5, CD82 was coprecipitated with CD19 from Brij97 extracts of Raji cells. By contrast, no CD82 could be detected in the CD10 immunoprecipitate. To demonstrate that the association of CD19 with CD9 and CD82 occurred at the surface of living cells, cocapping experiments were performed. Biotin-labeled CD9 and CD82 mAb were bound to the cells and cross-linked by Texas Red-labeled streptavidin at 37 °C. The cells were then chilled and treated with FITC-labeled CD19, CD38, or CD40 mAbs. CD19 strongly cocapped with CD9 in Raji/CD9 and NALM-6 cells (Fig. 6). As a control, CD40, in Raji/CD9, or CD38, in NALM-6 cells, did not cocap with CD9. Similarly, CD19 was found to cocap with CD82 in Raji cells. Here again, CD40 did not cocap with this antigen. The two chimeric CD9/CD81 molecules have previously been described (17Lagaudrière-Gesbert C. Le Naour F. Lebel-Binay S. Billard M. Lemichez E. Boucheix C. Conjeaud H. Rubinstein E. Cell Immunol. 1997; 182: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CD9 × 81 is composed of the first half of CD9 joined to the second half of CD81, the junction being located approximately 5 amino acids after the third transmembrane domain of CD9. CD81 × 9 is the reciprocal construction (Fig. 7 A). The two chimeric molecules were transfected in Raji cells. CD9 × 81, which is recognized by CD81 mAbs and the polyclonal antibody directed to the short extracellular domain of CD9 associated with CD82, and CD81 × 9, recognized by CD9 mAbs associated with both CD81 and CD82 (data not shown). None of these chimeric molecules were coprecipitated with CD19 in digitonin (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that sequences in both halves of the CD81 molecule are involved in the interaction with CD19. CD81 has been shown to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in mature B cells (28Schick M.R. Nguyen V.Q. Levy S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1918-1925PubMed Google Scholar). Whether CD9 could similarly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was investigated by imunoblotting stimulated cell extracts with the 4G10 mAb. Fig. 8 shows that ligation of CD9 on the surface of Daudi/CD9 cells induces the phosphorylation of proteins of apparent molecular masses of about 195, 150, 120, 95, 80, and 72 kDa. The maximum effect was observed after a 1-min incubation. Similar molecules were phosphorylated after engagement of CD81 in Daudi cells. By contrast, in Raji/CD9 cells, only an ≈95-kDa molecule was phosphorylated after engagement of either CD9 or CD81. One of the bands phosphorylated by CD9 and CD81 mAb in Raji/CD9 and Daudi/CD9 has the apparent molecular mass of CD19 (95 kDa, reduced). Moreover, CD19 ligation on the surface of either Raji/CD9 (Fig. 8) or Daudi/CD9 (Fig. 9) cells induced the phosphorylation of this molecule. Because CD19 is phosphorylated after being cross-linked on cell surface (29Chalupny N.J. Kanner S.B. Schieven G.L. Wee S.F. Gilliard L.K. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2691-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we examined whether the 95-kDa molecule phosphorylated after CD9 engagement was indeed CD19. Cell lysates were precleared with a CD19 mAb before Western blot analysis with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. As shown in Fig. 9, this led to a marked reduction of this band, but not of other bands. Conversely, analysis of the CD19 immunoprecipitates showed an increase of the level of CD19 phosphorylation following ligation of CD9. By contrast, the CD82 mAb failed to phosphorylate CD19 in Daudi/CD9 cells. That CD9 ligation could induce phosphorylation of CD19 was confirmed in Raji/CD9 cells (data not shown). One of the most striking features of the tetraspans is their ability to associate together and with identical non-tetraspan molecules, including several β1 integrins (in particular α3β1, α4β1, and α6β1), HLA class II in B cells (13Angelisova P. Hilgert I. Horejsi V. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 15Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,30Szöllösi J. Horejsi V. Bene L. Angelisova P. Damjanovich S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2939-2946PubMed Google Scholar), and CD4 or CD8 in T cells (24Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1993; 141: 6470-6481Google Scholar). These complexes are of high molecular weight as determined by cross-linking and continuous sucrose gradients (15Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and they contain several tetraspans, including multiple copies of one given tetraspan (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The complexes may contain several types of non-tetraspan molecules, for instance β1integrins and HLA-DR antigens (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). When a tetraspan is expressed after transfection, it is apparently included into preexisting complexes (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These features, together with the fact that mAbs directed to tetraspans and associated molecules produce similar effects (17Lagaudrière-Gesbert C. Le Naour F. Lebel-Binay S. Billard M. Lemichez E. Boucheix C. Conjeaud H. Rubinstein E. Cell Immunol. 1997; 182: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), indicate the existence on cell surface of macromolecular complexes that we call “the tetraspan web” (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The CD81 tetraspan belongs in B cells to another molecular complex whose central element, CD19, plays a role in the regulation of B cell activation (3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Fearon D.T. Carter R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It is not known whether, in B cells, CD81 is included into two different types of complexes or whether larger types of complexes are formed by the combination of these complexes. In favor of this latter hypothesis, we provide evidence that two other tetraspans, CD9 and CD82, are associated with CD19 in B cell lines. Moreover, CD9 is associated with CD81 and CD19 in purified CD10+ early B cells. CD9 and CD81 interact with CD19 in different manners since the CD19-CD9 complex is disrupted in the presence of digitonin, but not the CD19-CD81 complex (Figs. 1 and 3). It is possible that the association of CD19 with CD9 is weaker than with CD81. Alternately, CD9 could associate indirectly with CD19, whereas CD81 has been proposed to interact directly (3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In favor of this latter hypothesis, it should be noted that the digitonin buffer appears to be more stringent since much fewer molecules are coprecipitated with CD9 or CD81 in these conditions, compared with Brij97 or CHAPS extraction buffers. Interestingly, the CD9/CD81 association is disrupted in digitonin, which further argues for an indirect CD9/CD19 association, possibly mediated through CD81. Surprisingly, none of the two reciprocal CD9/CD81 chimeric molecules transfected in Raji cells could be coprecipitated with CD19, suggesting that the CD81/CD19 association requires sequences present into both halves of the CD81 molecule. It has been previously demonstrated that the interaction of CD81 with CD19 only required the extracellular domain of CD19 (10Matsumoto A.K. Martin D.R. Carter R.H. Klickstein L.B. Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that both the short and the large extracellular domains of CD81 are involved in the association with CD19. Only a fraction of CD9 or CD82 was coprecipitated with CD19 in Brij97. This may be partly explained by the fact that CD9 is expressed at a higher level than CD19 in the cell lines tested. Moreover, it is likely that partial disruption of the complexes occurs during the lysis with Brij97. With this respect, CD21 was barely detectable in the CD19 immunoprecipitates collected in these conditions (Fig. 1). It should also be noted that CD19 failed to coprecipitate CD81 in the presence of CHAPS (Figs. 1 and 3). That CD19 could associate with CD9 and CD82 was confirmed by cocapping experiments. Interestingly, after the induction of capping by CD9 or CD82 mAbs, the CD19 almost completely colocalized with these antigens (Fig. 6), suggesting that the majority of CD19 molecules is associated with CD9 and CD82. We have previously demonstrated that several molecules associated with tetraspans, i.e. HLA-DR and β1 integrins, were present in the same complexes (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The data reported in this work show that proteins comigrating with integrins and HLA-DR are coprecipitated with CD19 from Brij97 lysates (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that the coprecipitation of these molecules was not observed in conditions that disrupt the association of CD19 with the tetraspan web, in the presence of CHAPS or digitonin. This suggests that CD19 associates with these molecules through the tetraspan web, which probably explains why they are detected at low levels in CD19 immunoprecipitates. An association between HLA-DR and CD19 is suggested by the cocapping of these two molecules (6Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar) and is strengthened by the fact that anti-HLA-DR mAbs produce the same effects as mAbs to CD19, including homotypic aggregation and inhibition of proliferation of B cell lines (6Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar, 21Odum N. Ledbetter J.A. Martin P. Geraghty D. Tsu T. Hansen J.A. Gladstone P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CD19 has been reported to associate with VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrins (31Xiao J. Messinger Y. Jin J. Myers D.E. Bolen J.B. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7659-7664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), an association that is functionally relevant since CD19 mAbs could induce the adhesion of B cells to the interfollicular stroma of frozen tonsil by a mechanism involving VLA-4 (32Behr S. Schriever F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, integrin cross-linking through specific antibody homoconjugates activates CD19-associated protein-tyrosine kinases and induces the phosphorylation of CD19 itself in mature and pre-B cell lines (31Xiao J. Messinger Y. Jin J. Myers D.E. Bolen J.B. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7659-7664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that CD9 or CD81 engagement induces similar patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation, one of the phosphorylated proteins being CD19. This is the first demonstration that CD9 engagement can induce the activation of tyrosine kinases in nucleated cells. In the absence of known function for tetraspans and of identified soluble extracellular ligands or counterreceptors, their ability to form organized complexes has led to the suggestion that they could be surface organizers (14Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), or facilitators (33Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), interconnecting other surface molecules. Indeed, chimeric CD19 molecules that do not associate with CD81 were no longer able to deliver a signal leading to homotypic aggregation (10Matsumoto A.K. Martin D.R. Carter R.H. Klickstein L.B. Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), suggesting that such a signal is transmitted to the cell through CD81. In addition, if the studies of several CD81-deficient mice have demonstrated that the initial signals following BCR engagement do not necessitate CD81 (11Tsitsikov E.N. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10844-10849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Maecker H.T. Levy S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Miyazaki T. Müller U. Campbell K.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4217-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), it was shown in one of these reports that CD81-deficient B cells had an impaired calcium mobilization in response to CD19 mAbs (11Tsitsikov E.N. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10844-10849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the possibility that this defect could be due to a lower expression of CD19 was not ruled out, it is possible that a part of this calcium mobilization requires the presence of CD81. An interesting hypothesis is that in the absence of CD81, CD19 is no longer connected to the tetraspan web and therefore cannot recruit other molecules necessary for the full signal. CD19 has been proposed to regulate signaling thresholds for transmembrane signal, in particular those mediated through the B cell receptor (3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Fearon D.T. Carter R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The effects of hyperexpression or inactivation of CD19 indicate that it plays a critical role during the selection process of B cells, by tightly regulating the B cell receptor function (2Engel P. Zhou M.-J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S.

A. 1995; 92: 11558-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Its role at earlier stages is poorly understood and it may just anticipate the appearance of the B cell receptor. However, CD19 has been shown to be associated in early B cells with β1integrins (31Xiao J. Messinger Y. Jin J. Myers D.E. Bolen J.B. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7659-7664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) whose role in B cell differentiation is suggested by several experiments. First, it was shown that B cell precursor growth on stromal cells can be inhibited by VLA-4 mAb in vitro (36Ryan D.H. Nuccie B.L. Abboud C.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3759-3764PubMed Google Scholar,37Miyake K. Weissman I.L. Greenberger J.S. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Second, chimeric mice originating from RAG-1−/− or RAG-2−/− blastocysts injected with ES cells deleted for β1 or α4 integrins have a dramatic deficiency of B cells in the bone marrow, blood, and lymphoid organs (38Hirsch E. Iglesias A. Potocnik A.J. Hartmann U. Fässler R. Nature. 1996; 380: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 39Arroyo A.G. Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1996; 85: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Since the engagement of VLA-4 and VLA-5 induces the phosphorylation of CD19 (and associated tyrosine kinases), it is possible that CD19 mediates signals triggered by these integrins during early B cell differentiation. Our results suggest that CD81 could be responsible for the connection of CD19 to the tetraspan web and its associated molecules such as integrins. The changes in tetraspan expression during B cell differentiation, in particular with the disappearance of CD9, concomitant to the expression of surface immunoglobulins, may modify the way CD19 and integrins are connected. This may modulate the cross-talk between CD19 and integrins. We are grateful to Dr. Bréard, Dr. Conjeaud, Dr. Seed, and Dr. Yoshie for the generous gift of cDNA and antibodies.

FMO2, or “pulmonary” FMO, one of five forms of the enzyme identified in mammals, is expressed predominantly in lung and differs from other FMOs in that it can catalyze the N-oxidation of certain primary alkylamines. We describe here the isolation and characterization of cDNAs for human FMO2. Analysis of the sequence of the cDNAs and of a section of the corresponding gene revealed that the major FMO2 allele of humans encodes a polypeptide that, compared with the orthologous protein of other mammals, lacks 64 amino acid residues from its C terminus. Heterologous expression of the cDNA revealed that the truncated polypeptide was catalytically inactive. The nonsense mutation that gave rise to the truncated polypeptide, a C → T transition in codon 472, is not present in theFMO2 gene of closely related primates, including gorilla and chimpanzee, and must therefore have arisen in the human lineage after the divergence of the Homo and Pan clades.

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs)1 (EC 1.14.13.8) are NADPH-dependent flavoenzymes that catalyze oxidation of soft nucleophilic heteroatom centers in a range of structurally diverse compounds, including drugs, pesticides, and other xenobiotics (1Ziegler D.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 321-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 179-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Functionally, FMOs differ from other monooxygenases in that the active oxygenating species, the C(4a)hydroperoxide derivative of the flavin cofactor, exists stably within the protein in the absence of substrate, thereby enabling the enzyme to oxidize any soft nucleophile able to gain access to the active site. FMO was originally characterized by using a homogeneous enzyme preparation isolated from pig liver (3Ziegler D.M. Mitchell C.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Proteins with equivalent catalytic properties and substrate profiles were later isolated from the livers of several other species (4Hlavica P. Hulsmann S. Biochem.

However, contemporaneous studies indicated that rabbit lung contained a form of FMO which, although clearly related to the liver enzyme, possessed distinct physicochemical properties (7Devereux T.R. Fouts J.R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1974; 8: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and substrate preferences (8Ohmiya Y. Mehendale H.M.

Hodgson E. Philpot R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5855-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that each was the product of a separate gene. Following the identification of “liver” and “lung” FMO as discrete enzymes, evidence accumulated indicating the presence in these tissues of additional forms of the enzyme. The existence of multiple mammalian FMOs was subsequently confirmed when new forms were identified, either by direct sequencing of purified proteins (14Ozols J. Arch. Biochem.

To date, five distinct forms of FMO, designated FMOs 1–5, each of which is encoded by its own gene and which exhibits approximately 50–60% pairwise amino acid sequence similarity, have been identified in mammals (19Lawton M.P.

Philpot R.M. Carver G. Lawton M.P. Nikbakht K.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1996; 24: 1320-1327PubMed Google Scholar). FMO2 displays catalytic characteristics that distinguish it from other forms of FMO. For instance, although able to oxidize many typical FMO substrates, it is inactive toward certain tertiary amines, such as imipramine and chlorpromazine (9Ohmiya Y. Mehendale H.M. Biochem.

Furthermore, in contrast to other FMOs, FMO2 is capable of mediating the N-oxidation of some primary alkylamines to their oximes, via anN-hydroxylamine intermediate (28Tynes R.E. Sabourin P.J.

In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding human FMO2 and demonstrate that, in common with human FMOs 1 and 3 (31Dolphin C.T. Cullingford T.E. Shephard E.A. Smith R.L. Phillips I.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), expression of the corresponding gene is subject to both ontogenic and tissue-specific regulation. Furthermore, we report that, in contrast to apparently all other mammalian species, including closely related primates, in humans the major FMO2allele encodes a truncated polypeptide which is catalytically inactive. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a PCR-MATE DNA synthesizer (model 391, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Human adult and fetal tissue samples were obtained as described previously (31Dolphin C.T. Cullingford T.E. Shephard E.A. Smith R.L. Phillips I.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) except for single adult lung and kidney samples, which were obtained from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (Exton, PA). Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate/LiCl method (34Cathala G. Savouret J-F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. RNA concentration was determined from absorbance at 260 nm. Human genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood by the method of Lahiri and Nurnberger (35Lahiri D.K. Nurnberger J.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar) and from solid tissue by use of a commercial DNA isolation kit (Nucleon Biosciences, Coatbridge, Scotland). Gorilla and chimpanzee genomic DNA was isolated by the method of Blin and Stafford (36Blin N. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar) from post-mortem tissue samples. Reverse-transcription of rabbit (New Zealand White) lung total RNA (20 μg) was primed with 200 pg of random hexamer oligonucleotides (Pharmacia Biotech, St. Albans, UK) and catalyzed by 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse-transcriptase (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland) in a total volume of 20 μl according to the supplier's recommendations. The reaction mix was then incubated for 5 min at 75 °C and the volume increased to 100 μl with water. Oligonucleotides 102 (5′-GACGCAGTCATGGTCTGCAGTGGC-3′) and 180 (5′-GATGTAATTGGTCTGCAGTTTCTG-3′), designed from the rabbit FMO2 cDNA sequence (13Lawton M.P. Gasser R. Tynes R.E. Hodgson E. Philpot R.M. J. Biol.

The PCR was performed in a volume of 40 μl containing 15 pmol of each primer, 66.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1.25 mmMgCl2, 16.7 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 50 μm of each dNTP, and a 5-μl aliquot of the reverse-transcription product. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, 0.5 μl (2.5 units) of Taq DNA polymerase (BioLine, London, UK) was added, and the reaction mix was incubated (TR1, Hybaid, Ashford, UK) for 32 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by an additional 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was incubated withPstI, gel-purified, and ligated intoPstI-digested pBS (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) to give the plasmid pRABLUNG. The identity of the cDNA insert was confirmed by restriction mapping and partial DNA sequencing. The insert from pRABLUNG was excised by incubation with PstI, gel-purified, radiolabeled by the oligonucleotide random primer method (37Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal.

Because of loss of the EcoRI cloning sites during library construction, insert DNAs could not be excised from positive phage clones by restriction digestion and were therefore recovered by PCR as described previously (30Dolphin C.

The products of the seminested 5′-RACE-PCRs were blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK), then purifed (SpinBind, FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) and inserted into EcoRV-digested pBS. 3′-RACE-PCR was performed essentially as described by Frohman et al.

Oligonucleotides 392 (5′-CTAGAATTCTAGAATGGCAAAGAAGGTAGCTGTGATTG-3′) and 394 (5′-TACTGGATCCTGACAAGATAATAAAGCCCAAAG-3′), containing uniqueXbaI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites, respectively, were designed to prime the amplification of the entire protein-coding region of the human FMO2 cDNA plus a small stretch of the 3′-untranslated region. PCR was performed in a volume of 40 μl containing 15 pmol of each primer, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml), 200 mm of each dNTP, and a 2-μl aliquot of the reverse-transcription product. After an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min, 1 μl (2.5 units) of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was added and the reaction incubated for 36 cycles at 94 °C for 75 s, 52 °C for 75 s, and 72 °C for 4 min, and then for an additional 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting PCR product was incubated with XbaI and BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated into pBS, previously digested withXbaI and BamHI, to give the plasmid pBSFMO2/2. Amplification of the entire protein-coding region of the cynomolgus macaque FMO2 cDNA, plus small stretches of both the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, was achieved with the forward primer 618 (5′-CGTTGAATTCCAAGGGAGAAAACTATTCTGTC-3′), designed from the sequence of the 5′-RACE-PCR products (data not shown), and the human FMO2 cDNA-specific reverse primer 394. PCR conditions were as described above for the amplification of the partial-length rabbit FMO2 cDNA, except that a 5-μl aliquot of the reverse-transcription product was used as template and the reaction mix was incubated for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by an additional 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was purified from the reaction mix (SpinBind, FMC) and sequenced directly. An equivalent 235-bp region of the human, gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) FMO2 gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 422 (5′-TTCAAAGATCCTAAACTGGCTGTGAG-3′) and 394. Reaction mixtures containing approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA as template were incubated for 38 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, followed by an additional 5 min at 72 °C. Reaction conditions were as described above for the amplification of the partial-length rabbit FMO2 cDNA. PCR products were purified from the reaction mix (SpinBind, FMC) and sequenced directly. Plasmid DNA and purified PCR products were sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) using DNA sequencing kits (Sequenase II, Amersham International; Cyclist, Stratagene) and either vector- or insert-specific primers. The insert of pBSFMO2/2 and the subcloned products of the human FMO2 3′-RACE-PCRs and of the human and cynomolgus macaque FMO2 5′-RACE-PCRs were sequenced completely on both strands (Fig. 1), whereas the full-length cDNA encoding cynomolgus macaque FMO2 was only partially sequenced. Sequence data were analyzed with MacVector (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK) or Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) sequence analysis software. The human FMO2 RNase protection plasmid, pBSFMO2/2/15, was constructed by excising a 985-bp section from within the insert of pBSFMO2/2 (by digestion withHindIII and StyI), followed by blunt-ending of the DNA with T4 DNA polymerase and self-ligation of the larger vector fragment. pBSFMO2/2/15 (10 μg) was linearized by digestion withMscI, after which the reaction mix was treated with proteinase K and SDS (40Shephard E.A. Palmer C.N.A. Segall H.J. Phillips I.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and extracted with phenol-chloroform (1:1, v/v). The linearized plasmid was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. In vitro synthesis of radiolabeled antisense RNA, probe purification, and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (31Dolphin C.T. Cullingford T.E. Shephard E.A. Smith R.L. Phillips I.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Shephard E.A. Palmer C.N.A. Segall H.J. Phillips I.R. Arch. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Comparison of the autoradiographic signal derived from the protected species with a standard curve of undigested probe permitted quantification of FMO2 mRNA in terms of molecules/μg of total RNA. This was converted to molecules/cell by using the average RNA content of a mammalian cell (5 pg) (42Little P.F.R. Jackson I.J. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning; Volume III. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 1-18Google Scholar). Human genomic DNA (20 μg) was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 300 units of EcoRI orHindIII (New England Biolabs), extracted with phenol-chloroform (1:1, v/v), ethanol-precipitated, electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond, Amersham International). The membrane was prehybridized at 42 °C for 3 h in 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSPE (1× SSPE, 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA), 5× Denhardt's reagent, 2% (w/v) SDS, and denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml), then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSPE, 2% (w/v) SDS and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, containing radiolabeled probe (synthesized as described above for cDNA library screening) at a final concentration of 2–5 ng/ml. After hybridization the membrane was washed once in 2× SSPE/1% (w/v) SDS, (15 min at room temperature), twice in 1× SSPE/1% SDS (15 min each at room temperature), and twice in 0.1× SSPE/1% SDS (15 min each, once at room temperature then at 55 °C), then autoradiographed for 72 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. RNA samples (15 μg) were denatured in formaldehyde and electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel (43Fourney R. Miyakoshi J. Day R.S. Patterson M.C. Focus (BRL). 1988; 10: 5-7Google Scholar). After transfer to a nylon membrane (BDH, Poole, UK) RNA was immobilized by baking the membrane at 80 °C, followed by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene). The membrane was prehybridized, hybridized, washed, and subjected to autoradiography as described above. To construct FMO2X472 recombinant baculovirus, pBSFMO2/2 was incubated withXbaI and PstI, and the smaller of the resulting restriction fragments, comprising the 1413-bp ORF, 192 bp of associated 3′-untranslated region, and approximately 50 bp of pBS, was ligated toXbaI/PstI-digested pFastBac (Life Technologies) to give pFastFMO2/2/8. To construct recombinant virus containing FMO2Q472, two oligonucleotides, 576 (5′-CGAGCTCGCCTTAGAGATAGGTGCG-3′) and 394, were used to prime the amplification of a 330-bp contiguous region of the FMO2 gene that encompassed codon 472 and the second in-frame stop signal located 192 bp downstream (see Fig. 2). PCR conditions were as described above for FMO2gene amplification, except that genomic DNA (100 ng) isolated from an individual previously identified as being heterozygous for TAG and CAG triplets at codon 472 was used as a template. The PCR product was ligated directly into EcoRV-linearized pBS, and, after propagation in Escherichia coli, a plasmid clone containing CAG at codon 472 in the amplified region of theFMO2 gene was identified by DNA sequencing. The insert of this plasmid was excised by incubation with SacI and BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated, in a three-fragment reaction, with a SacI/XbaI restriction fragment of pBSFMO2/2 that contained the remainder of the FMO2 coding region, and XbaI/BamHI-digested pBS, to give pBSFMO2/2/16. The extended FMO2 ORF was excised from pBSFMO2/2/16, by incubation with XbaI and PstI, then gel-purified and ligated into pFastBac to give pFastFMO2/2/16. In order to bring the translational initiation codon of each of the inserted cDNAs closer to the position of that of the original polyhedrin gene, approximately 50 bp were excised from the multiple cloning sites of both pFastFMO2/2/8 and pFastFMO2/2/16 by digestion with EcoRI and XbaI. After religation of the blunt-ended vector portions to give pFastFMO2X472 and pFastFMO2Q472, the respective recombinant baculoviruses, AcFMO2X472 and AcFMO2Q472, were generated by transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf) 9 cells with the corresponding recombinant bacmid DNA, obtained via site-specific transposition using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies) according to the supplier's recommendations. Sf9 and Tricoplusia ni insect cells were grown and passaged in shaker cultures using Sf-900II (Life Technologies) and Excell 405 (JRH Biosciences-Europe, Marlow, UK) serum-free media, respectively, containing amphotericin B (5 μg/ml), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml). For amplification of virus, Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infecton of ≤0.1. For expression, 100 ml of T. ni cells, grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask, were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infecton of 7 and incubated by shaking at 130 rpm in an orbital shaker (New Brunswick Scientific (UK) Ltd., Hatfield, Herts) at 28 °C for 60 h. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 30 ml 0.154 m KCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and subjected to two 30-s bursts of sonication (Dynatech, model 150) on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The microsomal fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Microsomal pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of 0.154 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and stored in aliquots (150 μl) at −80 °C until use. Pr"
https://openalex.org/W1982743619,"We describe novel biochemical and electron microscopy assays to investigate in vitro fusion of latex bead phagosomes with three different endocytic organelle fractions from J774 macrophages. After formation, early phagosomes fuse avidly with early and late endosomes and for a longer period of time with lysosomes, but they subsequently become fusion-incompetent. The fusion of early, but not late, phagosomes with all three endocytic fractions could be significantly stimulated by Rab5. In contrast to other cell types investigated, this Rab is uniquely enriched on both early and late endosomes in J774 macrophages. Moreover, exogenous Rab5 stimulates homotypic fusion between both sets of organelles. This was shown by a quantitative electron microscopy fusion assay that can directly assay fusion between any combination of morphologically defined organelles. By the same approach, we discovered an unexpected Rab5-stimulatable fusion between early and late endosomes in J774, but not in BHK cells. Thus, in J774 cells both Rab5 and the endocytic pathway seem to have evolved additional functions not yet seen in nonphagocytic cells.

Phagocytosis is a process crucial for immune defense, which involves the uptake of particles larger than 0.3–0.5 μm. It is used for such purposes as the clearance of pathogens by professional phagocytes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Brown E.J.

These specialized cells are also able to take up particulate material such as carbon particles and asbestos and, in this way, remove potentially life-threatening material from the blood circulation. Macrophages and neutrophils, the quintessential phagocytes, have evolved a number of complementary mechanisms to kill invading pathogens, such as the oxidative burst (4Morel F. Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), acidification of the newly formed phagosome (5Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This fusion process provides access of digestive enzymes to the phagosome to digest the phagosomal content. The endocytic pathway appears to consist of up to four distinct sets of organelles through which endocytic tracers pass sequentially: the early endosome, the endocytic carrier vesicle (multivesicular body), the late endosome (prelysosomal compartment; rich in some recycling receptors such as the two mannose 6-phosphate receptors in some cells), and the lysosome (9Kornfeld S.

The latter two sets of organelles are structurally distinct, although they are both highly enriched in lysosomal enzymes (14Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of the pathways and mechanistic details of the fusion process between the newly formed phagosome and these endocytic organelles is still incomplete. Up to the late 1980s, the accepted model was that phagosomes interacted exclusively with organelles classified at that time as “lysosomes” (7Silverstein S.C. Steinman R.M. Cohn Z.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 669-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 15Gabay J.E. Horwitz M.A. Cohn Z.A. Biochem. Soc.

Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1749-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More recent in vivo studies suggested that, after internalization into macrophages, 1-μm latex bead-enclosing phagosomes preferentially fuse with late endosomes (18Rabinowitz S. Horstmann H. Gordon S. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Additionally,in vitro studies have also shown that bacterial phagosomes can fuse with early endosomes (19Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Dieplinger H. Jahraus A. Griffiths G. Huber L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32194-32200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence that, following internalization of 1-μm latex beads into J774 macrophages, phagosomes undergo a complex series of biochemical changes (summarized by Desjardins (24Desjardins M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); see also Ref. 25Emans N. Nzala N.N. Desjardins M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Of relevance to the present study is the fact that phagosomes acquire the Ras-related family of Rab GTPases, in particular Rab5 and Rab7, which are now accepted as being crucial in regulating membrane organelle docking and/or fusion events in the cell (26Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that Rab5 and Rab7 sequentially regulate transport in the endocytic pathway of cells such as BHK and HeLa (28Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K.

Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Rab5 has been localized in a number of cells to the early endosomes, to endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles as well as on the plasma membrane (28Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 34Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). This protein somehow regulates both the rate of docking/fusion of clathrin-coated vesicles with early endosomes as well as the homotypic fusion of early endosomes with themselves (28Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 30Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). While latex bead phagosomes reached an apparent equilibrium of fluid content mixing with late endocytic organelles after ∼60 min, Rab5 and Rab7 could be detected on isolated latex bead phagosomes for at least 15 h (22Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 35Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13326-13331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In addition to the GTP-binding proteins, the spanning membrane glycoproteins LAMP-1 and -2, abundant constituents of both late endosomes and lysosomes (11Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), are also acquired by phagosomes (22Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 35Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol.

In our system, these molecules are present on the earliest latex bead phagosome stages studied and reach their maximal concentration on phagosomes between 6–12 h, thereafter remaining relatively constant in amounts on the phagosomal membrane (22Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The fact that the phagosome is a newly formed vesicle that changes its biochemical composition with time argues strongly that this organelle is a structure that “matures” (8Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Desjardins M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a phenomenon defined as an irreversible physiological change, akin to an aging process (14Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have argued that early and late endosomes are stable, preexisting compartments that do not mature (14Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 1-5Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although other views, preferring maturation phenomena, have also been proposed (38Murphy R.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 39Stoorvogel W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Desjardins (24Desjardins M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) has recently summarized the accumulating set of data suggesting that phagosomes dynamically fuse with and physically separate from multiple elements of the endocytic pathway, a process he has termed “kiss and run” by analogy to the ideas on the exocytic fusion pore (40Almers W. Nature. 1994; 367: 682-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Monck J.R. Fernandez J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The complexity of the phagosome maturation makes it very difficult to dissect the highly complex molecular events that phagosomes undergoin vivo. Here we introduce novel in vitro assays to investigate the fusion between isolated phagosomes and endocytic organelles of J774 mouse macrophages. We have used 1-μm latex beads as markers for phagosomes. The advantage of using these polystyrene particles is the ease and purity with which phagosomes can be isolated (22Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Moreover, due to the nondegradable nature of latex, phagosomes at any stage after bead internalization can be examined. We also took advantage of a novel procedure for isolating enriched fractions of early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes of J774 macrophages, with a minimum of cross-contamination between the three fractions (Refs. 42Claus V. Jahraus A. Tjelle T. Berg T. Kirschke H. Faulstich H. Griffiths G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9842-9851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 43Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar and this study). With these tools, we could study the fusion between phagosomes and endocytic organelles in a more accessible manner. While most of this study deals with an avidin-biotin biochemical assay that is based on an earlier in vitrosystem (44Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), we have also set up a complementary EM fusion assay that is a direct estimator of the fusion between any combination of endocytic organelles with themselves or with phagosomes. To our surprise, we found that the fusion properties of these endocytic organelles and the role of Rab5 in macrophages differed significantly from that in fibroblasts. We speculate that this is related to the many specialized functions of macrophages that seemingly require a hyperactive endocytic pathway. J774A.1 mouse macrophages were maintained as described by Blocker et al.(46Blocker A. Severin F.F. Habermann A. Hyman A.A. Griffiths G. Burkhardt J.K. J. Biol.

For phagosome preparation, 15 10-cm dishes of macrophages were plated into 6245 × 245-mm plates (Nunc) 1.5 days before the incubation with avidin latex beads. For preparation of endocytic organelles, cells were grown to subconfluence in 10-cm dishes (Falcon) When postnuclear supernatant extracts (PNS)1 were used for fusion assays we used three dishes, whereas for isolated endocytic organelles six dishes were used. For cytosol preparations, macrophages were grown as spinner cultures in Joklik's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented as above except with 10% new born calf serum (Seromed). Avidin was covalently coupled to carboxylated latex beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 0.05 mg/ml deglycosylated avidin (Neutralite avidin, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was incubated with carboxylated latex beads (Seradyn, Indianapolis, IN) at a final bead concentration of 1% in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.7) for 15 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel. Then, a 2.5-fold molar excess over latex bead carboxyl concentration of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Sigma) was rapidly added to the reaction and further incubated for 1 h at room temperature. A second addition of the same amount of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide followed, and the reaction was mixed for an additional hour. Unbound protein was removed by washing twice in stop buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 9.4, 1% TX-100); once in PBS; and three times in PBS, 0.03% fish skin gelatin (Sigma). The beads were stored as a 1% suspension for no longer than 2 months in aliquots at 4 °C in PBS, 0.03% fish skin gelatin, and 0.02% azide and immediately before use were washed twice with internalization medium (IM; minimal essential medium, 10 mmHEPES, 5 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4). Protein determination of the bound avidin on the beads with the micro-BCA assay kit (Pierce) showed that the coupling procedure was reproducible; the amount of avidin was in the range of 3–4 × 10−7μg/bead. The bead number was determined by flow cytometry or light scattering at A 600. Increasing amounts of beads resulted in a linear increase in light scattering. Macrophages were fed a final concentration of 0.05% of the stock preparations of avidin beads in IM under ambient conditions for indicated times at 37 °C. After two washes with PBS, cells were chased, if necessary, for the indicated times in either chase medium (minimal essential medium, 10 mm TES, 10 mm MOPS, 15 mm HEPES, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 35 mg/ml NaHCO3, pH 7.4) under ambient conditions, or, if chase times exceeded 1 h, cells were kept in culture medium at 5% CO2. In the case of 20-min pulse/10-min chase phagosomes as well as the 1-h pulse and 1-h chase phagosomes, the fusion results seen with the three endocytic fractions were the same when either chase medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were used for the isolation of phagosomes. Phagosomes were isolated as described (22Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar,45Muller W.A. Steinman R.M. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A concentration of phagosomes was achieved by performing a second gradient; the phagosome band was adjusted with 62% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole to 35%, overlaid with homogenization buffer (HB; 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4), and centrifuged in a SW 60 rotor for 20 min at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C. The bead number in the 35% HB interphase from the latter gradient was determined at A 600, and phagosomes were aliquoted and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml biotin-insulin (Sigma) to quench accessible avidin sites on the beads during freeze-thawing of phagosomes. After thawing, about 70% of the phagosomes are enclosed by an intact membrane. The high purity of the isolated phagosomes had been shown (23Desjardins M. Celis J.E. van Meer G. Dieplinger H. Jahraus A. Griffiths G. Huber L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32194-32200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endocytic pathway in J774 macrophages was labeled by pulse-chase kinetics with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (bHRP; prepared as described by Gruenberg et al. (44Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar)). For standard conditions in the in vitro assay, 1.7 mg/ml bHRP was pulsed for 40 min in IM at 37 °C, which labels all endocytic organelles (see “Results”). After washing twice briefly with PBS and twice for 15 min with PBS, 5 mg/ml BSA on ice, a PNS was prepared (see above). For specific labeling of early endosomes or late endosomes/lysosomes, macrophages were pulsed for 5 or 30 min, respectively with 1.7 mg/ml bHRP. Macrophages marked for late endosomes or lysosomes were further chased for 30 or 60 min, respectively, in chase medium after washing with PBS and PBS/BSA on ice. Either a crude PNS was prepared from these cells or isolation via gradients was carried out according to Tjelleet al. (43Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for these fractions was as follows. Early endosomes were isolated by homogenizing macrophages that had been pulsed for 5 min with bHRP in HB containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.5 μg/ml Leupeptin, 4 μg/ml Aprotinin), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml DNase I to avoid contaminating DNA in the early endosomal fraction after centrifugation. Then the PNS was mixed 1:1 with 80% metrizamide in PBS, placed at the bottom of an SW40 tube, and overlaid with 8.5 ml of 17% Percoll/HB and 500 μl of HB. After centrifugation at 56,000 × g for 45 min, the early endosomes were collected from the top of the self-formed Percoll gradient. Late endosomes and lysosomes were isolated from one set of macrophages using ovalbumin-conjugated gold particles (10 nm) to achieve a density shift between late endosomes and lysosomes. The gold was internalized into J774 for 3 h at a finalA 520 of 6 and chased overnight to trace the bulk of gold into the lysosomal compartment. The cells were homogenized in HB in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture and dithiothreitol (see above) and centrifuged at 750 × g for 7 min. The gold-containing fraction was found in the nuclear pellet, whereas the late endosome fraction stayed in the PNS. This PNS was layered in a SW40 tube onto 8.5 ml of 17% Percoll/HB with a 2-ml 50% sucrose cushion underneath in order to eliminate gold particles left over in the PNS. After centrifugation at 56,000 × g for 1 h, the late endosomes accumulated as a band in the Percoll gradient close to the sucrose cushion. The nuclear pellet with the gold-containing lysosomes was resuspended in 2 ml of 17% Percoll/HB and layered onto 2 ml of 64% sucrose cushion in a SW50.1 tube. A centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min separated the gold-filled lysosomes, which pelleted through the sucrose cushion, from the nuclei remaining on top of the gradient. Fractions were previously characterized by Tjelle et al. (43Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar). PNS and/or isolated endocytic organelles were used immediately in the biochemical in vitro assay after the bHRP content had been determined with the ImmunoPure TMB substrate kit (Pierce). Quantification of the recovery of the three endocytic fractions showed that the early endosome fraction contained about 87% of the total HRP in the homogenate after a 5-min pulse. The late endosome and the lysosome fractions reached a recovery yield of approximately 32 and 76%, respectively, of the total HRP in the homogenate at the chase time in which these organelles reached their peak value for the marker (45 min and 2 h, respectively). For the biochemical fusion between phagosomes and organelles of the endocytic pathway, we modified a cell-free assay for homotypic endosome fusion (44Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Isolated phagosomes containing avidin beads were mixed on ice with endocytic organelles loaded with bHRP prepared freshly from a separate cell population. Additionally, macrophage cytosol at a final concentration of 4 mg/ml and 10 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (1:1:1 mixture of 100 mm ATP brought to pH 7 with KOH, 800 mm creatine phosphate, and 4 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase) or an ATP-depleting system (1500 units/ml hexokinase (Boehringer Mannheim)), 1:1 with 1 m glucose) was added. The preparation of macrophage cytosol is described (46Blocker A. Severin F.F. Habermann A. Hyman A.A. Griffiths G. Burkhardt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3803-3811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mixture was adjusted to contain 0.05 mg/ml biotinylated insulin, 60 mm KOAc, 1.5 mm MgOAc, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The final volume of 182 μl was incubated for 80 min at 37 °C. During this time, fusion between phagosomes containing avidin beads and bHRP-loaded endocytic organelles resulted in the formation of an avidin-bHRP complex on the latex beads. After the 37 °C incubation, tubes were chilled on ice, and an additional 0.55 mg/ml of biotinylated insulin was added. Then the reaction was sonicated (pulsed 15 times, using duty cycle 10 and output control 1 with a tip sonifier (Branson sonifier 250)) to eliminate aggregates (20% of the HRP activity was lost by sonication); lysed in 2% Triton X-100/PBS; and adjusted with 62% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole to 35% and loaded at the bottom of a 5 × 41-mm centrifuge tube (Beckman). This sucrose step was overlaid with 200 μl of 25% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole and 50 μl of HB and spun at 100,000 × g in a SW55 rotor containing adapters for 20 min at 4 °C. The phagosome band was collected in 90 μl and washed four times with PBS, 0.5% fish skin gelatin, 0.25% TX-100 by centrifugation in a table top centrifuge at 35,000 × g for 8 min using a TLA 100.2 rotor. After the last wash, the pellets were resuspended in 120 μl of wash buffer, and the bHRP content was measured together with a bHRP standard. Furthermore, the amount of beads/tube was determined by spectrophotometry (A 600), and the bHRP value was correlated with bead number. The fusion is expressed as ng of bHRP bound to a fixed number of avidin beads after incubation at 37 °C, lysing membranes, and washing. The values were estimated from standard curves relative to pure bHRP from the same batch. For each set of fusion reactions, endocytic organelle fractions prepared from the same number of cells were added to the same number of latex bead phagosomes. We emphasize that since the amount of bHRP found in each fraction at time 0 is different for the early endosomes (5-min pulse HRP) compared with the two other fractions (30-min pulse), the magnitude of the fusion of the different fractions with the phagosomes cannot be directly compared. A further unknown factor is the absolute surface area of fusogenic membrane surfaces that is present for fusion in the three membrane factions. Where indicated, Rab5-Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) complex (prepared as described by Horiuchi et al. (47Horiuchi H. Ullrich O. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), except that the elution buffer was changed to HB, 1 μm GDP, and 0.005% TX-100) was added to the tube at a final concentration of 50 nm, whereas control tubes contained the same volume of Rab5-Rab GDI elution buffer. For experiments with different phagosome preparations, the bead number was measured before the experiment, and equal amounts were added to each fusion tube, usually corresponding to approximately A 600 = 0.090. 50 nm of Rab5-Rab GDI complex (or 5 μm Rab GDI) prepared as described (47Horiuchi H. Ullrich O. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 48Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Alexandrov K. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was added to 2 × 108 avidin bead phagosomes of different ages in the presence of 10 μm GTP (or 10 μm GDP, respectively) in membrane buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mm KOAc, 25 mm MgOAc) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. As control for nonspecific binding, an identical number of naked fish skin gelatin-coated beads were incubated in the same way. After incubation, phagosomes or beads were floated away from excess Rab5-Rab GDI complex or Rab GDI using the small gradients described above. Then the phagosome band was diluted 4 times with membrane buffer and centrifuged in a TL-100 table top centrifuge (Beckman) at 50,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3× Laemmli buffer, and the A 600 was measured in 0.01 m HCl and 1% TX-100. The same amount of beads per lane was loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel together with a Rab5-Rab GDI complex standard and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blot was analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) with a monoclonal anti-Rab5 (mouse) antibody (49Bucci C. Wandinger-Ness A. Lutcke A. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Zerial M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and a secondary radioactive (35S-) labeled anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Amersham, United Kingdom). Early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes were prepared as described except for bHRP internalization. After centrifugation of the three different fractions in a TL-100 rotor with a Beckman table top centrifuge for 30 min at 100.000 × g at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of membrane buffer (see above), and protein was determined using the micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce). 8 μg of each f"

The number of channels at the cell surface is tightly regulated; most cells express only a few channels. We have examined the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. The subunits of ENaC are readily synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, but most of them remain as immature proteins in pre-Golgi compartments, where they are degraded by the proteasomal pathway without apparent ubiquitination. Even when the three subunits, α, β, and γ, are expressed in the same cell, only a very small fraction of the total channel population leave the endoplasmic reticulum, acquire complex oligosaccharides, and reach the plasma membrane. Overexpression of subunits does not increase the number of channels in the plasma membrane but results in the appearance of cytoplasmic subunits in a form not membrane bound. The data indicate that maturation and assembly of the subunits are slow and inefficient processes, and constitute limiting steps for the expression of functional ENaC channels in the plasma membrane.

The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)1 is a heteromultimeric protein formed by three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ, that associate in a protein complex, whose number of subunits and stoichiometry have not been determined definitively yet (1Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A-M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 2Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Single subunits induce small amiloride-sensitive current and are not detected at the cell surface (3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar, 4Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Even when the three subunits are present, the expression of ENaC at the plasma membrane is of small magnitude; in most tissues only a few copies are found per cell (5May A. Puotti A. Gaeggeler H-P. Horisberger J-D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Palmer L.G. Li J.H.Y. Lindemann B. Edelamn I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 64: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of highly regulated mechanisms that control its surface expression. Since ENaC is a constitutively active channel with high open probability (7Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), control of the number of channels at the cell surface is crucial for the regulation of sodium reabsorption. In addition to turnover of channels by endocytosis (8Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), another mechanism that controls the number of channels in the plasma membrane is the rate of delivery of newly synthesized channels. Xenopus oocytes have become the most frequently used expression system to study structure, function, and regulation of ENaC, and where most of the recent characterizations of wild-type and mutant channels have been performed. Here, we have examined the biosynthesis of wild-type ENaC and of channels with deletions of the carboxyl termini (the latter known to increase the activity of ENaC by 3–5-fold) in Xenopus oocytes (9Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our results show that subunits are readily synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but they remain as core-glycosylated, immature proteins that are degraded in pre-Golgi compartments by a process that requires the activity of the proteasome but without the need for ubiquitination. Co-expression of all three subunits significantly stabilizes the subunits in the ER, but still, only a very small fraction is converted into a mature form that bears complex oligosaccharides and that represents the functional form detected at the plasma membrane. Overexpression of subunits, in an attempt to increase delivery to the cell surface, does not increase the number of channels in the plasma membrane but induces synthesis of cytosolic subunits in a form not membrane bound. The amount of non-membrane bound subunits was significantly larger when single subunits were expressed than when all three subunits were present, suggesting that subunits unable to assembly rapidly with other partners block the incorporation of other nascent subunits into the ER membrane. The results demonstrate that maturation of ENaC in the ER-Golgi is limiting for the expression of functional channels, and suggest that it may be the site of regulatory mechanisms for the expression of ENaC. Antibodies used in immunoprecipitations of the subunits of ENaC were polyclonal sera raised in rabbits against GST fusion proteins (10Duc C. Farman N. Canessa C.M. Bonvalet J.P. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1907-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in Western blots were affinity purified to decrease background. We covalently bound GST and each of the fusion proteins to Affi-Gel matrix (Bio-Rad). The anti-α serum was passed first to GST Affi-Gel column to deplete anti-GST antibodies and then to the α-fusion protein Affi-Gel column. Antibodies were eluted with low pH and immediately neutralized with 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The same procedure was used for affinity purification of β and γ antibodies from whole sera. Anti-ubiquitin antibodies were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-rat Na+/K+-ATPase β subunit was from Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-FLAG antibodies were monoclonals purchased from Kodak. Lactacystin (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 25 μm. Treatments with endoglycosidase H and endoglycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) were performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate for in vitrotranslation was from Amersham. Trypsin was from Life Technologies, Inc.In Vivo Cell Labeling Mix for metabolic labeling was a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol) purchased from Amersham Corp. EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, EZ-Link biotin-LC-hydrazine, and streptavidin-agarose were from Pierce Chemical Co. cDNAs encoding wild-type α, β, and γ subunits were transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase from the pSD5 plasmid. βT and γT were constructed by introducing a stop codon at positions Arg-564 and Gln-566 of the β and γ cDNAs, respectively. cDNAs encoding α and β subunits of rat Na+/K+-ATPase were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase from the BlueScript plasmid. Ubiquitin cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and ligated into pSD5. A FLAG epitope was added in-frame to the amino terminus. Ubiquitin-K48R was generated by polymerase chain reaction. Stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were harvested as described previously (11McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). 1 ng of cRNA of each of the subunits of ENaC was injected per oocyte in a final volume of 50 nl. Cells were incubated in modified Barth solution (MBS) containing 1 mCi/ml of a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 4-h pulses. Chases were started by extensive washes with MBS supplemented with 10 mm each of cold methionine and cysteine. At 0, 3, 7, 12, and 22-h time points, oocytes were removed from the chase solutions for processing. Cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1% Triton X-100 containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg of each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Antibodies specific for the subunits of ENaC were added to the supernatants and incubated at room temperature for 8 h. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose beads, and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, treated for fluorography with 1 m salicylic acid, dried, and exposed to film at −80 °C. Quantification of the products was performed by scanning of autoradiographs, and by scintillation counting of a small aliquot of the proteins prior to loading into gels. Oocytes injected with α, β, and γ cRNAs, or with α and β subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase were metabolically labeled for 36 h. 75 oocytes were biotinylated with 1.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in MBS, pH 7.8, twice consecutively for 25 min at room temperature with gentle motion according to Ref. 12Gottardi C.J. Dumbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Biotin was quenched by washing oocytes for 20 min with MBS supplemented with 100 mm glycine. Oocytes were lysed and ENaC subunits or β subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. The immune complexes were eluted from Protein A-agarose beads with 2% SDS and the samples diluted and incubated with 30 μl of streptavidin beads. Samples were incubated for 6 h at 4 °C, washed, eluted with loading buffer, and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. In another set of experiments, α, β, and γ subunits were immunoprecipitated from oocytes and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) for Western blotting. ENaC subunits were detected with affinity purified antibodies and luminescence (ECL, Amersham). Membranes were exposed to film for 4 min. Quantification of Western blots was performed by comparing the intensity of bands of Western blots containing known quantities of the α, β, or γ GST fusion proteins used to raise the antibodies for the subunits of ENaC. Concentration of the GST fusion proteins was calculated by absorbance at 280 nm and corrected for the amino acid composition of each of the peptides according to Ref. 13Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996Crossref Google Scholar. Biotinylation of surface glycoproteins was also performed with EZ-Link biotin-LC-hydrazine. Oocytes were incubated in 8 mm sodium periodate for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The oxidation reaction was terminated by washing with cold MBS. Cells were resuspended in 5 mm EZ-Link biotin-LC-hydrazine for 30 min on ice with frequent swirling and subsequently washed with cold MBS (14Kahne T. Ansorge S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and processed for Western blotting of the subunits of ENaC. cRNAs were translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate and [35S]methionine according to the provider's instructions. After 90 min incubation the cRNA was degraded by adding RNase. The subunits were recovered by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies and loaded into gels. 10 injected and metabolically labeled oocytes were washed in cold MBS and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with a tight fitting pestle in a buffer without detergent (85 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors). The homogenate was spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 30,000 × gfor 30 min, and at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3 and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Pellets from the 4 consecutive centrifugations and the final supernatant were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and the products resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. Oocytes injected with βT cRNA were metabolically labeled for 4 h, then injected with 50 nl of 5 g/ml trypsin or H2O. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, cells were lysed in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 g/ml), and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. The subunits of ENaC were immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled oocytes. Immune complexes were eluted with 30 μl of 0.2% SDS and 170 μl of IEF solubilization buffer and resolved by two-dimentional electrophoresis: first dimension, isoelectric focusing using 1% 5/7 and 4% 3/10 anpholytes (Bio-Rad); second dimension, 10% SDS-PAGE according to Ref.15Valentijn J.A. Jamieson J.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar. The three subunits of ENaC are glycosylated in multiple asparagine residues: 6 in α, 10 to 12 in β, and 4 in γ. To determine the cellular compartment in which the subunits are expressed we treated the subunits of ENaC with glycanases. Endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H) cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides on high mannose and hybrids (but not complex-type) oligosaccharides making it useful for examining the maturation of the subunits as they move through the ER-Golgi compartments. As a control we usedN-glycosidase F (PNGase-F) which cleaves all types of N-glycans. Oocytes were injected with α, β, and γ subunits, metabolically labeled with a mixture of [35S]methionine and cysteine for 4 h, and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. The products of the immunoprecipitations were divided in three equal samples that were either left untreated or treated with glycanases and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1 shows that α, β, and γ subunits were completely digested by Endo-H and PNGase-F, reducing the molecular weights to the products of in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate. The subunits were sensitive to Endo-H when expressed singly or in combination with all three subunits indicating that they are unable to exit the ER efficiently. The results indicate that almost all the subunits of ENaC expressed in oocytes remain in pre-Golgi compartments as co-reglycosylated immature forms. Injection of cRNA of each subunit alone results in synthesis of abundant protein with half-lives (t½ ± S.E.) of 3.8 ± 0.21 h for α, 3.4 ± 0.15 h for β, and 3.9 ± 0.26 for γ (Fig. 2). These t½ values are longer than the ones previously reported in transfected cells (16Coux O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), or in A6 cells (5May A. Puotti A. Gaeggeler H-P. Horisberger J-D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and probably reflect the lower temperature at which oocytes are maintained. We also examined the t½ of β and γ subunits with deletions of the carboxyl termini because the higher current expressed by carboxyl-terminal truncated channels could be the consequence of a prolonged t½. We found that the t½ for βT was 3.0 ± 0.5 h and for γT was 3.9 ± 0.9 h, values not different from the ones observed for wild-type subunits. When αβγ or αβTγ were co-expressed thet½ values of all the subunits increased. Thet½ values of the α, β, γ, and βT subunits were 11 to 9.5 h, significantly longer than from oocytes expressing single subunits (Fig. 3). However, the t½ of β and βT were not significantly different. The kinetics of degradation were also distinct; disappearance of subunits did not follow a simple exponential function but were more linear. These observations are in agreement with the notion that assembly of subunits with the correct partners stabilizes the channel complex, whereas single subunits tend to be rapidly degraded. It is important to notice in the pulse-chase experiments in Figs. 2 and 3, that when expressed alone or in combination, the subunits remain in the co-reglycosylated, immature form. A higher molecular weight form was never seen consistent with the acquisition of complex oligosaccharides and indicative of exit from the ER. The results indicate that co-expression of α, β, and γ stabilizes the subunits in the ER preventing their rapid degradation but assembly is not enough to allow efficient exit from the ER and the appearance of a fully glycosylated mature form. To detect channels expressed at the plasma membrane, we biotinylated oocytes injected with the three subunits of ENaC using two different impermeant biotinylation reagents: EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (modifies lysines and arginines) and EZ-link biotin-LC-hydrazine (modifies aldehyde groups of glycoproteins generated by oxidation). In one set of experiments oocytes expressing ENaC were metabolically labeled for 36 h, and then biotinylated with EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. The subunits of ENaC were recovered with specific antibodies and the biotinylated fraction with streptavidin-agarose. As control for the biotinylation procedure, we injected oocytes with the α and β subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase and looked for biotinylation of the β subunit. Fig. 4 A shows that the subunits of ENaC in the plasma membrane have higher molecular weight and migrate in broader bands than the intracellular subunits, consistent with the acquisition of complex oligosaccharides. In this experiment material from 25 oocytes was loaded on each lane, whereas for all other experiments it was the equivalent of 3 to 4 oocytes. In addition, the exposure time of the gels was five times longer to detect the biotinylated subunits. For comparison, Fig. 4 B shows the much higher intensity of the signal obtained with the β subunit of the pump. The weak signal recovered after biotinylation of ENaC could be due to low efficiency of biotinylation of the subunits in oocytes. To assess the efficiency of biotinylation of ENaC we performed a quantitative assay. GST fusion proteins used to raised the antibodies for ENaC were loaded on gels in decreasing amounts and processed for Western blotting using the corresponding affinity purified ENaC antibodies. The intensity of bands of the fusion proteins were compared with bands of Western blots obtained from biotinylated α, β, and γ subunits. Fig. 5 A shows Western blots of biotinylated α, β, and γ subunits with EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin or EZ-link biotin-LC-hydrazine from 40 oocytes. The intensities of the bands were similar using any of the two biotinylation reagents. Fig. 5 B shows Western blots of α, β, and γ GST fusion proteins at concentrations of 50, 2.0, 0.5, and 0.1 fmol/lane. Comparison of the intensity of the biotinylated subunits with the known amount of fusion proteins in Fig. 5 Bindicates that we recovered approximately 2.0 fmol of biotinylated subunits from 40 oocytes. For contrast, Fig. 5 C shows Western blots loaded with 1/100 of the whole oocyte lysate and represents expression of both intra- and extracellular subunits. 25 oocytes from the same batch were also examined for expression of amiloride-sensitive current. The mean whole cell current was 12 ± 3.3 μA/oocyte when measured at a membrane potential of −100 mV with the two-electrode voltage clamp. Since the single channel current of ENaC in the presence of 100 mm sodium in the bath solution is 1 pA, and the mean open probability is 0.5, the number of channels at the cell surface should be close to 24 million channels/oocyte or 96 million subunits if we assume that channels are tetramers. Then, the material contained on the gel shown in Fig. 5 A corresponds to 4 × 109 subunits or 6.66 fmol. Since the intensity of the biotinylated subunits were similar to the 2.0-fmol bands of the fusion proteins, we can argue that the efficiency of biotinylation was approximately 30% and that the biotinylated subunits reflect the actual number of channels at the cell surface, only a small fraction of the total channels expressed in oocytes. This result is consistent with the values obtained by Firsov et al. (1Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A-M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), who used a125I-labeled anti-FLAG antibody to measure the number of channels expressed at the cell surface of oocytes. They found 0.02 fmol/μA of β and γ and 0.055 fmol/μA of α. Accordingly, for 40 oocytes that expressed a mean whole cell current of 12 μA it is expected 12 fmol at the plasma membrane. This number is very close to the value we obtained. Therefore, the channels at the plasma membrane is only a very small fraction (<1%) of the total amount of subunits expressed in oocytes. We have shown that most of the subunits remain in pre-Golgi compartments where they are eventually degraded. We examined whether the proteasomal pathway was involved in the degradation of the intracellular subunits by incubating oocytes with lactacystin, a potent and specific inhibitor of the proteasome. Proteasomal degradation is one of the major cellular pathways for removal of protein from the cytosol and from the ER (16Coux O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The effect of lactacystin on the t½ of β subunits expressed alone is shown in Fig. 6; degradation of β subunits was almost completely blocked. In contrast, lactacystin had less effect on the t½ when the three subunits were co-expressed (Fig. 3), indicating that assembled subunits were protected from rapid degradation by the proteasome. Despite the involvement of the proteasome in subunit degradation, we failed to detect ubiquitination in any of the subunits, even when it was sought by multiple approaches including: immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin antibodies after incubation with lactacystin, or with anti-FLAG antibodies in oocytes co-injected with ENaC and ubiquitin cRNA tagged with the FLAG epitope; or co-injection with a mutant ubiquitin (ubiquitin-K48R) that inhibits polyubiquitination of proteins slowing degradation because they failed to be recognized by the proteasome (17Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We also did not detect a ladder of increasing molecular weight as it would have been expected if multiple ubiquitin moities were added (data not shown). These negative results indicate that the subunits are degraded in pre-Golgi compartments by a mechanism that involves the proteasome but does not require ubiquitination of the subunits. Two proteins with different molecular weights were frequently recovered with antibodies specific for the subunits of ENaC (Figs. 1, 2, and 6). The lower molecular weight protein is not a proteolytic product of the core glycosylated form because it is equally recognized by antibodies directed against the amino and carboxyl termini (Fig. 7), therefore, both ends of the protein are intact. The lower molecular weight protein has the same mobility as the in vitro translation product and is resistant to treatment with glycanases (Fig. 1), indicating that its lower molecular weight is due to the absence of glycosylation. It is unusual for proteins with multiple N-glycosylation sites not to be glycosylated at all because the addition of oligosaccharides occurs co-translationally in the lumen of the ER. We investigated two possibilities: (i) either the subunits are glycosylated in the ER and then are translocated back to the cytoplasm where cytosolic glycanases remove the oligosaccharides from the protein (18Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); or (ii) the subunits are synthesized in the cytoplasm without incorporation into the ER membrane and without exposure to the glycosylation machinery of the ER lumen. The first mechanism has been shown to be a pathway for degradation of ER-associated proteins and is part of the quality control of the ER (19Sommer T. Wolf D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); therefore, the deglycosylated subunits could represent the fraction that is retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. First, we demonstrated that the lower molecular weight form is indeed in the cytoplasm. Differential centrifugation of oocyte homogenates without detergent showed that it localized in the supernatant (cytosolic fraction), whereas the core-glycosylated localized in the pellet (membrane fraction) (Fig. 8). Furthermore, we examined the sensitivity of the two proteins to trypsin digestion. For that purpose, oocytes expressing βT were metabolically labeled for 4 h and then injected with trypsin. Since injected trypsin distributes in the cytoplasm of cells, only the polypeptides exposed to the cytosol can be degraded, while the ones in the ER lumen will be protected. We found that the core-glycosylated form was almost completely protected from digestion as expected for a βT subunit that only has a short amino terminus exposed to the cytoplasm. In contrast, the non-glycosylated form was completely degraded (Fig. 9).Figure 9The cytosolic form is degraded by trypsin. Metabolically labeled oocytes expressing βTwere injected with 30 nl of H2O or trypsin (25 mg/ml). After 1 h, oocytes were homogenized in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor (250 mg/ml) and treated for immunoprecipitation with an anti-β antibody that recognizes the domain that resides in the lumen of the ER in properly folded subunits. In cells treated with trypsin, the core-glycosylated form of βT migrates slightly faster, indicating a small change in molecular weight. In contrast, the non-glycosylated form is completely eliminated, indicating that the protein was digested by trypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we examined whether the cytosolic subunits were deglycosylated in the cytosol. It has been shown that the cytosol contains a PNGase-F activity that cleaves all types of asparagine boundN-glycans producing ammonia, aspartic acid in the peptide chain, and the complete oligosaccharide (24Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, removal of all 10 to 12 N-linked oligosaccharides from the β subunit should add to the protein 10 to 12 negative charges and produce a change in isoelectric point large enough to be detected by isoelectric focusing (IEF). We resolved immunoprecipitated β subunits on two-dimensional gels and found that the higher molecular weight (ER membrane) and the lower molecular weight (cytosolic) forms both exhibited the same migration, as well as the in vitrotranslation product; therefore, the total charge in all these proteins must be the same (data not shown). We conclude that the non-glycosylated, low molecular weight protein was made in the cytoplasm and was not a product of retrotranslocation from the ER. We have shown that the limiting steps for the accumulation of functional channels in the plasma membrane are the processes of assembly and maturation of the subunits in the ER. Most of the subunits are degraded in pre-Golgi compartments where they reside in a core-glycosylated form that is sensitive to Endo-H digestion. These findings are not restricted to the oocyte expression system because previous experiments, in mammalian or amphibian cells, also showed that most of the channel protein is in the core-glycosylated form (5May A. Puotti A. Gaeggeler H-P. Horisberger J-D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The findings presented here are in sharp contrast to biosynthesis and processing of FaNaCh, a channel closely related to ENaC. In experiments similar to the ones used by us, Coscoy et al. (21Coscoy S. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8317-8322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) showed a 74-kDa core glycosylated and a 82-kDa fully glycosylated form of FaNaCh. During the chase points, the 74-kDa polypeptide disappeared while the 82-kDa form became more intense, indicating progressive maturation of the protein and efficient delivery to the plasma membrane where was detected in large amounts (10% of the total plasma membrane proteins). Instead, we never detected maturation of ENaC into a fully glycosylated form in pulse-chase experiments, indicating that the subunits largely remain in the ER and only a very small fraction of the total protein is further processed, acquires more complex oligosaccharides, and is detected at the plasma membrane; the majority of the subunits remain inside the cell where they are degraded. Therefore, maturation and assembly of subunits seem to be important steps in the regulation of ENaC expression. When single subunits were expressed, the t½ values were short (3–4 h) and the kinetics of degradation could be fitted to a simple exponential function, indicating that they were degraded by a non-saturated pathway at a rate proportional to the amount of protein present in the cell. Degradation of the subunits expressed alone was markedly slowed by inhibition of the proteasomal activity by lactacystin, consistent with the involvement of the proteasome in the removal of unassembled subunits from the ER. Turnover of the channel proteins was different in the presence of all three subunits: the kinetics of degradation became slower, more complex, and less dependent on proteasomal activity. The results are in agreement with the notion that subunits of multimeric proteins are stabilized by association with the correct partners (22Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, despite assembly, channels left the pre-Golgi compartment in very small amounts that did not permit detection of the fully glycosylated form in the pulse-chase experiments. Although our data do not reveal the mechanisms that retain channels in the ER, the results indicate that inefficient maturation is a property intrinsic to the subunits of ENaC and it may constitute a way to limit the delivery of channels to the plasma membrane. Since ENaC is a constitutively active channel, with a relatively high open probability (P o 0.5), strict control of the number of channels at the cell surface is necessary to regulate sodium reabsorption by epithelial tissues. We found that ubiquitination does not seem to be required for the proteolysis of ENaC in the ER. Xenopus oocytes express all the machinery necessary for ubiquitination (23Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Furuno N. Watanabe N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2433-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); indeed, we detected ubiquitinated endogenous proteins in oocytes treated with lactacystin. The failure to demonstrate ubiquitination of the ENaC subunits, even when sought by several different approaches, suggests that the subunits present in the pre-Golgi compartments are not ubiquitinated prior to degradation by the proteasome. Other membrane proteins such as CFTR are also degraded in pre-Golgi compartments but in this case ubiquitination precedes degradation (24Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jeensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R.

However, ubiquitination is not obligatory to target substrates to the proteasome (27Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 28Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Although speculative, ubiquitination may be necessary for degradation of proteins with large cytoplasmic domains such CFTR, but not for proteins with few amino acids in the cytoplasm such as the subunits of ENaC. The lack of ubiquitination in oocytes contrasts to previous reports showing ubiquitination of ENaC is transfected Hek-293 cells (20Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that Nedd4 binds to the carboxyl termini of the subunits and ubiquitinates the amino termini of α and γ (20Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 30Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination seems to be a signal for retrieval of channels from the plasma membrane and targeting to lyzosomes for degradation. An explanation for the discrepancy may be that Nedd4 ubiquitinates channels only in the plasma membrane and not in the intracellular compartments. We have shown that in oocytes, most of the subunits are in the ER where they are degraded by a mechanism that involves the proteasome but does not require ubiquitination and is independent of binding of Nedd4. Since the fraction of channels expressed at the plasma membrane is very small and, furthermore, not all channels at the cell surface are expected to be ubiquitinated, our assays could not detect the very small number of ubiquitinated channels at the cell surface. A similar explanation may apply for the finding that wild-type and truncated subunits exhibit the same t½ values. Thet½ values calculated from pulse-chase experiments reflect the fate of the intracellular subunits and not of the small fraction present in the plasma membrane. In a previous publication (8Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we were able to measure the residence time in the plasma membrane of wild-type and carboxyl-terminal truncated channels by using an electrophysiological measurement (much more sensitive that biochemichal assays). The t½ of wild-type was 3.6 h and it was markedly prolonged for αβTγTchannels. Overexpression of subunits did not overcome the blockade of the channels in the ER nor did it increase the fraction delivered to the plasma membrane; instead, subunits appeared in the cytosol. Unassembled membrane proteins such as the MHC class I molecules (31Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) and α chains of the T cell antigen receptor (32Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) are selectively released from the ER to the cytoplasm, deglycosylated, and degraded by the proteasome. We examined whether ENaC followed a similar pathway. However, we found that the cytosolic subunits were not retrotranslocated from the ER but that they were synthesized in the cytoplasm. Accumulation in the cytosol was prominent only when single subunits were expressed (Fig. 6). In oocytes producing all three subunits (Fig. 2) accumulation in the cytosol did not occur although the total amount of protein produced was approximately the same. This indicates that the phenomenon was not simply due to saturation of the translocation machinery of the ER. The results are consistent with the notion that the efficiency of translocation to the ER is influenced by the association of the several subunits with their partners and that perhaps, if the subunits cannot be assembled rapidly they remain in the translocon (33Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for longer periods obstructing the translocation of other nascent subunits into the ER membrane. We thank Dr. M.

We provide evidence that calpains and the proteasome function synergistically downstream of caspases to assist the constitutive apoptotic program of aging neutrophils, which plays an important role in resolution of inflammatory responses. Inhibitor studies indicated that “tethering” of preapoptotic senescent neutrophils to human macrophages required caspase activity. However, the development of morphological features characteristic of apoptosis, including nuclear morphology, PS exposure, surface protein shedding, and the capacity to be ingested by macrophages, required the downstream action of either calpains or the proteasome.

Although traditionally viewed as participating in self-contained catabolism, the importance of these proteases has strengthened with two major advances: first, the discovery of a novel family of cysteinyl proteases (5Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the caspases, which cleave to the carboxyl side of aspartic residues and which are predominantly activated via autonomous cascades in the execution of an apoptotic program (6Takahashi A.

First, the cleavage of fodrin as a molecular marker of apoptosis is more than likely effected by a caspase distinct from CPP32 (41Vanags D.M. Porn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6425-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Second, inhibition of thymocyte apoptosis by the calpain inhibitor ALLN, which also inhibits the proteasome (44Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar), can be reproduced with a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, i.e. lactacystin (33Grimm L.M. Goldberg L.A. Poirier G.G. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 34Sadoul R. Fernandez P.-A. Quiquerz A.-L. Martinou I. Maki M. Schroter M. Becherer J.D. Irmler M. Tschopp J. Martinou J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Defining the role of calpains in apoptosis has also been confounded by the use of experimental models in which apoptosis is drug or stress induced, in which case calpain activation might occur independently of processes necessary for apoptosis.To extend our own studies on the role of calpains and eliminate the foregoing concerns, we have focused on the self-contained and constitutive apoptosis of senescent neutrophils, a physiological form of programmed cell death responsible for safe phagocytic removal of senescent neutrophils during resolution of inflammation (45Savill J. Haslett C. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 46Savill J. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 47Savill J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1518-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We report herein that calpains are involved in neutrophil apoptosis and that one of their functions is to modify the composition and association of actin-binding proteins with F-actin at the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONWith the exception of the caspase family (2Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 4Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 5Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the role and importance of intracellular proteases in apoptosis remain poorly defined and often controversial. Insofar as any result with protease inhibitors must be interpreted with caution, we have found evidence that caspases (zVAD), calpains (calpeptin and ALLN), and the proteasome (lactacystin and ALLN) all play a role in the constitutive apoptosis of neutrophils in vitro. The interplay between these proteases, however, was not simple. Indeed, our results demonstrate that in aging neutrophils a high degree of synergy existed between calpains and the proteasome, which acted downstream of caspases, to effect the constitutive apoptotic program of neutrophils.First we showed that calpains were constitutively active in freshly isolated neutrophils as assessed by the in situ hydrolysis of a synthetic calpain substrate, although we could not exclude the possibility that the conditions for substrate cell loading were responsible for its activation. This activity, nevertheless, was blocked with the cell-permeable inhibitors calpeptin and, to a lesser extent, ALLN. However, only ALLN, not calpeptin, was able to inhibit the constitutive apoptosis of senescent neutrophils over a 24-h period of culture. When we used lactacystin, at concentrations known to be effective for the inhibition of the proteasomal complex and an alternative target of ALLN action, we found no evidence that any aspect of neutrophil apoptosis or viability was affected. This raised the intriguing possibility that the inhibitory effect of ALLN on morphological apoptosis was attributable to the combined inhibition of calpains and the proteasome. Indeed, the combined effect of lactacystin and calpeptin in suppressing neutrophil apoptosis provided compelling evidence that a high degree of synergy existed between calpain and proteasomal activities. That ALLN was not as effective as the combination of lactacystin and calpeptin was curious but again may implicate other targets of ALLN action that may have been proapoptotic (58Zhu W. Murtha P.E. Young C.Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 214: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Throughout these studies we were unable to dissociate nuclear morphological events from cell surface phenomena such as PS exposure or CD16 and CD43 protein shedding. This confirmed that nuclear morphology and surface changes characteristic of apoptosis were coordinately regulated and distal within the apoptotic program (Fig. 7). This contrasts with the recognition, but not ingestion, of aged neutrophils by Mφ cells, in which an inhibition of both calpains and the proteasome did not inhibit the ability of Mφ cells to bind aged neutrophils. Given that the tethering of neutrophils was sensitive to caspase inhibition, this suggests that Mφ recognition was proximal to caspases but upstream of calpain and proteasomal activities required to complete the apoptotic program. These results support the likelihood that phagocyte uptake of apoptotic (59Savill J. Nature. 1998; 392: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or damaged (60Sambrano G.R. Terpstra V. Steinberg D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) cells involves potentially distinguishable stages of binding to the phagocyte followed by a separate ingestion phase.The current data establish that calpains are present in neutrophils and that their inhibition, in conjunction with that of the proteasome, results in a significant suppression of constitutive neutrophil apoptosis. However, the data provide no indication as to how calpains, or for that matter the proteasome, can effect this inhibition. Nevertheless, although calpain activity was apparently diminished once neutrophils had undergone apoptosis, this was shown to be responsible for a number of phenomena associated with the apoptotic phenotype. Furthermore, possible roles for calpain and the proteasome were suggested by the ability of both calpeptin and ALLN to wholly inhibit the immunodetection of an epitope within the immediate N terminus of β-actin that became unmasked as neutrophils underwent apoptosis, and each inhibitor impaired the loss and degradation of α-actinin and ezrin, two actin-binding, membrane-anchoring proteins. Because the anti-actin mAb used in these studies recognized an epitope adjacent to a previously characterized site of cleavage within F-actin, it may be speculated that exposure of the AC-15 epitope in the N terminus of actin and degradation of α-actinin and ezrin may be linked. Furthermore, the scissile site was previously found to be devoid of a consensus site for caspase cleavage, and ALLN, not zVAD, was able to inhibit this cleavage (12Brown S.B. Bailey K. Savill J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a finding we have since validated with the use of calpeptin (data not presented).Taken together, these results suggest that calpains are responsible for the dissociation of actin-binding proteins, including α-actinin and ezrin, from filamentous β-actin. This results in the unmasking of an immediate N-terminal epitope recognized by the mAb AC-15, rendering it susceptible to subsequent proteolysis. It is tempting to speculate further that the breakdown in cytoskeletal protein associations at the plasmalemmal interface direct the shedding of l-selectin, which binds α-actinin, and CD43, which binds ezrin. Recently, ezrin was shown to first dephosphorylate and then translocate, without degradation, from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm after Fas-induced death in L cells (61Kondo T. Takeuchi K. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Nagata S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have presented evidence that calpains and the proteasome function synergistically to complete the constitutive apoptotic program of senescent neutrophils, a physiological form of cell death important in resolution of inflammation. Most importantly, these two proteolytic activities appear to function downstream of caspases in mutually redundant pathways where the loss of both activities inhibits the characteristic phenotypic changes seen in apoptosis. This is supported, and not excluded, by recent reports in which both the calpains and the proteasome were separately implicated as key effectors of thymocyte apoptosis. In the absence of combined inhibitor studies and a wider range of criteria to assess apoptosis, other than DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphology, it remains a distinct possibility that thymocytes also require synergy between calpain and proteasomal activities. Proteases are increasingly recognized as playing a key role in effecting apoptosis and its associated morphology in cells destined to die programmed deaths (1Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 3Squier M.K.T.

Although traditionally viewed as participating in self-contained catabolism, the importance of these proteases has strengthened with two major advances: first, the discovery of a novel family of cysteinyl proteases (5Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the caspases, which cleave to the carboxyl side of aspartic residues and which are predominantly activated via autonomous cascades in the execution of an apoptotic program (6Takahashi A. Hirata H. Yonehara S. Imai I. Lee K.-K. Moyer R.W. Turner P.C. Mesner P.W. Okazaki T. Sawai H. Kishi S. Yamamoto K. Okuma M. Sasada M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2741-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); and second, the realization that limited proteolysis results not only in a loss of function for many substrates (7Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) but also in a gain of function for others. Of relevance is the caspase-dependent activation of Gas2 (8Brancolini C. Benedetti M. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5179-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), PAK-2 (9Rudel T.

Sakiyama Y. Kobayashi K. Kuzumaki N.

Bailey K. Savill J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Villa P.G. Henzel W.J. Sensenbrenner M. Henderson C.E. Pettman B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 713-722PubMed Google Scholar). The first clear evidence that proteases were important in apoptosis came from the use of nonspecific protease inhibitors. Darzynkiewicz and colleagues (14Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar) showed that as cells underwent apoptosis they lost cellular protein and that both apoptosis and protein loss could be blocked with protease inhibitors (15Bruno S. Del Bino G. Lassota P. Giaretti W. Darzynkiewicz Z. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 1113-1120PubMed Google Scholar).

First, the cleavage of fodrin as a molecular marker of apoptosis is more than likely effected by a caspase distinct from CPP32 (41Vanags D.M. Porn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6425-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Second, inhibition of thymocyte apoptosis by the calpain inhibitor ALLN, which also inhibits the proteasome (44Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar), can be reproduced with a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, i.e. lactacystin (33Grimm L.M. Goldberg L.A.

Defining the role of calpains in apoptosis has also been confounded by the use of experimental models in which apoptosis is drug or stress induced, in which case calpain activation might occur independently of processes necessary for apoptosis. To extend our own studies on the role of calpains and eliminate the foregoing concerns, we have focused on the self-contained and constitutive apoptosis of senescent neutrophils, a physiological form of programmed cell death responsible for safe phagocytic removal of senescent neutrophils during resolution of inflammation (45Savill J. Haslett C. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 46Savill J. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin.

We report herein that calpains are involved in neutrophil apoptosis and that one of their functions is to modify the composition and association of actin-binding proteins with F-actin at the plasma membrane. DISCUSSIONWith the exception of the caspase family (2Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 4Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 5Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the role and importance of intracellular proteases in apoptosis remain poorly defined and often controversial. Insofar as any result with protease inhibitors must be interpreted with caution, we have found evidence that caspases (zVAD), calpains (calpeptin and ALLN), and the proteasome (lactacystin and ALLN) all play a role in the constitutive apoptosis of neutrophils in vitro. The interplay between these proteases, however, was not simple. Indeed, our results demonstrate that in aging neutrophils a high degree of synergy existed between calpains and the proteasome, which acted downstream of caspases, to effect the constitutive apoptotic program of neutrophils.First we showed that calpains were constitutively active in freshly isolated neutrophils as assessed by the in situ hydrolysis of a synthetic calpain substrate, although we could not exclude the possibility that the conditions for substrate cell loading were responsible for its activation. This activity, nevertheless, was blocked with the cell-permeable inhibitors calpeptin and, to a lesser extent, ALLN. However, only ALLN, not calpeptin, was able to inhibit the constitutive apoptosis of senescent neutrophils over a 24-h period of culture. When we used lactacystin, at concentrations known to be effective for the inhibition of the proteasomal complex and an alternative target of ALLN action, we found no evidence that any aspect of neutrophil apoptosis or viability was affected. This raised the intriguing possibility that the inhibitory effect of ALLN on morphological apoptosis was attributable to the combined inhibition of calpains and the proteasome. Indeed, the combined effect of lactacystin and calpeptin in suppressing neutrophil apoptosis provided compelling evidence that a high degree of synergy existed between calpain and proteasomal activities. That ALLN was not as effective as the combination of lactacystin and calpeptin was curious but again may implicate other targets of ALLN action that may have been proapoptotic (58Zhu W. Murtha P.E. Young C.Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 214: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Throughout these studies we were unable to dissociate nuclear morphological events from cell surface phenomena such as PS exposure or CD16 and CD43 protein shedding. This confirmed that nuclear morphology and surface changes characteristic of apoptosis were coordinately regulated and distal within the apoptotic program (Fig. 7). This contrasts with the recognition, but not ingestion, of aged neutrophils by Mφ cells, in which an inhibition of both calpains and the proteasome did not inhibit the ability of Mφ cells to bind aged neutrophils. Given that the tethering of neutrophils was sensitive to caspase inhibition, this suggests that Mφ recognition was proximal to caspases but upstream of calpain and proteasomal activities required to complete the apoptotic program. These results support the likelihood that phagocyte uptake of apoptotic (59Savill J. Nature. 1998; 392: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or damaged (60Sambrano G.R. Terpstra V. Steinberg D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) cells involves potentially distinguishable stages of binding to the phagocyte followed by a separate ingestion phase.The current data establish that calpains are present in neutrophils and that their inhibition, in conjunction with that of the proteasome, results in a significant suppression of constitutive neutrophil apoptosis. However, the data provide no indication as to how calpains, or for that matter the proteasome, can effect this inhibition. Nevertheless, although calpain activity was apparently diminished once neutrophils had undergone apoptosis, this was shown to be responsible for a number of phenomena associated with the apoptotic phenotype. Furthermore, possible roles for calpain and the proteasome were suggested by the ability of both calpeptin and ALLN to wholly inhibit the immunodetection of an epitope within the immediate N terminus of β-actin that became unmasked as neutrophils underwent apoptosis, and each inhibitor impaired the loss and degradation of α-actinin and ezrin, two actin-binding, membrane-anchoring proteins. Because the anti-actin mAb used in these studies recognized an epitope adjacent to a previously characterized site of cleavage within F-actin, it may be speculated that exposure of the AC-15 epitope in the N terminus of actin and degradation of α-actinin and ezrin may be linked. Furthermore, the scissile site was previously found to be devoid of a consensus site for caspase cleavage, and ALLN, not zVAD, was able to inhibit this cleavage (12Brown S.B. Bailey K. Savill J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a finding we have since validated with the use of calpeptin (data not presented).Taken together, these results suggest that calpains are responsible for the dissociation of actin-binding proteins, including α-actinin and ezrin, from filamentous β-actin. This results in the unmasking of an immediate N-terminal epitope recognized by the mAb AC-15, rendering it susceptible to subsequent proteolysis. It is tempting to speculate further that the breakdown in cytoskeletal protein associations at the plasmalemmal interface direct the shedding of l-selectin, which binds α-actinin, and CD43, which binds ezrin. Recently, ezrin was shown to first dephosphorylate and then translocate, without degradation, from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm after Fas-induced death in L cells (61Kondo T. Takeuchi K. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Nagata S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have presented evidence that calpains and the proteasome function synergistically to complete the constitutive apoptotic program of senescent neutrophils, a physiological form of cell death important in resolution of inflammation. Most importantly, these two proteolytic activities appear to function downstream of caspases in mutually redundant pathways where the loss of both activities inhibits the characteristic phenotypic changes seen in apoptosis. This is supported, and not excluded, by recent reports in which both the calpains and the proteasome were separately implicated as key effectors of thymocyte apoptosis. In the absence of combined inhibitor studies and a wider range of criteria to assess apoptosis, other than DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphology, it remains a distinct possibility that thymocytes also require synergy between calpain and proteasomal activities. With the exception of the caspase family (2Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 4Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin.

Changing aspartate 283 to alanine (D283A) left 10% residual activity, contrary to a previous report, but complementation of repair-deficient bacteria by the D283A Ape1 protein was consistent with its activity in vitro. The D308A, D283/D308A double mutant, and histidine 309 to asparagine proteins had 22, 1, and ∼0.02% of wild-type Ape1 activity, respectively. Despite this range of enzymatic activities, all the mutant proteins had near-wild-type binding affinity specific for DNA containing a synthetic abasic site. Thus, substrate recognition and cleavage are genetically separable steps. Both the wild-type and mutant Ape1 proteins bound strongly to the enzyme incision product, an incised abasic site, which suggested that Ape1 might exhibit product inhibition. The use of human DNA polymerase β to increase Ape1 activity by eliminating the incision product supports this conclusion. Notably, the complexes of the D283A, D308A, and D283A/D308A double mutant proteins with both intact and incised abasic DNA were significantly more stable than complexes containing wild-type Ape1, which may contribute to the lower turnover numbers of the mutant enzymes. Wild-type Ape1 protein bound tightly to DNA containing a one-nucleotide gap but not to DNA with a nick, consistent with the proposal that substrate recognition by Ape1 involves a space bracketed by duplex DNA, rather than mere flexibility of the DNA.

The process can be initiated by DNA glycosylases, which excise damaged bases to create apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)1 sites. Modified abasic sites can arise directly from oxidative DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation (3von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology.

The AP and modified abasic sites are substrates for class II AP endonucleases, which cleave the 5′ phosphodiester of both regular (hydrolytic) AP sites (4Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev.

The proteins of the Ape1/exonuclease III family exhibit a range of enzymatic activities on duplex DNA. Along with the class II AP endonuclease activity, exonuclease III possesses duplex-specific 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, 3′-repair phosphodiesterase activity, 3′-phosphatase activity, and RNase H activity (15Richardson C.

Ape1 protein also has these multiple activities, but with 3′-repair diesterase, 3′-phosphatase, RNase H, and exonuclease activities 100–10,000-fold lower than its AP endonuclease activity (4Demple B.

The presence of multiple catalytic functions for exonuclease III, a relatively small (M r ∼30,000), monomeric protein suggested that a single active site catalyzes all the enzymatic reactions (22Weiss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1896-1901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that model, distinct recognition elements in the protein were proposed to interact with duplex DNA 5′ to the target site, and a “space” in the DNA duplex caused by a missing base or frayed 3′-end. The crystal structure of exonuclease III has been solved, and a catalytic mechanism was proposed involving a single active site (23Mol C.D. Kuo C.F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The recently proposed crystal structure of Ape1/Hap1 protein (24Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) prompted an essentially identical proposal that involves a single active site for this enzyme. Both models involve amino acid residues that are conserved in the Ape1/exonuclease III family, and the properties of some site-specific mutant Ape1 proteins are consistent with the proposal (25Barzilay G.

Some of the alterations in these proteins were mapped to conserved residues that do not correspond to functional residues proposed for exonuclease III or Ape1. One of the Rrp1 mutant proteins had diminished 3′-repair diesterase activity but normal AP endonuclease activity. Thus, either these proteins have more than one active site, or substrate specificity can be modulated independently of the catalytic activity. We have previously addressed the mechanism of substrate recognition by Ape1 protein using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and footprinting methods (28Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Those studies showed that Ape1 binds specifically around the abasic site in DNA and causes a pronounced distortion at the abasic site in a preincision complex (19Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the EMSA conditions and those of others (26Rothwell D.G. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4217-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Strauss P.R. Beard W.A. Patterson T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were not suitable for biochemical characterization, because the protein-DNA complexes were relatively unstable. Here we report improved conditions for EMSA and use the assay to monitor Ape1 binding and dissociation from an abasic substrate and the incised product. We have examined the interactions for several site-specific mutant forms of Ape1. We show here that Ape1 has a high affinity to the incised product DNA and to DNA with a one-nucleotide gap, and the several mutations that affect the catalytic activity to different degrees do not significantly affect abasic site recognition but do affect the dynamics of the protein-DNA interaction. For plasmid construction, strain DH5α (endA1 hsdR17 (r K − m K + ) supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA (NalR) relA1Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR(φ80dlacΔ(lacZ)M15)) was used (30Woodcock D.M. Crowther P.J. Doherty J.

Strain BW528 (Δxth nfo::kan) (31Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.M. Spitzer S.G. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained originally from Dr. Bernard Weiss (University of Michigan Medical School). For overproduction of human Ape1 and human DNA polymerase β (Polβ) proteins, strain BL21 (DE3) (ompT lon hsdR (rB–mB–)) was used (32Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The Ape1 expression plasmid, pXC53, was obtained from DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., and the expression plasmid for human Polβ was a generous gift of Dr. Stuart Linn (University of California, Berkeley, CA) “DeepVent” DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate site-specific mutations in APE1 cDNA. In the final expression constructs, any DNA products that resulted from PCRs were sequenced to verify that only the desired mutation had been introduced. Using plasmid pCW26 (7Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) as the template DNA, the 5′-portion of the APE1 gene was amplified with T3 (ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG) and D308A(–) primers (TAGGACAGTGAGCACTCGCGA). Likewise, the 3′-portion of the gene was amplified with T7 (AATACGACTCACTATAG) and D308A primer (TCGCGAGTGCTCACTGTCCTA) in a separate reaction. The reaction products were then isolated, mixed together, and PCR-amplified with the T7 and T3 primers to generate a complete APE1 cDNA with the desired site-specific mutation. The final PCR product was cut withEcoRI and subcloned into Bluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the EcoRI site. Note that the sequence of D308A primer had been designed to change two amino acid residues, although the final plasmid had in fact only one mutation, D308A. Mutagenesis was exactly as for D308A, except that the H309N (CGGCAGTGATAACTGTCCTAT) or D283A (GTTGGTTGGCGCCTTGCTTAC) primer and the H309N(–) (ATAGGACAGTTATCACTGCCG) or D283A(–) (GTAAGCAAGGCGCCAACCAAC) primer were used to mutate the gene. The intermediate PCR products were amplified with hAPE15NcoI (CAGCTGCCATGGGGTTCG) and hAPE13HindIII (TCTCTGAAGCTTGTTTAAAG) primers to generate the entire gene with the desired site-specific mutation. The final PCR product was cut with NcoI and HindIII and subcloned into NcoI/HindIII-digested pSE380 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The technique described for generating the D308A substitution was used to construct this double mutant, except that the template DNA for the PCR was the single mutant D283A in pSE380. The primers D308A and D308A(–) were used to create the second site-specific mutation. To construct expression plasmids for the mutant portion, the 238-base pair PstI-HindIII fragment encompassing the 3′-portion of APE1 cDNA from pXC53 was replaced with the corresponding PstI-HindIII fragment from the mutagenized plasmids. For in vivo complementation tests, aXbaI-HindIII fragment containing the entireAPE1 DNA from pXC53 or its derivatives was inserted downstream of the arabinose-regulated promoter of pBAD22A (obtained from The Cloning Vector Collection of the National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan). Strain BW528 was transformed by pBAD22A or the derivatives carrying the wild-type or mutant APE1 gene. The resulting strains were tested for their ability to form single colonies by streak-dilution on LB agar plates (33Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 0.025% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and 0.2% l-arabinose. The colony-forming ability was checked after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. Poly[d(A-T)] containing [α-32P,uracil-3H]dUMP at a frequency of one per 500 nucleotides was synthesized as described by Levin and Demple (34Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5069-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), except that the [α-32P]dUTP was prepared from labeled dCTP (Andotek, Irvine, CA) by deamination with dCTP deaminase (35Wang L. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5647-5653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Weiss, University of Michigan Medical School). After the reaction, more than 95% of dCTP had been converted to dUTP, as determined using thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose (36Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3305-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 51-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (37Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) containing a tetrahydrofuran residue (51F), a uracil (51U), or a cytosine at position 22 (51C) and the related oligonucleotides (see Fig. 6 A) were purchased from Operon Technologies Inc. (Alameda, CA). The concentration of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To generate a double-stranded substrate, 100 pmol of oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and then annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide (see Fig. 6 A). After precipitation with ethanol, the amount of DNA recovered was determined by monitoring the recovered radioactivity. To prepare incised 51F, the double-stranded oligonucleotide (100 pmol) was treated with 12.5 pmol of Ape1 in a 100-μl reaction (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. After the reaction, 98% of substrate had been converted to the incised form (data not shown). The DNA was sequentially extracted with phenol-chloroform and chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol. A substrate with a single AP site was prepared according to Bennettet al. (39Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), except that the Ape1 reaction buffer was used (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100). After treatment with recombinant E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (a generous gift of Dr. Dale Mosbaugh, Oregon State University), the reaction mixture was used directly for incision assays. To purify the recombinant Ape1 proteins, expression was accomplished by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the bacterial cultures had reached an absorbance at 600 nm to 0.5, and the incubation was continued for 90 min according to Marians (40Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (fraction I) were prepared as described by Hupp and Kaguni (41Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13128-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysate was fractionated at a 55% saturation of ammonium sulfate, and the remaining soluble proteins were then precipitated at 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The proteins were resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 100 mm KCl and dialyzed against the same buffer (fraction II). Fraction II was applied to a 20-ml phosphocellulose (Whatman P11) column and then eluted with a linear gradient of 100–750 mm KCl in Buffer A. The peak fractions containing Ape1 were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, (fraction III). Fraction III was applied to a MonoS 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then eluted with a linear gradient of 100–250 mm KCl in Buffer A. The peak fractions containing Ape1 were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against Buffer A containing 200 mm KCl and 20% polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight, 8000) (fraction IV). Fraction IV was applied to a Superose-12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which yielded a first, symmetrical peak corresponding to Ape1 protein and the AP endonuclease activity, and a second peak corresponding to residual lysozyme from the cell lysis procedure (41Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13128-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Polβ purification, expression of the protein and preparation of lysate (fraction I) were performed basically the same as for Ape1 purification. After dialysis against Buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 100 mmKCl, fraction I was applied to a 60-ml phosphocellulose (Whatman P11) column and then eluted with a linear gradient of 100–800 mm KCl in Buffer B. The peak fractions containing active Polβ were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B containing 100 mm KCl, (fraction II). Fraction II was applied to a 1-ml heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a linear gradient of 50–750 mm KCl in Buffer B. Fractions containing active Polβ were pooled. Analysis of these fractions by SDS-PAGE indicated that they contained only a single protein detectable by silver staining (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), based on the method of Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using BSA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the standard. The following binding methods were adapted from the protocols of Wilson et al. (28Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), Ng and Marians (43Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and Hendrickson and Schleif (44Hendrickson W. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Modification of the binding conditions of Wilson et al. (28Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) involved exploring the pH range 7.5–8.8 with different buffers and a range of KCl concentrations up to 50 mm NaCl (data not shown); however, the most important factors in the improved electrophoretic resolution were the reduction of the concentration of EDTA and omission of glycerol from the buffer. For binding measurements, reaction mixtures (10 μl) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.2 mg/ml BSA containing 51F DNA (1 nm) were mixed with proteins as indicated in the figure legends. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 10 min and loaded on a prerunning 8% polyacrylamide gel (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). The electrophoresis buffer contained 6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mmsodium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA (43Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the gels were subjected to a constant voltage of 8 V/cm applied for 2 h at 4 °C. Following gel electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed at –80 °C. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified using a Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad). To follow dissociation, binding reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 1 nm 51F DNA and 7.8 nm Ape1 protein were incubated on ice for 10 min. The subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C using equipment prechilled to 4 °C. At time 0, 10-μl samples were removed, mixed with 1 μl of a 1-μmunlabeled 51F stock, and incubated for various times on ice before being loaded on a prerunning gel to separate free DNA from the Ape1-DNA complexes. To deplete the Ape1 reaction product from the reaction mixture, we used human Polβ and a 51-mer oligonucleotide (100 nm) containing a natural AP site as the substrate. The concentration of proteins used is indicated in the figure legends. After the incision reactions, the AP site was treated with NaBH4 (140 mm) to reduce and stabilize it against spontaneous β-elimination (45Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). After inactivation of the enzymes by heating at 80 °C for 1 min, the DNA was analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified using a Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad). To monitor AP endonuclease activity during purification, poly[d(A-T)] containing [α-32P,uracil-3H]dUMP was used as a substrate. Just before use, the polymer was treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (kindly provided by Dr. Dale Mosbaugh, Oregon State University) at 37 °C for 1.5 h under standard assay conditions. The AP endonuclease assays contained DNA with 1.8 pmol of AP sites in 25 μl, and the reactions were initiated by addition of an enzyme sample (≤2 μl), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 25 μl of stop solution (0.45n NaOH, 25 mm EDTA) and heating for 45 min at 65 °C. The amount of incised AP sites was determined as the acid-soluble, Norit-nonadsorbed radioactivity following treatment at alkaline pH; β-elimination of nonincised AP sites does not liberate the 32P label in Norit-nonadsorbable form (34Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5069-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One unit of AP endonuclease was defined as the amount of activity that cleaves 1 pmol of AP sites per min. To monitor the Polβ activity during purification, a hairpin-structured oligonucleotide DNA (46Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used as a substrate. Assays contained 50 pmol of substrate DNA in buffer, 25 μl of 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 μm each of [α-32P]dTTP, dGTP, dCTP, and dATP and were initiated by the addition of an enzyme sample (≤2 μl) and incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 25 μl of 50 mm EDTA, and 5-μl samples were spotted on DE81 paper (Whatman), which was washed three times with 0.5 mNa2HPO4. The amount of incorporated dTMP was determined as the radioactivity retained on the paper (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The site-specifically mutated Ape1 proteins were purified following overexpression in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). After induction of the D283A and D308A mutant proteins, the crude extracts (fraction I) containing these proteins displayed significantly higher AP endonuclease activity than extracts of the control strain (data not shown), which indicated that both the D283A and D308A proteins retain substantial enzymatic activity. This result seemed to contrast with the data of Barzilayet al. (25Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), who reported a D283A mutant protein that had ∼2000-fold reduced activity. Therefore, we purified the mutant proteins very carefully, and both the AP endonuclease activity and the amount of the induced M r 37,000 protein were monitored during all purification steps. In contrast to the above, for the D283A/D308A double-mutant and H309N proteins, no increase was detected in the total AP endonuclease activity in crude extracts of cells after protein induction, even though substantial amounts of the induced recombinant proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Thus, only the inducedM r 37,000 protein could be monitored during the purification of the D283A/D308A and H309N proteins. In the final step of the H309N purification, the leading edge of a bacterial AP endonuclease peak introduced <5% contaminating activity (data not shown). Analysis of these preparations by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1) or silver (data not shown) indicated that they contained only a single predominant polypeptide (≥95%) with M r ∼37,000 as expected for this protein of 35,500 Da (7Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two proteins containing the D283A mutation migrated slightly faster in the gel.

https://openalex.org/W2010946184,"Osteocalcin gene expression is initiated perinatally and is restricted to mature osteoblasts and odontoblasts. Because their pattern of expression is highly restricted, the osteocalcin genes are excellent tools to study osteoblast-specific gene expression. To define the mechanisms of osteocalcin cell-specific gene expression in vivo, we generated transgenic mice harboring deletion mutants of the promoter region of OG2, one of the mouse osteocalcin genes. We show here that only 647 base pairs of this promoter are sufficient to confer cell-specific and time-specific expression to a reporter gene in vivo. This promoter fragment contains two copies of OSE2. This osteoblast-specificcis-acting element binds Osf2, a recently characterized osteoblast-specific transcription factor (Ducy, P., Zhang, R., Geoffroy, V., Ridall, A. L., and Karsenty, G. (1997)Cell 89, 747–754). We also demonstrate that the proximal OSE2 element is critical to confer an osteoblast-specific, developmentally regulated pattern of expression to a reporter gene. The other OSE2 element, located more upstream and presenting a lower affinity for Osf2, affects only weakly OG2 promoter activity. These data demonstrate the crucial role of Osf2 in controlling osteocalcin gene expression. Since osteocalcin synthesis is a hallmark of the differentiated osteoblast phenotype, these results suggest that, beyond its developmental function, Osf2 is also required for the maintenance of the osteoblast phenotype postnatally."

In the present study, we present evidence that thyroid hormones negatively regulate the expression of the APP gene in neuroblastoma cells. Transient transfection studies using plasmids that contain progressive deletions of the 5′ region of the gene demonstrate that triiodothyronine (T3), the more active form of the thyroid hormones, represses APP promoter activity by a mechanism that requires binding of the nuclear T3 receptor (TR) to a specific sequence located in the first exon. The unliganded receptor increases promoter activity, and T3 reverses that activity to basal levels. The repressive effect of T3 does not exhibit TR isoform specificity, and it is equally mediated by TRα and TRβ. Gel mobility shift assays using in vitro synthesized nuclear receptors and nuclear extracts led to the identification of a negative thyroid hormone response element, at nucleotide position +80/+96, that preferentially binds heterodimers of TR with the retinoid X receptor.

The β-amyloid protein, the major component of the Alzheimer-associated plaques, is derived from a set of alternatively spliced β-amyloid precursor proteins (APP),1 which are encoded by a single gene located on human chromosome 21 (for a review see Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Although at physiological levels APP appears to be involved in neurotrophic events (2Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Culwell A.R. Esch F.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), its overexpression might cause neuronal degeneration by a mechanism that probably involves an increased production of β-amyloid protein (3Yoshikawa K.

An apparent relationship between thyroid status and Alzheimer's disease has been suggested. Thyroid hormones, in particular T3, are essential for normal brain maturation and function (10Dussault J.H. Ruel J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their deficiency causes neurologic symptoms that in a way resemble those observed in Alzheimer's patients. Moreover, although a strong link between thyroid hormones and Alzheimer has not been yet established, it has been suggested that a history of thyroid dysfunction may represent a risk factor for this pathology (11Heyman A. Wilkinson W.E. Hurwith B.J. Schmechel D. Sigmon A.H. Weinberg T. Helms M.J. Swift M. Ann. Neurol. 1983; 14: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Mortimer J.A.

Pascual A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2692-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicate that T3 affects splicing and secretion of APP isoforms in neuroblastoma cells. Most of the effects of the thyroid hormone are mediated by binding and activation of nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). TR functions as a ligand-inducible transcription factor to increase or decrease the transcription of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs), which consist of hexameric half-sites of the consensus sequence AGGTCA arranged as palindromes or direct repeats (for a review, see Ref. 14Lazar M.A. Endocr.

Ligand binding induces a conformational change that causes the release of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators, which bind to the AF-2 C-terminal domain (16Chen J.D. Evans R.M Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), and allows transactivation. The mechanisms involved in T3-dependent transcriptional repression remain less well defined. Negative response elements (nTREs) are located close to, and often downstream from, the transcriptional start site (17Carr F.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nTREs are frequently composed of more than one TR-binding site, each of them containing sequences that partially resemble the AGGTCA sequence described for positive TREs (17Carr F.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M-E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRs can bind to these sequences as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with RXR (17Carr F.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M-E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13899-13905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, up to now, a consensus sequence for nTREs has not been yet established, and the precise role of RXR on the T3-induced repression remains unclear. In addition, TRs can also negatively affect the expression of certain genes, without requiring binding to DNA, by interfering with AP-1-induced transcriptional activation (22Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that T3 reduces APP transcripts in N2a-β neuroblastoma cells. Transient transfection studies with different fragments of the 5′ region of the APP gene, together with gel mobility shift assays, show that the negative effect of T3 requires binding of TR to sequences located within the first exon of the APP gene, between positions +80 and +96. These sequences preferentially bind TR/RXR heterodimers, whereas monomers or homodimers are either not bound or bound with a very low affinity. Insertion of the +55/+102 region of the APP gene, which contains the +80/+96 element, confers negative regulation by T3 to a heterologous promoter. Taken together, our results reveal the existence of a functional nTRE, located in the first exon, that could mediate a repressive effect of thyroid hormone on APP gene expression. Murine N2a neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described previously by Ortiz-Caro et al. (23Ortiz-Caro J. Yusta B. Montiel F. Aranda A. Pascual A. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous to the experiments, the culture medium was replaced with a similar medium containing serum depleted of thyroid hormone by treatment with resin AG1X8 as described by Samuels et al.(24Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. Endocrinology. 1979; 105: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and the cells were then incubated in this medium for an additional 24-h period before the beginning of the experiments. N2a-β cells, a subclone that constitutively expresses the β-isoform of TR (TRβ), were grown as described previously by Lebel et al.(25Lebel J-M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the experiments were carried out in the same medium containing 0.5% thyroid hormone-depleted fetal calf serum. Total RNA was extracted from the cell cultures by the guanidine thiocyanate method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The RNA (30 μg) was run in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon-nitrocellulose membranes (Nytran) for Northern blot analysis. The RNA was stained with 0.02% methylene blue. The blots were hybridized, as described by Church and Gilbert (27Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar), with a plasmid containing a human APP cDNA labeled by random oligonucleotide priming. Hybridizations were at 65 °C in PSE buffer (0.3m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mmEDTA). Quantification of mRNA levels was carried out by densitometric scan of the autoradiograms. The values obtained were corrected by the amount of RNA applied in each lane, which was determined by densitometry of the stained membranes. The chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter plasmid containing the −1099/+105 fragment of the human APP gene has been previously described (28Lahiri D.K. Robakis N.K. Mol. Brain. Res. 1991; 9: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Progressive 5′ deletions to −487, −307, −15, +55, and +75 bp were prepared by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the BamHI site of pBL-CAT8, a plasmid that lacks the AP-1 binding site present in the pUC backbone. The cDNAs encoding TRα, RXRα, and v-ErbA as well as the cDNAs encoding TR mutants E401Q, E401K, and C-1 are inserted into the EcoI site of the expression vector pSG5, which contains the SV40 early promoter (29Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.d. M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The reporter construct TREAPP/TK-CAT consists of a single copy of the +55/+102 fragment of APP inserted in front of a TK promoter driving the expression of the CAT gene. N2a cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 1 μg of reporter plasmids and carrier DNA. One hundred nanograms of a luciferase reference vector was simultaneously used as an internal control of the transfection efficiency. In cotransfection experiments, 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of the corresponding receptor expression vector were used. After 16 h of incubation in the presence of calcium phosphate, a new medium containing 0.5% thyroid hormone-depleted serum was added, and the cells were then incubated for an additional period of 48 h in the presence or absence of 5 nm T3. Each treatment was performed in duplicate cultures that normally showed less than 5–15% variation in CAT activity, which was determined by incubation of [14C]chloramphenicol with cell lysate protein. Each experiment was repeated at least two or three times with similar relative differences in regulated expression. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing the TR-binding sequences of the human APP promoter, were end-labeled with [32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase and then incubated with in vitro translated receptors or with nuclear extracts obtained from N2a-β cells. cDNAs for TR and RXR in pSG5 were transcribed and translated in vitro with the TNT kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The nuclear extracts were obtained by the method of Andrews and Faller (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). For gel retardation assays, translated receptors (2 μl) or nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated on ice for 15 min in a buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 13% glycerol) containing 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) and then were incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature with approximately 70,000 cpm of the double-stranded labeled oligonucleotide. Unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate was used as a control for nonspecific binding. For competition experiments, increasing concentrations of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence TREPAL (5′-AGGTCATGACCT-3′), were added to the binding reaction mixture. For gel supershift, the reaction mixtures were incubated with 1 μl of specific anti-TR or anti-RXR antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5% TBE buffer. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C. APP mRNA levels were determined in N2a-β cells, which express high levels of TRβ (25Lebel J-M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), after treatment with 5 nm T3. Fig. 1 illustrates the results obtained in a representative Northern blot carried out with 30 μg of total RNA. A single band of 3.4 kilobases, which corresponds to APP mRNA was detected. Densitometric scanning of the bands showed that T3 decreased APP mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. The negative effect of T3 was already detected at 24 h and became more evident after 48 h of treatment. No effects of T3 on APP mRNA levels were observed in parental N2a cells, which express very low levels of TR (23Ortiz-Caro J. Yusta B. Montiel F. Aranda A. Pascual A. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Transient transfection assays were carried out to determine whether or not T3 affects the transcriptional activity of the APP gene in neuroblastoma cells. N2a-β cells were transiently transfected with a chimeric plasmid containing the −1099 to +105 bp fragment of the human APP gene linked to the CAT reporter gene and then incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of 5 nm T3. As shown in Fig. 2 (left panel), CAT activity was significantly inhibited in N2a-β cells incubated in the presence of T3, whereas this hormone did not affect the activity of the APP gene promoter in the parental N2a cell line. To confirm the role of TR in this negative response, the unresponsive parental N2a cells were co-transfected with the APP promoter-CAT construct and a vector expressing the α-isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor (TRα). As shown in Fig. 2 (right panel), the unliganded TR increased basal promoter activity, and T3 effectively reversed this effect. The negative effect of T3 in N2a cells transiently transfected with TRα was very similar to that observed in N2a-β cells, thus showing that the inhibitory effect of T3 does not exhibit TR isoform specificity. To map the DNA sequences of the 5′-flanking region of the human APP gene involved in the T3-induced response, progressively deleted fragments (−1099, −487, −307, and −15) of the promoter were linked to the upstream region of the reporter CAT gene and transfected into N2a-β cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the negative effect of T3 was maintained even in cells transfected with the shortest (−15/+102 bp) fragment, which lacks the AP-1 sites. Similar results were obtained in N2a cells transfected with TRα (data not shown). These results strongly suggest the existence of a TR-binding site in the −15 to +102 bp region of the gene. Ligand-dependent transactivation function of the TR is associated with an autonomous and highly conserved C-terminal region of the receptor referred to as AF-2 (29Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.d. M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To determine whether this transcriptional domain could also play a role in the ligand-dependent repression of the APP promoter, we examined the response to T3 in N2a cells transfected with v-ErbA, a natural AF-2 mutant of TRα that fails to bind ligand, as well as with several TRα mutants affecting the AF-2 domain. The C-1 mutant carries a 9-amino acid C-terminal deletion like that found in v-ErbA, and the E401Q and E401K mutants contain a point mutation of the Glu (E) residue at position 401. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the wild-type receptor and the AF-2 mutants increased with a similar potency the activity of the −1099/+105 APP promoter construct in the absence of ligand. T3 effectively reversed the promoter activation induced by the wild-type TR, but it was unable to reduce significantly the constitutive induction caused by the AF-2 mutant receptors. The C-1 and E401K mutants show a strongly reduced ligand binding affinity (29Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.d. M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which, as in the case of v-ErbA, could explain the lack of response to T3. However, the effect of T3 was also abolished in the E401Q mutant, in which ligand binding affinity remains unaltered (29Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.d. M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). For a more detailed study of the DNA sequences involved in this T3-induced response, we further analyzed the −15/+102 bp region of the gene. As depicted in Fig. 5 (upper panel), a computer-assisted study of the nucleotide sequence of this region revealed the existence of three potential thyroid hormone response elements located at the nucleotide positions −4 to +9 (E1), +20 to +30 (E2), and +80 to +96 (E3). The first motif overlaps the major transcriptional start point, and the other two, E2 and E3, are located within the first exon of the gene. To determine whether the potential response elements of the APP gene are able to bind TR, we conducted gel mobility shift assays within vitro translated receptors and oligonucleotides containing the E1, E2, and E3 sequences. As illustrated in Fig. 5, no specific retarded bands were detected when TR or RXR were used separately, and only the oligonucleotide (+75/+101) containing the E3 motif was able to specifically bind TR/RXR heterodimers. No detectable complexes were established between the heterodimer and the probes containing the E1 (−10/+15) or E2 (+13/+37) sequences. To further analyze the E3 domain, the only motif that effectively bound TR/RXR, we performed new gel mobility shift assays, using both in vitro translated receptors and nuclear extracts obtained from control and T3-treated N2a-β cells. Fig. 6 A shows binding of thein vitro translated protein preparations. A specific band running in a position that is compatible with a mobility complex containing the heterodimer TR/RXR was detected. In agreement with the results observed in Fig. 5, bands corresponding to monomers or homodimers of TR or RXR were not detected. TR/RXR binding to the oligonucleotide containing the E3 motif appeared not to be significantly affected by T3, which only induced a slight increase in the mobility of the retarded band. The retarded band was competed by the unlabeled E3-containing oligonucleotide as well as by the thyroid hormone consensus response element TREpal. No competition was observed when an unrelated oligonucleotide was used. Fig. 6 B shows the results of a representative gel mobility shift assay carried out with nuclear extracts of N2a-β cells. Several retarded bands were detected. The most prominent band presented a mobility identical to that obtained with the in vitro translated TR/RXR heterodimer (lane 3). The mobility of this band was again slightly increased in the presence of T3. This band was specifically competed by an excess of both unlabeled E3 oligonucleotide or TREpal but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide. The presence of TR and RXR in the complex was tested with specific antibodies against both receptor proteins. The retarded band was inhibited by the TR antibody (Fig. 6, αTR) and supershifted by the RXR antibody (αRXR). These data show that the E3 element binds the endogenous TR/RXR heterodimers present in N2a-β cell nuclei. In addition to the major TR/RXR-containing complex, nuclear extracts from N2a-β cells caused the formation of a minor retarded band of slower mobility. This unidentified band contains neither TR nor heterodimers of RXR with other nuclear receptors, since it was unaffected by the antibodies. The nucleotide sequence of the E3 element contains three motifs +80/+85, +85/+90, and +91/+96, each resembling the consensus core sequence AGGTCA established for the positive TREs. To confirm the functionality of this potential nTRE, we studied whether this element is able to confer T3 responsiveness to a heterologous nonresponsive promoter. For this purpose, N2a cells were transiently cotransfected with a TK-CAT construct or the TREAPP/TK-CAT (a chimeric plasmid containing the +55 to +102 bp fragment of the human APP gene linked to the TK-CAT reporter gene) and an expression vector for TRα. As shown in Fig. 7, the activity of the TK promoter was not affected by TR either in the presence or in the absence of T3. In contrast, the insertion of the APP promoter fragment into the upstream region of the construct conferred T3 responsiveness to the TK promoter. The regulation was identical to that found with the APP promoter, where unliganded TR significantly increased CAT activity and T3 reverted the increased activity to the uninduced basal levels. In this report, we present evidence that T3 negatively regulates APP gene expression in a rat neuroblastoma cell line. The repressive effect of T3 was observed in N2a-β cells, a subclone that constitutively expresses high levels of TRβ, but not in the parental cell line, which contains low levels of thyroid hormone receptors. This suggests that the negative effect of T3 on the APP gene will occur specifically in cells and brain regions expressing high TR levels. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that T3 represses APP promoter activity in N2a-β cells. Several mechanisms, involving either binding to specific nTREs or interference with other positive transcription factors, in particular the AP-1 complex (22Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), have been described as mediating negative regulation of gene expression by T3. The APP promoter has the typical structure of a housekeeping gene, lacking the TATA and CAAT elements but containing two AP-1 sites, which are located upstream of the transcription start point, at nucleotide positions −345 and −38 (31Salbaum J.M. Weidemann A. Lemaire H. Master C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 32Milici A. Salbaum J.M. Beyreuther K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33LaFauci G. Lahiri D.K. Salton S.R.J. Robakis N.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Chernak J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results show that the progressive removal of the AP-1 sites did not significantly affect the repressive effect of T3 on the APP promoter, thus ruling out the participation of a mechanism involving transcriptional antagonism between TR and the AP-1 complex. These results, together with the requirement for TR, suggested a mechanism in which the negative effect of T3 could be directly mediated by receptor binding to specific DNA sequences. Negative TREs are normally located in the proximal promoter or even within the first exon, downstream of the transcriptional start site. The finding that T3 effectively repressed the activity of a minimal APP promoter fragment suggested the existence of a negative TRE in the proximity of the main transcriptional start site. Sequence analysis of the promoter region located between nucleotides −15 and +102 revealed the presence of three potential TR binding sites. The promoter fragments −4/+9 and +20/+30 contain sequences that strongly resemble the previously established AGGTCA consensus TRE half-site. However, analysis of the binding properties of these elements revealed that they are unable to bind TR or TR/RXR. Only the sequence located between nucleotides +80 and +96 binds the receptor significantly. Therefore, although the possibility that the more upstream sequences could contribute to modulate TR binding to the more downstream element cannot be dismissed, our results strongly suggest that the negative effect of T3 on the APP gene might be mediated by a unique nTRE present within the first exon at positions +80/+96. The putative nTRE of the APP gene contains at least two hemisites, each resembling the consensus TR binding motifs. A central core of nucleotides might be interpreted as a third hemisite or alternatively as a spacer. It is well known that orientation and spacing as well as the primary nucleotide sequence of core DNA-binding motifs strongly contribute to dictate the selective positive or negative transcriptional actions induced by the ligand-dependent family of transcription factors (35Näär A.M.

The APP element binds heterodimers of TR with RXR but does not bind TR monomers or homodimers. This result is different from that obtained with other negative responses to T3, where the monomeric TR forms appear to play an essential role (17Carr F.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preferential binding of TR/RXR heterodimers firmly supports a structure containing two hemisites spaced by five or, more likely, four base pairs. In both cases the downstream hemisite (+91/+96 bp) is identical to the sequence found by Desvergne et al. in the rat malic enzyme TRE (36Desvergne B. Petty K.J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1008-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first hemisite, in turn, can be defined either at nucleotides positions +80/+85 (5-bp spacer model) or +81/+86 (4-bp spacer), both resembling the consensus sequences described in the rat growth hormone TRE by Brent et al. (37Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y. Warne R.L. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1996-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (-AGGT(C/A)A-) and Norman et al.

Binding of unliganded receptors to nTREs can lead to a constitutive activation of gene transcription (39Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol.

In N2a cells, unliganded TRα stimulates APP promoter activity, and as occurs with a number of negatively regulated genes (17Carr F.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M-E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5710-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), T3 reverses the activation induced by the transfected unliganded receptor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for constitutive activation are still unknown. However, it has been recently reported that unliganded TR might stimulate the basal activity of negatively regulated promoter in a manner that requires the association of corepressors (42Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The addition of T3 might reverse basal activity, perhaps by dissociation of those corepressors. Experiments with AF-2-defective mutants show that this receptor region is required for the T3-dependent repression of the APP promoter in N2a cells. A point mutation, E401Q, which affects T3-dependent activation without altering T3 binding (29Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.d. M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), severely impaired the repressive activity of T3 on the APP promoter. These data indicate that the AF-2 function is required not only for ligand-dependent stimulatory responses mediated by positive response elements but also for the repressive effect of T3 on the APP promoter. Since the AF-2 region appears to be mainly involved in the binding of coactivators (43Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), our results strongly suggest that these proteins might play a role in the regulation of the APP gene by T3. In contrast, TR mutants lacking the AF-2 function activated transcription in a ligand-independent manner as efficiently as wild-type TR, indicating that the C-terminal region of TR is dispensable for T3-independent transactivation of the APP promoter and that different domains are required for the ligand-dependent and ligand-independent actions of TR on this promoter. Finally, our data show that the TR/RXR-binding element of the APP promoter was able to confer negative regulation by T3 to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Furthermore, this element also conferred stimulation by the unliganded receptor. These results confirm the functionality of the binding element and strongly suggest that this nTRE alone is sufficient to mediate both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent actions of the thyroid hormone receptor on the APP gene. In summary, this report describes a negative regulation of APP gene expression by the thyroid hormone in neuroblastoma cells. This effect requires a nTRE, which binds TR/RXR heterodimers, located in the first exon downstream of the main transcriptional start site and is equally mediated by TRα and TRβ. In addition to the repressive effect of the thyroid hormone on APP mRNA levels and APP promoter activity, we have previously demonstrated that thyroid hormones specifically alter the pattern of intracellular and secreted APP isoforms (13Latasa M.J. Belandia B. Pascual A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2692-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results together with the reduction of thyroid hormone receptor levels observed in Alzheimer hippocampal cells (44Sutherland M.K. Wong L. Somerville M.J. Handley P. Yoong L. Bergeron C.

Aging. 1992; 13: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the effects exerted by estradiol or retinoic acid on APP expression and metabolism (9König G. Master C.L. Beyreuther K.

This and related enzymes show strong dependence on divalent cations, particularly magnesium. Here we explore the role of this metal in different stages of the Ape1 reaction: substrate binding, cleavage, and product release. We examined DNA binding using an electrophoretic approach and DNA cleavage in single-turnover and steady-state reactions. Magnesium at low to moderate concentrations accelerated both substrate and product release by wild-type Ape1 protein. For a mutant Ape1 protein with an aspartate to alanine substitution at residue 308, substrate in preformed protein-DNA complexes was more efficiently cleaved before release in contrast to wild-type Ape1, whereas product release was accelerated dramatically. The magnesium dependence of steady-state AP endonuclease reactions was sigmoidal for both wild-type and the aspartate 308 to alanine protein but was not sigmoidal for an aspartate 283 to alanine derivative of Ape1. These results show that magnesium affects both DNA interactions with and phosphodiester cleavage by Ape1 and can change the rate-limiting step of the reaction. Structural studies will need to be interpreted in the context of these diverse effects of the metal. Repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites is initiated by AP endonucleases, such as the human Ape1 protein (also called Hap1, Apex, and Ref1). This and related enzymes show strong dependence on divalent cations, particularly magnesium. Here we explore the role of this metal in different stages of the Ape1 reaction: substrate binding, cleavage, and product release. We examined DNA binding using an electrophoretic approach and DNA cleavage in single-turnover and steady-state reactions.

Loss of DNA bases to form apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)1 sites occurs spontaneously and through removal of aberrant bases by DNA glycosylases (1Lindahl T.

In addition, free radicals attack DNA deoxyribose to form oxidized abasic sites (3von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor and Francis, London1987Google Scholar). Because AP sites are mutagenic (4Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), their repair is important for maintaining genetic stability. AP site repair is initiated by AP endonucleases, and the predominant forms of these enzymes hydrolyze the 5′-phosphodiester of the abasic residue (2Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev.

Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have shown that Ape1 also possesses a high affinity for its product, the incised AP site (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Indeed, this affinity is such that DNA containing incised AP sites displays an inhibitory effect on the nicking reaction of Ape1 (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Like many nucleases, Ape1 is strongly stimulated by metals, such as magnesium (10Chen D.S. Herman T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) in the absence of substrate revealed bound metal atoms that could account for the metal stimulation of their activities. Substitution of some Ape1 residues thought to be involved in this metal binding lowered the enzyme activity (13Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, our own work indicates that at least one of these Ape1 residues (aspartate 308) is in fact dispensable (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, preincision complexes of abasic DNA and either an Ape1 derivative with an alanine substitution at residue 283 (D283A) or the D308A mutant protein had increased stability (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Mg2+ might play a role in the Ape1 enzyme reaction other than, or in addition to, the proposed mechanistic function in phosphodiester cleavage (13Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Gorman M.A. Morera S.

To address the role of magnesium in the human AP endonuclease, we have developed methods to observe sequentially several steps of the Ape1 reaction at an abasic site. We show here that for wild-type Ape1, Mg2+ stimulates the dissociation from incised DNA in a manner dependent on the concentration by a mechanism independent of its effect on DNA cleavage. At Mg2+ concentrations up to 3 mm, the D283A and D308A mutant proteins dissociated more quickly than wild-type Ape1 from the incised DNA product. At low Mg2+ concentrations, the two mutant proteins displayed higher activity than wild-type Ape1. Thus, Mg2+ has complex effects on the Ape1 endonuclease reaction that influence both the overall interaction with the DNA substrate and product, and the incision step. The generation and purification of the wild-type and mutant Ape1 proteins have been described in separate work (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). T4 endonuclease V was isolated as described by Johnson and Demple (26Johnson A.W. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18017-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abasic DNA substrate was a 51-mer duplex oligonucleotide (27Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), in this case with a tetrahydrofuran abasic residue at position 22 (51F). The tetrahydrofuran substrate was used in order to avoid substrate degradation during electrophoresis (18Wilson D.M.I. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The development of improved protein-DNA binding conditions and a gel-buffer system for EMSA have been described separately (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and 1 nm5′-α-32P-labeled-51F DNA. To follow dissociation after the addition of MgCl2, binding reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 7.8 nm Ape1 were incubated at 0 °C for 10 min. At time 0, 10-μl samples were removed, mixed with 1 μl of a 1 μm unlabeled 51F stock containing MgCl2, followed by incubation for various times at 0 °C before loading on a prerunning 8% polyacrylamide gel (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) to separate the free DNA from the Ape1-DNA complexes. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified by phosphorimaging (Molecular Imager System, Bio-Rad). The figures show x-ray film autoradiographs of the same gels. The final concentrations of MgCl2 after mixing are indicated in the figure legends; note that the final mixtures also contained 0.9 mm EDTA. To identify only the initial nicking reaction in the Ape1·51F-DNA complex, we developed a running start incision assay. A binding reaction mixture (10 μl) (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, labeled 51F DNA (1 nm), and 7.8 nmApe1) was incubated for 10 min on ice. The incision reaction was started by mixing in 1 μl of a solution containing 1 or 8.5 μm unlabeled 51F DNA and MgCl2 at 11 times the final concentrations indicated in the figures. After incubation for 10 s at 0 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and mixing, followed by addition of 8 μl of formamide. The DNA was then analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified by phosphorimaging (Molecular Imager System, Bio-Rad); the figures show autoradiographs on x-ray film. Steady-state AP endonuclease assays were routinely performed by using as the substrate poly[d(A-T)] containing occasional [α-32P,uracil-3H]dUMP residues and freshly treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (kindly provided by Dr. Dale Mosbaugh, Oregon State University) (28Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5069-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For assays of the 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of Ape1, the polymer was first treated concurrently with uracil-DNA glycosylase and T4 endonuclease V (26Johnson A.W. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18017-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-two-μl aliquots of the reactions were mixed with 2 μl of MgCl2 (at a concentration 12.5 times the final concentration indicated in Fig. 6). The reactions were started by adding 1 μl of the indicated amount of Ape1 protein. The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and polymer containing 1.8 pmol of AP sites or 3′-abasic deoxyribose. After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped, and the amount of deoxyribose released was determined from the acid-soluble and Norit-nonadsorbed radioactivity (26Johnson A.W. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18017-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); for AP endonuclease assays, the acid/Norit treatment was preceded by β-elimination (28Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5069-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To address the effect of MgCl2 on preformed complexes of Ape1 with DNA containing an AP site, we utilized as the substrate a 51-mer double-stranded DNA containing a tetrahydrofuranyl residue (51F), because the stability of this substrate also allowed us to use EMSA to determine the dissociation of Ape1 from the AP site in the presence of EDTA (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The newly developed EMSA buffer differed slightly from the standard endonuclease buffer for Ape1 (11Wilson III., D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) but allowed a cleaner separation of protein-DNA complexes from the free DNA than obtained previously (11Wilson III., D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the modified EMSA buffer supported the endonuclease activity almost as well as the standard reaction buffer, and the relative activities of the wild-type and mutant Ape1 proteins were consistent between the two conditions (Table I). It was noteworthy that the AP endonuclease activities of both proteins containing the D308A mutation were 2–3-fold higher in the EMSA buffer than in the standard buffer (Table I). We have not determined whether this small difference was due to the pH difference or the KCl difference between the buffers.Table IRelative AP endonuclease activities of wild-type and mutant Ape proteins under different assay conditionsMutationStandard buffer1-a50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100.EMSA buffer1-b50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and 10 mm MgCl2.Wild-type10067D308A2267D283A106.0D283A/D308A1.02.0H309N0.0140.009The steady-state AP endonuclease assay (28Levin J.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5069-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (see under “Experimental Procedures”) was used to determine the activities of Ape1 proteins. Aliquots of reactions containing preformed Ape1·51F-DNA complexes were removed and mixed in solution with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled 51F-DNA and MgCl2 to reach a final concentration of 10 mm. (Note that the final mixtures also contained 0.9 mm EDTA.) After incubation for various times, the samples were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel to separate the remaining Ape1·51F-DNA complexes from the free 51F-DNA. The results showed that MgCl2 drastically accelerated the dissociation of the complexes (Fig. 1 A); the half-life of the complexes in 10 mm Mg2+ was <10 s (Fig. 1 A). This result agrees with previous measurements by a filter binding assay (18Wilson D.M.I. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The same result was obtained when magnesium-glutamate was used instead of MgCl2(data not shown). The addition of MgCl2 also accelerated the dissociation of the mutant Ape1 proteins D283A, D308A, D283A/D308A (double mutant), and H309N from the AP site (Fig. 1, B–E). Note that in absence of Mg2+, all of the proteins, except for the H309N protein, exhibited relatively slow dissociation from intact AP-DNA (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because three of these mutant enzymes have very low or undetectable AP endonuclease activity, the results indicated that MgCl2 destabilized the preincision complexes of the mutant Ape1 proteins with 51F-DNA. An alternative possibility was that rapid dissociation occurs after Ape1-mediated incision of the DNA and that preformed complexes with the mutant proteins would be competent for cleavage of the DNA. To distinguish between these possibilities, it was essential to separate the initial incision from subsequent reactions. For this purpose, we employed a running start incision assay (see under “Experimental Procedures”). After complex formation, incision reactions were started by addition of MgCl2 and a large excess of unlabeled 51F-DNA, and the reactions were carried out for only 10 s at 0 °C (Fig. 2). In this assay, the amount of the incised product recovered was insensitive to the amount of excess unlabeled 51F-DNA added over a 100–850-fold range (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the majority of the products would be derived from the initial incision. Before the addition of MgCl2, 75% of the 51F-DNA was present in a complex with wild-type Ape1 (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). However, the amount of incised product observed in the running start assay corresponded to only 30% of the total 51F-DNA (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, more than half of the wild-type Ape1 protein dissociated without incising DNA substrate. In the same way, ∼38% of the D308A protein and >90% of the D283A, D283A/D308A, and H309N proteins dissociated without incising the DNA substrate (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 8–16). We conclude that MgCl2 accelerates the dissociation of Ape1 from intact AP sites, in addition to promoting the incision reaction. The results of the running start incision assay showed that MgCl2 has two different effects: to support the nicking reaction and to accelerate the dissociation of Ape1. For a more detailed analysis of the effect of MgCl2 on the interaction of Ape1 with substrate and product DNA, reactions containing preformed Ape1·51F-DNA complexes were mixed with a large excess of unlabeled 51F-DNA containing various concentrations of MgCl2. Because Ape1 dissociated quickly upon the addition of MgCl2 (Fig. 1), the dissociation reactions were carried out for 10 s at 0 °C and then immediately loaded on polyacrylamide gels that were already undergoing electrophoresis to separate the remaining Ape1·51F-DNA complexes from free 51F-DNA. The results of such an experiment showed that the dissociation was sensitive to concentrations of Mg2+significantly lower than the optimal values reported for the overall incision (steady-state) reaction (13Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, at 1 mm total MgCl2, the dissociation rates of wild-type Ape1 and of the H309N proteins were slightly slower than in the absence of MgCl2 (Fig. 3 A, panels a and e, compare lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the dissociation of the D283A, D308A, and D283A/D308A proteins was monotonically dependent on the Mg2+ concentration (Fig. 3,A and B). To observe the initial nicking reaction as a function of Mg2+ concentration, running start assays were carried out. However, in this experiment, we focused on only the wild-type and D308A mutant proteins, because the activities of the D283A, D283A/D308A, and H309N proteins were too low to be used for the running start incision assay (Fig. 2). Above 1 mm total Mg2+, the amount of the incised products was inversely related to the concentration of MgCl2 (Fig. 4). At a total Mg2+concentration of 1 mm, about half of the substrate DNA was converted to product by both proteins. The results indicated that of the preformed Ape1·51F-DNA complexes, 80% was converted into the incised form for wild-type Ape1, and 63% was converted for the D308A protein. This result suggested that the stable complex of wild-type Ape1 that was observed in the dissociation assay at low concentrations of MgCl2 (Fig. 3 A, panel a, lane 3) contained the incised form of 51F-DNA. To confirm this conclusion, we isolated the free DNA fraction from a gel of a sample taken 10 s after the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration 0 or 2 mm (see Fig. 3 A, panels a and c, lanes 2 and 4) and analyzed these materials on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. In this experiment, 90% of the DNA that had dissociated from wild-type Ape1 was still intact (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 2 and 3), but at least 50% of the DNA that had dissociated from the D308A protein was the incised product (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 4 and 5). This result was consistent with the interpretation that the dissociation of product from wild-type Ape1 was slower than the dissociation of intact DNA at low concentrations of MgCl2. In contrast, the D308A protein dissociated more quickly from the product after incision. Fig. 5 A shows time courses for the dissociation of preincision complexes before and after the addition of MgCl2 (1 mm). For wild-type Ape1, the half-life of the complex with intact 51F-DNA was ∼50 s (Fig. 5 A), similar to the value determined previously (18Wilson D.M.I. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Upon addition of 1 mm MgCl2, the 51F complex with wild-type Ape exhibited a half-life of 4.4 min (Fig. 5 A). For the D308A protein, the complex with 51F-DNA in the absence of Mg2+ was very long-lived (t½ ∼ 9 min; Fig. 5 A), consistent with our previous determination (19Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J.

When 1 mmMgCl2 was added, ∼70% of the D308A·51F-DNA complex dissociated within 15 s, and the remainder decayed with a half-life of ∼75 s (Fig. 5 A). The biphasic nature of the Mg-induced dissociation of the D308A protein could reflect the time necessary for Mg2+ binding into the protein, the time for incision of the DNA, or the actual dissociation from incised DNA. To address the effect of Mg2+ specifically on only the dissociation from incised DNA, preincision 51F-DNA and Ape1 proteins were mixed to form complexes in the presence of 1 mmMgCl2 instead of 1 mm EDTA, and a large excess of unlabeled 51F-DNA was added at time 0. After incubation for various times, the samples were analyzed by EMSA. Notably, in the presence of MgCl2, the same amount of complex was formed as in the absence of MgCl2 (Fig. 5 B, time 0), indicating that MgCl2 does not affect the overall binding affinity of Ape1 proteins for incised 51F-DNA. This result was confirmed by protein titration in the presence of MgCl2 (data not shown). Fig. 5 B shows that in the presence of MgCl2 the dissociation rate of the D308A protein from the incised DNA was increased dramatically. In contrast, the dissociation rate of wild-type Ape1 was slightly decreased (Fig. 5 B). These results confirmed that under these conditions, 1 mmMg2+ represses dissociation of wild-type Ape1 but accelerates the dissociation of D308A protein from incised DNA and that the stabilizing effect of Mg2+ on the wild-type Ape1-DNA complex (Fig. 5 A) is likely due to stabilization of the complex with incised DNA (Fig. 5 B). The results described above suggested that the rate-limiting step in Ape1-mediated cleavage might vary with the magnesium concentration. We therefore determined the effect of MgCl2 on the steady-state nicking reaction of wild-type and mutant Ape1 proteins (Fig. 6). Kane and Linn (20Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined an optimal concentration of 10–15 mmMgCl2 for the AP endonuclease activity of Ape1. Our results (Fig. 6 A) agree with that determination, but they also revealed that the magnesium dependence of wild-type Ape1 was sigmoidal (Fig. 6 A), indicating that the metal has two different effects on the enzyme reaction. The D308A protein also exhibited sigmoidal Mg2+ dependence, whereas the D283A protein had metal dependence that increased monotonically to plateau at 2.5–5 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 6 A, inset). Both of these mutant proteins had higher activity than the wild-type at MgCl2 concentrations ≤1.25 mm (Fig. 6 A). This result was consistent with the data from EMSA experiments, which showed that at total Mg2+ concentrations of 1–3 mm, the D283A and D308A proteins dissociate from product faster than wild-type Ape1 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the product dissociation step may limit the turnover of human AP endonuclease at moderate to low Mg2+ concentrations, and increasing the concentration of MgCl2 enhances the dissociation after incision. In contrast, the 3′-repair phosphodiesterase activities of wild-type Ape1 and the mutant proteins were all maximal at about 1.25–2.5 mm MgCl2, and the magnesium dependence curves were not sigmoidal (Fig. 6 B). The experiments presented here show that Mg2+ has complex effects on the overall reaction of Ape1 with DNA containing abasic sites. As in many other nucleases, the metal likely supports the chemistry of phosphodiester cleavage, a conclusion consistent with the identification of metal atoms bound around the proposed active sites of Ape1 (25Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and exonuclease III (24Mol C.D. Kuo C.F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, Mg2+ clearly also has independent effects on the binding of Ape1 to its substrate and product abasic DNA molecules. Such effects were not apparent in the activity of the enzyme as a 3′-repair diesterase acting to unblock DNA 3′-termini, which is, in any case, a much more sluggish reaction (10Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,29Suh D. Wilson III, D.M. Povirk L.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the rate-limiting step of the Ape1 reaction with abasic DNA can vary with the Mg2+ concentration. At low MgCl2 concentrations, the rate-limiting step for wild-type Ape1 appears to be product release, and the increased velocity of product release at higher MgCl2 overcomes this limitation such that catalysis (or another step) becomes rate-limiting. The latter conclusion is consistent with the conclusion of Strausset al. (17Strauss P.R. Beard W.A. Patterson T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), who carried out experiments only at 5 mm MgCl2. In the present work, we have also found that magnesium not only enhances DNA cleavage by Ape1 but also destabilizes the preincision protein-DNA complex. Because of these multiple effects, we could not directly address whether the binding affinity of Ape1 for DNA abasic sites is altered by magnesium. On the other hand, we did show that magnesium does not affect the overall affinity of Ape1 protein for incised abasic sites, although the stability of complexes with incised DNA was decreased by the metal. To investigate the magnesium effect on the substrate affinity of Ape1 protein would require substrate analogs that do not undergo cleavage. One such substrate could be the Sp diastereomer of a 5′-phosphorothioate at the tetrahydrofuranyl site, which is cleaved at a rate >500-fold lower than the corresponding Rp diastereomer (11Wilson III., D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, we found that introducing the Sp 5′-phosphorothioate also significantly reduced the affinity of Ape1 for DNA in EMSA experiments. 2D. M. Wilson III, M. Takeshita, and B. Demple, unpublished results. Thus, the inhibitory effect of this 5′-phosphorothioate derivative is likely due both to decreased affinity and to inhibition of the cleavage chemistry. For these reasons, the slow reaction of Ape1 on the Sp phosphorothioate cannot be taken as evidence that phosphodiester hydrolysis itself is rate-limiting in the normal Ape1 reaction, as some have argued (17Strauss P.R. Beard W.A. Patterson T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The response of the mutant Ape1 proteins to magnesium was informative regarding the roles of this metal. The aspartic acid residues 283 and 308 that were replaced with alanines in the mutant proteins are conserved among the members of the Ape1/exonuclease III family (25Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Mutation of these two residues affects the enzyme activity to differing degrees (Table I), however, and they exert different effects on the magnesium dependence of the enzyme. Wild-type Ape1 still exhibited low activity even in the presence of EDTA (consistent with a previous observation of Wilson et al. (18Wilson D.M.I. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas the D308A protein lacked detectable activity (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 5). One possibility is that aspartate-308 helps bind Mg2+ tightly to the protein, such that some bound metal is retained in wild-type Ape1 through the purification process and in the presence of chelator. This tightly bound metal would in turn contribute to more unstable binding of the substrate and product DNA than is found for the D308A protein. The more dramatic effect of mutating aspartate 283 suggests that this residue plays a separate, critical role, perhaps in anchoring and orienting a metal atom that is directly involved in catalysis, as suggested by the structural studies of Gorman et al. (25Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, the activity of both the D283A and the D283A/D308A proteins was maximal at relatively low metal concentration (2.5 mm MgCl2 for the AP substrate (Fig. 6 A) or ∼0.25 mmMg2+ for the 3′-repair substrate (Fig. 6 B)). In other words, if aspartate 283 is involved in orienting the Mg2+ ion to promote chemistry, elevating the metal concentration would likely not correct this effect. The in vivo consequences of the variations of Ape1 activity with Mg2+ concentration are unknown. Although reliable figures are not available for changes in the amount of free Mg2+ in cells, it is possible that Ape1 might, under some circumstances, exhibit slow dissociation after cleavage of an abasic site and limit DNA repair. Our studies point to complex effects of this important metal and show that the issue of substrate recognition should be considered in the context of magnesium interactions with both the protein and the DNA.

After import into the mitochondrial matrix, the presequence is cleaved off by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, and the 90-amino acid-long N-terminal tail is translocated to the inter-membrane space in a process dependent on pre-existing Oxa1p (4Hell K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Based on hydrophobicity analysis and limited proteolysis data, Oxa1p is thought to span the mitochondrial inner membrane five times with the C terminus in the matrix (7Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), although this model remains to be experimentally verified.Oxa1p homologues have been found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (1Bonnefoy N.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plunkett G.D. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Genomics. 1993; 16: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity and PhoA fusion analyses suggest a topology with six transmembrane (TM)1 segments. In contrast to mitochondrial Oxa1p, Oxa1Ec has an uncleaved, N-terminal signal-anchor sequence. Interestingly, although most Oxa1Ec-PhoA fusions are degraded by periplasmically added proteinase K, only a short N-terminal piece is removed from the wild-type and full-length fusion proteins. C-terminal parts of the protein are thus essential for folding and/or oligomerization into a protease-resistant form.DISCUSSIONMitochondrial Oxa1p has been implicated in the translocation of N- and C-terminal tails of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins from the matrix to the intermembrane space (2He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since S. cerevisiae mitochondria do not contain a Sec-type protein translocation machinery (23Glick B.S. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2651-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), Oxa1p is thought to be a component of a new protein translocation pathway present also in bacteria, possibly specialized in the assembly of inner membrane proteins.We have determined the membrane topology of the 60-kDa Oxa1p homologue present in E. coli (Oxa1Ec). Hydrophobicity and PhoA fusion analyses support a Ncyt-Ccyttopology with six transmembrane segments, Fig. 5. The distribution of positively charged residues (Arg, Lys) conforms to the “positive inside” rule (24von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), lending further support to the proposed topology.Mitochondrial Oxa1p lacks a TM domain at the N terminus but otherwise has a similar hydrophobicity profile as Oxa1Ec (Fig. 1). In agreement with the topology model proposed here for Oxa1Ec, previous work has shown that the large N-terminal domain and the loop between the second and third TM in Oxa1p is exposed to the intermembrane space (7Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that Oxa1p and Oxa1Ec have the same topology beyond the N-terminal TM present only in OxaEc.Interestingly, despite having most of its mass exposed to the periplasm, Oxa1Ec folds into a protease-resistant conformation where only the most N-terminal TM can be removed by proteinase K treatment of spheroplasts. Protease resistance is only seen in the full-length protein, suggesting that important folding determinants are present in the C-terminal ∼50 residues and that full-length Oxa1Ec might be part of an oligomeric complex, as has been proposed for the mitochondrial Oxa1p (4Hell K.

Mitochondrial Oxa1p lacks a TM domain at the N terminus but otherwise has a similar hydrophobicity profile as Oxa1Ec (Fig. 1). In agreement with the topology model proposed here for Oxa1Ec, previous work has shown that the large N-terminal domain and the loop between the second and third TM in Oxa1p is exposed to the intermembrane space (7Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that Oxa1p and Oxa1Ec have the same topology beyond the N-terminal TM present only in OxaEc. Interestingly, despite having most of its mass exposed to the periplasm, Oxa1Ec folds into a protease-resistant conformation where only the most N-terminal TM can be removed by proteinase K treatment of spheroplasts. Protease resistance is only seen in the full-length protein, suggesting that important folding determinants are present in the C-terminal ∼50 residues and that full-length Oxa1Ec might be part of an oligomeric complex, as has been proposed for the mitochondrial Oxa1p (4Hell K.

https://openalex.org/W2041480709,"Gab1 is a member of the docking/scaffolding protein family which includes IRS-1, IRS-2, c-Cbl, p130cas, and p62dok. These proteins contain a variety of protein-protein interaction motifs including multiple tyrosine residues that when phosphorylated can act as binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling proteins. We show in the RAMOS human B cell line that Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 correlated with the binding of several SH2-containing signaling proteins to Gab1 including Shc, Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase. Far Western analysis showed that the SH2 domains of Shc, SHP-2, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase could bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 isolated from activated RAMOS cells. In contrast, the Grb2 SH2 domain did not bind directly to Gab1 but instead to the Shc and SHP-2 associated with Gab1. We also show that Gab1 is present in the membrane-enriched particulate fraction of RAMOS cells and that Gab1/signaling protein complexes are found in this fraction after BCR engagement. Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 may recruit cytosolic signaling proteins to cellular membranes where they can act on membrane-bound targets. This may be a critical step in the activation of multiple BCR signaling pathways. Gab1 is a member of the docking/scaffolding protein family which includes IRS-1, IRS-2, c-Cbl, p130cas, and p62dok.

Signaling by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)1 regulates several key steps in B cell development and activation (1Gold M.R. Matsuuchi L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 157: 181-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In particular, the binding of antigens to the BCR is important for initiating the differentiation of resting B cells into antibody (Ab)-secreting plasma cells. The BCR exerts its effects by activating multiple signal transduction pathways. These include the well characterized Ras, phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase pathways, as well as other signaling pathways involving Vav and the HS-1 protein (1Gold M.R. Matsuuchi L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 157: 181-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2DeFranco A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). An important question is how these signaling pathways are turned on when antigens bind to the BCR. The BCR consists of a membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) that is associated with the invariant Ig-α and Ig-β polypeptides (3Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane Ig contains the antigen binding site while the disulfide-linked Ig-α/β heterodimer can initiate all signal transduction events characteristic of the BCR (4Law D.A. Chan V.W.-F. Datta S.K. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 645-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Clustering of the BCR by multivalent antigens or by anti-Ig Abs results in the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases, which then phosphorylate a large number of substrates. Two of these substrates are the Ig-α and Ig-β chains of the BCR, which are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic tails (5Gold M.R. Matsuuchi L. Kelly R.B. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3436-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-containing sequences provide binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of both the Src family tyrosine kinases and the Syk tyrosine kinase. Recruitment of these tyrosine kinases to Ig-α/β is essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of other substrates and for activation of BCR signaling pathways (1Gold M.R. Matsuuchi L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 157: 181-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 7Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Many of the signaling pathways initiated by the BCR also rely on the translocation of cytosolic signaling proteins to cellular membranes where they can act on membrane-associated targets. For example, the Ras activator SOS is a cytosolic enzyme that must translocate to the membrane in order to activate Ras, which is tethered to the inner face of the plasma membrane. Similarly, both PLC-γ and PtdIns 3-kinase are cytosolic enzymes whose lipid substrates are located in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Thus, bringing together the components of signaling pathways is likely to be the key event in initiating signal transduction. A major mechanism by which cytosolic signaling proteins are recruited to cellular membranes involves the binding of SH2 domains in the signaling enzyme or associated adapter protein to Tyr(P)-containing sequences in membrane-associated proteins. The Tyr(P)-containing ITAM sequences in Ig-α/β are all pYXXL/I (single-letter code, where X is any letter), which is optimal for recruiting the Src and Syk kinases, but would not be able to recruit the diverse array of SH2 domain-containing proteins important for BCR signaling (8Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). One way in which this problem is overcome is by phosphorylation of other membrane-associated proteins that can provide docking sites for signaling proteins. For example, BCR ligation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the transmembrane proteins CD19 and CD22, allowing them to bind PtdIns 3-kinase, Vav, and the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase (9Tuveson D.A. Carter R.H. Soltoff S.P. Fearon D.T. Science. 1993; 260: 986-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10Law C.L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z.H. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J.

Another class of proteins termed docking or scaffolding proteins may also play a role in recruiting signaling proteins to cellular membranes. The docking protein family includes IRS-1, IRS-2, p130cas, c-Cbl, and p62dok. These proteins have multiple protein-protein interaction motifs including proline-rich sequences, SH3 domains, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Some docking proteins can associate with membranes, and this may be due in part to their PH domains binding membrane lipids (12Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of docking proteins is that they are phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues in response to receptor signaling and can then bind SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. For example, in response to insulin stimulation, IRS-1 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues, which allows it to bind Fyn, PtdIns 3-kinase, SHP-2, Grb2, and Nck (13White M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Similarly, the BCR uses c-Cbl and p130cas as docking proteins for PtdIns 3-kinase and for the Crk and Grb2 adapter proteins (14Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Soltoff S. Reedquist K. Druker B.

A recently identified member of the docking protein family is the Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) protein (18Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Gab1 is most closely related to the IRS-1 docking protein. Like IRS-1, Gab1 has a PH domain as well as a C-terminal region that is rich in proline and serine residues. Gab1 also has two PXXPXR motifs, which may allow it to bind SH3 domain-containing proteins. Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to both insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, and this allows it to bind the SH2 domains of Grb2, PtdIns 3-kinase, PLC-γ, and the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase (18Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In this report we investigated whether the BCR uses Gab1 as a docking protein in the RAMOS human B cell line, a cell line that has been used extensively to study BCR signaling (14Panchamoorthy G.

We show that BCR ligation induces strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and causes the SH2 domain-containing proteins Shc, Grb2, PtdIns 3-kinase, and SHP-2 to bind to Gab1. These Gab1/signaling protein complexes are present in the membrane-enriched particulate fraction of activated RAMOS B lymphoma cells. Thus, the BCR may use Gab1 to recruit multiple signaling proteins to cellular membranes where they can act on membrane-associated targets. Abs to Gab1 were produced by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Gab1 fusion protein (18Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) or were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-SHP-2, anti-Cbl, and anti-GST Abs, as well as the anti-Grb2 mAb, were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Cas mAb was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-p85 Ab was from Lewis Williams (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). Rabbit IgG (control) was purified from normal rabbit serum using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Bacteria harboring plasmids encoding GST fused to the Shc SH2 domain or the Shc phosphotyrosine-binding domain were a gift from M. Welham (University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom). Bacteria carrying plasmids encoding GST fused to either the N-terminal or C-terminal SH2 domains of the PtdIns 3-kinase p85 subunit were from T. Pawson (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada). Bacteria carrying a plasmid encoding GST fused to the Grb2 SH2 domain were from G. Koretzky (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), while bacteria carrying a plasmid encoding GST fused to the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2 were obtained from F. Jirik (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Fusion protein production was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia, Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). RAMOS cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. The cells were resuspended to 2.5 × 107/ml in modified Hepes-buffered saline (21Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulated with goat anti-human IgM Abs (Bio-Can, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The stimulation was stopped by adding cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4. After washing, the cells were solubilized at 5 × 107/ml in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After 10 min on ice, detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Cells were stimulated and washed as above, resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na3MoO4, 5 μmβ-methylaspartic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and broken with five 5-s bursts using a needle probe and a Misonix XL sonicator (Farmingdale, NY). The efficiency of cell disruption was monitored by trypan blue staining. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The soluble fraction was removed, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The pellet containing the particulate fraction was rinsed with sonication buffer and then resuspended in sonication buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The pellet was dispersed by brief sonication, and detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 3 min in the cold. Extracts from 1–2 × 107 cells (3 × 107 cells for cell fractionation experiments) were pre-cleared for 30 min at 4 °C with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose and then mixed with Abs (1–2 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by adding 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose and mixing for an additional hour. The beads were washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer before eluting bound proteins with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were separated on 1.5-mm-thick SDS-PAGE mini-gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters for 75 min at 70 V. Molecular mass standards were visualized by staining with Ponceau S (Sigma). For anti-Tyr(P) blots, filters were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) while all other blots were blocked with TBS containing 5% milk powder. Primary antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and incubated with the filter for 3 h at room temperature or overnight in the cold. After washing with TBS/0.05% Tween 20, the filters were incubated 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000 in TBS; Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 in TBS; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) or protein A (1:2500 in TBS; Bio-Rad). The filters were washed extensively with TBS/0.1% Tween 20, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To reprobe filters, bound Abs were removed by washing the filter with several changes of TBS, pH 2, for 1 h. The stripped filters were then blocked and probed as above. Anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked 1 h with TBS/5% BSA and then incubated overnight in the cold with 2 μg/ml GST fusion protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% azide. After washing for 30 min with TBS/0.05% Tween 20, the filters were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1 μg/ml anti-GST mAb in TBS. The filters were washed 30 min with TBS/0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 in TBS). After washing the filters for 30 min with TBS/0.1% Tween 20, immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Extracts from 3–5 × 106 cells (7 × 106 cells for cell fractionation experiments) were immunoprecipitated as above and then washed twice with Triton X-100 lysis buffer (Na3VO4 reduced to 50 μm) and three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. PtdIns (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was dried under nitrogen gas, resuspended to 1 mg/ml in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and sonicated before adding 10 μg to each tube. After 10 min on ice, reactions were initiated by adding 40 μl of kinase assay buffer (30 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 200 μm adenosine, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature and stopped with 0.1 ml of 1 n HCl. The lipids were extracted with 0.2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and 20 μl of the lower phase was spotted onto oxalate-treated silica TLC plates (VWR Scientific, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The chromatograms were developed in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (18:14:3:1). After drying, the plates were exposed to film at −80 °C. If the BCR uses Gab1 as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing proteins, then Gab1 should be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to BCR engagement. We initiated BCR signaling by adding anti-IgM Abs to RAMOS human B lymphoma cells and then examined the phosphorylation state of Gab1 by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. We found that a 110–120-kDa protein that had the same electrophoretic mobility as Gab1 was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated within 2 min of adding anti-IgM antibodies to the cells. This response persisted for at least 30 min (Fig. 1). Re-probing these blots with anti-Gab1 Abs showed that BCR ligation caused a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of Gab1 (Fig. 1), consistent with the idea that Gab1 is phosphorylated after BCR engagement. However, since BCR ligation also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 Cas and p120 Cbl, we wished to rule out the possibility that the tyrosine-phosphorylated 110–120-kDa band seen in the anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates was either Cas or Cbl that had co-precipitated with Gab1. We found that neither Cas nor Cbl could be detected in anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2), even after very long exposures. 2R. J. Ingham and M. R. Gold, unpublished results. Although we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that an unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated 110- to 120-kDa protein co-precipitated with Gab1, the simplest interpretation of our results is that BCR ligation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1.Figure 2Cas and Cbl do not co-precipitate with Gab1. RAMOS cells were incubated for 2 min with (+) or without (−) anti-IgM Abs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Abs to Gab1, Cas, or Cbl or with rabbit IgG (control). Precipitated proteins were analyzed by blotting with an anti-Cas mAb (A) or with anti-Cbl (B) Abs. Molecular mass standards (in kDa) are indicated to the left. Note that, even after very long exposures of these blots to film, no Cas or Cbl was detected in anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our finding that Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to BCR ligation suggests that it could act as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. Since many of these proteins are themselves tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to receptor signaling, we asked whether tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with Gab1 in anti-IgM-stimulated RAMOS cells. We found that tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of approximately 150, 90–97, 70, 55, and 50 kDa bound to Gab1 after BCR ligation (Fig. 3). We had previously shown that BCR engagement causes Shc (21Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar) and PtdIns 3-kinase2 to associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 110–120 kDa. Therefore, we asked whether these signaling proteins associated with Gab1 in activated RAMOS B cells. The p52 and p46 forms of the Shc adapter protein are strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to BCR engagement, and phosphorylated Shc is a major target for the SH2 domain of the Grb2 adapter protein in activated B cells (21Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar). Since Grb2 associates with the Ras activator SOS, Shc may play a key role in activating Ras by directing Grb2·SOS complexes to the plasma membrane where Ras is located. Given the potentially important role of Shc in BCR signaling, we asked whether the Gab1-associated phosphoproteins of approximately 55 and 50 kDa were the two isoforms of Shc. Immunoblotting anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates with anti-Shc Abs showed that both the p52 and p46 forms of Shc bound to Gab1 in anti-IgM-stimulated cells but not in unstimulated RAMOS cells (Fig. 4 A). Reprobing these filters with an anti-Tyr(P) mAb showed that the Gab1-associated phosphoproteins of approximately 55 and 50 kDa had the same electrophoretic mobility as tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc.2 Thus, both isoforms of Shc bind to Gab1 after BCR ligation. The binding of Shc to Gab1 after BCR engagement suggests that Gab1 could be a docking site for Grb2·SOS complexes in activated B cells. Therefore, we determined whether Grb2 bound to Gab1 in B cells. Fig. 4 B shows that there was a small amount of Grb2 associated with Gab1 in unstimulated RAMOS cells but that BCR stimulation significantly increased the amount of Grb2 bound to Gab1. Thus, Gab1 may participate in BCR-mediated Ras activation by providing a docking site for Grb2·SOS complexes. PtdIns 3-kinase is another cytosolic signaling enzyme that must be recruited to the plasma membrane in order to gain access to its substrates. PtdIns 3-kinase phosphorylates inositol phospholipids, and we have shown that BCR ligation increases the levels of PtdIns 3-kinase products in B cells (22Gold M.R. Aebersold R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Gab1 might also be a docking site for PtdIns 3-kinase, we immunoprecipitated Gab1 from RAMOS cells and assayed for the presence of the p85 subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase and for PtdIns 3-kinase enzyme activity. Immunoblotting with anti-p85 Abs showed that BCR ligation caused PtdIns 3-kinase to associate with Gab1 (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, PtdIns 3-kinase activity was present in anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates from anti-IgM-stimulated cells but not from unstimulated cells (Fig. 5 B). Thus in B cells, Gab1 appears to be a docking site for PtdIns 3-kinase and may recruit PtdIns 3-kinase to the plasma membrane where its substrate is located. In A431 cells, EGF stimulation causes the 70-kDa SHP-2 (PTP-1D, Syp) tyrosine phosphatase to associate with Gab1 (18Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In RAMOS cells, we found that a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of similar molecular mass bound to Gab1 after BCR ligation (Fig. 3). Therefore, we asked whether this Gab1-associated protein was SHP-2. We found that SHP-2 bound to Gab1 in anti-IgM-stimulated cells but not in unstimulated cells (Fig. 6 A). Reprobing these blots with the anti-Tyr(P) mAb indicated that SHP-2 had the same electrophoretic mobility as the 70-kDa Gab1-associated phosphoprotein.2 This suggested that SHP-2 might be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to BCR ligation. Fig. 6 Bshows that SHP-2 was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to BCR cross-linking. Moreover, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of approximately 150 and 110–120 kDa co-precipitated with SHP-2 from anti-IgM-stimulated cells. The 110-120-kDa protein is likely Gab1. The identity of the 150-kDa protein is not known, but a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of similar molecular mass associates with Gab1 in anti-IgM-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). Thus, SHP-2 is a target of BCR-activated tyrosine kinases and uses Gab1 as a docking site. Gab1 contains tyrosine residues, which if phosphorylated, would be consensus binding sites for the SH2 domains of Shc, Grb2, PtdIns 3-kinase, and SHP-2. Tyrosine 162 of Gab1 is part of an optimal sequence (YQLI) for binding the Shc SH2 domain (23Zhou S. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), tyrosine 48 is part of a YKND motif that is optimal for binding the Grb2 SH2 domain (8Songyang Z.

This suggests that BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 could create binding sites for the SH2 domains of Shc, Grb2, PtdIns 3-kinase, and SHP-2 and that this could be the basis for the association of these proteins with Gab1 in activated RAMOS cells. To directly test this model, we performed Far Western assays in which we probed blots of anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of Shc, Grb2, PtdIns 3-kinase, and SHP-2. Fig. 7 shows that a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Shc could bind directly to a 110–120-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 Abs from anti-IgM-stimulated RAMOS cells but not from unstimulated RAMOS cells. Reprobing this blot with the anti-Gab1 Ab showed that this 110–120-kDa band had the same electrophoretic mobility as Gab1 (Fig. 7 A, lower panel). The Shc SH2 domain fusion protein did not bind to Gab1 precipitated from unstimulated RAMOS cells, consistent with the idea that it binds only to tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1. We found that GST fusion proteins containing the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2, the N-terminal SH2 domain of the PtdIns 3-kinase p85 subunit, or the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85 could also bind directly to Gab1 from anti-IgM-stimulated RAMOS cells. As a specificity control, we showed that a GST fusion protein containing the Shc phosphotyrosine-binding domain did not bind to Gab1 or any other protein in anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7 E). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the SH2 domain fusion proteins bound to an unidentified 110–120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that co-precipitated with Gab1, the simplest interpretation of our results is that BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 created binding sites for the SH2 domains of Shc, PtdIns 3-kinase, and SHP-2. Although Grb2 binds directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 precipitated from EGF-stimulated A431 cells (18Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J.

https://openalex.org/W1965627178,"Abstract Although cytoskeletal regulation is critical to cell function during interphase and mitosis, the components of the cytoskeleton involved with its control are only beginning to be elucidated. Recently, we reported the identification of a cytoskeletal-associated protein,proline-serine-threoninephosphatase-interacting protein (PSTPIP), whose level of tyrosine phosphorylation was controlled by PEST-type protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) bound to a novel protein interaction site in the PSTPIP predicted coiled-coil domain. We also showed that the PSTPIP SH3 domain interacts with theWiskott-Aldrich syndromeprotein (WASP), a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, in a manner modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we describe the identification of PSTPIP 2, a widely expressed protein that is related to PSTPIP. PSTPIP 2 lacks an SH3 domain but contains a region predicted to bind to PEST-type PTPs, and structure-function analyses demonstrate that PSTPIP 2 interacts with the proline-rich C terminus of the PEST-type PTP hematopoietic stem cell factor in a manner similar to that previously demonstrated for PSTPIP. Confocal microscopy revealed that PSTPIP 2 colocalizes with PSTPIP in F actin-rich regions. PSTPIP 2 was found to be efficiently phosphorylated in v-Src-transfected or pervanadate-treated cells at two tyrosines conserved in PSTPIP, but in contrast to PSTPIP, tyrosine phosphorylated PSTPIP 2 was only weakly dephosphorylated in the presence of PTP HSCF. Finally, analysis of oligomer formation demonstrated that PSTPIP and PSTPIP 2 formed homo- but not heterodimers. These data suggest that a family of tyrosine phosphorylated, PEST PTP binding proteins may be implicated in cytoskeletal regulation."

Although all these WSCPs exhibit similar properties in terms of hydrophilicity, molecular size, and subunit conformation, they can be categorized into two groups on the basis of their chlorophyll content. The first group shows a higher content of Chl a, and includes WSCPs from cauliflower (Chl a/b= 6.3) (2Murata T. Toda F. Uchino K. Yakushiji E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 245: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), wild mustard (Chl a/b = 8) (1Murata T. Murata N. Carnegie Inst.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); the second group is characterized by a higher content of Chlb, as in WSCPs from L. virginicum (Chla/b = 1–2) (5Murata T. Ishikawa C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Itoh R. Itoh S. Sugawa M. Oishi O. Tabata K. Okada M. Nishimura M. Yakushiji E. Plant Cell Physiol. 1982; 23: 557-560Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although some physicochemical and biochemical characterizations of WSCPs have been performed, almost nothing has been determined in regard to the physiological function of these proteins in plant tissues. In recent studies, it was suggested that the WSCPs from cauliflower (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Brussels sprouts (4Kamimura Y. Mori T. Yamasaki T. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) may be identical to a drought-induced 22-kDa protein in rapeseed, BnD22, which possesses a motif of the Künitz-type proteinase inhibitor family (7Downing W.L. Mauxion F. Fauvarque M.-O. Reviron M.-P. de Vienne D. Vartanian N. Giraudat J. Plant J. 1992; 2: 685-693PubMed Google Scholar, 8Reviron M.-P. Vartanian N. Sallantin M. Huet J.-C. Pernollet J.-C. de Vienne D. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although WSCPs from cauliflower (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), rapeseed (3Nishio N. Satoh H.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and L. virginicum (Y. Oka, K. Fujiyama, H. Satoh, K. Nakayama, and M. Okada (1996) DDBJ accession no. AB002589) possess this motif, those from cauliflower and Brussels sprouts have been reported not to inhibit trypsin (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Kamimura Y. Mori T. Yamasaki T. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been speculated that BnD22 controls proteolytic pathways in plants, based on its ability to slightly inhibit chymotrypsin activity (10Ilami G. Nespoulous C. Huet J.-C. Vartanian N. Pernollet J.-C. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 1-8Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to their predicted function as a proteinase inhibitor, WSCPs have been postulated to function as a Chl carrier (4Kamimura Y. Mori T. Yamasaki T. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Murata T. Ishikawa C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, there are no experimental data in support of this hypothesis. In this study, we have cloned the cauliflower WSCP cDNA and expressed it in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein linked to maltose-binding protein (MBP). The recombinant MBP-WSCP successfully bound Chl molecules in the same fashion as did the native WSCP when the protein was mixed in aqueous solution with thylakoid membranes from spinach leaves. This result makes WSCP the first documented hydrophilic protein capable of removing Chls from thylakoid pigment proteins, and suggests that the WSCP may function as a Chl carrier in plants. Seeds of cauliflower (B. oleracea L. var. botrys) were germinated on cubes of glass fiber irrigated with half-strength Hoagland's solution. Seedlings were grown hydroponically with the same medium in a greenhouse under a 16-h photoperiod at 23 °C. The volume of medium was maintained at the original level by addition of water every other day, and the culture medium was changed every 2 weeks. Cauliflower plants for purification of native WSCP were obtained from a local farmer in Chiba, Japan. About 2 kg of cauliflower leaves were used for the WSCP purification (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of native WSCP was determined by mass spectrometry (Voyager; PerSeptive Biosystems). The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using a kit from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. cDNA of cauliflower-WSCP was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (11Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad., Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). Two-month-old cauliflowers grown hydroponically were transferred, along with their bases, from the growth medium and left to dry for 2 days in the greenhouse. Total leaf RNA was extracted by the guanidium thiocyanate method (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of total RNA by priming the reaction with an oligo(dT)20-M4 anchor (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). The reverse-transcription reaction was performed at 42 °C for 1 h with 3 μg of RNA and 300 units of reverse transcriptase XL (Takara Biomedicals, Japan) in a 10-μl mixture. Previously, 46 amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus of native WSCP from cauliflower were determined (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The amplification was performed using Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Biomedicals) in the presence of sense primer (5′-AGAGAACAGGTGAAGGA-3′) corresponding to NH2-terminal residues REQVKD, and anchor (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) primer. PCR (GeneAmp 2400; Perkin-Elmer) was conducted for 30 cycles using the profile: 94 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. An additional 10 min at 72 °C was used for the last cycle. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene) at the EcoRV site. Six independent recombinant clones were sequenced using an ALFred DNA sequencer with a Thermo Sequenase or an Autoread DNA Sequencing Kit (all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA confirmed that it encoded WSCP of cauliflower and BnD22 of rapeseed (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Downing W.L. Mauxion F. Fauvarque M.-O. Reviron M.-P. de Vienne D. Vartanian N. Giraudat J.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For further confirmation of the identity of the cDNA, we performed RACE-reverse transcription PCR with a sense DNA primer (5′-ATGAAGACTTTTTTTCTAG-3′) corresponding to the NH2-terminal residues of the BnD22 precursor, MKTFFL (7Downing W.L. Mauxion F. Fauvarque M.-O. Reviron M.-P. de Vienne D. Vartanian N. Giraudat J. Plant J. 1992; 2: 685-693PubMed Google Scholar). An amplified fragment was cloned and sequenced. To express the mature form of WSCP, a cDNA without the signal peptide was excised and cloned into a procaryotic expression vector, pMAL-cRI (New England Biolabs). Cauliflower WSCP was expressed in E. colias a fusion protein linked to the MBP. Expression of MBP-WSCP and affinity purification by amylose column chromatography were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Profiles of the expressed protein and its purification were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were prepared from spinach chloroplasts according to the methods of Nakayama et al. (14Nakayama K. Itagaki T. Okada M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 311-317Google Scholar). Five nmol of WSCP was mixed with membrane aliquots containing 0, 1.25, 5 or 20 nmol of Chls in an aqueous solution of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.5 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm maltose. After 30 min at 22 °C, the water-soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min and subjected to PAGE (detergent-free) using an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Fluorescence of Chls bound to MBP-WSCP was detected on a long wave UV transilluminator. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. To analyze the spectrophotometric properties of the reconstituted MBP-WSCP, thylakoid membranes with an 8-fold molar excess of Chls relative to MBP-WSCP were mixed with MBP-WSCP. After centrifugation, the water-soluble fraction, as well as native WSCP purified from cauliflower, were analyzed by absorption and fluorescence spectrometries using a U-3300 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Co., Ltd.) and a FluoroMax spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries). The absorption spectral data at 0.2-nm intervals were analyzed as fourth derivative spectra (15Savitzky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (15323) Google Scholar). Spectra were resolved into their components (16Nakayama K. Mimuro M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using an Igor Multi-peak Fit package (Wave Metrics, Inc.). To determine the ratio of Chl molecules to MBP-WSCP, a thylakoid membrane preparation containing 200 nmol of Chls was incubated with 40 nmol of MBP-WSCP at 23 °C for 30 min and centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 15 min). An aliquot of the supernatant was then subjected to protein quantitation. SDS solution was added to the remaining supernatant to a final concentration of 1%. Chls were extracted from holo-MBP-WSCP by diethyl ether, and the concentrations of Chls were determined spectrophotometrically in 80% acetone (17Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry was calculated from the amounts of protein and Chls in reconstituted MBP-WSCP. Photosynthetic pigments were extracted from spinach leaves with chloroform (18Kobayashi M. Watanabe T. Nakazato M. Ikegami I. Hiyama T. Matsunaga T. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 81-89Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) after the leaves were dried by grinding with a silica gel (19Katayama N. Hirata T. Kurashima A. Dasai A. Yokohama Y. Jpn. J. Phycol. 1994; 42 (in Japanese): 71-77Google Scholar). Chls a and b were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Unicil Pack C18; Gasukuro Kogyo, Japan) using 100% methanol as an eluent. Five hundred pmol of MBP-WSCP was mixed with 0, 12.5, 125, 250, or 500 pmol of purified Chl a in 20% ethanol and 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The mixtures were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min and subjected to 8% PAGE (detergent-free). The Chls and proteins were visualized. A cDNA for cauliflower WSCP was amplified by 3′-RACE PCR with a sense primer deduced from residues 1–6 (REQVKD) of the native WSCP (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and cloned. Six independently isolated recombinants contained identical sequences. These 729-base pair cDNAs contained an open reading frame encoding 199 amino acids, and a 3′-untranslated region of 129 bases. All 48 amino acids of the native WSCP (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) corresponded to the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA starting at residue 1 of the mature form of WSCP. Our previous work suggested that cauliflower WSCP and BnD22, a drought-induced protein in rapeseed, were identical (3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To verify this identity, we used a sense primer corresponding to the NH2terminus of a precursor of BnD22 for the RACE-PCR with cauliflower RNA. An amplified band was cloned and sequenced (Fig. 1). The sequence of the cDNA was identical to that of the fragment amplified with a sense primer for the NH2 terminus of mature WSCP. In addition, we cloned a cDNA for BnD22 from rapeseed and expressed it in E. coli. The recombinant MBP-BnD22 exhibited the same properties of binding to Chl as did the recombinant MBP-WSCP (discussed below). Together, these results indicate that the drought-induced BnD22 protein in rapeseed is WSCP. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA was compared with a data base by the BLASTp program (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Sequences of proteins in Brassicaceae with high homology to WSCP are aligned in Fig. 2. All proteins listed in the figure contain a motif for the Künitz-type proteinase inhibitor family (PROSITE (21Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) accession no. PS00283, indicated by the thick bar in Fig. 2), although the functional significance remains obscure. The WSCP sequence of cauliflower (B. oleracea) shows extensive homology (94%) to BnD22 of rapeseed (B. napus), supporting the identity of both proteins. In contrast, the WSCP in L. virginicum (DDBJ accession no. AB002589) showed a much lower homology (44%) to that from cauliflower. InRaphanus sativus, a cDNA encoding a protein that is 80% homologous to WSCP, designated P22, has been cloned as a salt- and drought-stress-inducible protein (22Lopez F. Vansuyt G. Fourcroy P. Casse-Delbart F. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 91: 605-614Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similar drought-related proteins have been cloned from Brassica rapa (C. Shin, S. Song, and Y. Choi (1993) GenBank accession no. Z25770) and Arabidopsis thaliana (24Gosti F. Bertauche N. Vartanian N. Giraudat J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The sequence homologies of cauliflower WSCP to these two proteins are 51% and 26%, respectively. Although it is unclear whether or not these proteins can bind Chls, it can be concluded that proteins homologous to WSCP are widespread in Brassicaceae. Residues that were conserved among the six proteins listed in Fig. 2are indicated by asterisks. Many of these conserved residues were located in the NH2-terminal half, suggesting that the functionally and/or structurally important regions might be located in this region. A conserved region in WSCP,39PFCPLGI45 (indicated by the thin bar in Fig. 2), showed homology to the sequence motif called the (F/Y)DPLGL motif (25Green B.R. Kühlbrandt W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) of light-harvesting Chla/b-binding protein and its related proteins,e.g. 211PFDPLGL217 in CP29 of barley (26Sørensen A.B. Lauridsen B.F. Gausing K. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1538-1540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a three-dimensional structural model of pea light-harvesting Chl a/b-protein complex II (25Green B.R. Kühlbrandt W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), this motif is in a region located at the top of the third helix and covers Chla1 and one head group of lutein (25Green B.R. Kühlbrandt W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that this motif in WSCP might play a role in Chl binding. Although the sequence homology in the COOH-terminal half is relatively low, the COOH-terminal 11 amino acids, EKLGL(K/R)MFPFY are highly conserved. Interestingly, we found that 10 COOH-terminal residues in this hydrophobic region were missing in the mature form of WSCP. The molecular weight of native WSCP, as determined by mass spectrometry, was 20,226.4, which corresponds to the calculated molecular weight of residues 1–189 (with an error of 0.048%) of the predicted 199-amino acid sequence of mature WSCP. This conserved hydrophobic region may function in targeting to a particular compartment; however, this region may not affect the Chl-binding properties of WSCP, since the recombinant MBP-WSCP that possesses this region still binds Chls correctly (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, discussed below).Figure 5Comparisons of absorption and those of fourth derivative spectra of reconstituted MBP-WSCP and native WSCP purified from cauliflower leaves.

Although the intensities of the component with a peaked at 677 nm were slightly different between the two spectra, other components exhibited good agreement in both intensity and wavelength between the two spectra.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Comparisons of fluorescence spectra of MBP-WSCP and native WSCP by curve-fitting analysis.

Zero, 12.5, 125, 250, or 500 pmol of Chl a (lanes 1–5) or Chlb (lanes 6–10) were mixed in 20% ethanol with the 500 pmol of the MBP-WSCP. Then the mixtures were separated on 8% PAGE (detergent-free). Patterns of the proteins (panel A) and Chls (panel B) were visualized. MBP-WSCP itself possessed higher affinity to Chl a than that to Chlb, based on the finding that mixing of Chl a and MBP-WSCP at a 0.5:1 molar ratio exhibited no residual monomer, whereas a 1:1 molar ratio of Chl b to MBP-WSCP still retained the monomeric form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Hexamer formation of MBP-WSCP by mixing with purified Chl a or thylakoid membranes.

Fig. 3 shows the SDS-PAGE profiles of the MBP-WSCP fusion protein during the expression and purification steps. Addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to the bacterial culture medium induced a prominent polypeptide of 66 kDa (indicated by an arrow; compare lanes 1 and 2); this polypeptide represents a fusion of MBP (44 kDa) and WSCP (22 kDa). Following sonication, much of the MBP-WSCP was found in the soluble fraction of the cell extracts (compare lanes 3and 4). The 66-kDa MBP-WSCP bound to an amylose column was specifically eluted with 10 mm maltose (lane 5). Proteins expressed in pMAL-cRI can be cleaved with a proteinase, factor Xα. The expressed MBP-WSCP was cleaved by the proteinase and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The profile displayed a prominent 44-kDa band corresponding to MBP and several faint bands between 21 and 30 kDa (data not shown). Because we could not obtain a distinct band for WSCP following factor-Xα digestion, we used the fusion protein to analyze Chl binding. To examine the function of WSCP as a carrier of Chl, MBP-WSCP was mixed in various ratios with thylakoid membranes (Fig. 4). When thylakoid membranes were not added, a ladder of oligomeric MBP-WSCP formed (panel A, lane 1), with the major form being the monomer. When the MBP-WSCP was mixed with thylakoid membranes, the major form became the tetramer, and the hexamer form was also apparent (lanes 2–4 in panel A). Interestingly, only the tetramers and hexamers emitted fluorescence (panel B). These results indicate that the MBP-WSCP monomer removed Chls from thylakoid membranes to form tetrameric and hexameric structures. The dimeric form of apo-MBP-WSCP was also prominent (lane 1 in panel A), but its level was not substantially altered upon addition of thylakoid membranes. Further, the dimer and trimer, unlike the tetramer and hexamer, did not emit fluorescence. This raises the possibility that dimers and trimers may be formed artificially (discussed below). Densitometric analysis of the gel presented in panel A revealed that, prior to the addition of Chl (lane 1), the ratio of monomer:dimer was about 3:1. Forms other than monomers and dimers made up less than about 3% of the total. Hence, at least 75% of the MBP-WSCP in the preparation could bind Chl. This activity coefficient of 0.75 was used in subsequent analyses of the data. The stoichiometry of Chl in MBP-WSCP, which may be fully saturated with Chl, was examined. A thylakoid membranes and MBP-WSCP were mixed with a molar ratio of Chl:MBP-WSCP of 200:30. From the amount of protein and Chl, the stoichiometry was calculated to be 2 Chls per tetramer, as in the case of the native WSCP. To compare the Chl-binding properties of the MBP-WSCP with those of the native WSCP, absorption (Figs. 5 and 6) and fluorescence (Fig. 7) spectra were measured. The absorption spectra of MBP-WSCP and native WSCP exhibited a similar shape in both the red and Soret bands (Fig. 5 A). MBP-WSCP showed a shoulder at 485 nm, which was not as intense in the spectrum of the native WSCP. This shoulder may represent one of the protein-bound forms of Chl b, although this speculation remains to be verified. The Chl a/b ratio in native WSCP displays variations among the different WSCP preparations. Our previously determined absorption spectrum for cauliflower WSCP possessed more Chlb than the present spectrum (compare Fig. 5 A with Ref. 3Nishio N. Satoh H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Diversity in the Chl a/b ratio has also been reported in Lepidium WSCP (2Murata T. Toda F. Uchino K. Yakushiji E.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1982; 23: 557-560Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Peak wavelengths of absorption spectra of each MBP-WSCP and native WSCP in the red band were 672 and 673 nm, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The fourth derivative spectra (Fig. 5 B) and a curve-fitting analysis of the red band of native WSCP (Fig. 6) deconvoluted it into four major Chl a-components (Ca663, Ca671, Ca677, and Ca685) and a single component for Chl b (Cb653) (Fig. 6). This deconvolution profile was almost identical to that for the native WSCP purified from wild mustard (27Sugiyama K. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 503: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The intensity of each component in both MBP-WSCP and native WSCP exhibited good agreement between the two proteins with the exception of one component, Ca677 (Fig. 6). The intensity of Ca677 was greater in native WSCP than in MBP-WSCP. This difference caused a slight shift of the absorption peak between the two spectra (Fig. 5 B). However, in both proteins, peak wavelengths of all Chl components were identical (Fig. 6). Fluorescence emission spectra of both proteins excited at 440 nm (Fig. 7, panels A and B) and at 460 nm (Fig. 7,panels C and D) were measured. These fluorescence spectra were resolved into four major components assigned for Chla with peaks at 667, 672, 679, and 686 nm. Identical emission peaks were obtained for native WSCP and MBP-WSCP at both excitation wavelengths (Fig. 7, panels A and B, C and D). When Chl a was excited, the major fluorescence was emitted from Ca671 (F672) (panel A), whereas excitation of Chl b gave a more intense signal from Ca677 (F679) (panel C). Because very low level fluorescence was emitted from Chl b, excited Chl b molecules might efficiently transfer their energy to Chl a molecules in the complex, as reported in WSCP from L. virginicum (28Tabata K. Itoh S. Sugawa M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1983; 24: 987-994Google Scholar). It should also be noted that considerable fluorescence was emitted from all Chl a forms when Chl b was primarily excited, suggesting that energy transfer also occurred between Chl amolecules. These spectrofluorometric properties of the native WSCP were ex"

In this study, we use surface plasmon resonance to study the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of echovirus 11 with its cellular receptor decay-accelerating factor (CD55).

Echovirus 11 (EV11)1 is a member of the genus Enterovirus, familyPicornaviridae.

Fields' Virology.in: Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Lipincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996Google Scholar). The interaction of the virus with a specific cell surface receptor is a prerequisite for cell infection, and individual members of the Picornaviridae have evolved to use many different cell surface molecules for attachment and entry (3Bernhardt G.

DAF is a widely expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface glycoprotein that protects cells from damage by autologous complement-mediated lysis (reviewed in Ref. 9Nicholson Weller A. Wang C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar) by accelerating the decay of the C3/C5 convertases (hence DAF). DAF is also commonly used as a cell surface receptor by various pathogenic viruses and bacteria, thereby providing an initial site of host-pathogen interaction. Both the complement-regulatory and pathogen recognition functions are located within the membrane distal portion of the molecule which contains four contiguous, 60-amino acid-long short consensus repeats (SCR) (10Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson E.S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Anstee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar, 11Clarkson N.A. Kaufman R. Lublin D.M. Ward T.

The SCR domains are connected to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor by a Ser/Thr-rich stalk containing many O-linked oligosaccharides (13Medof M.E. Lublin D.M. Holers V.M. Ayers D.J. Getty R.R.

For example, SCR domains 2 to 4 (DAF234 3The DAF constructs are named so that the subscript denotes which SCR domains are present; e.g.DAF234 consists of domains 2, 3, and 4. ) are required for binding and infection by most DAF-utilizing picornaviruses (e.g. Coxsackie B3 (15Bergelson J.M.

Virol. 1997; 71: 4736-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used surface plasmon resonance to measure the affinity and kinetics of the binding of soluble DAF fragments, expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris (16Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to EV11. Our results indicate that DAF binds to EV11 with a low affinity and very fast kinetics and that most of the binding energy is contributed by the DAF SCR domain 3. The expression of soluble DAF in the yeast P. pastoris has been described in detail elsewhere (16Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, soluble recombinant DAF (hereafter termed DAF) and DAF domain deletion mutants were expressed with a carboxyl-terminal oligohistidine tag and purified to >95% purity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen, Dorking, United Kingdom). The proteins migrated at the expected size on reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis, indicating that they did not form disulfide-linked multimers (data not shown). The concentrations of the DAF constructs were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm using extinction coefficients (DAF1234= 36,840 m−1 cm−1; DAF234 = 29,870 m−1cm−1; DAF12 = 17,780m−1 cm−1; DAF23 = 17,780 m−1 cm−1; DAF34 = 19,060 m−1cm−1) computed from the amino acid composition (Trp, Tyr, and Cys) on the ExPASY server (18Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The recombinant DAF fragments were judged to be correctly folded by two criteria: they had NMR spectra typical of proteins with SCR domains; they were able to inhibit the binding of a range (∼30 in total) of different CD55 monoclonal antibodies to erythrocytes (19Daniels G.L. Green C.A. Powell R.M. Ward T. Transfusion. 1997; 38: 332-336Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EV11 was grown in confluent monolayers of HT29 human intestinal epithelial cells. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10, and infection was allowed to proceed for ∼16 h. Cells remaining attached to the flasks were removed by scraping, and the medium was frozen and thawed three times. Debris was removed by low speed centrifugation, and the virus was pelleted through a 30% sucrose layer. The pelleted material was then subjected to two rounds of rate zonal centrifugation on 15–45% sucrose gradients. All sucrose solutions contained 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Virus was pelleted from gradient fractions following dilution in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and finally resuspended in the same buffer. Purified virus was concentrated to 8 mg/ml using Centricon 10-kDa cutoff microconcentrators (Millipore, Watford, UK) Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore2000 (BIAcore AB, Stevenage, UK). EV11 was covalently immobilized to the carboxylated dextran matrix on the surface of CM5 sensor chips via primary amino groups using the amine-coupling kit (BIAcore AB) as directed (20Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After the activation step, purified virus was injected at 80 μg/ml in 10 mmsodium formate (pH 3.0) for 5 min. In separate experiments, we showed that incubation at low pH does not affect virus infectivity (data not shown), indicating that such treatment does not disrupt virion structure. This is not unexpected since the virus replicates in the intestine, having passed through the very low pH environment of the stomach. Different levels (1,300–16,200 response units or RU) of virus were immobilized by varying the length of the activation step from 30 s to 5 min. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed at a flow rate of 40 μl/min at 25 °C using as running buffer commercially obtained (BIAcore AB) HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20). Binding of recombinant DAF to EV11 was measured by injecting the proteins, such as DAF234, through a BIAcore flow cell with EV11 covalently coupled to the sensor surface as well as through a mock-coupled control flow cell in which the sensor surface had been subjected to the coupling reaction in the absence of EV11 (see,e.g., Fig. 1 A). The traces, or sensorgrams, reveal that a background response is observed when DAF234 is injected (Fig. 1 A, bar) over the control (mock-coupled) surface. This background response is seen because the BIAcore measures the refractive index near the sensor surface and therefore detects any changes in bulk refractive index of the injected sample. It does not represent nonspecific binding. A much larger response is observed when DAF234 is injected over the EV11-coupled flow cell. Subtraction of the sensorgram obtained in the control flow cell from the latter sensorgram gives the actual binding response (Fig. 1 A, inset). Inspection of these corrected sensorgrams reveals that the kinetics of DAF234 binding is rapid; binding reached equilibrium within 10 s of the start of the injection, and dissociation was complete within 20 s of the end of the injection. When DAF12 was injected, an identical sensorgram was observed in both the EV11 and control flow cells, indicating that this construct does not bind EV11 (data not shown). These results establish that soluble recombinant DAF can bind directly and specifically to EV11 covalently coupled to the BIAcore sensor surface. The ratio of the maximal level of bound DAF234 to the level of covalently immobilized EV11 (both measured in RUs) varied from 0.05 to 0.08. This can be calculated to be 30–50% of the theoretical maximum if it is assumed that there are 60 binding sites per virion and that the virus and DAF234 have molecular masses of 8 × 103 and 21 kDa, respectively. A somewhat lower binding stoichiometry (14–18%) was observed by Casasnovas and Springer (1Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) for sICAM-1 binding to human rhinovirus 3 (HRV3) immobilized on the BIAcore surface. Submaximal binding is likely to be a consequence of occlusion or disruption of binding sites when the viral particles are covalently coupled to the sensor surface. Similar sensorgrams were obtained when DAF1234, DAF23, and DAF34 were injected over EV11 (data not shown). The equilibrium binding responses were measured during injection of at least five concentrations of the construct varying by at least one order of magnitude, and the data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB). Nonlinear curve fitting of a simple Langmuir model of the association (A + B→ AB) to these data (Fig. 1, B and C) yielded values for the dissociation constant,K D (∼3 μm for the longer constructs). The K D was also determined from Scatchard plots of the data (Fig. 1 C, inset). Identical results were obtained irrespective of the order of injections (low to high concentrations or vice versa), indicating that the coupled EV11 was stable for the duration of the experiment (data not shown). Table I summarizes the mean and range of between 5 and 10 K D determinations for each construct that bound EV11. Using the relationship −ΔG = RT ln K D we calculated the corresponding binding energy for each construct and used these values to estimate the contributions of each domain to the total binding energy. DAF234 and DAF1234 had the same binding energy, indicating little or no contribution from domain 1 (Table I). DAF23 interacted with a ∼0.7 kcal·m−1 lower binding energy than DAF234, indicating that domain 4 contributes at most ∼0.7 kcal·m−1. By similar comparison of DAF34 with DAF234, it is evident that domain 2 contributes at most ∼1.1 kcal·m−1. Thus, domain 1, 2, and 4 together contribute at most ∼1.8 kcal·m−1 (or ∼20%) of the total binding energy, whereas SCR domain 3 contributes the remaining ∼80%.Table IAffinity parameters for DAF fragments binding to EV11ConstructK DΔG°μmkcal·m−1DAF12343.4 ± 0.41-aMean ± SD of 5 to 10 independent experiments.−7.5DAF2343.0 ± 0.04−7.6DAF239.3 ± 0.8−6.9DAF3419.2 ± 0.4−6.5Affinity constants were obtained by equilibrium binding analysis, as described in Fig. 1.1-a Mean ± SD of 5 to 10 independent experiments.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this study), this construct was used for a more detailed analysis. Measurement of the affinity at different temperatures revealed that there was a decrease in the affinity as the temperature increased from 15 to 40 °C (Table II). This indicates that the interaction is exothermic at physiological temperatures. A (van't Hoff) plot of ln(1/K D)versus 1/T was not linear (data not shown), indicating that the enthalpy varies with temperature.Table IIAffinity constants for DAF234 binding to EV11 at difference temperaturesTemperatureK D°Cμm152.5 ± 0.22-aMean ± SD.203.0 ± 0.2253.8 ± 0.3(4.1 ± 0.5)2-bNumbers in parentheses, K D determined at 25 °C after cooling from 40 °C.304.7 ± 0.5356.2 ± 1.04010.2 ± 1.5Values shown are the mean and range of two independent experiments.2-a Mean ± SD.2-b Numbers in parentheses, K D determined at 25 °C after cooling from 40 °C.

Binding on the BIAcore is frequently affected by mass transport limitations which can lead to an underestimate of the kinetic constants (e.g. see Schuck (21Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1230-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)). We sought to avoid this by performing the experiments at high flow rates (40 μl/min) with low levels of coupled EV11. Several different DAF concentrations were injected (Fig. 1 B). The association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants were obtained by simultaneously fitting numerically integrated rate equations derived from the simple Langmuir binding model (A +B→AB) to all the sensorgrams (global analysis). Excellent fits were obtained (χ2 values were 0.87 ± 0.41; see, for example Fig. 1 B), providing thek on and k off values shown in Table III (once again, these values are the average after five repeated experiments with the errors reflecting the variation between individual experiments). The samek on and k off values were obtained at different flow rates (data not shown) and with two different levels of virus immobilized to the sensor surface, demonstrating that binding under these condition is not limited by mass transport.

The affinity constants reported here for DAF binding to EV11 are much lower than affinities measured for biological interactions involving soluble macromolecules such as hormones, cytokines, and antibodies but are typical of interactions between cell-cell recognition molecules (22Van Der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This is appropriate since the interaction between echovirus virions and cell surface DAF is likely to be highly multivalent; the virus surface presents 60 identical sites due to the symmetry of the capsid. There is one other reported study of the affinity and kinetics of an intact virus with its receptor (1Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although Casasnovas and Springer reported a similar affinity for sICAM-1 binding to HRV3, a virus belonging to the same family as EV11, the kinetics were much slower (see below). A higher affinity (K D 40–400 nm) has been reported for the binding of the human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein gp120 to its cell surface receptor CD4 (23Fischer P.B. Collin M. Karlsson G.B. James W. Butters T.D. Davis S.J. Gordon S. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5791-5797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of DAF1234 and DAF234 for EV11 are essentially the same, whereas DAF23 and DAF34 bind with affinities between 3- and 6-fold lower (Table I). Comparison of the calculated binding energies of all these constructs indicates that SCR domain 3 contributes ∼80% of the binding energy (Table I). In this context, it is noteworthy that two of the antibodies that most effectively inhibit in vitro infection by the closely related echovirus 7 (1H4 and 3D11) have been shown to bind domain 3 (7Bergelson J.M.

Furthermore,Escherichia coli Dr and related adhesins have also been shown to bind DAF SCR domain 3 (12Nowicki B. Hart A. Coyne K.E. Lublin D.M. Nowicki S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The k on for the interaction between EV11 and DAF234 falls within the usual range for macromolecular interactions (22Van Der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), while the k off is unusually fast, a feature characteristic of interactions between cell-cell recognition molecules (22Van Der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These results differ from the findings of Casasnovas and Springer (1Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), who reported kinetic constants for the sICAM-1/HRV3 interaction that were two to three orders of magnitude slower (k on 130–2450m−1.s−1 and k off 0.0013 s−1). Casasnovas and Springer (1Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) proposed that the unusually slowk off rate was either due to the relatively inaccessible nature of the sICAM-1 binding site on HRV3 (the tip of sICAM-1 binding in a depression on the surface of the virus capsid (24Olson N.H. Kolatkar P.R. Oliveira M.A. Cheng R.H. Greve J.M. McClelland A. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar)) or because of a requirement for conformational change in the HRV3 binding site before sICAM-1 binding can occur. In contrast, we show that a domain in the “middle” of DAF is crucial for binding to EV11, making it unlikely that DAF binds in a similar way,i.e. to a deep depression on the surface of EV11. The binding of EV11 to DAF can also be fully described using a simple 1:1 binding model, consistent with the “docking” of two preformed sites. In contrast, the sICAM-1/HRV3 interaction exhibited biphasic binding kinetics, suggesting a more complex binding scheme. Finally, analysis of the temperature dependence of the sICAM-1/HRV3 interaction indicated it was endothermic, which is somewhat unusual for a protein-protein interaction, whereas our analysis of the EV11/DAF interaction indicates that it is exothermic. In conclusion, we have shown that DAF binds to EV11 with a low affinity and very fast kinetics. These binding characteristics are typical of the molecular interactions mediating cell-cell recognition but differ substantially from the sICAM-1/HRV3 interaction, the only other whole virus cellular-receptor interaction studied to date (1Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We also show that the bulk of the binding energy is contributed by the third SCR domain. We thank for Christine Harley for assistance in virus preparation."

Biochem. 1994; 224: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (see Structure I). It is produced at millimolar intracellular levels but only by actinomycetes, including pathogenic mycobacteria, none of which produce glutathione (5Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. delCardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because mycothiol is more resistant to autoxidation than is glutathione, both of which are more resistant than cysteine, it may serve as a stable intracellular reserve of cysteine and also have protective functions against oxygen and other electrophilic agents analogous to those ascribed to glutathione in GSH-producing organisms (3Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Newton G.L. Arnold K.

If so, then compounds that block the functions of MSH might be developed as effective drugs for use against pathogenic actinomycetes (5Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. delCardayre S.B.

J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Elaboration of the biosynthetic and metabolic pathways for MSH is an important goal in this pursuit. Relatively little is presently known about the biochemistry of MSH. It has recently been shown to be the cofactor for an NAD-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase found in actinomycetes, where it functions in a fashion analogous to that of GSH in the NAD/GSH-dependent enzyme (7Misset-Smits M. van Ophem P.W. Sakuda S. Duine J.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In another recent publication, Bornemann et al. (6Bornemann C. Jardine M.A. Spies H.S.C. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) presented evidence derived from studies with partially purified extracts of Mycobacterium smegmatis, indicating that the final steps in the biosynthesis of MSH involve ATP-activated coupling of Cys to GlcN-Ins followed by acetylation of Cys-GlcN-Ins with acetyl-CoA to produce MSH. If MSH serves as an intracellular reserve of cysteine, then a pathway for regeneration of cysteine from MSH must exist and might, in principle, involve initial cleavage of any of the three links in MSH to produce acetate plus Cys-GlcN-Ins, AcCys plus GlcN-Ins, or AcCys-GlcN plus inositol. The objective of the present study was to measure the cellular levels of potential intermediates in the biosynthesis and degradation of MSH. Methods for determination of GlcN-Ins, AcCys, Cys-GlcN, AcCys-GlcN, and Cys-GlcN-Ins are described and used to analyze cellular levels of these mycothiol components in M. smegmatis and other bacteria. Results with M. smegmatis under a variety of conditions provide insight into the pathways of MSH biosynthesis and degradation. M. smegmatisstrains MC26 and MC2155 and Staphylococcus aureus RN450 were kindly provided by Julian Davies, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia. Micromonospora echinospora 14847 was purchased from Northern Regional Research Center (NRRL B-12180), and Escherichia coli HB101 was purchased from Promega. M. smegmatis cultures were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (0.05% Tween 80 and 0.4% glucose) at 37 °C. S. aureus and E. coli cultures were grown in Trypticase soy broth at 37 °C.M. echinospora cultures were grown in Todd Hewitt broth (0.5% yeast extract and 0.25% sucrose) at 28 °C. All cultures were shaken at 220 rpm. AccQ-Fluor was purchased from Waters. ATP, AcCys, GlcN·HCl, HEPES, inositol, NEM, sucrose, Tris, and yeast extract were obtained from Sigma. Cys and DTT were from Calbiochem,14C-inositol was from NEN Life Science Products, glucose and Tween 80 were from Fisher, and acetonitrile was from Mallinckrodt. Atto-Tag CBQCA, dansyl-chloride, fluorescamine, mBBr, and 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)) chloride were purchased from Molecular Probes. Methanesulfonic acid was supplied by Fluka. Cys-GlcN and AcCys-GlcN were prepared as described previously (8Unson M.D. Newton G.L. Davis C. Fahey R.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 214: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Middlebrook 7H9, yeast extract, and Todd Hewitt broth were purchased from Difco Laboratories, and Trypticase soy broth was purchased from BBL. All other reagents were reagent grade or higher quality. GlcN-Ins was purified from M. echinospora(NRRL B-12180) by a modification of the method of Maehr et al. (9Maehr H. Liu C. Hermann T. Prosser B.L.T. Smallheer J.M. Palleroni N.J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1980; 33: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). M. echinospora was cultured on 0.5% yeast extract, 3% Todd Hewitt media, and 0.25% sucrose to late log phase and collected by centrifugation. Bulk cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C until the material was processed. A 235-g pellet of M. echinospora was suspended in 1 liter of 50% acetonitrile-water (60 °C) containing 20 mm H2SO4(pH 5 cell suspension). The suspension was adjusted to pH 2.5 with concentrated H2SO4 and then disrupted using a Bransonic sonicator at ∼70% maximum power for 15 min without cooling. The cell extract was cooled on ice, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was reduced to 250 ml using a rotary evaporator and clarified by centrifugation as above. The supernatant contained 240 μmol of thiol by assay with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (10Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Next, MSH was recovered from the extract. DTT (250 μmol) was added, and the extract was adjusted to pH 7.9 with concentrated NH4OH. After clarification by centrifugation, the supernatant was passed over a 2-thiopyridine-activated thiolpropyl-agarose column (3Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the column was eluted with DTT, and the mycothiol was purified by preparative HPLC after derivatization with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The unbound extract (310 ml) from the thiol affinity column (pH 7.6) was applied directly to a 2.5 × 18-cm Amberlite IRC50 (Mallinckrodt) column that had been prewashed with 3 mNH4OH followed by H2O. The effluent pH was 10.3 when the sample was applied. The column was washed with water and eluted with 350 ml of 1 n NH4OH followed by 550 ml of 3 m NH4OH. The fractions from both effluents were found to contain GlcN-Ins as assayed by TLC with ninhydrin detection as previously reported (9Maehr H. Liu C. Hermann T. Prosser B.L.T. Smallheer J.M. Palleroni N.J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1980; 33: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fractions containing GlcN-Ins were combined and lyophilized. The residue was redissolved in water (pH ∼ 9) and applied to a 1 × 12-cm AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad, 200–400 mesh) anion exchange column in the hydroxyl form. The column was eluted in water, and the GlcN-Ins-containing fractions were again pooled. The fractions containing GlcN-Ins (Rf 0.33) were also contaminated by higher Rf ninhydrin-positive materials. The GlcN-Ins-containing fractions were again combined, dried by lyophilization, and dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, water. This sample was applied to a 20-ml Sep Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) equilibrated in the same solvent. The GlcN-Ins was eluted with 0–5% methanol gradient in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The GlcN-Ins-containing fractions gave a single ninhydrin spot on TLC, free of the high Rf contaminant. However, amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis (3Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) revealed that GlcN was a minor component and that another amine eluting after arginine was a major component. To remove this contaminant, the dried GlcN-Ins-containing fractions were applied to a 1 × 12-cm Biorex 70 (sodium form, 100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad) column. The GlcN-Ins was eluted in water, and the GlcN-Ins-containing fractions were pooled. Amino acid analysis showed that the basic contaminant had been completely removed. The product gave a small peak at mass 341 (molecular ion) and a major peak at mass 364 (molecular ion plus sodium) on electrospray mass spectroscopy. The 1H NMR was consistent with the expected structure, and all peaks could be assigned by analogy with the spectrum for MSH (Table I). A stock solution of this material, which contained 0.5 mg of GlcN-Ins by NMR analysis relative to a known concentration of acetone as internal standard, was used for all experiments with GlcN-Ins.Table I1H (500 MHz, δ (×J in Hz)) NMR data for GlcN-Ins and MSmB in D2O with acetone as the internal reference (δ 2.225)AssignmentGlcN-InsMSmB1-aData are from Ref. 3.d-Glucosamine 15.13 (d), 3.15.12 (d, 3.5) 22.76 (dd, 10.4, 3.8)3.96 (dd, 10, 3.5) 3∼3.76 (m)3.78 (t, 10) 43.38 (t, 10)3.48 (t, 10) 5∼3.84 (m)3.86 (m) 6∼3.76 (m)3.79 (m)3.84 (m)3.88 (m)myo-Inositol 1′3.58 (dm, 10)3.58 (dd, 10, 2) 2′4.20 (t, 2)4.19 (t, 2) 3′3.53 (dm, 10)3.52 (dd, 10, 2) 4′3.62 (t, 10)3.62 (t, 10) 5′3.30 (t, 10)3.28 (t, 10) 6′3.63 (t, 10)3.76 (t, 10)1-a Data are from Ref. 3Newton G.L.

Open table in a new tab AccQ-Fluor was dissolved in acetonitrile to 10 mm as recommended by the manufacturer. Standard solutions of d-glucosamine·HCl and purified GlcN-Ins were prepared at 3.1 to 200 μm in water. For the derivatization of GlcN and GlcN-Ins, 6 μl of the standard amine was diluted to 30 μl in 200 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 15 μl of acetonitrile; 15 μl of 10 mm AccQ-Fluor were added, and the mixture vortexed. After 1 min at room temperature, samples were heated for 10 min at 60 °C. The samples were diluted 4-fold with water and stored at −70 °C. To determine GlcN and GlcN-Ins levels in cells, a sample of cell suspension was chilled on ice and pelleted at 4 °C using a SS34 or GSA rotor in a Sorvall RC-5 centrifuge. The cell pellet was lysed by the addition of 450 μl of warm acetonitrile and heating at 60 °C for 2 min. Next, 490 μl of water, 10 μl of 1 m HEPES (pH 8), and 50 μl of 100 mm NEM in acetonitrile were added, the mixture was heated at 60 °C for 10 min, and the container was immediately chilled in ice. The sample was pelleted by brief centrifugation in a microfuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed to an Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube on ice. A 15-μl aliquot was immediately taken from the supernatant for derivatization with AccQ-Fluor by the addition of 12.5 μl of 1 m HEPES (pH 8.0), 42.5 μl of water, 23.8 μl of acetonitrile, and 31.2 μl of 10 mmAccQ-Fluor, and the mixture was vortexed immediately. A second 30-μl aliquot of cell extract was taken at the same time and prepared in the same fashion except that the volumes of water and acetonitrile added were 35 and 16.8 μl, respectively. After 1 min at room temperature, the samples were heated for 10 min at 60 °C, diluted 4-fold with water, and stored at −70 °C. The cell pellet was dried in a tared tube to determine the residual dry weight (RDW) of the extract. The AccQ-Fluor-derivatized samples were analyzed by HPLC utilizing a Waters 600E solvent delivery system equipped with a Waters WISP Model 710B autoinjector, Laboratory Data Control Fluorometer III, and a Nelson Model 444 data collection system. Separation was obtained on a Beckman Ultrasphere IP (250 × 4.6 mm) analytical column equipped with a Brownley HPLC guard column containing an OD-GU 5-μm C-18 cartridge using the following linear gradients: 0 min, 100% A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water); 10 min, 100% A; 50 min, 60% B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol); 53 min, 100% B; 57 min, 100% B; 60 min, 100% A; 70 min, reinjection. The flow rate was 1 ml min−1, and the effluent was monitored by fluorescence with a 254-nm excitation filter and a 370–700-nm emission filter. This protocol is designated HPLC method 5. AccQ-Fluor-derivatized amines had the following retention times: GlcN, 12 min; GlcN-Ins, 24 min. The bimane derivative of mycothiol (MSmB) was prepared in pure form as described previously (3Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 mg of MSmB was hydrolyzed in 2 ml of 6n HCl for 2 h at 60 °C, and the hydrolysate was purified by HPLC on a preparative C-18 Vydac column (22 × 250 mm). The sample was eluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (mobile phase A) with a 1%/min linear gradient from 0 to 40% B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol) at a flow rate of 5 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored by fluorescence detection with excitation at 370 nm and emission at 418–700 nm. CySmB-GlcN-Ins was collected at 32 min and repurified twice to minimize CySmB-GlcN contamination. The identity of this peak was confirmed with electrospray mass spectrometry, which yielded a major peak at 657 daltons (molecular ion + sodium). The final yield of 0.63 mg of mB-Cys-GlcN-Ins was estimated assuming ε = 5300 at 390 nm, the value reported for the mBBr derivative of glutathione (11Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Newton G.L. Ranney H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Labeling of cell extracts with mBBr was carried out as described previously (5Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. delCardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of Cys, MSH, AcCys-GlcN, ACys, and H2S was performed using method 1A, a modification of the previously described method 1 (12Fahey R.C. Newton G.L.

For separation of Cys-GlcN-Ins and Cys-GlcN, the HPLC conditions were identical to those of method 5 above with the following modifications: solvent B was 7.5% methanol in acetonitrile, and fluorescence detection was accomplished with a 370-nm excitation filter and a 418–700 emission filter (designated method 5A). A minor modification of the protocol described by Bornemann et al. (6Bornemann C. Jardine M.A. Spies H.S.C. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used. M. smegmatisMC2155 was grown to mid-log phase in Middlebrook 7H9 medium with 0.4% glucose and 0.05% Tween. Cells were pelleted and washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 0.25 g of wet weight/ml. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice and pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge. Assay of the supernatant was conducted in a final volume of 600 μl containing 60 μl of supernatant, 50 μm GlcN-Ins, 100 μm Cys or AcCys, 100 μm sodium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 35 μm each of the protease inhibitors phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride,N-α-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone, and N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysinechloromethyl ketone. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C, and 100 μl samples were removed at 0 and 60 min for thiol analysis. One sample was mixed with 4 μl of 100 mm mBBr and allowed to react for 5 min at room temperature before acidification with 0.5 μl of 5m methanesulfonic acid to quench the reaction. A second control sample was reacted 5 min with 5 mm NEM before treatment with mBBr as above. Several standard methods of fluorescent amine labeling in conjunction with HPLC were tested initially with GlcN as potential ways to determine GlcN and GlcN-Ins. Reaction with dansyl chloride, fluorescamine, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)) chloride, and CBQCA (Molecular Probes) provided markedly poorer sensitivity than labeling with AccQ-Fluor, a reagent recently developed for analysis of amino acids (13Cohen S.A. Michaud D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). For labeling of amino sugars, a buffer of slightly lower pH than employed with amino acids was chosen so that the amino sugars, whose ammonium forms have lower pK a values than those of most amino acids, would have a competitive advantage during labeling of cell extracts. Fig. 1 (top panel ) shows the chromatogram obtained with a standard GlcN sample, and Fig. 2 presents a representative calibration curve.Figure 2Calibration curves for analysis of GlcN (•) and GlcN-Ins(♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the method with GlcN-Ins, it was necessary to obtain an authentic sample. GlcN-Ins was originally isolated from M. echinospora by Maehr et al. (9Maehr H. Liu C. Hermann T. Prosser B.L.T. Smallheer J.M. Palleroni N.J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1980; 33: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and an initial description of its synthesis was recently reported by Bornemannet al. (6Bornemann C. Jardine M.A. Spies H.S.C. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Isolation appeared to be the simpler route and had the advantage of permitting simultaneous isolation of MSH in significant amounts with a minor modification of the protocol. However, at the end of the published isolation protocol our GlcN-Ins sample, although apparently pure by TLC, proved to be substantially contaminated by another amine. Pure GlcN-Ins was obtained by adding an additional purification step; the overall yield was poor but adequate for the present purposes. The chromatogram obtained from a standard solution of GlcN-Ins after labeling with AccQ-Fluor is shown in Fig. 1 (middle panel), and a representative standard curve is included in Fig. 2. Fig. 1 also presents the chromatogram obtained from the labeling of a sample of a 50% acetonitrile extract of the M. echinospora used for the purification of GlcN-Ins. The peak for GlcN-Ins corresponds to a content of ∼0.8 μmol/g of RDW. From this value it can be calculated that the recovery in our purification of GlcN-Ins was only 8%. No doubt this can be improved with suitable modifications of the purification protocol and the use of AccQ-Fluor labeling with HPLC analysis to more closely monitor the purification process. Cellular thiol levels were analyzed by HPLC after fluorescent labeling of the thiol moiety with mBBr (14Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 148-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Quantitative values for the cellular thiol levels were obtained after correction for any nonthiol fluorescent background identified in control samples in which thiols were blocked by reaction with NEM before treatment with mBBr. Standards were prepared by labeling of the commercial (Cys, AcCys) or synthetic (Cys-GlcN, AcCys-GlcN) thiols or of isolated MSH (3Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A standard for labeled Cys-GlcN-Ins was obtained by partial hydrolysis of MSmB, purification of CySmB-GlcN-Ins by preparative HPLC, and quantitation of the standard based upon the absorbance of the bimane label. All of these bimane derivatives could not be separated from each other, from reagent-derived components, and from fluorescent cellular materials using a single HPLC protocol, and many different HPLC separations were tested before two methods were found that provided analyses for the thiols of interest without major coeluting peaks in the NEM control sample. Fig. 3 illustrates the analysis used to obtain values for Cys-GlcN-Ins and Cys-GlcN. In cell extracts, no peaks were observed for Cys-GlcN, and reported values represent the limits of detection (Fig. 3 B). Peaks for Cys-GlcN-Ins were observed with cell extracts as illustrated in Fig. 3 B. An unidentified thiol peak of comparable size to the Cys-GlcN-Ins peak and eluting at 26.7 min is also apparent in Fig. 3 B. Fig. 4 illustrates the analysis for Cys, AcCys, AcCys-GlcN, MSH, and H2S; the Cys-GlcN-Ins and Cys-GlcN derivatives were only slightly retained and could not be separated under these conditions. The peaks for Cys and MSH have small coeluting peaks present in the NEM control (Fig. 4, lower panel), which amounted to 10 and 2%, respectively, of the Cys and MSH peaks measured in the sample (Fig. 4, middle panel). In calculating the Cys and MSH content, small corrections for these control values were incorporated. Note that the α and β epimers of bimane derivatives of Cys-GlcN and AcCys-GlcN interconvert to give an equilibrium mixture producing two partially resolved peaks with similar retention times (Figs. 3 A and 4).Figure 4HPLC chromatograms (method 1A) for analysis of thiols.

Analysis of extracts from M. smegmatis MC2155 revealed the presence of a measurable GlcN-Ins content. To check whether the values are sensitive to the sample size analyzed, possibly as the result of depletion of the labeling agent by the plethora of amines present in cells, we analyzed 30 μl of supernatant from extracts (1 ml volume) of M. smegmatis MC2155 with increasing sample size from 3.9 to 61 mg RDW of cell pellet residue. For samples sizes up to 30 mg of RDW, there is an apparent slight decrease in measured GlcN-Ins content with increasing sample size (0.13%/mg RDW), but the change is within the uncertainties in the measurements. However, above 30 mg RDW, a marked decrease in measured value was apparent. To prevent underestimates of GlcN-Ins content, all quantitative determinations were made with samples corresponding to ≤30 mg RDW.Table IIMycothiol component levels in selected bacteriaOrganismContent (μmol/g residual dry weight)2-aNumbers designated with < represent detection limits where no discernable peak was present.

Open table in a new tab M. smegmatis MC26, the parent strain of M. smegmatis MC2155, also produced GlcN-Ins in significant amount. Cys was also found, but neither strain appeared to produce comparable amounts of other potential intermediates of MSH metabolism, including AcCys, AcCys-GlcN, Cys-GlcN, or Cys-GlcN-Ins. It had been previously shown that S. aureus and E. coli did not produce MSH (5Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. delCardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were reexamined using the present methods to ascertain whether they might produce one or more of the intermediates involved in mycothiol biosynthesis and especially GlcN-Ins. The results (Table II) indicate that neither of these bacteria produce any component of MSH at measureable levels, other than Cys and GlcN. Levels of potential MSH intermediates were determined for M. smegmatisMC2155 as a function of growth phase (Fig. 5). The MSH level remained remarkably constant through exponential growth and into stationary phase, as did the Cys level at about 1% the MSH level. However, in stationary phase, there did appear to be a significant drop in the GlcN and GlcN-Ins levels and an increase in the H2S level. To test whether an increase in cellular Ins content would influence the levels of MSH or potential MSH intermediates, we examined M. smegmatis MC2155 incubated with Ins. We initially tested Ins uptake by adding 37 μm [14C]Ins to a culture atA 600 = 1.0 and determining the loss of radiolabel from the medium and its appearance in cells. After 2.5 h, 77% of the counts had been lost from the medium to the cells, showing that M. smegmatis efficiently imports Ins. Next we harvested cells after growth to mid-log phase, resuspended them atA 600 = 1.05 in 7H9 media with glucose and 1 mm Ins at 37 °C, and took samples for analysis at 0, 0.5, and 2.5 h (Fig. 6 A). The GlcN-Ins content was initially more than 3-fold greater than normal but fell to about half normal at 0.5 h before returning to normal at 2.5 h. Smaller reciprocal changes occurred in the Cys levels, whereas the MSH and H2S levels did not change to a significant extent. The A 600 value increased 40% over the 2.5 h incubation, a change comparable with that found for exponential cultures without added Ins. To test whether changes in cellular Cys levels would influence MSH or MSH intermediates, we incubated cells in medium containing 10 mm AcCys. Because AcCys is readily taken up by passive diffusion, we expected this to produce markedly elevated levels of cellular AcCys and, through deacylation, Cys. The results (Fig. 6 B) showed this to be the case; the cellular AcCys level was elevated 1000-fold over the normal level, and the Cys level was increased 50-fold. This was accompanied by a 5- to 10-fold decrease in GlcN-Ins content, whereas the H2S level roughly doubled. The Cys-GlcN-Ins content was elevated 20-fold over normal immediately after the start of incubation but then fell a factor of 70 over the next 2.5 h. Least affected was the MSH content, which was elevated ∼40% after 2.5 h. The A 600 value changed little (5%) over the 2.5-h incubation period, indicating that AcCys significantly inhibits growth under these conditions. Incubation of cells in the absence of glucose (Fig. 6 C) resulted in a decrease in GlcN-Ins level to values 13–30% of normal during the initial 2.5-h incubation, but continuation of the incubation resulted in a return to normal values by the end of 8 h (data not shown). The MSH level increased to 40% over normal by 2.5 h and remained at that value to 8 h. The value of A 600 declined slightly (10%) during the 2.5-h incubation period, showing that glucose deprivation arrested cell growth. Bornemann et al.(6) demonstrated the presence of enzyme activity in extracts of M. smegmatis capable of converting Cys plus GlcN-Ins to Cys-GlcN-Ins in the presence of ATP and the accompanying production of MSH, which was enhanced by acetate or acetyl-CoA. They were unable to assess AcCys as substrate in this reaction, because it was rapidly converted to Cys. We conducted analogous assays with an undialyzed supernatant fraction from extraction of M. smegmatis. Incubation of 100 μm Cys and 50 μm GlcN-Ins with 1 mm ATP in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT after the addition of cell extract supernatant resulted in an increase in Cys-GlcN-Ins from <0.2 to 26 μm over 60 min, whereas the MSH content declined from 15 to 13 μm, corresponding to the MSH content present in the undialyzed cell extract. A parallel experiment with 100 μm AcCys in place of Cys resulted in an increase from <0.2 to 20 μm Cys-GlcN-Ins and no change in MSH content (15 μm); however, marked conversion of AcCys to Cys had occurred by 60 min ([Cys]/[AcCys] ∼ 3). If the MSH had increased by as much as 2 μm (10% of the change in Cys-GlcN-Ins), the change would have been detected, and this experiment therefore established that conversion of Cys to Cys-GlcN-Ins is at least an order of magnitude faster than conversion of AcCys to MSH under these conditions. The analytical methods developed in the present studies to analyze mycothiol components should prove useful in elaborating various aspects of mycothiol metabolism. In its simplest form, the biosynthesis and degradation of MSH could, in principle, involve the steps illustrated in Scheme FSI. In the present work we have determined the levels of all of the potential intermediates of Scheme FSI in M. smegmatis under a variety of experimental conditions, and the results allow certain conclusions to be drawn concerning the cellular route for biosynthesis and degradation of MSH. We note first that whereas AcCys and GlcN-Ins were found at measureable levels, Cys-GlcN was never detected in cell extracts, even when cellular Cys was present at high levels in cells incubated in AcCys. This indicates that step 3 of Scheme FSI is not involved in the biosynthesis of MSH and that steps 7, 8, and 11 are therefore also not involved. Because AcCys-GlcN was not detected in cells during normal growth, AcCys-GlcN also appeared not to be involved in the biosynthesis path leading to MSH, but this conclusion is less certain because of the limits of the analytical method to measure low levels of AcCys-GlcN. However, the failure to observe AcCys-GlcN during incubation of cells in AcCys, where levels of AcCys are markedly elevated, argues against step 4, and therefore step 9, as components of the pathway leading to MSH. This leaves steps 5 and 6 as the remaining possible second steps in MSH biosynthesis. If step 6 is involved in MSH production, then elevation of the cellular Cys level by incubation of cells in AcCys should produce an elevation in the level of Cys-GlcN-Ins, and this is observed (Fig. 6 B). This is consistent with biosynthesis of MSH occurring via steps 2, 6, and 10 but does not exclude step 5 as a concurrent pathway. The finding that cell extracts incubated with GlcN-Ins and Cys produce Cys-GlcN-Ins at a rate more than 10-fold faster than the rate that extracts incubated with GlcN-Ins and AcCys produce MSH demonstrates that the route via steps 6 and 10 is the favored path leading to MSH. The present conclusions on the biosynthetic pathway from measurements of cellular metabolite levels are in accord with those of Bornemannet al. (6Bornemann C. Jardine M.A. Spies H.S.C. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) based on in vitro measurements with cell extracts incubated with synthetic GlcN-Ins. Although their extracts converted AcCys to Cys at a rate too great for them to distinguish which of these substrates was favored for reaction with GlcN-Ins, we did not experience that difficulty, and our results clearly indicated that Cys was the preferred substrate. An estimate of the cellular concentrations of GlcN-Ins and Cys-GlcN-Ins is useful for comparison to the K m values for the enzymes using these substrates. Assuming a ratio of cell water to cell RDW of 3, the cellular concentrations of GlcN-Ins and Cys-GlcN-Ins during exponential growth (Table II) are calculated as 33 ± 14 and 2.6 ± 1.6 μm, respectively. The value for GlcN-Ins is about one-fourth the value of K mestimated for GlcN-Ins in its conversion to Cys-GlcN-Ins with saturating Cys and ATP, using a partially purified extract fromM. smegmatis (6Bornemann C. Jardine M.A. Spies H.S.C. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggests that changes in the cellular GlcN-Ins level will produce a corresponding change in the rate of conversion of GlcN-Ins to Cys-GlcN-Ins. The observed high ratio of GlcN-Ins to Cys-GlcN-Ins indicates that the effective first order rate constant of conversion of the latter to MSH is more than an order faster than the corresponding rate of formation from GlcN-Ins during exponential growth. One postulated function of MSH is to serve as a slowly autoxidizing cellular reserve of Cys (3Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). If this is correct then there must be a pathway by which Cys is regenerated from MSH, and this would be expected to be different from the reverse of the biosynthesis route. We know that M. smegmatis is capable of converting intracellular AcCys to Cys (Fig. 6 B), and we can estimate from the data in Table II that the AcCys level in exponential cells is ∼4 μm. The source of the AcCys is unclear but may involve step 5 of Scheme FSI as a degradative pathway of MSH. The glucose deprivation experiment (Fig. 6 C) was conducted in part to see whether loss of a primary energy source needed to synthesize MSH might result in changes in intermediate levels, indicative of the MSH-degradative pathway. However, under these conditions the MSH level did not decline but actually increased by 40%, and the AcCys level exhibited little change. Thus, no clear insight into the degradative pathway was obtained from this experiment. The present results demonstrate that the MSH level is very tightly regulated in M. smegmatis. Only minor changes in concentration were observed in the transition from exponential to stationary phase (Fig. 5) during glucose deprivation (Fig. 6 C) and during inositol or AcCys/Cys supplementation (Fig. 6, A and B). The steady-state level of MSH depends upon the net balance in its rate of production and its rate of degradation. These can be influenced at a variety of levels, from feedback inhibition/activation of key enzymes in the pathway to regulation of gene expression, and elaboration of the mechanisms involved will be of interest as more is learned about the enzymes of MSH metabolism. In conclusion, the present studies have provided some important tools for the study of MSH metabolism. Their application to M. smegmatis has provided evidence that GlcN-Ins and Cys-GlcN-Ins are intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway and suggested that AcCys and GlcN-Ins may be involved in the degradative pathway. The HPLC analysis methods presented here complement our immunoassay methods for MSH (8Unson M.D. Newton G.L. Davis C. Fahey R.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 214: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and together these methods provide important tools for identifying and analyzing mycobacterial mutants blocked in MSH biosynthesis, a topic of subsequent papers in this series.

These proteins include several protein kinases, phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), multiple components in smooth muscle contraction, ion channels, etc. In the x-ray structure, Ca2+-CaM adopts a dumbbell-shaped structure, with the two lobes connected by a 26-residue-long α-helix (5Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Each lobe contains two helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs that are interconnected by a small β-sheet between the two Ca2+-binding loops. In solution, the middle portion of the central α-helical linker region is flexible, as demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy (6Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Methionine-rich hydrophobic patches become exposed on each lobe of CaM following the binding of four Ca2+ ions (5Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), whereas these two hydrophobic patches are absent or not fully exposed in apo-CaM structures (7Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat.

When the concentration of the secondary messenger Ca2+increases inside cells from ∼10−7 to ∼10−5m, four Ca2+ ions will bind to CaM, and CaM will expose its two hydrophobic patches for target protein binding. This sequence of events is confirmed by high resolution x-ray and NMR structures of the complexes between Ca2+-CaM and peptides derived from CaM-binding domains of target proteins (9Ikura M.

CaM-binding domains in typical target proteins do not have any amino acid sequence homology. They often comprise a stretch of ∼20–25 amino acid residues; this region has the potential to form a positively charged amphipathic α-helix (2Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

CaM-binding domains usually do not contain a significant number of negatively charged residues such as Asp or Glu, which could give rise to unfavorable electrostatic repulsion with CaM. CaM is highly acidic, as it carries a net negative charge of 17 even after it has bound four Ca2+ ions. Synthetic peptides encompassing CaM-binding domains of distinct target proteins usually bind to Ca2+-CaM in a 1:1 complex with an amphipathic α-helical motif (9Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

The hydrophobic face of the peptide interacts with the two Met-rich hydrophobic patches in Ca2+-CaM, and the positively charged Lys and Arg residues of the peptide bind to several negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) in Ca2+-CaM (9Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

The flexible central linker region of CaM can bend to a different extent to accommodate the binding of diverse peptides, and the two Met-rich hydrophobic patches also create a highly adjustable binding surface to allow binding of peptides of distinct amino acid sequence (9Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

The interactions between Ca2+-CaM and the peptides are predominantly hydrophobic in nature, and the interface exclusively involves amino acid side chain-side chain interactions (9Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

Here we characterize an unusual CaM-binding domain derived from petunia glutamate decarboxylase. Glutamate decarboxylase catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to CO2 and γ-aminobutyric acid. γ-Aminobutyric acid is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian cells, and the γ-aminobutyric acid level is crucial for the development of plant cells (13Baum G. Lev-Yadun S. Fridmann Y. Arazi T. Katsnelson H. Zik M. Fromm H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2988-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Petunia GAD is a 58-kDa cytosolic protein that has a 34-amino acid extension at its C terminus that is absent in mammalian or Escherichia coli GAD (14Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This part of the protein has been shown to interact with petunia CaM as well as with mammalian [35S]Met-labeled CaM, CaM-Sepharose, or biotinylated CaM (14Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CaM-binding domain was further mapped to a 26-residue peptide (15Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to mammalian GADs, plant GADs are CaM-binding proteins, and the CaM-binding properties of plant GAD have now been demonstrated in different plant species such as petunia, Arabidopsis thaliana, fava bean, and soybean (14Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Ling V. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1135-1143PubMed Google Scholar, 17Snedden W.A. Arazi T. Fromm H. Shelp B.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the CaM-binding domains of petunia and A. thaliana have been reported (13Baum G. Lev-Yadun S. Fridmann Y. Arazi T. Katsnelson H. Zik M. Fromm H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2988-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most interesting feature of these CaM-binding domains is that they contain four (for A. thaliana) or five (for petunia) Asp or Glu residues at conserved positions (Fig. 1) (15Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The presence of this many negatively charged residues in a CaM-binding domain peptide is unique. CaM is an acidic protein, and hence, it is not designed to interact with negatively charged residues in the peptide. We have studied the interaction of Ca2+-CaM and a 26-residue PGD peptide derived from GAD by nondenaturing urea-PAGE, circular dichroism, steady-state Trp fluorescence, and two-dimensional NMR. The peptide is a monomer in aqueous solution in the absence of CaM. However, we have found that two α-helical peptides bind simultaneously to Ca2+-CaM. To the best of our knowledge, the Ca2+-CaM-induced dimerization of plant GAD represents a new Ca2+-CaM·protein-binding motif. A synthetic gene encoding the mammalian CaM sequence was cloned and expressed in E. coli as described previously (18Waltersson Y. Linse S. Brodin P. Grundström T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7866-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Zhang M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22420-22428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of wild-type CaM and [methyl-13C]]Met-labeled CaM followed established procedures (19Zhang M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22420-22428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purification of CT-CaM (a CaM mutant with all four Met residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM mutated to Leu residues), SeMet-CaM (a CaM variant in which all nine Met residues are substituted with the unnatural amino acid SeMet), and SeMet-CT-CaM (CT-CaM with the remaining five Met residues substituted with SeMet) has been described in detail elsewhere (21Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar); SeMet was incorporated to 87%. A 26-residue peptide (NH2-HKKTDSEVQLEMITAWKKFVEEKKKK-CONH2) that corresponds to the CaM-binding domain in petunia GAD (amino acid residues 470–495) (15Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was chemically synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Core Facility at the University of Calgary (Calgary, Canada). The composition and purity of the peptide were confirmed by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography, amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry. Ultrapure CsCl was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The soluble nitroxide spin label TEMPOL (4-hydroxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy; also called HyTEMPO) was purchased from Sigma. The concentration of CaM was determined by ultraviolet spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient ε2761% = 1.8. The concentration of the PGD peptide was determined by weight and by using a molar extinction coefficient ε280 = 5500m−1 cm−1, which was consistent with the outcome of quantitative amino acid analysis. Nondenaturing urea-PAGE gel band shift assays were performed using a published procedure (22Yuan T. Mietzner T.A. Montelaro R.C. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10690-10696Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The urea is normally included in the gel to prevent the formation of nonspecific interactions. CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C) using a 1-mm path length cylindrical quartz cuvette. The parameters used were as follows: 0.2-nm step resolution, 50-nm/min scanning speed, 2-s response time, 1-nm bandwidth, and 20-millidegree sensitivity. All spectra shown were the average over 10 scans. The concentration of the CaM or PGD peptide used was 10 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, with 2 mmCaCl2 or 2 mm EDTA. The total volume of each sample was 200 μl. The background signals from the buffer were subtracted, and each spectrum was smoothed and converted to molar ellipticity using Jasco software. The CD spectra were reported either as molar ellipticity or as mean residue molar ellipticity. The α-helical content of the peptide was calculated according to Scholtzet al. (23Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Steady-state Trp fluorescence and CsCl quenching experiments were carried out on a Hitachi 2000 spectrofluorometer as described previously (21Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The Trp fluorescence was excited at 295 nm to reduce the excitation of the two Tyr residues in CaM. Emission wavelength scans were recorded from 300 to 450 nm. Fluorescence samples contained 10 μm PGD peptide in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 100 mm KCl in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mmEDTA. The total sample volume was 1 ml. The CaM concentration was 5 or 10 μm for a PGD peptide/CaM ratio of 2:1 or 1:1, respectively. The fluorescence titration of the PGD peptide with Ca2+-CaM was performed by continuously adding 2 μl of a 200 μm CaM stock solution into 1 ml of the PGD peptide in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. The total volume of CaM added to the cuvette was 20 μl. Since we monitored only the shift of the maximum emission wavelength in these experiments, the increase in the total sample volume could be neglected. All NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer using a 5-mm broadband, z axis gradient-shielded probe at 298 K. Two-dimensional1H-13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectra were acquired with pulsed field gradient selection (24Wider G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 239-241Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Quadrature detection in the F1 dimension was obtained using the time-proportional phase incrementation technique. The sweep width was 8 ppm in the 1H dimension and 6 ppm in the13C dimension, with the 1H carrier set at 500.1388 MHz and the 13C carrier at 125.7613 MHz. The size of the HMQC spectra was a 1024 × 128 real data matrix with eight scans for each experiment. The TEMPOL titration experiments were carried out as described. 2T. Yuan, H. Ouyang, and H. J. Vogel, submitted for publication. Two-dimensional homonuclear1H-1H NMR spectra were acquired for the spectral assignment of the PGD peptide in H2O. The peptide sample contained 2 mm PGD peptide in 90% H2O and 10% D2O, pH 5.0 (not corrected for the isotope effects). COSY and NOESY spectra were acquired with pulsed field gradient experiments (25Jeener J. Meier H. Bachman P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4825) Google Scholar, 26Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Keeler J. Moskau D. Lohman J. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 94: 637-644Google Scholar). Total correlation spectra were acquired according to Griesinger et al. (27Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). The typical size of a spectrum was a 2048 × 400 real data matrix with 64∼128 scans for each experiment. NOESY spectra were acquired with two different mixing times (100 and 250 ms) to check for spin diffusion effects. All spectra were acquired at two different temperatures (289 and 298 K) for cross-checking the assignments. The assignment obtained at 298 K is reported under “Results.” NMR spectra were processed using nmrPipe and nmrDraw software (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11441) Google Scholar). All spectra were zero-filled once in both dimensions, and 90° and 75° sine square shifted window functions were applied to the F2 and F1 dimensions, respectively, before Fourier transformation. Proton chemical shifts are referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as 0 ppm. Carbon-13 chemical shifts are referenced indirectly to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate using the converting ratio13C/1H = 0.251449530 as suggested by Wishart et al. (29Wishart D. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). The α-1H and α-13C random coil chemical shifts for the amino acid residues are taken from Wishart and Sykes (30Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The α-helical content of the peptide was calculated using the Agadir program, which is available on the web site of EMBL (31Muñoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41 (, and references therein): 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This program has been developed for predicting peptide rather than protein secondary structure, and it has had considerable success when compared with experimental determinations of secondary structure (31Muñoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41 (, and references therein): 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, we used a gel band shift assay to assess the interaction between Ca2+-CaM and the PGD peptide. At increasing ratios of the PGD peptide to Ca2+-CaM, we observed a large band shift due to the formation of a complex between the PGD peptide and Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 2). This phenomenon is normally observed for high affinity CaM-binding peptides (1Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Vogel H.J. Zhang M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 3-15Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found that the band for CaM did not disappear until 2 eq of the PGD peptide were added (Fig. 2). No changes occurred when >2 eq of PGD peptide were added. These results suggest that two PGD peptide molecules bind simultaneously to one CaM molecule. This observation is surprising in view of the fact that most of the well characterized CaM-binding peptides, such as peptides derived from myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), constitutive nitric-oxide synthase, and CaM-dependent protein kinase I, form only a 1:1 complex with Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 2 and data not shown) (1Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Vogel H.J. Zhang M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 3-15Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Also the band for the Ca2+-CaM·PGD peptide complex runs much slower on the gel than the bands of either the Ca2+-CaM·MLCK peptide complex (Fig. 2) or the Ca2+-CaM·constitutive nitric-oxide synthase peptide complex (data not shown). Although there is no direct correlation between the band migration distance and the molecular mass of proteins on the nondenaturing urea-polyacrylamide gel, the mobility of the band on such a gel usually suggests either that the Ca2+-CaM·PGD peptide complex has a higher molecular mass or that this complex has a very different shape compared with the Ca2+-CaM·MLCK peptide complex (Fig. 2). We also performed the band shift assay without including urea in the gel and samples and obtained exactly the same results (data not shown). We acquired CD spectra to study the secondary structural changes that occur upon binding of the PGD peptide to Ca2+-CaM. The PGD peptide itself has ∼31% α-helix in aqueous solution, and this percentage agrees very well with the 38% predicted by the Agadir program (Fig. 3). The observation of such an extent of α-helix formation is not uncommon in 20∼25-residue-long monomeric peptides that contain potential ion pairs in (i, i + 3) or (i, i + 4) positions (32Kuhlman B. Yang H.Y. Boice J.A. Fairman R. Raleigh D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Smith J.S. Scholtz J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When the PGD peptide was added to a Ca2+-CaM solution, the negative molar ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm increased dramatically upon adding 1 eq of the PGD peptide. This suggests an increase in the α-helical content of the Ca2+-CaM·PGD peptide complex (Fig. 3). Since Ca2+-CaM usually does not gain any α-helical structure upon peptide binding (9Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 11Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), the increase in α-helix in the Ca2+-CaM·peptide complex can be attributed to the bound peptide (1Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Vogel H.J. Zhang M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 3-15Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the PGD peptide has ∼72% α-helix when complexed with Ca2+-CaM. Interestingly, when we added a second equivalent of peptide, we observed a further increase in the amount of α-helix in the complex, which is more than would be obtained from addition of unbound PGD peptide (Fig. 3). Our CD results are consistent with the idea that Ca2+-CaM is able to bind 2 eq of the PGD peptide, both in an α-helical conformation. In addition, isotope-filtered Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (34Zhang M. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10883-10888Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) also confirmed that the PGD peptide adopts an α-helix when bound to Ca2+-CaM. 3H. Fabian, T. Yuan, and H. J. Vogel, unpublished results. We next performed a trifluoroethanol (TFE) titration experiment to study the α-helix-forming potential of the PGD peptide. The α-helical content of the PGD peptide increases with increasing TFE concentration up to 20% TFE, after which it levels off (data not shown). The percentage α-helix formed in the PGD peptide is ∼68% in 20% TFE aqueous solution. Since TFE is a well known α-helix-stabilizing solvent (35Nelson J.W. Kallenbach N.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 36Zhang M. Yuan T. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the observation that the α-helix of the PGD peptide can be further stabilized by TFE is as expected. In many of our studies concerning peptide binding to CaM, we have observed that the extent of α-helix formation induced in the peptide by binding to CaM or by addition of TFE is identical (36Zhang M. Yuan T. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also for the PGD peptide, these two values are in close agreement (72 and 68%, respectively). The outcome of the steady-state Trp fluorescence experiments are presented in Fig. 4. The PGD peptide has a maximum emission wavelength at 353 nm, which is typical for a solvent-exposed Trp residue in a peptide (Fig. 4 A). When Ca2+-CaM was titrated into a PGD peptide solution, we found a significant blue shift of the maximum emission wavelength (note that there are no Trp residues in CaM). The maximum emission wavelength recorded for the complex is 335 nm (Fig. 4 A). This relatively large blue shift indicates that the Trp residue(s) in the peptide move from a solvent-exposed environment to a hydrophobic environment in the complex, which is quite common for CaM-binding peptides (21Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A change in the microenvironment around the Trp residues in the PGD peptides upon binding to Ca2+-CaM was also observed by near-UV CD spectroscopy (data not shown). However, we noted that the fluorescence intensity of the CaM·PGD peptide complex experienced only a small increase; this is quite different from most of the CaM-binding peptides, which typically experience a doubling or tripling of the fluorescence quantum yield upon binding to CaM (21Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This could be due to the fact that the PGD peptide contains negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) as opposed to normal CaM-binding peptides and that the carboxyl side chain of Asp and Glu residues can have quenching effects on the Trp fluorescence. Another possibility is that the two Trp residues in the bound dimeric PGD peptide may sit in a unique environment upon binding to Ca2+-CaM, so the higher Trp fluorescence, which is normally seen when it resides in a hydrophobic environment, is quenched. Titration experiments of the PGD peptide with Ca2+-CaM showed that the maximum emission wavelength already reached a plateau (337 nm) when only 0.5 eq of Ca2+-CaM was added (Fig. 4, A and B). This result indicates again that the PGD peptide binds to Ca2+-CaM in a 2:1 ratio (Fig. 4 B). In addition, we did not find any changes in the Trp fluorescence of the PGD peptide upon adding apo-CaM (with 5 mm EDTA in the sample) (data not shown). Therefore, the interactions between CaM and the PGD peptide take place only in the presence of calcium. Fluorescence quenching experiments with small molecules such as CsCl were also performed. The Trp residue in the PGD peptide was effectively quenched by increasing concentrations of CsCl, indicating a fully solvent-exposed Trp residue in the peptide. At 1:1 and 2:1 ratios of PGD to Ca2+-CaM, the Trp residues in the bound peptide were inaccessible to the quenching agent (Fig. 4 C). These data again indicate that the PGD peptide binds to Ca2+-CaM in a 2:1 ratio and that the indole rings of the Trp residues from both peptides are shielded from the solvent in the complex. To obtain further information about the potential arrangement of the two PGD peptides when bound to Ca2+-CaM, we recorded the fluorescence spectra of the PGD peptide complexed with four CaM variant proteins with different Met substitutions in the presence of calcium. We have successfully used the same approach to determine the orientation"

These changes include activation of the gene that encodes human involucrin (hINV).1 Involucrin is not expressed in the basal epidermal layer, but expression is activated in the late spinous layer and continues in the granular layer (4Rice R.H. Green H. Cell. 1979; 18: 681-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 5Rice R.H. Green H. Cell. 1977; 11: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Involucrin is an α-helical, rod-shaped, 68 kilodalton, glutamine- and glutamic acid-rich structural protein that is an efficient transglutaminase substrate (6Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

During the final stages in keratinocyte differentiation, involucrin is incorporated, via the formation of interprotein ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links with other proteins, into the keratinocyte cornified envelope (10Eckert R.L.

Involucrin play a similar role in other stratifying epithelia, including esophagus, cornea, ectocervix, vagina, etc. (15Banks-Schlegel S. Green H. J.

Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In each tissue, expression is confined to the suprabasal layers. We are interested in the regulation of hINV expression and identification of the regulatory elements responsible for the tissue-specific and differentiation-appropriate expression in these tissues. Recent studies indicate that a 6-kb segment of the hINV gene, including the hINV upstream regulatory region, the intron, and the coding sequence, targets expression to the appropriate tissues (16Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Targeted expression is also observed when the upstream regulatory region is linked to the SV40 intron and β-galactosidase (17Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In vitro studies show that the promoter is expressed in cells derived from stratifying epithelia (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Deletion mapping and point mutation studies identify two regions of the upstream regulatory region, the proximal regulatory region (PRR) and the distal regulatory region (DRR), that are required for optimal expression in cultured cells (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both the DRR and PRR contain AP1 sites, AP1–5 and AP1–1, respectively, that are required for optimal promoter activity (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, the PRR contains an Sp1 site that synergistically activates expression in conjunction with the AP1–5 site (19Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluate the role of the DRR in mediating in vivo expression using a transgenic mouse model. Among other findings, we demonstrate that the DRR is necessary and sufficient for expression of the transgene in epidermis and other stratifying epithelia. E13E was constructed byEcoRI digestion of λ phage, Charon 4AλI-3 (21Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A 13-kbEcoRI fragment was then subcloned into pBKS(+) to yield pBKS-E13E. The EcoRI insert from this plasmid is shown in Fig. 1. The H6B transgene is a 6-kb HindIII/BamHI fragment that was derived by restricting Charon 4AλI-3 withHindIII/BamHI and subcloning the resulting 6-kb fragment into HindIII/BamHI-restricted pSP64 to yield pSP64λI-3 H6B (21Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Promoter deleted transgenes were constructed by taking advantage of unique restriction sites located upstream of the transcription start site. Consequently, the Ha5.5B transgene was generated by digesting pSP64λI-3 H6B withHaeII/BamHI and isolating theHaeII/BamHI. Likewise, the A4.3B and K4B transgenes were isolated from pSP64λI-3 H6B by digesting withAccI/BamHI and KpnI/BamHI, respectively. P3.4B was generated by complete BamHI and partial PstI digestion. DRR-P3.4B was created by cloning theHindIII/HaeII DRR segment immediately upstream of the minimal promoter in P3.4B using a polylinker. Maps of the transgenes are shown in Figs. 1 and 7. Multiple E13E (one), A4.3B (one), K4B (one), H6B (four), Ha5.5B (three), P3.4B (five), and DRR-P3.4B (three) transgenic lines were characterized.Figure 7The DRR region is necessary for expression in epidermis. Panel A compares the structure of P3.4B, DRR-P3.4B, and H6B. The DRR is shown as an open box. In DRR-P3.4B, the DRR element is fused immediately upstream of nucleotide –41 of the minimal promoter. All conventions are exactly as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Panel B shows immunoblots for detection of hINV in DRR-P3.4B, P3.4B, and H6B mice.

Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1986Google Scholar). The offspring were characterized for the presence of the human involucrin (hINV) transgene by blotting of tail DNA (16Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1986Google Scholar). To detect hINV expression in mouse tissues, total protein extracts were prepared from tissue samples in Laemmli sample buffer, electrophoresed on acrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot. The blot was incubated with a primary antibody prepared against human involucrin, diluted 1:8000 as described previously (16Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), followed by visualization using a chemiluminescent detection system. To detect hINV in tissue sections, samples were fixed in buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (16Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sections were deparaffinized, blocked, incubated with primary anti-hINV antibody and secondary detection agents exactly as described previously (16Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The involucrin antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and was preabsorbed on 3T3 fibroblast cells prior to use. Expression of hINV mRNA in mouse tissues was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Two micrograms of total RNA, isolated from mouse tissue, was reverse transcribed in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm of each dNTP, 1.6 μg of oligo-p(dT)15 primer, 50 units of RNase inhibitor, and 20 units of reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 10 min at 25 °C and for 60 min at 42 °C in a 20-μl reaction. The reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating, and 20 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was added to a 100-μl PCR amplification reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm each dNTP, 0.2 μm each upstream (5′-CTC CAC CAA AGC CTC TGC, in exon 1) and downstream (5′-CTG CTT AAG CTG CTG CTC, exon 2) primers, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR cycling reactions were 96 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. These primers amplify a 380 bp segment of the hINV mRNA sequence. Because the primers are in different exons, PCR amplification of contaminating genomic DNA can be distinguished by production of a much larger band. β-actin was amplified in parallel reactions as a control. The upstream regulatory region from the hINV gene (21Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) was isolated and sequenced using Maxam-Gilbert (23Eckert R.L. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 51: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and dideoxy sequencing (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The complete sequence was determined in both directions. The hINV transgenes are shown in Fig. 1. E13E includes approximately 5,000 bp of upstream sequence, the transcribed gene, and 4.5 kb of downstream sequence. All other constructs are truncated at a BamHI site located just downstream of the transcription stop sequence. H6B, Ha5.5B, A4.3B, and K4B are progressively truncated from the 5′ end and contain 2473, 1953, 1333, and 986 bp of upstream regulatory region, respectively. To detect expression of the hINV protein in mice, we assayed epidermis and kidney for expression of the hINV protein by immunoblot of whole cell extracts as described previously (16Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Equivalent quantities of protein extract (15 μg) were immunoblotted. As shown in Fig. 2 A, hINV protein is detected in epidermis in E13E and H6B mice, but not in Ha5.5B, A4.3B, or K4B mice. In contrast to the differences in hINV expression in epidermis, hINV transgene expression is retained in the kidney of all transgenic lines (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the 520-bp DNA segment located between −2473 to −1953 is required for expression of the hINV transgene in epidermis. Nontransgenic mice did not produce hINV. The above experiments show that hINV protein is present in the epidermis and kidney of E13E and H6B mice, but not in Ha5.5B, A4.3B, K4B, or P3.4B mice. However, these results do not demonstrate that hINV is synthesized in these tissues. To directly demonstrate synthesis, we assayed for hINV mRNA by RT-PCR. Fig. 3 shows that mRNA encoding hINV is produced in the epidermis (E) and kidney (K) of H6B mice, but not in the epidermis of Ha5.5B mice. Thus, hINV is synthesized in these tissues, and loss of hINV expression in the Ha5.5B as compared with H6B is associated with loss of hINV mRNA. We used immunological techniques to evaluate the differentiation-dependence of expression (Fig. 4). hINV is detected in the upper spinous and granular layers in footpad epidermis (EPI) in E13E and H6B mice, but no expression is detected in the basal layer (arrowheads). Suprabasal expression is also observed in the ectocervical epithelium (EC) in these mice. In contrast, no expression is observed in epithelium or epidermis of transgenic strains Ha5.5B or K4B (Fig. 4), and no expression is observed in nontransgenic mice (not shown). Fig. 5 shows transgene expression in the kidney of K4B mice. In this, and all other lines, expression in kidney is confined to the epithelia lining the distal convoluted tubule.Figure 5Immunodetection of hINV in kidney.Kidney tissue sections were prepared from representative K4B transgenic animals and from nontransgenic (NT) animals. Sections were incubated with the hINV-specific primary antibody followed by treatment with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. Thearrowheads indicate the lumenal epithelium lining the distal convoluted tubules. The asterisks identify the renal corpuscles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results suggest that important regulatory elements are localized within the −2473/−1953 segment. To identify these potential elements, the entire 2473-bp hINV upstream regulatory region (−2473/−7) was sequenced (Fig. 6). The experiments shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 suggest that the −2473/−1953 segment is required for expression in stratifying epithelia. The minimal hINV promoter construct, P3.4B, which contains only 41 bp of upstream sequence (Fig. 7 A), shows no expression in epidermis (Fig. 7 B). Fusion of the DRR-containing segment (−2473/−1953) immediately upstream of the minimal promoter restores expression in stratifying epithelia (Fig. 7 B). The DRR-P3.4B construct is expressed at a level compared with that observed with H6B (Fig. 7 B). Immunohistological examination of the pattern of expression reveals that the DRR-P3.4B drives expression in the suprabasal layers in the ectocervical epithelium (Fig. 8). Identifying mechanisms that govern tissue-specific and differentiation-appropriate gene expression in stratifying epithelia, such as epidermis, is an area of intense interest. In these epithelia, stem cells give rise to daughter cells that then differentiate to form the suprabasal layers of the tissue. This process produces profound changes in cell morphological and biochemistry. Several marker proteins have been identified that are differentially regulated during this process, including loricrin (25Yoneda K. McBride O.W. Korge B.P. Kim I.G. Steinert P.M. J.

Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). H6B includes 2.5 kb of DNA upstream of the transcription start site, the two exons, the intron, and a short sequence segment downstream of the polyadenylation signal. Although the expression of this construct appeared physiologic, we wanted to test larger constructs to determine whether additional sequence would alter expression. The E13E results show that the presence of additional DNA does not change the regulation. Thus, neither the downstream region (+4500/+8000) nor the most distal upstream region (−5000/−2473) is required for appropriate expression in stratifying epithelia. To identify regions that are important for expression, we tested promoter deletions. In contrast to E13E and H6B, Ha5.5B does not express in epidermis, cervix, or other stratifying epithelia, suggesting that elements within the 520-bp −2473/−1953 DRR segment (19Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) are essential for this expression. Truncation of additional sequence, in constructs A4.3B and P3.4B, does not restore expression. The loss of expression was not because of a general inactivation of the promoter, as, except for P3.4B, these constructs retain expression in kidney. Only P3.4B was off in all tissues, suggesting that the 41 bp of upstream region present in this construct represents the basal promoter. This region includes only the TATA box and some associated sequences (Fig. 6). Thus, the promoter appears to be organized into modular units including a “stratifying epithelial module” located in the DRR, and a kidney module located between −986/−41, and a basal promoter (−41/−7). However, additional experiments, discussed below, suggest that these regions cannot function completely independently. Splicing the DRR segment upstream of P3.4B, the minimal promoter construct, restores expression in stratifying epithelia. This result suggests that the DRR segment is necessary for expression and that the −1953/−41 segment is not required. However, it could be argued that the DRR region may be acting in conjunction with DNA in the transcribed region of the gene (e.g. the intron). However, the hINV promoter also drives stratifying epithelia-specific expression of heterologous genes (17Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The smallest construct tested, the −2473/−41 segment, drives expression of heterologous genes in stratifying epithelia. 2J. F. Crish and R. L. Eckert, unpublished data. Taken together, these results argue that the DRR is both necessary and sufficient for expression in stratifying epithelia. Although the DRR is necessary and sufficient for expression, other sequences appear to be necessary to produce authentic differentiation-dependent expression. In the absence of the −1953/−41 segment, the DRR produces expression only in the extreme suprabasal cell layers. This suggests that interaction between elements in the DRR and in the −1953/−41 segment may be required for expression in the layers immediately suprabasal to the stem cell layer. The present studies focus on the ectocervical and epidermal epithelia. However, we have also checked several other surface epithelia to determine whether the DRR is generally required for expression. We have studied esophagus, epidermis, footpad, ectocervix, and trachea. In each case, the DRR is required for expression, indicating that the DRR is a generally required element for surface epithelial expression. DNA sequence analysis indicates that the DRR contains binding sites for several transcription factors, including functionally important Sp1 and AP1 sites (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C.

Our previous in vitro studies show that the minimal promoter does not drive expression in keratinocytes; however, addition of the DRR restores hINV promoter activity (19Banks E.B. Crish J.F.

AP1 has been shown to be an important regulator in several genes that are expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner in surface epithelia (38DiSepio D. Jones A. Longley M.A. Bundman D.

Small angle scattering with contrast variation has revealed the shapes and dispositions of R and C in the reconstituted complexes, leading to low resolution models for both forms. The crystal structures of C and a truncation mutant of R fit well within the molecular boundaries of the RC dimer model. The area of interaction between R and C is small, seemingly poised for dissociation upon a conformational transition within R induced by cAMP binding. Within the RC dimer, C has a “closed” conformation similar to that seen for C with a bound pseudosubstrate peptide. The model for the PKA holoenzyme has an extended dumbbell shape. The interconnecting bar is formed from the dimerization domains of the R subunits, arranged in an antiparallel configuration, while each lobe contains the cAMP-binding domains of one R interacting with one C. Our studies suggest that the PKA structure may be flexible via a hinge movement of each dumbbell lobe with respect to the dimerization domain.

Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important mechanisms for the regulation of biochemical function in eukaryotic cells. It is catalyzed by a family of enzymes, the protein kinases, of which several hundred have been identified. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 was one of the earliest kinases to be discovered, and it serves as a prototype for understanding kinase structure-function relationships and regulatory mechanisms (1Walsh D.A. Perkins J.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3763-3765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowadski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the absence of cAMP, PKA is an inactive tetramer (R2C2) with two identical regulatory (R) and two identical catalytic (C) subunits. The two R subunits are homodimerized at their amino-terminal ends (3León D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and, physiologically, the R subunit appears always to exist as a dimer. The R subunit also has two in tandem cAMP-binding sites and a pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory domain that binds to C and inhibits catalysis in the absence of cAMP. Upon binding cAMP, the PKA holoenzyme dissociates into an R2 homodimer and two active C subunits (5Tsuzuki J. Kiger J.A.

Whether dissociation is absolutely required for activation, however, remains in question (8Johnson D.A. Leathers V.L. Martinez A.-M. Walsh D.A. Fletcher W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6402-6410Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Yang S. Fletcher W.H. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6267-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Saturation of both cAMP-binding sites on each R is required for activation. There are three isoforms of C (Cα, Cβ, and Cγ) and two major isoforms of R (RI and RII) that are further distinguished into subforms (α and β) (10Døskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjersten B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of these isozyme variations is not fully understood, but anchoring proteins (AKAPs) for RII give it a unique cellular distribution (11Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar). RI and RII show sequence homology in their cAMP-binding and pseudosubstrate domains but differ extensively in their dimerization domains as well as in the sequence connecting the dimerization and pseudosubstrate domains. Structural data have been obtained for the individual PKA subunits, but information on their interactions and the quaternary structure of the holoenzyme is very limited. The crystal structure of C complexed with the high affinity protein kinase inhibitor pseudosubstrate peptide, PKIα-(5–24), has been solved (13Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Like other kinase catalytic domains whose structures also have been solved, the PKA C subunit is bilobal with the catalytic cleft located between the two lobes. Small angle scattering studies (16Olah G.A. Mitchell R.D. Sosnick T.R. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3649-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) revealed that in the absence of the pseudosubstrate peptide the catalytic cleft is in a more “open” configuration resulting from a hinge movement at residue Gly125 located in the sequence segment joining the two lobes. This glycine is closely conserved throughout most of the kinase phylogenetic family (16Olah G.A. Mitchell R.D. Sosnick T.R. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3649-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Partially open forms of the PKA C subunit more recently have been solved by x-ray crystallography (17Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.-h. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the two in tandem cAMP binding sites of the R subunit has been solved using a Δ1–91 truncation mutant of the RIα subunit (18Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Two domains are evident in this structure, each containing one cAMP-binding site, both of which are structurally similar to that of the cAMP binding pocket of theEscherichia coli catabolite gene activation protein (19Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The likely structure of the dimerization domain of the RIIhas been elucidated by NMR studies of the dimeric peptide 1–44RII (4Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The NMR data indicate each peptide chain adopts a helix-turn-helix motif and that these structural motifs are arranged in an antiparallel four-helix bundle. Chemical evidence also supports an antiparallel arrangement for the dimerization domains in the RI dimer (3León D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The spatial arrangement of the subunits in the PKA holoenzyme and the nature of the RC interface are not known, although mutagenesis studies have identified a number of residues important for the R-C interaction (20Gibbs C.S.

We report here small angle x-ray scattering and neutron contrast variation measurements on the PKA holoenzyme (R2C2) and a Δ1–91RC heterodimer, each reconstituted with partially deuterated R and protiated C subunits. The different neutron scattering properties of hydrogen (protium) and deuterium enable us to extract the structural parameters for the C and R subunits within the complexes. From these measurements, we have determined the molecular boundaries of the RC dimer, the PKA holoenzyme, and the subunits within each complex. Using these data, we have derived a low resolution model for each PKA form. Our data for C and the in tandem cAMP-binding sites of R are consistent with the molecular dimensions of their respective crystal structures and allow for an assignment of their spatial alignment, thereby giving insights into the nature of the R-C interaction. We also report scattering studies of the individual C and R subunits that enable us to address whether the catalytic cleft in the C subunit is open or closed when C interacts with R and the extent of the cAMP-induced conformational change in R. Initial experiments suggested that the optimum preparation of a chimeric deuterated-protiated PKA holoenzyme was achieved using myristoylated catalytic subunit isolated directly from bovine heart and bacterially expressed deuterated regulatory subunit. Bacterially expressed nonmyristoylated C was not used because of the potential for the myristoyl group to play a role in the structure of the protein that is important for its interactions with R. Bovine heart Cα was prepared and purified to homogeneity as described previously (26Fletcher W.H. Van Patten S.M. Cheng H.-C. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5504-5513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deuterated RIIα was prepared by expression procedures similar to those used previously for the preparation of other deuterated proteins (27Olah G.A. Rokop S. Wang A.C. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Krueger J.K. Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6017-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, the murine RIIα vector (PET11D), provided by Dr. John Scott (29Scott J.D. Glaccum M.B. Zoller M.J. Uhler M.D. Helfman D.M. McKnight G.S. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5186-5192Google Scholar), was expressed in E. coliBL21DE3 in a mixture of D2O and H2O containing deuterated algal hydrolysate diluted with nondeuterated amino acids and glucose to give the average levels of deuteration desired (27Olah G.A. Rokop S. Wang A.C. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria were adapted from growth in LB/carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) to growth in the deuterated algal hydrolysate over a period of 3 days by diluting and growing mid-log phase cells (2% innoculum) in LB, to LB in D2O (55–65%), and then to the final deuterated medium. Production of the RIIα was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the medium at a final concentration of 1 mm when the absorbance of the culture (A 600) was 0.6–0.8, and the culture continued for 16 h at 27 °C. Following lysis in 50 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm2-mecaptoethanol, 1.0 μm leupeptin, 1.0 μmpepstatin, 50 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5.0 mm benzamidine, pH 6.8, the R subunit was purified by cAMP-agarose (N6 attachment, 11-atom spacer) affinity chromatography (10-ml bed volume/liter of original culture volume) with elution and dialysis conditions based upon those established for the R subunit purification from bovine heart (26Fletcher W.H. Van Patten S.M. Cheng H.-C. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5504-5513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this stage of preparation, R was about 95% pure and was obtained in yields of 11–17 mg/liter of original culture. Holoenzyme was formed by incubation of deuterated R with a 20% excess of bovine heart C on ice for 2 h, at protein concentrations of 0.4–0.8 mg/ml of each subunit. The reconstituted holoenzyme was then purified by Q2 anion exchange (Bio-Rad™) FPLC chromatography with an NaCl gradient elution. The final preparation was >99% pure by SDS gel electrophoresis, and it exhibited a specific activity of 9.2 μmol of 32P incorporated/min/mg of protein in a Kemptide protein kinase assay plus cAMP, a without/with cAMP activity ratio of 0.02, aK a cAMP = 0.04 μm, and a molecular mass of 280 kDa by gel filtration and of 162 kDa by native gel electrophoresis according to the method of Hedrick and Smith (30Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 26: 155-164Crossref Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). These characteristics are the same as those of fully protiated PKA holoenzyme. Δ1–91RIIwas obtained by limited proteolysis using 5.0 mg of the 95% pure deuterated RIIα with chymotrypsin-agarose beads (0.5 units/mg of RIIα) at 2 °C for 30 min in a volume of 5 ml in 5 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8. After 30 min on ice, the solution was cleared of chymotrypsin activity by centrifugation (twice) at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. At this stage, the preparation contained predominantly Δ1–91RII with some minor contaminants including other peptide fragments. The protein was then combined with Cα as described for the holoenzyme, and the Δ1–91RC dimer was purified by the same Q2-FPLC procedure. Only R containing an intact pseudosubstrate site forms a stable complex. Following this purification, the Δ1–91RC dimer exhibited a single amino-terminal sequence for the first 10 amino acids by automatic Edman degradation, indicative of cleavage at the Phe91-Thr92 peptide bond of the murine RIIα sequence 92TRRVSVCAET … 2Murine Phe91 is equivalent to bovine Phe90. Note that no sequence would be obtained for the C subunit, because it was N-myristoylated. There was no evidence of any contaminating peptide fragments, nor of undigested R subunit. The Δ1–91RC dimer was in excess of 99% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular mass for the Δ1–91RII of the expected size of 35 kDa. The Δ1–91RC dimer exhibited a specific activity of 10.9 μmol of 32P incorporated/min/mg of protein in a Kemptide protein kinase assay plus cAMP, a without/with cAMP activity ratio of 0.1, a K a cAMP = 0.6 μm, and a molecular mass of 83 kDa by gel filtration. This same method of proteolysis was used to prepare the Δ1–90 fragment of bovine heart RII. Three PKA samples were prepared with average deuteration levels in the R subunit equal to 42, 68, and 71%. Deuteration levels were determined using the neutron contrast solvent match point for the complex (see “Results”). The Δ1–91RC dimer samples were obtained from the 42 and 68% deuterated R subunit preparations. Protein concentrations were routinely measured by the Bio-Rad assay, as standardized against quadruplicate amino acid analyses of PKA. Protein concentrations for scattering measurements were in the range of 0.65–0.96 mg/ml for the PKA holoenzyme and 1.2–2.7 mg/ml for the Δ1–91RC dimer. Samples were maintained in 10 mm MES (pH 6.8) with 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150–300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol. All scattering data were collected within 5 days of protein preparation to minimize possible time-dependent aggregation effects. Samples in high D2O concentrations were prepared immediately before neutron scattering measurements to minimize possible D2O-induced aggregation. X-ray scattering data were measured at Los Alamos using the instrument and data reduction procedures described by Heidorn and Trewhella (31Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Neutron scattering data were measured using the NG3 30-m SANS instrument at the National Institute of Standards Technology (32Hammouda B. Barker J.G. Kreuger S. Small Angle Scattering Manuals. National Institutes of Standards Technology, Gaithersburg, MD1996Google Scholar) and reduced as described previously (33Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Wang C.-L.A. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Scattering data were measured as a function of scattering angle 2θ and reduced to I(Q)versus Q, where Q = 4πsinθ/λ is the momentum transfer of the scattered neutrons whose wavelength is λ. For the neutron scattering experiments, 5-Å neutrons were selected with a Δλ/λ of 30%, and two sample-to-detector distances were used (1.5 and 7.0 m) to give a measured Q range of 0.01–0.3 Å−1. For each reconstituted PKA sample, 2–5 neutron scattering data sets were collected with different solvent deuteration levels (0–94%). Samples with the highest solvent deuteration level were prepared by dialysis against buffer made up using 90% (v/v) D2O and 10% (v/v) glycerol-d 3. Intermediate solvent deuteration levels were obtained by mixing samples in the 94% deuterated solvent with those in all-protium solvent. Samples were stored on ice and maintained at 11 °C during data acquisition. Sample cells for scattering were 1-, 2-, and 4-mm path length quartz cuvettes for solvent deuteration levels of <50%, 50–70%, and >70%, respectively. The scattering of neutrons or x-rays from a homogeneous solution of monodisperse particles can be expressed as follows, I(Q)=∫‖[ρ(r)−ρs]exp[−i(Q·r)dr]‖2(Eq. 1) where the integration is taken over the volume of the particle, and angle brackets denote the average of all particle orientations. ρ(r) and ρs are the scattering densities for the protein and solvent, respectively, and their difference is the “contrast” of the protein with respect to the solvent. Scattering densities are calculated simply as the sum of the scattering amplitudes in a unit volume. The zero angle or forward scattering,I 0, is directly proportional to the square of the contrast and the square of the molecular weight of the scattering particle. When the average scattering density for a protein ρave equals ρs, the contrast is 0, and I 0 becomes 0, i.e. the protein is “solvent-matched.” X-rays are scattered by electrons, and hence, the scattering amplitudes increase monotonically with atomic number. Neutrons interact with atomic nuclei, and their scattering amplitudes vary randomly with atomic number and can be isotope-dependent. One of the largest differences in neutron scattering amplitudes is among the isotopes of hydrogen, protium (1H ≡ H), and deuterium (2H ≡ D), whose neutron scattering amplitudes differ both in magnitude and sign. Assuming internal scattering density fluctuations are negligible, the total scattering from a complex of C and deuterated R subunits can be written as follows, I(Q,ΔρC,ΔρR)=ΔρC2IC(Q)+ΔρC ΔρRICR(Q)+ΔρR2IR(Q)(Eq. 2) where ΔρC is the contrast between the C subunit and the solvent (ρC − ρs) and where ρC is the mean scattering density for C. A similar definition holds for ΔρR. By varying the protium/deuterium ratio in the solvent, a neutron contrast variation data set is obtained in which each scattering profile has the form of Equation 2 but with varying contrast factors. Since the contrast factors can be calculated from the chemical composition of the components, this resultant set of linear equations can be solved to give the basic scattering functionsI C(Q),I R(Q), and I CR(Q).I C(Q) and I R(Q) represent the scattering due to the C and R subunits within the complex, while the cross-termI CR(Q) contains information about the relative dispositions of the subunits. The inverse Fourier transformation of I(Q) gives the pair-distance distribution function, P(r), which is the probable frequency distribution of all vector lengths between scattering centers (atoms) within the particle.P(r) goes to 0 at the particle's maximum linear dimension, d max, and is easily interpreted in terms of the particle shape and domain structure. The forward scattering, I 0, and radius of gyration,R g, for the particle are calculated as the zeroth and second moments of P(r), respectively.P(r) calculations were done using the program GNOM (34Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigen L.A. Acta Crystallogr. 1988; A44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To model the scattering data, a Monte Carlo simulation program SASMODEL 3SASMODEL is written in C++, is available on request, and can run on most computer platforms with an adequate compiler. was developed. The program is designed to determine the shapes and relative dispositions of the macromolecular components (domains, subunits) by testing large numbers of models against scattering data. Each of the molecular components is described as a low resolution “object.” In the present implementation, these objects can be either ellipsoids or cylinders (which includes rods and discs). During the model search cycles, the size, position, and orientation parameters of each object to be optimized are generated by a random search or alternatively through a global minimization routine. 4The global minimization C-code is available from L. Ingeber on the World Wide Web athttp://www.ingeber.com/#ASA-CODE. The parameters can be constrained within a given range, and they can be correlated to each other. For example, two objects can be constrained to have the same dimension, to have surface contact with each other, or to have a certain symmetry with respect to a common symmetry center, axis, or plane. In order to test a model against the scattering data, a rapid Monte Carlo integration method (31Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) is used to generate the modelP(r) function. Once the parameters for each object are generated, they are filled with random points, and P(r) is calculated by summing all pairwise combinations of these points. The correspondingI(Q) is calculated by Fourier transformation of P(r). P(r) and I(Q) functions are then compared with the experimental data by least-square methods. The points defining the models having the best least-square deviations from the experimental data are saved in Brookhaven Protein Data Bank format for ease of viewing. Neutron scattering data from one of the reconstituted PKA (R2C2) samples and from the corresponding Δ1–91RC dimer preparation, both with deuterated R, are shown in Fig. 1. Also shown are the x-ray scattering data for PKA and the Δ1–91RC dimer. The precise deuteration level in each R preparation was determined using the forward scattering values, I 0, at each solvent deuteration level for a given reconstituted sample. Fig. 2 shows plots of the square root of I 0 versus ρs for two of the PKA and two Δ1–91RC dimer samples made from three independently purified and reconstituted preparations. From these plots, the solvent match point is obtained for the complex,i.e. the value of ρs at whichI 0 = 0 and hence ρave = ρs. The average scattering densities ρave for PKA and the Δ1–91RC dimer are readily calculated from those of the individual R and C subunits, which are in turn calculated from their chemical and isotopic compositions. The only unknown is the deuteration level of the R subunit, which is then determined assuming a protein specific volume of 0.72 cm3/g for nondeuterated protein, and ∼45% of all exchangeable hydrogens of both the R and C subunits will be at equilibrium with the solvent hydrogens (27Olah G.A. Rokop S. Wang A.C. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated deuteration levels for the nonexchangeable hydrogen positions in the R subunit in each sample are given in Table I. Using these deuteration levels, contrast values were calculated for the R and C subunits (ΔρR and ΔρC in Equation 2) in each PKA and Δ1–91RC dimer sample for each solvent deuteration level. The scattering profiles measured at each contrast value for a given sample were then expressed in the form of Equation 2, and the linear equations were solved to yield the three basic scattering functions for PKA and for the Δ1–91RC dimer. The basic scattering functions so derived from the neutron scattering data are shown in Fig. 3, while their respectiveP(r) functions are shown in Fig. 4. Table IIgives the R g and d max values obtained from the basic scattering functions for PKA and the Δ1–91RC dimer, as well as those obtained for the isolated subunits.Figure 2Square root of forward scatteringversus the solvent scattering density determination of the deuteration level of the R subunit.

https://openalex.org/W2051731160,"Metabolic labeling of cells with [3H]dihydrosphingosine ([3H]DHS) allows us to follow the incorporation of this tracer into ceramides (Cer), inositol phosphoceramides (IPCs), and mannosylated IPCs and at the same time to assess the remodeling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol proteins during which preexisting anchor lipid moieties are replaced by [3H]Cer-containing anchors. The results indicate that the remodelases in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi use as their substrate Cers that are not generated by the breakdown of IPCs but are newly synthesized. Aureobasidin A, an inhibitor of the IPC synthase Aur1p completely blocks IPC biosynthesis at 0.5 μg/ml but does not block remodeling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors even at concentrations up to 10 μg/ml. In addition, a synthetic Cer analogue,N-hexanoyl-[3H]DHS, is used as a substrate by Aur1p but not by the remodelases. Thus, remodeling is not mediated by Aur1p although remodeling presumably proceeds by an analogous reaction. Studies with secretion mutants deficient in COPII or COPI coat proteins show that all COPII mutants are unable to introduce [3H]Cer by the Golgi remodelase at the restrictive temperature. This suggests that Cer has to be transported by a COPII-dependent way from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi for Golgi remodeling to occur. Golgi remodeling is also not operating in the erd2 mutant and is significantly reduced in COPI mutants, suggesting a dependence of Golgi remodeling on retrotransport.

The lipid moieties of mature GPI1 anchors usually do not contain the DAG species found on the cells PI, although PI would appear as the natural starting point for the biosynthesis of the GPI (1McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 2Thomas J.R. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5414-5422Google Scholar). Studies in trypanosomes and in yeast strongly suggest that ordinary PIs indeed serve as the primary platform on which, by stepwise addition of sugars, GPIs are built but that the primary lipid moiety is remodeled later on, either shortly before transfer of the GPI to proteins (Trypanosoma brucei) or after this transfer (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trypanosoma cruzi) (3Masterson W.J.

Parasitol. 1995; 70: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Curiously, it appears that after remodeling, lipids continue to be exchanged even on mature GPI proteins, although this further lipid exchange replaces lipids by lipids of the same structure (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Buxbaum L.U. Milne K.G. Werbovetz K.A. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The situation in S. cerevisiae is peculiar since two different types of lipids can be found on GPI anchors as follows: Cer and DAG, both containing C26:0 or hydroxylated C26:0 (11Fankhauser C. Homans S.W. Thomas Oates J.E. McConville M.J. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26365-26374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, all mature GPI proteins of yeast contain large lipid moieties with C26 fatty acids. The remodeling introducing Cer can be monitored by metabolic labeling experiments using tritiated DHS ([3H]DHS) (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When given to cells, this tracer is rapidly taken up and is incorporated into all sphingolipids as well as Cer-containing GPI proteins (Fig. 1). By labeling different secretion mutants with [3H]DHS or by using preincubations with cycloheximide (Chx), we found that GPI remodelase 2In this paper we will use the terms remodeling/remodelase to describe the event/enzyme that changes the primary DAG of the GPI anchor for a Cer. activity is present in both the ER and the Golgi (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Curiously, in temperature-sensitive secretion mutants such as sec12 orsec18, the incorporation of [3H]DHS into GPI proteins in the Golgi is completely blocked at 37 °C, whereas [3H]DHS continues to be incorporated into immature GPI proteins in the ER. This suggested that the substrate for the Golgi remodelase may not reach the Golgi, if the vesicular flow from the ER to the Golgi is interrupted. To allow for a more definitive interpretation of this result, we set out to identify the lipid substrate of the remodeling reaction. It seemed likely that lipid remodeling proceeds by some transesterification or transglycosylation since activated forms of Cer such as CDP-Cer have not been found in yeast although they exist in certain bacteria (12Schneider E.G. Kennedy E.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A priori we had to consider that remodeling may occur by introduction of IPC, Cer-P, or Cer in exchange for PI, phosphatidic acid, or DAG, respectively. Introduction of IPC could be excluded since metabolic labeling of cells with [3H]Ins in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor Chx fails to label GPI proteins, whereas [3H]DHS is strongly incorporated under this condition (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We could, however, not exclude that remodelases use IPC as a substrate from which to take Cer-P or Cer for transesterification. This hypothesis even seemed attractive since, when the vesicular traffic from ER to Golgi is blocked in temperature-sensitive COPII mutants, the main IPC (IPC/C) continues to be made in the ER, but mannosylation of IPC/C to MIPC in the Golgi is abolished indicating that IPC is neither transported to the Golgi nor synthesized in the Golgi under these conditions (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, this lack of transport of IPC to the Golgi could explain the lack of GPI remodeling in the Golgi in COPII mutants. Here we present evidence in favor of Cer rather than Cer-P as a remodelase substrate, and we establish that this Cer substrate is newly synthesized and is not taken from IPC or other more complex sphingolipids. By using aureobasidin A (AbA), a recently identified inhibitor of IPC biosynthesis (15Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), we can demonstrate that Golgi remodeling of GPI proteins is occurring normally even if IPC biosynthesis is blocked. Our data lend support to the hypothesis that it is newly synthesized Cer that is used for remodeling. We further present evidence against the possibility that the Aur1p and Ipt1p contain remodelase activity. Moreover, using secretion and retrieval mutants, we evaluate the necessity of COPI- and COPII-dependent vesicle flow for the transfer of Cer onto GPI proteins in the Golgi. S.cerevisiae strains are indicated in Table I. Maintenance and growth conditions as well as the photometric determination of cell density have been described (16Benghezal M. Benachour A. Rusconi S.

Either 15 μl of acetic anhydride or 15 μl of caproic anhydride were added, and the mixture was left standing at room temperature for 2 h. The sample was dried and flashed with 100 μl of dry methanol. This N-acylation procedure was repeated twice. The product was purified by preparative TLC using 0.2-mm thick silica gel plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and developed in solvent system 1. Labeled ceramides were eluted from the silica gel with methanol; methanol was evaporated and the remaining silica gel particles were eliminated by butanol/water partitioning (19Krakow J.L. Hereld D. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12147-12153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If not stated otherwise aliquots of 2.5 A 600 of cells were labeled by adding 25 μCi of [3H]Ins, [3H]DHS, [3H]DHS-C2, or [3H]DHS-C6 exactly as described (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Chx was added at 100 μg/ml. Labelings were stopped and proteins were extracted and delipidated as described (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, proteins were resuspended and boiled during 5 min in reducing sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), and 1/4 of the sample was loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were then processed for fluorography. When preparing cell extracts for protein analysis, the organic solvent extracts were saved, pooled, and dried. Where indicated, lipids were subjected to mild base treatment using NaOH (21Puoti A. Desponds C. Fankhauser C. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21051-21059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were desalted by partitioning between n-butyl alcohol and water followed by back extraction of the butanol phase with water (19Krakow J.L. Hereld D. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12147-12153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The desalted lipids were analyzed by ascending TLC using 0.2-mm thick silica gel plates with solvent system 1 (chloroform, methanol, 2 mNH4OH (40:10:1)), solvent system 2 (chloroform, methanol, 0.25% KCl (55:45:10)), or solvent system 3 (chloroform, methanol, 2m acetic acid (18:10:2)). Radioactivity was quantified by radioscanning using a Berthold radioscanner (22Benghezal M. Lipke P.N. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Results were calculated from the scans by summing up the radioactivity of all lipid peaks including [3H]DHS and by dividing the radioactivity in any given lipid by this sum. Lipids were scraped and eluted from the TLC with methanol as described (17Reggiori, F., Canivenc-Gansel, E., and Conzelmann, A. (1998)Methods Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The extract was pooled and dried. Lipids were desalted by partitioning betweenn-butyl alcohol and water followed by a back extraction of the butanol phase with water (19Krakow J.L. Hereld D. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12147-12153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were then subjected to strong acid hydrolysis (23Conzelmann A. Fankhauser C. Puoti A. Desponds C. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or treated with PI-PLC for 16 h (24Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7215-7224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treatments, lipids were desalted with partitioning betweenn-butyl alcohol and water. GPI peptides were purified from 15A 600 of cells and treated with PI-PLC (0.05 units) as described (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Reggiori, F., Canivenc-Gansel, E., and Conzelmann, A. (1998)Methods Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). GPI-PLD treatment was performed by resuspending the GPI peptides in 100 μl of PI-PLD buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 4.5, 10 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 20% propanol) and adding 0.5 units of GPI-PLD (17Reggiori, F., Canivenc-Gansel, E., and Conzelmann, A. (1998)Methods Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. P-Cer obtained by GPI-PLD was dephosphorylated to Cer by alkaline phosphatase treatment (17Reggiori, F., Canivenc-Gansel, E., and Conzelmann, A. (1998)Methods Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Previous studies have revealed that the Cer moieties introduced into GPI anchors by remodeling are not representative of the cell-free Cers. In particular, if secretion is blocked in sec18, the prevalent PHS-C26OH is used to make IPC/C, whereas cells incorporate into GPI anchors a more hydrophobic, PHS-containing lipid, probably PHS-C26 (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Since both of these reactions occur in the ER, this discrepancy made us suspicious that the remodelases may draw on Cers present in form of Cer-P or else on IPCs. To evaluate the possibility of Cer-P being the substrate for remodeling reactions, we set out to see if cells contain a pool of free Cer-P. Standards were prepared from [3H]DHS-labeled GPI proteins using phospholipases. PI-PLC treatment of anchor peptides generated Cers α, β, and γ corresponding to DHS-C26, PHS-C26, and PHS-C26OH (Fig. 2, lane 2), the γCer only being found on GPI proteins having reached the Golgi (6Sipos G. Reggiori F. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3494-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). GPI-PLD treatment of anchor peptides generated three more polar lipids representing phosphorylated forms of Cers α, β, and γ (Fig. 2,lane 7). They were resistant to mild alkaline hydrolysis and could be converted to Cers α, β, and γ by phosphatase treatment (not shown). Lipid extracts from wild type or heat-shockedsec18 cells did contain lipids migrating close to these Cer-P standards, but they were not resistant to alkaline hydrolysis and hence are not Cer-Ps (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6). In particular, after mild base hydrolysis, the region corresponding to βCer-P, which is derived from the most abundant anchor species, was completely empty. Any isolated band containing >0.03% of the radioactivity spotted in each lane (5 μCi/1 cm) is detected by the radioscanner. In comparison, the free Cer (PHS-C26OH) comigrating with γCer accounts for 7.8% (wt) and 16.8% (sec18) of the total lipid extract. Thus, Cer-P, if present at all, is at least 260- or 560-fold less abundant than the Cer PHS-C26OH. This makes it rather unlikely that free Cer-Ps would serve as substrates for GPI remodeling reactions. We also wanted to rule out the possibility that in a first step free [3H]DHS or [3H]PHS is introduced into GPI anchors, in exchange for diacylglycerol, and that the long chain base is N-acylated only subsequently. For this we used australifungin, a recently described antifungal drug that blocks the sphinganineN-acyltransferase thus blocking the conversion of DHS to Cer (25Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. Pelaez F. Harris G.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). When present at 0.5 μg/ml, australifungin completely blocked the incorporation of [3H]DHS into Cer and IPCs as expected. At the same time it also completely abrogated incorporation of [3H]DHS into GPI proteins (not shown). This argues in favor of the idea that [3H]DHS has first to be converted to [3H]Cer before being incorporated into GPI anchors. Aureobasidin A is a potent inhibitor of the IPC synthase Aur1p, an essential enzyme transferring Ins-P from PI to Cer, thus forming IPC (15Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The main toxicity of AbA is due to its effect on Aur1p since point mutations in AUR1 render cells resistant to AbA (15Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26Hashida-Okado T. Ogawa A. Endo M. Yasumoto R. Takesako K. Kato I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of Aur1p has not been reported, but it is believed to reside in the ER since in temperature-sensitive COPII mutants the main IPC (IPC/C) continues to be made when the vesicular traffic from ER to Golgi is blocked, whereas mannosylation of IPC/C to MIPC in the Golgi is blocked indicating that IPC is neither transported to the Golgi nor synthesized in the Golgi under these conditions (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To monitor the effect of AbA on the remodeling of GPI anchors, we labeled cells with [3H]Ins and [3H]DHS which both can be used to selectively label GPI proteins. AbA did not affect the incorporation of [3H]Ins and [3H]DHS into proteins (Fig. 3) at a concentration at which incorporation into sphingolipids was completely blocked (not shown). We found that for a complete inhibition of IPC biosynthesis, it was necessary to have 0.2 μg/ml (= 0.17 μm) AbA in the labeling medium, the same concentration as is required to achieve complete growth arrest. These experiments indicate that GPI remodeling can occur in the absence of IPC biosynthesis and argue against the possibility that [3H]DHS is first incorporated into IPC in order to become integrated into a GPI anchor. We wanted to know if both, ER and Golgi remodelase activities are independent of AUR1, and we therefore tested AbA in the previously established experimental settings in which only ER or only Golgi activity is assayed (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ER activity can be measured in the secretion mutant sec18, which at 37 °C effectively blocks incorporation of [3H]DHS into mature-sized GPI proteins in the Golgi. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, at a concentration of AbA which completely blocks the biosynthesis of IPCs and of M(IP)2C, the incorporation of [3H]DHS into immature GPI proteins is somewhat reduced but so is the incorporation of [3H]Ins, the latter being a reflection of the rates of GPI protein synthesis and turnover but not remodeling. The result suggests that AbA has no effect on the efficiency of remodeling of GPI proteins in the ER. The conditions used in Fig. 4 A do not exclude the possibility that some of the remodeling activity is due to newly made Golgi remodelase in transit to the Golgi, which was trapped in the ER by the secretion block. To eliminate this possibility we used another preincubation protocol allowing us to specifically measure the autochthonous ER remodelase activity as detailed in Fig. 4 B. Fig. 4 B shows that under these conditions the incorporation of [3H]DHS into proteins is not reduced by AbA, whereas incorporation of [3H]DHS into IPC/B, IPC/C, IPC/D, and M(IP)2C is completely blocked. The incorporation of [3H]DHS into IPC/D and M(IP)2C is blocked even in the absence of AbA as a result of the secretion block, as mentioned above (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of AbA on the Golgi remodelase, cells were pretreated with Chx, allowing GPI proteins to be exported out of the ER before the label was added (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, with this protocol, AbA diminishes the labeling of mature-sized proteins with [3H]DHS somewhat, whereas the biosynthesis of sphingolipids is completely blocked. Thus, both ER and Golgi remodelases are able to incorporate [3H]DHS even if IPC biosynthesis is completely blocked. Cers of GPI proteins seem to get exchanged for Cers (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but this conservative lipid exchange does not seem to occur on sphingolipids since no labeling of IPC, MIPC, or M(IP)2C is observed in wt cells in the presence of AbA. This, however, does not rule out the possibility of such an exchange being mediated by Aur1p. Cer has been found to be toxic to cells, and its toxicity was considered to be the reason for the lack of success in early attempts to generate mutants in IPC biosynthesis (15Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 27Nickels J.T. Broach J.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results document, however, that AbA does not compromise the synthesis of GPI proteins nor their remodeling for the duration of the experiment (3 h), although it can be expected that the endogenously produced Cer reaches very high levels under these conditions (15Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the accumulation of [3H]PHS-C26OH does not reflect the increase in cold Cer. In the presence of AbA, [3H]PHS-C26OH reaches only about 3-fold higher levels than in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3). This elevation is moderate since even in the absence of AbA no more than 20–25% of [3H]DHS added to cells gets incorporated into sphingolipids, whereas the rest is degraded and incorporated into other types of phospholipids. Collectively the results described so far support the idea that newly synthesized Cer is the substrate for the remodeling of GPI anchors in yeast and that the remodelases exchange DAG for Cer. This type of transesterification reaction is analogous to the biosynthesis of IPC by Aur1p, an enzyme replacing the DAG moiety of PI by a Cer. The following experiments were performed to see if Aur1p is the remodelase of GPI anchors. (i) As shown in Fig. 6, AbA does not interfere with GPI remodeling even at elevated concentrations (10 μg/ml). (ii) When cells were incubated with chemically acylated [3H]DHS (N-acetylated orN-hexanoylated), we did not find any incorporation of these short chain Cers into GPI proteins although they were efficiently incorporated into IPC and M(IP)2C (Fig. 7, A and B; not shown). Even when purifying large amounts of glycoproteins over concanavalin A-Sepharose and preparing anchor peptides in the same way as done in Fig. 9 C, we could not find any traces of radioactivity in anchor peptides from DHS-C2- or DHS-C6-labeled cells. (iii) As mentioned, if secretion is blocked in sec18, Aur1p uses the prevalent PHS-C26OH to make IPC/C, whereas cells incorporate into GPI anchors a more hydrophobic, PHS-containing lipid, probably PHS-C26 (9Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the remodelase has a different substrate specificity than Aur1p. We also tested if theAUR1 homologue IPT1 is involved in Golgi remodeling. IPT1 has been shown to be necessary for the transfer of inositol phosphate from PI onto MIPC in order to make M(IP)2C, a reaction that is supposed to occur in the Golgi (13Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Wells G.B. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29620-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We find that the deletion of IPT1 has no influence on Golgi remodelase (Fig. 7 D) and also has no effect on the incorporation of [3H]DHS into proteins when all remodelases are measured simultaneously (not shown). Recently it was found that exogenous [3H]DHS is first phosphorylated and subsequently dephosphorylated again before being incorporated into sphingolipids (30Qie L. Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A.

The sequences of four peptides derived from the purified protein matched portions of an expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence, and the EST clone was used to obtain cDNA clones encoding the pp37 protein, which shares sequence similarity with the PST PIP (proline, serine,threonine phosphatase interactingprotein)/CDC15 family of protein-tyrosine phosphatase substrates. pp37 is predicted to contain a Fes/CIP4 homology (FCH) domain and an actin-binding domain-like sequence. It is expressed selectively in macrophages, macrophage cell lines, and at low levels in macrophage-containing tissues. pp37 is predominantly found in the cytosol, where it is associated with actin. However, ∼4% resides in the membrane fraction, and the trace amount in the cytoskeletal fraction is increased by CSF-1 stimulation.

Absence of HVDAC1 in skeletal muscle of a child with a severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (13Huizing M. Ruitenbeek W. Thinnes F. DePinto V. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggests that VDACs have an important regulatory role in energy metabolism. To date, three mouse VDAC isoforms have been isolated (9Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Davison D.B. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,12Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). VDAC3 has 65–70% amino acid similarity to the other two murine VDAC isoforms. Unlike VDAC1 and VDAC2, VDAC3 is able to only partially complement a temperature-sensitive YVDAC-deficient yeast strain when grown on glycerol-based media (14Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), suggesting that this isoform may have distinct physiological functions. In this report a new VDAC3 isoform with a single amino acid insertion is described. It appears to arise by tissue-specific alternative splicing of a 3-base exon. Using a YVDAC-deficient yeast strain, functional differences between the two VDAC3 isoforms have been investigated. There is no evidence for targeting by either isoform to sites other than mitochondria. Mouse brain and testes cDNA libraries were screened with the VDAC3 3′-untranslated region (from nucleotide 1022–1428). A number of VDAC3 cDNAs isolated from each library were sequenced using an ABI model 373A automated DNA sequencer. The DNA sequence was analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis package (15Devereux J. Wisconsin Package Program Manual. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar). A genomic fragment containing VDAC3 intron 3 was isolated from a Lambda Fix II phage clone (14Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and similarly sequenced. Total RNA was extracted from various adult mouse tissues using guanidinium isothiocyanate, as described (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). After treatment with RNase-free DNase, 5 μg of RNA from each tissue was used to generate reverse transcribed cDNAs (Superscript RT II first-strand cDNA synthesis kit; Life Technologies, Inc.). A pair of oligonucleotides (sense primer, 5′-GGCATGGTCAAGATAGATCTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTATA AGCATGACCTGAAGTAG-3′; 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, 35 cycles) flanking the insertion site was designed to amplify a 74- or 77-bp product, depending on the presence or absence of the ATG codon. The sense oligonucleotide was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Life Science) and [γ-32P]ATP. A 1:20 dilution of labeled to unlabeled oligonucleotide was used for PCR. The products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and the gel exposed to x-ray film. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to create anAflIII site at the VDAC3 start codon and aNsiI site in the VDAC3 3′-untranslated region. This approach allows the complete open reading frame of the VDAC3 cDNA to precisely replace the YVDAC gene previously cloned into the yeast single-copy shuttle vector PSCY58 (provided by M. Forte, Oregon Health Sciences University; Ref. 17Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were used to amplify a VDAC3 cDNA fragment with the ATG insertion (using a mouse brain cDNA as template), and the product used to replace theYVDAC gene between the NcoI and NsiI sites. From the most 5′ ATG codon, the length of the VDAC3 cDNA is 1017 bp. An oligonucleotide was also designed to generate anNcoI site at the ATG insertion sequence 117 bp into theVDAC3 coding sequence, and a truncated VDAC3 PCR fragment was amplified using this oligonucleotide in conjunction with the previous 3′-untranslated oligonucleotide. The truncated cDNA was digested with the restriction enzymes and subcloned as before. This same strategy was also used to design oligonucleotides in which the inserted ATG codon was mutated to encode alternative amino acid codons that are frequently (except for CCG (proline)) used in yeast (18Zhang S. Zubay G. Goldman E. Gene (Amst .). 1991; 105: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with BglII (which cuts within the 117-bp region) and NsiI and the resulting fragment subcloned into the VDAC3 expression construct, replacing 917 bp of VDAC3 coding sequence. The following amino acid substitutions were generated: histidine (CAC), leucine (CTA), alanine (GCA), proline (CCG), and glutamic acid (GAA). The VDAC3constructs were then introduced into the VDAC-deficient yeast strain M22-2 by lithium-acetate transformation (19Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Growth was examined by serial dilution of a liquid culture and plating onto glycerol-based medium, followed by incubation at 30 or 37 °C for 6 days. Protein sizes were determined using a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag attached to the carboxyl-terminal end of each isoform. The HA tag was introduced by oligonucleotide PCR mutagenesis using the primer (5′-GAACCAATGCATCTAAGCATAGTCTGGCACATCGTAGGGATACATAGCCTCCAGTTCAAATCCCA-3′) in conjunction with the above described cDNAs as templates. Following transformation of yeast, mitochondrial fractions were prepared by the method of Daum et al. (20Daum G. Bohni P. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Western blotting performed as described by Thomas et al. (21Thomas N. Jones C. Thomas P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by a HA-specific monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). VDAC2 promoter activity was previously localized to a 1014-bpEcoRI/PvuII fragment (14Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A 1.3-kbEcoRI/NcoI genomic fragment was isolated that contains the promoter region as well as the two 5′-untranslated VDAC2 exons. The NcoI site is located at the translation start codon in the second exon of the VDAC2 gene. The following DNA fragments were subcloned in a three fragment ligation between the VDAC2 promoter and a ClaI/NotI 250-bp bovine polyadenylation fragment in a pBluescript KS(−) vector: anAflIII/BglII 92-bp 5′ VDAC3 cDNA fragment, aBglII/BsaI genomic fragment containing the second part of exon 3, all of intron 3, and the first part of exon 4, and aBsaI/ClaI 3′ VDAC3 cDNA coding and 3′-untranslated fragment. A carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was placed onto the end of each VDAC3 isoform and the truncated version by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the 5′ primer 5′-GAACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGCCTCCAGTTCAAATCCCA-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript, digested withApaI and SpeI, and subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pCDM-SRα. Following transfection of NIH3T3 fibroblasts or the C2C12 mouse myocytic cell line with Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), cells were incubated with Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc.), fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-FLAG IgG and anti-IgG/fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for coincidental staining. VDAC3 cDNAs were previously cloned from a mouse liver cDNA library (9Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Davison D.B. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To investigate whether additional VDAC isoforms are present in other mouse tissues, brain and testes cDNA libraries were screened using the 3′-untranslated regions of all three mouse VDAC isoforms. Two VDAC3 cDNAs isolated from a brain cDNA library were completely sequenced and an in-frame ATG insertion was found 117 bp into the coding sequence. Finding the insertion in two distinct cDNAs and subsequently in different mouse and human expressed sequence-tagged cDNAs makes it highly unlikely the insertion is a cloning artifact. The human orthologue of mouseVDAC3, although unreported, can be found in a number of expressed sequence-tagged cDNA sequences. The sequence of human VDAC3 cDNAs without the ATG insertion has been deposited from the Soares pregnant uterus NbHPU, Stratagene hNT neuron, and fetal heart cDNA libraries (accession numbers AA133349, AA206747, and N86098, respectively). The human VDAC3 cDNAs have greater than 90% sequence homology with the murine VDAC3 isoform. In addition, human VDAC3 cDNAs with the ATG insertion have been deposited from the Stratagene hNT neuron, Stratagene muscle, infant brain, and fetal heart cDNA libraries (accession numbers AA214443, AA180978,AA350849, and N89234, respectively). In contrast to the report of Haet al. (22Ha H. Hajek P. Bedwell D.M. Burrows P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12143-12149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found different isoforms of the humanVDAC2 gene, this was the only example of VDAC alternative splicing found in the course of our studies in the mouse.VDAC3 cDNAs were also isolated and sequenced from a mouse testes cDNA library, and these all lacked the ATG insertion. The VDAC3 isoform with the ATG insertion is expressed in only three of the tissues examined: brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). Brain and skeletal muscle clearly express both isoforms, whereas the smaller isoform was only detected at very low levels by RT-PCR from heart RNA. A variety of additional tissues were also examined for expression of the larger VDAC3 isoform, including testes, liver, ovary, adrenal, lung, spleen, and kidney; all only expressed the VDAC3 isoform without the ATG insertion (data not shown). The ATG insertion occurs at the VDAC3 exon 3 and exon 4 splice junction (14Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The 3.8-kb intron 3 separating the two exons was isolated from a genomic phage clone and sequenced. An ATG sequence flanked by consensus splice acceptor and donor sites was found 1.9 kb 3′ of exon 3 (Fig. 2). Downstream of the putative exon are located guanine-rich splice enhancer elements that have been reported to be necessary for the splicing of very small exons (23Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Of course, given the small size, it is possible that the sequence occurs at this location by chance, but the simultaneous presence of the splice enhancer sequences makes this less likely. To test whether these sequences are sufficient for alternative splicing, a VDAC3 expression plasmid was generated with the coding region of VDAC3 cDNA flanking intron 3. The VDAC2promoter, which generates high levels of transcription in tissue culture (14Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was placed 5′ of the VDAC3 sequences to direct mRNA synthesis. A VDAC2-specific oligonucleotide derived from the 5′-untranslated region sequence, when used in conjunction with a VDAC3-specific 3′ primer, allows for the amplification of the hybrid transcript. This strategy (outlined in Fig. 3) avoids problems with contamination by the endogenous VDAC3 transcript or from genomic DNA that can give rise to spurious bands due to amplification of processed pseudogenes of VDAC3. The plasmid was transfected into NIH3T3 cells and a mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 and the presence of the ATG determined by DNA sequencing of the RT-PCR product. Although splicing of the transcript between exons 3 and 4 occurred appropriately, the ATG was not detected in the RT-PCR product (data not shown). Primary cultures of chick myoblasts were then used for transfection and the RT-PCR assay carried out 2 days later. Although this system is capable of splicing the VDAC3 transcript to the predicted 251-bp fragment, no cDNAs that had incorporated the ATG into the transcript were detected by DNA sequencing. This may be because the plasmid lacks essential regions of the gene necessary for splicing, the chick cells fail to recognize the mouse signals for the small exon, or the insertion of the ATG involves RNA editing and not alternative splicing. This latter explanation seems less plausible given the presence of the predicted sequences within intron 3. To determine if any functional differences can be detected between the two VDAC3 isoforms when expressed in YVDAC-deficient yeast, the two isoforms were expressed behind the promoter for the endogenousYVDAC gene on a single copy plasmid. The two isoforms are indistinguishable in their ability to stimulate growth, each leading to only partial complementation of growth at 37 °C (Fig. 4 A). Since the insertion encodes a potential start codon and is in-frame, it is possible that the ATG insertion acts as a new translation start site for VDAC3 protein synthesis. To determine whether the downstream ATG is used as a new start site in yeast, an epitope tag was placed on the carboxyl-terminal end of the proteins and protein size examined by Western blotting with an antibody specific to the epitope tag. No difference in the molecular size between the two isoforms was observed (Fig. 4 B), indicating that in yeast the inserted ATG is not used for translation initiation. A second construct using the inserted ATG as the obligatory start codon was generated and transfected into the YVDAC-deficient strain. Unlike the full-length VDAC3 constructs, this truncated construct was able to fully rescue the yeast temperature-sensitive growth deficiency (Fig. 4 A). To determine if substitution of the ATG codon with other amino acids affects the ability of VDAC3 to rescue theYVDAC-deficient yeast phenotype, the codon was mutated in the full-length VDAC3 cDNA to that for histidine, leucine, alanine, proline, or glutamic acid. The six mutated constructs exhibited quite variable abilities to complement YVDAC deficiency, with the charged residues histidine and glutamic acid and the small amino acid proline conferring growth comparable to the wild-type yeast strain (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that, in yeast, position 39 plays a significant role in the function of the VDAC3 protein and that levels of protein expression cannot be the sole effect of these amino acid substitutions. In addition, the ability to fully complement the growth deficiency indicates that the amino-terminal region of the protein per se does not inhibit growth, but rather the identity of the 39th amino acid is crucial to the growth phenotype. Since the mitochondrial location of VDAC3 has not previously been demonstrated and it has been reported that VDACs localize to non-mitochondrial sites (24Shoshan-Barmatz V. Hadad N. Feng W. Shafir I. Orr I. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Jurgens L. Kleineke J. Brdiczka D. Thinnes F.P. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1995; 376: 685-689PubMed Google Scholar), we examined its subcellular location using the full-length cDNA with and without the extra ATG. Each isoform was transfected into mouse fibroblasts and C2C12 cells and tested for co-localization with a mitochondria-specific dye (Fig. 5). The VDAC3 protein localizes exclusively to mitochondria and addition of the ATG fails to alter the subcellular location. These results demonstrate that the extra methionine has no effect on membrane targeting. To ensure that location is unaltered if indeed translation initiates at the inserted ATG, the truncated form of the protein was similarly tested for mitochondrial co-localization and the same result obtained. This further implies that the mouse VDAC3 mitochondrial targeting signal is not located at the amino-terminal end of the protein. The discovery of an alternative VDAC3 suggests the existence of an unusual splicing mechanism. Analysis of mouse genomic DNA by PCR demonstrates that the ATG insertion is not encoded by a VDAC3-like intronless gene. Two VDAC3-like intronless genes have been identified in the mouse (14Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). One is an obvious pseudogene while the other has a complete open reading frame, but neither contains the ATG insertion. Although the use of a 3-bp exon is quite unusual it is not unique. Santoni et al. (26Santoni M.J. Barthels D. Vopper G. Boned A. Goridis C. Wille W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) suggested that the alternatively spliced AAG trinucleotide found in the mouse NCAM gene is also encoded by a 3-bp exon. The AAG trinucleotide (flanked by splice acceptor and donor consensus sequences) is located in the intronic region between the exon splice junction site where the insertion occurs. The sequences of the putative NCAM and VDAC3 3-bp exons are similar in several respects. Both are surrounded by conventional AG … GT dinucleotides, although the acceptor splice site of both exons do not conform well to the consensus sequence (27Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). The hierarchy of acceptor splice sites is CAG = TAG > AAG ≫ GAG in vivo and in vitro (28Andreadis A. Broderick J.A. Kosik K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3585-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both the NCAM and VDAC3 proposed small exons have a CAG at the splice acceptor site; however, the classical pyrimidine stretch is not found adjacent to the AG dinucleotide. In contrast, the donor splice sites conform closely with the consensus sequence (26Santoni M.J. Barthels D. Vopper G. Boned A. Goridis C. Wille W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These similarities, as well as the fact that the alternatively spliced trinucleotides of both genes are found in the brain, suggest that similar mechanisms may be used in the splicing of these very small exons. The average vertebrate exon is 137 bp and is separated by introns that are typically considerably larger (29Hawkins J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9893-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Splice acceptor and donor consensus sequences are relatively short and poorly conserved (30Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 31Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-347Google Scholar). The splicing machinery is able to overcome this disadvantage by requiring an interaction between 5′ and 3′ splice sites and the factors that recognize them for the proper regulation of spliceosome assembly (32Guthrie C. Science. 1991; 253: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 33Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 79-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 34Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Because of this it has also been assumed that a minimal separation, and therefore exon size, would be required to prevent steric hindrance among the splicing machinery proteins. Dominski and Kole (35Dominski Z. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) demonstrated that when a constitutively recognized internal exon is reduced to less than 50 nucleotides it is skipped by the splicing machinery. Exon skipping can be corrected by increasing the strength of the splice sites, suggesting that splice sites are additive factors in exon recognition (36Dominski Z. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A number of small exons have been studied and the surrounding intronic sequences analyzed. These studies suggest that small exons require for inclusion special enhancing sequences found in the neighboring introns outside of the strong splice sites (37Black D.L. Cell. 1992; 69: 795-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 38Sterner D.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2677-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that these enhancers function as binding sites for splicing factors, thereby artificially extending the exon domain during exon recognition (23Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). In the region downstream of the VDAC3 exon are multiple splice enhancer sequences previously associated with small exons (39Carlo T. Sterner D.A. Berget S.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 342-353PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences may play a role in aiding the recognition of the exon in a tissue-specific manner. Although the in vivo role of the alternatively spliced VDAC3 isoform remains unknown, its biological importance is presumably reflected in its conservation in human cDNAs. In addition to the cDNAs reported here, there are a number of mouse expressed sequence-tagged cDNAs that contain the ATG, and all have been cloned from cDNA libraries generated from brain, muscle, or heart tissues. Human VDAC3 isoforms that contain the ATG were identified in expressed sequence-tagged cDNAs isolated from a human fetal heart cDNA library, consistent with both the tissue specificity and its occurrence during development. Both mouse VDAC3 isoforms are able to partially rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the yeast, indicating that in yeast the proteins appear to act similarly. In mammalian cells, the VDAC3 ATG insertion may cause a subtle change in the conformation of the protein in the mitochondrial membrane, perhaps altering channel permeability. Alternatively, the methionine insertion may allow the channel to differentially interact with a specific kinase, metabolite, or other protein. Based upon the proposed models of the yeast and human VDAC protein, the methionine is located in an extramembranous region facing the intermembrane space of mitochondria (40Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S.Z. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 41De Pinto V.D. Palmieri F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This location suggests the amino acid may regulate VDAC3 protein interactions rather than channel selectivity. However, these models may be of limited accuracy and conformational effects of the methionine cannot be excluded. Another hypothesis is that the ATG insertion acts as an alternative translation initiation site, generating a truncated VDAC3 protein. TheVDAC3 start codon (GTTGTAGCTATGT) does not match the Kozak consensus sequence well (GCCGCCPurCCATGPur; Ref.42Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar), and the Kozak sequence generated by the ATG insertion is somewhat better (AGTGGAGTGATGG). Yet, in yeast translation continues to initiate at the proximal ATG, and in preliminary experiments using a VDAC3-specific antibody we only detect the full-length protein in mitochondrial preparations from the appropriate tissues. 2W. K. Decker and W. J. Craigen, unpublished data. A truncated version of the VDAC3 cDNA was also expressed in yeast and found to fully complement the YVDAC-deficient temperature-sensitive phenotype. This result was unexpected given that the full-length VDAC3 cDNAs are only able to partially rescue the phenotype. Because the amino terminus of VDAC has been proposed to regulate the conductive state of the protein (40Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S.Z. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), deletion of this region may generate a VDAC protein that is constitutively open. Alternatively, the amount of the truncated protein may effect growth and may vary despite the use of identical transcription control elements. Although the level of expression of the truncated protein is qualitatively higher, this is an unsatisfactory answer in that substitution of different amino acids can similarly enhance growth despite the continued presence of the 39 amino-terminal residues. These results suggest it is more likely a conformational change in the protein that improves growth, whether through altered channel characteristics, protein-protein interactions, or outer membrane permeability. Electrophysiologic studies of the two forms of VDAC3 have been carried out following purification from yeast mitochondria and fail to demonstrate any significant difference in ion selectivity or conductance characteristics. 3Xu, X., Sampson, M. J., Craigen, W. J., and Colombini, M., submitted for publication. In summary, we describe an unusual protein isoform that differs from the more widely expressed protein by only a single amino acid, and this variant appears to be the product of tissue-specific alternative splicing. The functional significance of this splice event remains obscure but does not involve altered translation initiation or subcellular localization. We thank Dr. Tom Cooper for help with the RNA splicing experiments and Dr. Marco Colombini for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2159424962,"Zinc fingers are recognized as small protein domains that bind to specific DNA sequences. Recently however, zinc fingers from a number of proteins, in particular the GATA family of transcription factors, have also been implicated in specific protein-protein interactions. The erythroid protein GATA-1 contains two zinc fingers: the C-finger, which is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA-binding, and the N-finger, which appears both to modulate DNA-binding and to interact with other transcription factors. We have expressed and purified the N-finger domain and investigated its involvement in the self-association of GATA-1. We demonstrate that this domain does not homodimerize but instead makes intermolecular contacts with the C-finger, suggesting that GATA dimers are maintained by reciprocal N-finger–C-finger contacts. Deletion analysis identifies a 25-residue region, C-terminal to the core N-finger domain, that is sufficient for interaction with intact GATA-1. A similar subdomain exists C-terminal to the C-finger, and we show that self-association is substantially reduced when both subdomains are disrupted by mutation. Moreover, mutations that impair GATA-1 self-association also interfere with its ability to activate transcription in transfection studies.

N-terminal finger C-terminal finger high pressure liquid chromatography tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine glutathioneS-transferase. The transcription factor GATA-1 recognizes WGATAR motifs (where W represents A/T and R represents A/G), which are found in the control regions of the vast majority of erythroid genes (for reviews see Refs.1Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar and 2Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In particular, GATA-1 binds to elements within both the promoters and the locus control regions of the α- and β-globin-like genes, and it has been proposed that it may be involved in communication between these distant enhancer-like elements and the globin promoters (3Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Grosveld F. Dillon N. Higgs D. Baillieres Clin.

The biological importance of GATA-1 has been demonstrated by knockout experiments in mice, which showed that it is strictly required for erythroid cell development (6Fujiwara Y. Browne C.P.

Other members of the GATA family, such as GATA-2 and -3, also play essential roles in the hematopoietic system (8Pandolfi P.P. Roth M.E. Karis A. Leonard M.W. Dzierzk E. Grosveld F.G. Engel J.D.

Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), and more distantly related members are important in other tissues and in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals (Ref. 11Rehorn K.-P. Thelen H. Michelson A.M. Reuter R. Development. 1996; 122: 4023-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The GATA-1 protein contains two adjacent zinc finger domains, encoded by successive exons (12Tsai S.F. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 13Tsai S.-F. Strauss E. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We refer to these fingers as the N-terminal finger, or N-finger (NF)1 and the C-terminal finger, or C-finger (CF), according to their relative positions in the protein. The two domains each contain four cysteines and are about 50% identical in amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). The CF, together with a C-terminal extension (encoded in the next exon), has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the recognition of WGATAR motifs (15Martin D.I.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar,16Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Apella A. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast, the exact role of the NF has proved more difficult to define. Early studies, focusing on GATA-1's ability to transactivate promoters in nonerythroid cells, indicated that the NF was not essential (15Martin D.I.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, more physiologically relevant experiments investigating GATA-1's ability to induce erythroid maturation have revealed a critical role for this finger (17Weiss M.J., Yu, C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). While the NF of GATA-1 cannot bind DNA in isolation (unlike the NFs of GATA-2 and -3; Ref. 18Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it does play a role in DNA binding. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the NF increases the stability of GATA-1-DNA complexes (15Martin D.I.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), influences the specificity of binding (19Whyatt D.J. de Boer E. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4993-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and is instrumental in the recognition of double WGATAR motifs, which occur in a number of important erythroid promoters (including GATA-1's own promoter) (20Yang H.-Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The GATA double zinc finger domain is also implicated in specific protein-protein interactions; it has been shown to mediate the formation of complexes with Fog (22Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y., Yu, C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), Sp1, and EKLF (23Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and is implicated in GATA self-association (24Calligaris R. Bottardi S. Cogoi S. Apezteguia I. Santoro C. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1353-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Crossley M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3096-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is known that only the NF (and not the CF) is required for formation of the complex with Fog, whereas in the cases of Sp1, EKLF, and the self-association of GATA-1, both the NF and the CF are implicated. It is also likely that the NF plays a role in GATA-1's interaction with the LIM domain protein RBTN2/LMO2 (29Osada H. Grutz G. Axelson H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), although in this case the specific contributions of the NF and the CF have not been delineated. The structure of the CF bound to DNA has been determined using NMR spectroscopy (16Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Apella A. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), but relatively little is known about the NF. In the present work, we have expressed and purified the NF domain, characterized its metal-dependent folding properties, and investigated its role in GATA-1 self-association. We show that it does not homodimerize in isolation but instead mediates GATA-1 self-association by interacting with the CF. We identify a minimal 25-amino acid subdomain that is able to interact with intact GATA-1. This subdomain, which we refer to as the NF-tail, lies immediately downstream of the core zinc-binding region of the NF and contains an Asn-Arg-Pro-Leu motif followed by a short basic stretch. An analogous subdomain is contained in the CF and has previously been implicated in GATA-1 homodimerization (26Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We show that when either subdomain is disrupted by mutation, the self-association is reduced. We have also tested the effect of these mutations on the ability of GATA-1 to activate transcription from single GATA and multi-GATA site promoters. In both cases, mutations that interfere with self-association reduce the ability of GATA-1 to activate transcription, but the effect is more dramatic on multi-GATA site promoters. These results suggest that the ability of GATA factors to self-associate may play an important role in the regulation of genes containing multiple GATA sites. The region encompassing exon 4 of murine GATA-1 (nucleotides 656–843, GenBankTMX15763) and encoding the entire NF domain (NF200–254) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers MC287 (CGTGGATCCGAGGCCAGAGAGTGTGTGA) and MC288 (CAGGAATTCATGCCCGTTTGCTGACAATCA). The resulting fragment was cut withBamHI and EcoRI and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), thereby creating in frame fusions with the glutathione S-transferase gene. C-terminal truncation mutants NF200–248 and NF200–243 were similarly constructed with the primers MC287 and A17 (CAGGAATTCACATTCGCTTCTTGGGCCGGA) or A18 (CAGGAATTCACCGGATGAGAGGCCGGTTCT), respectively. The N-terminal truncation mutants NF224–254, NF224–248, and NF224–243 were likewise constructed using the 5′-primer A82 (CGGGATCCCTGTGCAATGCCTGTGGCT) and MC288, A17, or A18, respectively. Mutation of Cys204 to Ala was achieved by amplification with primers A10 (CGTGGATCCGCCATGGAGGCCAGAGAGGCTGTGAAC) and MC288. Pro213→ Thr was generated by overlap polymerase chain reaction. The two initial reactions used MC287 and A21 (CCGCCACAGTGTAGTAGCCGTTGC) and A20 (GCAACGGCTACTACACTGTGGCGG) and MC288. The specific bands were purified, and a second polymerase chain reaction was carried out with primers MC287 and MC288. Sequencing was carried out to verify the mutagenesis. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria were transformed with the recombinant plasmid and propagated in order to produce recombinant material. Typically, 4 liters of culture were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of around 0.6, at which time expression of the GST-NF fusion proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 3–5 h of incubation, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with a buffer containing protease inhibitors, and then frozen at −80 °C. For the NF200–248 used in the biophysical studies, the following purification protocol was carried out. The cell pellet was thawed, sonicated (2–4 × 30-s bursts), and centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min), and the soluble fraction was retained. This fraction was passed down 4 × 10-ml glutathione-agarose columns. The columns were washed, and then the fusion protein was released from the columns by the addition of thrombin (100 units) to each column. The eluate was collected and lyophilized. It was then resuspended in water and subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a semipreparative Vydac C18 column. The major absorbance peaks (A 280) were collected, and samples were then identified using positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. In addition to the expected signal (M obs = 5,832 ± 1 Da, M calc = 5,831.8 Da), a second signal (∼5% of total peptide) was occasionally observed withM obs = 5,416 ± 1 Da. This corresponds to a peptide truncated after Lys245(M calc = 5416.3 Da), generated by secondary thrombin digestion. It is clear from two-dimensional NMR studies 2J. P. Mackay and M. Crossley, unpublished results. that this truncation has no effect on the biophysical behavior of the NF200–248 monomer, and the peptide was therefore not further purified. All peptides prepared by thrombin cleavage have an additional Gly-Ser dipeptide at the N terminus, derived from the thrombin cleavage site in pGEX-2T. Full-length recombinant GATA-1 was expressed from the bacterial expression vector pET3a/GATA-1 in BL21 bacteria (30Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) or in COS cells as described previously (26Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm quartz cuvette. NF200–248 (25 μm) was dissolved in a buffer containing Tris (10 mm) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 250 μm) at pH 8.0. ZnCl2 or CoCl2 were made up in water at a concentration of 20 mm. CD spectra of NF200–248 (190–260 nm) were recorded following the addition of successive 5-μm aliquots of Zn2+ or Co2+. The final spectrum in each case is the sum of five separate spectra with a step size of 0.5 nm, a 1-s response time, and a 1-nm bandwidth. Data were acquired at 20 °C and were base line-corrected by subtraction of the Tris/TCEP buffer. Samples of NF200–248 and Co2+ were prepared as for CD spectropolarimetry. UV and visible absorption spectra (250–500 nm and 500–800 nm, respectively) were recorded on a Cary 3 double-beam spectrophotometer using 1-cm cells. Co2+ was titrated into both the sample cell and the reference cell (the latter containing the Tris/TCEP buffer only) in 5-μm aliquots. Data were recorded at a speed of 100 nm min−1 with a signal averaging time of 0.1 s. The self-association of NF200–248 was investigated by sedimentation equilibrium methods on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Experiments were carried out at loading concentrations of 96, 32, and 9.6 μm, using a An-60ti rotor spinning at 42,000, 52,000, or 56,000 rpm and at a temperature of 20 °C. NF200–248 samples were made up as solutions in 10 mm Tris, 2 mm TCEP, and 1.1 molar equivalents of ZnCl2; the pH was held initially at 8.5 for the addition of the Zn2+ and then reduced to 5.3. A CD spectrum of the sample was recorded prior to the sedimentation equilibrium experiment to ensure that the peptide was folded; this spectrum was identical to that shown in Fig. 2 A(dotted line). Sedimentation equilibrium data were collected in a double sector cell as absorbance versusradius scans (0.001-cm increments). Scans were collected at 4-h intervals and compared to ensure that the sample reached equilibrium. Analysis of the data was carried out using the NONLIN software (31Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), and the final parameters were determined by a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to a model incorporating a single, nonassociating species. The goodness of fit was determined by examination of the residuals derived from the fit. The partial specific volume of NF200–248 (0.726 ml g−1) was determined from the amino acid sequence (32Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and the solvent density was taken to be 1.00 g ml−1. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer at 15 °C and consisted of 64 scans collected as 8192 data points over a spectral width of 7200 Hz. Suppression of the water resonance was carried out using presaturation during the relaxation delay between scans. NF200–248 (2.7 mg) was dissolved in H2O/D2O (95:5, 0.5 ml) containing Tris-d 11 (10 mm), giving a peptide concentration of 1.7 mm. The pH was adjusted to 5.5, and a one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum was recorded. A second sample was prepared containing NF200–248 (2.7 mg), Tris-d 11 (10 mm), and TCEP (2 mm). The pH of this sample was raised to 8.5, 1.1 molar equivalents of ZnCl2 were added, the pH was lowered again to 5.5, and a 1H spectrum was recorded. GST-NF fusion proteins and mutant derivatives were prepared as above except that proteins were not released from the GSH affinity column. Typically, 2 μl of GSH beads containing 1 μg of fusion protein were used in these experiments. Experiments usingin vitro translated 35S-labeled GATA-1 were carried out as described previously except that 0.5% rather than 0.2% Nonidet P-40 was used in the buffers (23Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 26Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Experiments with recombinant GATA-1 were carried out as follows. 10 μl of crude bacterial extract containing recombinant GATA-1 was incubated at 4 °C with 2 μl of beads containing the GST-NF fusion proteins. After 20 min, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with binding buffer containing Tris (50 mm), NaCl (50 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (1 mm), bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg ml−1), Nonidet P-40 (0.5%), and ZnSO4 (100 μm). The bound material was then released by boiling in SDS loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting. The presence of retained full-length GATA-1 was detected using the rat monoclonal N6 antibody and a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody. The presence of alkaline phosphatase was revealed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-1-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-CF249–318 was prepared as above but not released from the GSH affinity column by thrombin cleavage. Typically, 10 μl of beads containing around 2 μg of fusion protein was used in these experiments. HPLC-purified NF peptides were dissolved in Tris (50 mm), NaCl (50 mm), TCEP (100 μm), and either ZnSO4 (100 μm) or EDTA (10 mm) and incubated with the GST-CF249–318 beads for 30 min at 25 °C. The beads were then washed three times with a buffer containing Tris (50 mm), NaCl (50 mm), TCEP (100 μm), bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg ml−1), Nonidet P-40 (0.5%), and either ZnSO4(100 μm) or EDTA (10 mm) as appropriate and were then washed a further three times with the same buffer lacking the bovine serum albumin and Nonidet P-40. The bound material was then released by boiling in SDS loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. Gel retardation assays were carried out essentially as described by Crossley et al.(26Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in the gel retardation experiment contained the sequences MC71 (GATCTCCGGCAACTGATAAGGATTCCCTG) and MC72 (CAGGGAATCCTTATCAGTTGCCGGAGATC). 10 μg of COS nuclear extract containing recombinant GATA-1 was mixed with 0.1 ng of32P-radiolabeled probe in a total volume of 20 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the samples were loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C. The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. The anti-GATA-1 antibody used was N6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Transactivations were carried out as previously reported (15Martin D.I.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmids and increasing amounts of GATA-1 expression vector as shown. The reporter plasmids contained minimal promoters with either one (M1α) or six (M6α) GATA sites upstream of a β-globin TATA box and growth hormone reporter gene. The GATA-1 expression plasmids contained normal or mutant murine GATA-1 cDNA inserted between theHindIII and NotI sites of RcCMV (Invitrogen). Growth hormone levels were measured 48 h after transfection using the Allegro kit from the Nichols Institute. A peptide containing amino acids 200–248 of the N-finger was initially chosen for characterization and is referred to as NF200–248 (for numbering, see Fig. 1). In the absence of metal, NF200–248 exhibits both CD and one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 2 A, solid line, and Fig. 2 B, upper part, respectively) characteristic of an unfolded peptide; viz. the CD spectrum displays a pronounced minimum below 200 nm, while the resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum are sharp and poorly dispersed. The addition of one molar equivalent of Zn2+ induces substantial changes in both cases, consistent with the formation of persistent secondary structure. The red shift of the minimum in the CD spectrum to 208 nm (Fig. 2 A, dotted line) is diagnostic of the presence of α-helical secondary structure, and the wide chemical shift dispersion in the NMR spectrum (Fig. 2 B, lower part) is suggestive of a folded protein. The addition of more than one molar equivalent of Zn2+ had no further effect on the CD spectrum (data not shown), establishing the stoichiometry of the interaction as 1:1. The general features of the CD spectrum are comparable with those observed previously for folded zinc finger peptides (see, for example, Refs. 33Burke C.J. Sanyal G. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. LaFemina R.L. Robbins H.L. Zeft A.S. Middaugh C.R. Cordingley M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9639-9644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 34Frankel A.D. Berg J.M. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4841-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and are indicative of a mixture of α and β secondary structure. Comparable spectra were observed for the constructs NF200–254 and NF200–243, consistent with those peptides folding in the same fashion. The addition of Co2+ to NF200–248 induced a similar change in the CD spectrum (Fig. 2 A, dashed line), indicating that the peptide folds similarly around the two metals. Consequently, changes observed in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (vis) absorption spectra of NF200–248 following the addition of Co2+ were also used to probe both the nature and the geometry of the metal-peptide complex (note that the electronic configuration of Zn2+ precludes the observation of useful UV-vis spectra for this metal). The S → Co charge transfer bands observed at 310 and 370 nm in a UV-vis titration of NF200–248 with CoCl2 (Fig. 3 A) are suggestive of cysteinate ligation (33Burke C.J. Sanyal G. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. LaFemina R.L. Robbins H.L. Zeft A.S. Middaugh C.R. Cordingley M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9639-9644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Frankel A.D. Berg J.M. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4841-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the visible region of the spectrum (Fig. 3 B), intense d-dtransition bands at 610, 700, and 740 nm (e.g.ε740 ∼ 600 m−1cm−1) clearly show that the coordination mode is tetrahedral (35Bertini I. Luchinat C. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 6: 71-111PubMed Google Scholar); i.e. because d-d transitions in tetrahedral complexes are formally allowed, molar extinction coefficients are typically greater than ∼200m−1 cm−1, while in octahedral complexes, for example, such transitions are formally forbidden, resulting in values for ε of ∼10 m−1cm−1 (36Cotton F.A. Wilkinson G. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. 5th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Further, the wavelengths of thed–d transitions argue for a Cys4coordination sphere. The presence of nitrogen ligands in Cys2His2 zinc fingers causes a substantial increase in the d–d energy gap compared with an all-sulfur coordination sphere (37Huheey J.E. Inorganic Chemistry. 3rd Ed. Harper and Row, New York1983Google Scholar), and in such complexesd–d bands are typically observed in the 600–650-nm region (see, for example, Refs. 33Burke C.J. Sanyal G. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. LaFemina R.L. Robbins H.L. Zeft A.S. Middaugh C.R. Cordingley M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9639-9644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 34Frankel A.D. Berg J.M. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4841-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Moreover, the shape of the binding curve (Fig. 3 A, inset) suggests that the association constant for Co2+ binding is greater than ∼108m−1, which is substantially stronger than for interactions between Co2+and Cys2His2 fingers (38Berg J.M. Merkle D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3759-3761Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These conclusions are consistent with the configuration deduced in the solution structure of the CF of chicken GATA-1 (16Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Apella A. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), where the four homologous Cys residues are inferred from NMR data to coordinate the zinc in a tetrahedral arrangement. Having established that the NF is capable of folding in the anticipated fashion, we then focused on its ability to participate in protein-protein interactions and sought to define its role in the self-association of GATA-1. Previous experiments have focused on the GATA-1 CF and have demonstrated that it plays a significant role in the self-association of GATA-1 (26Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but it has also been noted that the N-finger alone can mediate association with full-length GATA-1. However, the relative importance of the N-finger has not been studied in detail (26Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out GST pull-down experiments to compare the ability of equal amounts of GST-NF200–254, GST-CF249–318, and GST-GATA-1 (full-length) to retain full-length in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled GATA-1. These three fusion proteins retained approximately equal amounts of GATA-1, while the control protein, GST alone, did not retain GATA-1 (Fig. 4 A). Taken together with previous work on the CF, this result suggests that the NF also plays a significant role in the self-association of GATA-1. In order to eliminate the possibility of a bridging event, where a separate mammalian protein present in reticulocyte lysates may interact with two GATA-1 molecules simultaneously, we further analyzed the binding of the N-finger to full-length GATA-1 using only recombinant proteins. Full-length recombinant GATA-1 was produced in bacteria and mixed with glutathione-agarose beads coated with GST-NF200–254. After extensive washing, the proteins retained on the beads were then subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting to test for the presence of retained full-length GATA-1. As can be seen from Fig. 4 B(lane 3), the GST-NF200–254 fusion was able to capture full-length GATA-1. In contrast, neither beads alone nor beads loaded with GST retained GATA-1 protein. This result confirms the previous result that the NF200–254 is able to associate with GATA-1 (Fig. 4 A and Ref. 26Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and indicates that it is a direct interaction. The same GST pull-down assay was used to delineate the critical portion of the NF involved in the interaction. We first tested two deletion mutants: GST-NF200–48 and GST-NF200–243. As can be seen in Fig. 4 B (lanes 4 and 5), the longer of the two constructs exhibited a substantially stronger interaction with full-length GATA-1; formation of a GATA-1-NF200–243 complex was only just detectable in the Western blot. This result suggests that either residues in the 244–254 region (see Fig. 1) directly contribute to"

Extracts from mitotic cells efficiently catalyzed the formation of the 3F3/2 phosphoepitope on fragments of HsTIIα expressed in bacteria. Expression and site-directed mutagenesis of various HsTIIα protein fragments mapped the 3F3/2 phosphoepitope to the region of HsTIIα containing phosphorylated threonine 1342. This threonine lies within a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by casein kinase II (CKII). CKII is present in cellular extracts and is associated with isolated mitotic chromosomes. The 3F3/2 phosphoepitope kinase present in mitotic cell extracts was able to create the epitope using GTP and was inhibited by heparin.

DNA topoisomerase II (TII)1 catalyzes the passage of one double-stranded DNA molecule through another double-stranded DNA molecule in an ATP-dependent manner by creating a transient DNA double strand break, passing the intact double strand through this break, and then ligating the break. This activity alters DNA topology during catenation/decatenation, enables knotting/unknotting, and relaxes DNA supercoils generated during DNA replication and RNA transcription (reviewed in Ref. 1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells require TII for survival. It is essential for proper chromosome condensation during mitosis and meiosis and for segregation of sister chromatids during anaphase (2Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K.

In addition, TII is thought to play a role in the maintenance of both interphase chromatin structure (5Berrios M. Osheroff N. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4142-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and mitotic chromosome structure (6Earnshaw W.C. Halligan B. Cooke C.A. Heck M.M. Liu L.F. J.

SMC (stablemaintenance of chromosomes) proteins and TII, the major components of the mitotic chromosome scaffold, have been shown to associate. It appears that TII and SMC proteins act collectively to maintain the structural integrity of the condensed chromosome (reviewed in Ref. 8Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Many anti-cancer reagents inhibit the activity of TII. The majority of these therapeutic topoisomerase poisons act by blocking the break-ligation reaction, resulting in a trapped intermediate termed the cleavable complex (9Schneider E. Hsiang Y.H.

Cancer. 1997; 75: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). During G1, the level of TIIα is at its lowest. Levels begin to increase prior to S phase, remain relatively stable through S, and increase again and peak in late G2 (19Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H.

Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 2093-2099PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast and Drosophila possess one form of TII. Earlier studies indicated that TII protein levels remained similar throughout the cell cycle in these organisms (25Whalen A.M. McConnell M. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Cardenas M.E. Laroche T. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 439-450PubMed Google Scholar), but subsequent studies have shown that yeast and Drosophila TII are expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner similar to the expression of TIIα in other eukaryotes (27Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Swedlow J.R. Sedat J.W. Agard D.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). TIIα is also phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of TIIα is maximal in G2/M phase. Burden et al. (21Burden D.A. Goldsmith L.J. Sullivan D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) detected phosphoserine residues on Chinese hamster TIIα in all phases of the cell cycle, whereas phosphothreonine residues were detected only in M phase cells. Several protein kinases including p34cdc2, protein kinase C, and casein kinase II (CKII) have been shown to phosphorylate TIIα. In G2/M phases, p34cdc2 is thought to phosphorylate serines 1212 and 1246 of human TIIα (HsTIIα) (29Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C also phosphorylates HsTIIα in G2/M phases on serine 29 (30Wells N.J. Fry A.M. Guano F. Norbury C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28357-28363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Taagepera et al. (31Taagepera S. Rao P.N. Drake F.H. Gorbsky G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found that mouse TIIα is the major mitotic chromosomal protein recognized by MPM-2, an antibody that binds to certain mitosis-specific phosphorylations. TII is phosphorylated by CKII in yeast, Drosophila, and human cells (reviewed in Ref. 32Larsen A.K. Skladanowski A. Bojanowski K. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1996; 2: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Wells et al. (33Wells N.J. Addison C.M. Fry A.M. Ganapathi R. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29746-29751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the major phosphorylation target sites for CKII on HsTIIα were serine 1376 and serine 1524. CKII has also been reported to phosphorylate HsTIIα threonine 1342 (34Ishida R. Iwai M. Marsh K.L. Austin C.A. Yano T. Shibata M. Nozaki N. Hara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30077-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In yeast, CKII differentially phosphorylates TII in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Some CKII phosphoacceptor sites are preferentially phosphorylated in mitosis, while others are preferentially phosphorylated in G1 (27Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). CKII and TII form stable complexes in which both enzymes' respective catalytic activities are maintained even after the phosphorylation of TII by CKII (35Bojanowski K. Filhol O. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Larsen A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22920-22926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that binding of CKII to HsTIIα stabilizes enzymatic activity of HsTIIα without phosphorylation (36Redwood C. Davies S.L. Wells N.J. Fry A.M. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3635-3642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The consequences of TII phosphorylation on the activity of the enzyme have been examined in several studies. In yeast, dephosphorylation of TII eliminates decatenation activity, which can be restored by CKII phosphorylation (37Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CKII phosphorylation of Drosophila TII also enhances enzymatic activity 2–3-fold (38Ackerman P. Glover C.V. Osheroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3164-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In mammals, the correlation between TII phosphorylation and its activity is less clear. Phosphorylation of HsTIIα by protein kinase C has been reported to increase its activity (28Swedlow J.R. Sedat J.W. Agard D.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Saijo et al. (39Saijo M. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have reported that dephosphorylated murine TII from Swiss 3T3 cells is almost completely inactive and that phosphorylation by a copurifying kinase increased its activity 8.6-fold over that of the dephosphorylated TII. In contrast, Redwood et al. (36Redwood C. Davies S.L. Wells N.J. Fry A.M. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3635-3642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) found that phosphorylation of HsTIIα by CKII did not increase decatenation activity. Kimuraet al. (40Kimura K. Saijo M. Tanaka M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10990-10995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) also indicated that murine TIIα from FM3A cells was unaffected either by phosphatase treatment or by phosphorylation with CKII. Phosphorylation of TII has been linked to chemotherapeutic drug resistance; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced hyperphosphorylation of HsTII by CKII in HL-60 cells treated with the anticancer drug etoposide, reduced the formation of cleavable complexes, and decreased cytotoxicity (41Chresta C.M. Hall B.F. Francis G.E. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1373-1381PubMed Google Scholar). The precise roles of the phosphorylations of mammalian TII and their effects upon its postulated activities have yet to be fully characterized. The monoclonal phosphoepitope antibody, 3F3/2, was originally prepared by Cyert et al. (42Cyert M.S. Scherson T. Kirschner M.W. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) against Xenopus egg extracts that had been supplemented with ATPγS. They found that the antibody recognized a large variety of thiophosphorylated proteins. Subsequently, we discovered that the antibody recognizes a small number of native phosphoproteins from mitotic cells that were never exposed to ATPγS. In addition, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the antibody bound to proteins in kinetochores and centrosomes (43Gorbsky G.J. Ricketts W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1311-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Li et al. demonstrated that levels of expression of the 3F3/2 kinetochore phosphoepitope were linked to tension created by kinetochore and spindle microtubule interactions (44Li X. Nicklas R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 537-545PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, when the 3F3/2 antibody was microinjected into living cells, the cells arrested at metaphase (45Campbell M.S. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results suggested that a 3F3/2 phosphoepitope may participate in a tension-sensitive signaling pathway and is a component of the cell cycle checkpoint regulating entry into anaphase. In this study, we have found that the 3F3/2 antibody binds to HsTIIα extracted from mitotically arrested cells. We have identified the specific phosphorylation site on HsTIIα required for the generation of the 3F3/2 phosphoepitope, investigated the cell cycle dependence of the phosphorylation, and characterized a mitotic kinase activity that can create this phosphoepitope. Tissue culture reagents including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nonessential amino acids were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Demecolcine, leupeptin, pepstatin A, Chaps, Triton X-100, EGTA, Trizma (Tris base), ATP, GTP, heparin, penicillin G, streptomycin, and β-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Sigma.

The antiphosphoepitope antibody 3F3/2 was prepared as an ascites fluid in the Lymphocyte Culture Center at the University of Virginia. Anti-topoisomerase II α mouse monoclonal antibodies SWT3D1 and SWR1C2, herein designated T3D1 and R1C2, respectively, were originally produced by Robinson et al.(46Robinson R.G. Rapp L. Bowdish K.J. Graham M.A. Huff A.C. Coughlin S.A. Hybridoma. 1993; 12: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) at Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals (Collegeville, PA). T3D1 and R1C2 used in these experiments were generously provided by R. G. Robinson and Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals as hybridoma cell supernatants. Rabbit anti-human casein kinase 2 α subunit (catalog no. 06-180) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse (catalog no. 115-035-146) and goat anti-rabbit (catalog no. 111-035-144) IgG antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The 16-amino acid peptide, FSDFDEKTDDEDFVPC, and the threonine-phosphorylated version were synthesized, purified, and characterized by mass spectroscopy by QCB (Hopkinton, MA). The first 15 residues of this peptide correspond to amino acids 1335–1349 of HsTIIα with the phosphorylated threonine corresponding to residue 1342. HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL 2.2) were grown in 1-liter spinner flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.05% (w/v) pluronic F68, 60 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells defined as cycling cells were harvested from logarithmically growing cultures. Cells were arrested in S phase by the addition of 1 μg/ml aphidicolin and subsequent culture for 18 h. To arrest cells in M phase, cells were incubated for 18 h in the presence of 0.15 μg/ml demecolcine. The mitotic index, the percentage of cells containing condensed chromosomes, was determined for cycling, S phase, and M phase cells by propidium iodide fluorescent staining analysis. The mitotic index in cycling cells ranged from 4 to 10%, S phase cells from 0 to 1%, and M phase cells from 70 to 95%. Harvested cells were washed twice in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation prior to extraction and use in various assays. Cell pellets not immediately used in assays were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. HeLa S3 chromosomes were isolated from mitotically arrested cultures as described previously (47Renzi L. Gersch M.S. Campbell M.S. Wu L. Osmani S.A. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2013-2025PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, M phase-arrested cells were centrifuged, rinsed twice in swelling buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4, protease inhibitor mixture), and lysed by vigorous pipetting in 4 °C extraction buffer (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes, pH 6.9, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture, and either 1% CHAPS or 0.5% Triton X-100). When indicated, the extraction buffer also contained 200 nm microcystin-LR, a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor. Protease inhibitor mixture additions result in final concentrations of 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml Pefabloc SC. Centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C removed nonmitotic nuclei and other cellular debris from the suspended chromosomes. The exclusion of nuclei was confirmed by propidium iodide fluorescent staining analysis. Chromosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed three times in extraction buffer by repeated centrifugation. Nuclei were isolated from cycling cell cultures (described above) using identical buffers and techniques as used during the isolation of chromosomes with the exception that the nuclei were pelleted from cellular debris and extract by centrifugation at 64 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclei preparations contained greater than 99% nonmitotic nuclei as determined by propidium iodide fluorescent staining analysis. Chromosomes or nuclei not immediately used in assays were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Protein A trisacryl beads were washed three times by centrifugation in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS (RIPA). 100 μl of protein A bead slurry was then combined with 800 μl of RIPA and either 1 μl of 3F3/2 ascites or 150 μl each of T3D1 and R1C2 anti-human topoisomerase II α antibodies. The mixtures were agitated for 2 h at 4 °C. Antibody-conjugated protein A beads were washed three times in RIPA containing 200 nmmicrocystin-LR and protease inhibitor mixture. Chromosomes were treated with 0.1 units/μl DNase for 5 min in extraction buffer (described above) at 37 °C. SDS was added to achieve a concentration of 1% (w/v), and the sample was vortexed. RIPA, without any SDS but containing 200 nm microcystin-LR and protease inhibitor mixture, was then added to adjust the final SDS concentration to 0.1%. The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was retained for immunoprecipitation. The chromosomal extracts were combined with the antibody-conjugated beads and gently agitated at 4 °C for 2–3 h. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times by centrifugation with RIPA containing 200 nm microcystin-LR and protease inhibitor mixture. Supernatants were also retained for analysis. For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis, the immunoprecipitates and supernatants were treated with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Chromosomes were isolated as described above in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. The chromosomes were then suspended in extraction buffer with and without 200 nm microcystin-LR. ATP was added to 1 mm, and the chromosomes were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Chromosomes were then treated with 0.1 units/μl DNase for 5 min at 37 °C, mixed 1:1 (v/v) with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min for gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. For SDS-PAGE analysis, whole cell extracts were prepared by dissolving cell pellets in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Soluble cell extracts for SDS-PAGE were prepared by lysing cell pellets in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4 (TEM) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 200 nm microcystin-LR, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Isolated chromosomes or nuclei were treated with 0.1 units/μl DNase for 5 min in extraction buffer (described above) and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. All SDS-PAGE samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Cellular extracts used in phosphorylation assays were prepared by lysing freshly isolated cells in TEM containing 200 nmmicrocystin-LR, 1% Chaps, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture or by thawing frozen cells in TEM containing 200 nmmicrocystin-LR, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture. These mixtures were intermittently vortexed and kept on ice for 5 min. The extracts were cleared by 15,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein concentrations for the extracts were determined using a Coomassie protein assay. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis using 5–20% gradient or 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. For Western analysis, the membranes were blocked for 30 min with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide. For detection of proteins recognized by the 3F3/2 antibody, 3F3/2 ascites was diluted 1:5000 in TBST and incubated with the membrane for 1–2 h. For detection of human topoisomerase II α, T3D1 and R1C2 mouse monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma culture supernatants were diluted 1:1000 in TBST and incubated with the membrane for 1–2 h. For detection of CKII, rabbit anti-CKII α subunit antibody at 1 μg/ml in TBST was incubated with the membrane for 1–2 h. After washing in TBST, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies diluted 1:20,000 to 1:30,000 in TBST for 1 h. Immunoblots were washed again in TBST and then developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence system. Immunoblotting inhibition assays for the 3F3/2 antibody were carried out by incubating 3F3/2 ascites at a 1:25,000 dilution in TBST with either the phosphopeptide or the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide (described above). The peptide concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 100 μg/ml. The 3F3/2 antibody was incubated with the peptides for 1 h at 4 °C. This solution was then used for immunoblotting as described above. A Bluescript II KS +/− plasmid containing the complete coding sequence for HsTIIα was obtained from the ATCC. This sequence was digested using appropriate restriction endonucleases, and the resulting DNA fragments were inserted into the pET30 vector (pET System, Novagen). pET30 vectors are bacterial expression vectors that encode an S-TagTM and a 6× histidine sequence on the N terminus of expressed proteins. When necessary, oligonucleotide primers containing restriction endonuclease sites were designed and used in conjunction with polymerase chain reaction methods to create sequences encoding portions of HsTIIα suitable for insertion into pET30 vectors. Mutagenesis of HsTIIα coding sequences was achieved using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. Sequence analysis of mutagenized constructs was performed by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility using dye terminator chemistry and an Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer. BL21(DE3)Escherichia coli were transformed with pET30 vectors containing HsTIIα constructs and induced to express HsTIIα protein fragments. Synthesized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (described above), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and detected using the S-TagTM alkaline phosphatase-conjugated detection system. In addition, these HsTIIα fragments were used as substrates for the 3F3/2 kinase assay described below. Fragments of HsTIIα protein were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as described above. The membranes were then cut into strips. Nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked by incubating the strips with TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide for 15 min. Strips were rinsed twice in TEM and then equilibrated in TEM containing 1 mm DTT, 200 nm microcystin-LR, and protease inhibitor mixture. After equilibration, the strips were placed in either HeLa S3 cellular extracts (prepared above) or casein kinase II diluted in TEM containing 1 mm DTT, 200 nmmicrocystin-LR, and protease inhibitor mixture. When indicated, 1 mm ATP or GTP was added. Final protein concentrations of cellular extracts used in this assay ranged from 20 to 150 μg/ml. To compare kinase activity between different cellular extracts, equivalent extract protein concentrations were used. Heparin at 50 μg/ml was included in the assay to test its inhibitory effects. The reactions were incubated at room temperature or 37 °C for 3–30 min. Multiple washes in TBST terminated the reactions. The strips were then immunoblotted with the 3F3/2 antibody as described above. Whole mitotic cells, extracts from mitotic cells, and mitotic chromosomal extracts isolated in the presence of the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin-LR, were immunoblotted with the 3F3/2 anti-phosphoepitope antibody (Fig. 1). In whole cell and soluble cell extract preparations the major immunoreactive proteins were found at approximately 220- and 170-kDa. Whole cell and chromosome samples shared 220-, 170-, and 18-kDa immunoreactive proteins. The 170-kDa protein was concentrated in the isolated chromosome fraction that, along with the 220- and 18-kDa proteins, also contained immunoreactive proteins of approximately 100 and 55 kDa. Because HsTIIα is a 170-kDa protein known to be concentrated in mitotic chromosomes, we sought to determine whether the 170-kDa band identified by the 3F3/2 anti-phosphoepitope antibody might be HsTIIα. Immunoprecipitations from chromosomal extracts with 3F3/2 and anti-HsTIIα antibodies were performed. Both immunoprecipitates and their supernatants were then immunoblotted with 3F3/2 and anti-HsTIIα antibodies (Fig. 2). Immunoblotting with anti-HsTIIα antibody shows that some but not all of the HsTIIα was immunoprecipitated by the 3F3/2 a"
https://openalex.org/W2152013177,"We describe herein the characterization of a major 45-kDa protein from the soluble βH-crystallin fraction of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) lens. Based on partial peptide sequence, immunoreactivity, and enzymatic activity, this protein has been identified as betaine-homocysteineS-methyltransferase (BHMT: EC 2.1.1.5), an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine using either betaine or thetins as methyl donors. This protein was found to be expressed abundantly in the nuclear region of the monkey lens, reaching ∼10% of the total nuclear protein, but was barely detectable in the epithelium and cortex regions of the lens. Because the nucleus represents the early embryonic and fetal stages of lens development, we infer that BHMT expression in the lens of the eye is developmentally regulated. By virtue of its high abundance, BHMT can be considered an enzyme crystallin (ψ-crystallin). This is the first enzyme crystallin to be found in primate lenses.

Crystallins, the major structural proteins of the eye lens, are the primary determinants of the refractive properties of this tissue. There are two major classes, the ubiquitous crystallins (α and β/γ) present in all vertebrates and the so-called enzyme crystallins, which occur in phylogenetically restricted groups (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Wistow G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The enzyme crystallins are major soluble lens proteins that are either identical or closely related to metabolic enzymes. More than 10 such proteins have been identified and characterized from a variety of vertebrate species (3De Jong W.W. Hendriks W. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. Trends Biochem.

Molecular Biology and Evolution of Crystallins: Gene Recruitment and Multifunctional Proteins in the Eye (Molecular Biology Intelligence Service). R. G. Lands, Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). Although it seems that the recruitment of metabolic enzymes as lens crystallins generally occurs through the modification of gene expression without previous gene duplication, very little is known regarding the molecular basis of their high expression in the lens or their selective recruitment to serve as crystallins (2Wistow G.

In this study we have identified and characterized a prominent protein from Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) lens and found it to be identical to betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT1: EC 2.1.1.5). Although expression of this protein was previously reported to be confined to the liver and kidney (6Ericson L.E. Acta Chem. Scand. 1960; 14: 2102-2112Crossref Google Scholar, 7Finkelstein J.D.

Because of its high abundance in the monkey lens nucleus, we consider BHMT to be a developmentally regulated enzyme crystallin, which we have named ψ-crystallin. Fresh rhesus monkey lenses were obtained from 2–3-year-old animals that were used by the vaccine testing service at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration (Bethesda, MD). Human lenses were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA), and Sprague-Dawley rats were from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Bovine eyes were from a local slaughterhouse. All lenses were stored at −70 °C until processed. Both monkey and human lenses were microdissected into different layers as described earlier (10Garland D.L. Duglas-Tabor Y. Jimenez-Asensio J. Datiles M.B. Magno B. Exp.

Lenses from different species were homogenized in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the soluble tissue extracts were obtained by centrifugation (25,000 × g) at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211784) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The βH-crystallin fraction from monkey lens was prepared by separating the lens soluble homogenate (25,000 × g) on a Superose 12 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) attached to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech high performance liquid chromatography system. Crystallin fractions were eluted from the column with 50 mmTris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions (0.8 ml) containing βH-crystallin were pooled and subjected to electrophoretic analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed according to the method of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205478) Google Scholar) using a Hoefer Mighty Small apparatus. Gels contained either 12.5 or 10% acrylamide and were stained with either Coomassie Blue R-250 or Syspro Red. Gels stained with Syspro Red were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager. To obtain a partial peptide sequence of the major 45-kDa protein from the βH-crystallin fraction of monkey lens, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and visualized with Ponceau S. The 45-kDa protein was cut from the blot and sequenced by Harvard Microchemistry Laboratories (Boston, MA). Immunoblots were developed according to the Bio-Rad protocol using an antibody (polyclonal) raised against recombinant human liver BHMT. 2N. S. Millian, X. Shi, and T. A. Garrow, unpublished data. Transfer of proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to a nitrocellulose membrane was accomplished using a Bio-Rad transfer unit, and protein bands were visualized using a peroxidase-linked second antibody and 4-chloro-1-naphthol substrate (Kirkegard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Tissue samples obtained from monkey lenses were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis as described earlier (10Garland D.L. Duglas-Tabor Y. Jimenez-Asensio J. Datiles M.B. Magno B. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were prepared in 9m urea containing 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% ampholytes (pI range, 3–10), and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The first dimension, isoelectric focusing, was carried out using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech immobilized nonlinear pH gradients (pH 3–10) and was run for 32,000 V-h. The second dimension was run on 18 × 18-cm, 15–18% acrylamide gradient SDS slab gels using the ISO-DALT system (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G. BHMT activity was determined as described by Garrow (13Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In brief, the assay contained 5 mmdl-homocysteine, 2 mm dimethylacetothetin (0.8 μCi), a sulfonium analog of betaine, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The final reaction volume was 0.5 ml. Reactions were initiated with the addition of tissue extract and carried out for 1–2 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by chilling the tubes in ice water, and reactants were applied to a Dowex 1-X 4 (OH, 200–400 mesh) column (0.6 × 3.75 cm). The unreacted dimethylacetothetin was washed from the column with water, and the reaction products, methylthioacetate and methionine, were eluted with 1.5 nHCl and quantified by scintillation counting. All samples were assayed in duplicate. BHMT activity is expressed as units per mg of protein. A unit is defined as 1 nmol of methionine produced/h. The levels of lens homocysteine, cystathionine, methionine, cysteine, and dimethylglycine were determined by Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. (Denver, CO). These assays were performed using the stable isotope dilution methods described by Stabler et al. (14Stabler S.P. Marcell P.D. Podell E.R. Allen R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and Allen et al. (15Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1448-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared by homogenizing freshly excised lenses in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.14m NaCl at a concentration of 100 mg of tissue/ml of buffer. The homogenates were quickly frozen and stored at −20 °C until shipped (frozen) to Denver for analysis. Betaine analysis was performed as described by Mar et al. (16Mar M.H.H. Ridky T.W. Garner S.C. Zeisel S.H. Nutr. Biochem. 1995; 6: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at the Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). Lens betaine was extracted with MeOH/CHCl3, derivatized with 4′-bromo-phenacyl triflate, and quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography using UV detection. By chance observation it was noted that rhesus monkey lens contained a water-soluble protein that migrated on SDS-PAGE as a ∼45-kDa band. This polypeptide, which was not apparent in samples from lenses of various other species, was found to elute from gel filtration columns with the βH-crystallin fraction, indicating a native molecular weight of >150,000. In an earlier report, Satoet al. (17Sato S. Russell P. Kinoshita J.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) had observed the same band in the βH-crystallin fraction of rhesus monkey lens and had noted that it did not appear to be a β-crystallin polypeptide; they did not attempt to identify the band. To identify the polypeptide, the monkey lens βH-crystallin fraction was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE analysis and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After visualization by staining with Ponceau S, the 45-kDa band was cut from the blot and sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Laboratories facility for microsequencing. After tryptic digestion, the sequences of two peptides totaling 33 residues were obtained, and these sequences were subjected to a BLAST search against the NCBI protein data bank to detect sequence homology with known proteins. Both peptide sequences were found to be 100% identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of human BHMT (Fig. 1) (13Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). After this initial identification, we confirmed its identity by enzyme activity and immunochemistry, studied its distribution in the monkey lens, and measured its activity levels in the lenses of monkeys and other species. Fig. 2 A depicts the lens soluble protein profiles from different species as seen on SDS-PAGE. The monkey lens homogenate shows a distinct and prominent band in the range of 45 kDa, which was not apparent in the other species with Coomassie Blue staining. Densitometric analysis indicated that the 45-kDa band accounted for 0.5–1% of total monkey lens protein. Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibody raised against human recombinant BHMT demonstrated strong and specific reactivity with the monkey sample only (Fig. 2 B). BHMT enzyme activity was determined on whole lens extracts from several species using an assay described by Garrow (13Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The BHMT activity of monkey lens was extremely high relative to that of all other species tested. In fact, guinea pig, bovine, and rabbit lenses did not show detectable levels of activity, whereas the monkey lens had 69 units/mg of protein; this difference is consistent with the high level of BHMT in monkey lens demonstrated electrophoretically in Fig. 2. The lens grows by adding layers of cells at the periphery, in a manner analogous to the growth rings of a tree; thus the oldest cells are at the center, or nucleus, and the tissue becomes progressively younger moving from the center to the lens periphery (cortex). It is thus possible to analyze tissue from different lens layers representing different stages of lens development and different tissue age. In contrast to similar dissection of human lenses, clear demarcation of cortex and the various nucleus zones was not evident in the monkey lenses; thus the layers dissected are simply concentric layers of progressively older cells as one moves from the epithelium to the central nucleus. The distribution of BHMT protein and activity was determined for different layers of the monkey lens. Freshly obtained monkey lenses were microdissected into epithelium/capsule and six or seven other layers of lens fibers in a concentric fashion from the lens periphery to its center (10Garland D.L. Duglas-Tabor Y. Jimenez-Asensio J. Datiles M.B. Magno B. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig. 3illustrates the SDS-PAGE analysis of soluble homogenates prepared from one set of such samples. The 45-kDa protein was found to be strikingly concentrated in the most central regions of the lens. It was not detectable by Coomassie Blue staining in the epithelium or in peripheral layers of cortex (layers 1–3), whereas in layer 4, one can see a prominent 45-kDa band, which increases dramatically in intensity in layers 5 and 6. In layers 5 and 6, this protein band was found to comprise 5 and 10% of total protein, respectively, as determined by densitometric analysis. To determine whether this 45-kDa band represents a single protein, we also subjected these same fractions to two-dimensional electrophoresis. Fig. 4, A–C, illustrates the two-dimensional patterns of monkey lens proteins taken from outer cortical, outer nuclear, and central nuclear layers, respectively. The proteins present in the bottom half of all three panels are the crystallin polypeptides and are similar in all three samples. Enzymes and other housekeeping proteins are found primarily at higher molecular weights. The location of BHMT is indicated in Fig. 4 B. It is clear that the staining at ∼45 kDa seen in one-dimensional SDS-PAGE results largely from three closely spaced basic polypeptides. These three spots represent charge variants of BHMT, as confirmed by running purified recombinant human BHMT as a control (results not shown). The relative intensity of these spots is increased in the central nucleus (Fig. 4 C), whereas in the outer cortex (Fig. 4 A) they are absent, or virtually so. To correlate BHMT protein distribution with its enzymatic activity, we have also assayed activity in the different layers of another monkey lens. As shown in Fig. 5, activity was distributed in a pattern similar to that found for the protein by electrophoretic analysis, with very high activity in the center of the lens compared with peripheral layers of fibers or with the epithelium. It was of obvious interest to determine the level of BHMT expression in human lens. Initial investigation with two pairs of lenses from adult donor eyes revealed no obvious band on SDS-PAGE at the expected position for BHMT. Analysis for BHMT activity in the same lenses indicated a low but measurable activity. In contrast to the non-primate lenses, in which no activity was detected, the human lenses had activity equal to ∼1% that of the monkey lens. After discovery of the developmental regulation of BHMT expression in monkey lens, lenses from four fresh human donor eyes were dissected into nucleus and cortex and assayed for BHMT activity. As shown in Table I, it is apparent that as in the monkey lens, activity is concentrated in the older tissue of the interior region of the lens. This is further demonstrated by the higher activity present in a human fetal lens (∼15 weeks of gestation) compared with the adult human lenses assayed.Table IBHMT activity in human lensAgeCortexNucleusyearsunits/mg1-aActivity reported as units per mg of protein where 1 unit is defined as 1 nmol of methionine formed/h using dimethylacetothetin as methyl donor substrate.Human lens 180.610.1 240.111.5 350.36.0 500.24.0 Fetal (whole, ∼15 weeks)64.8Monkey lens 2–34.11,024Human lenses were divided into nucleus and cortex as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For monkey lenses the cortex activity was the mean for three lenses estimated by adding the measured activities for the two most peripheral layers.

The nucleus value was estimated similarly using the activities from the three most central layers. To determine whether high BHMT expression in animal lenses might result in altered levels of BHMT substrates and products, or other sulfur amino acids, freshly enucleated lenses from rat, bovine, and monkey were extracted and assayed for these metabolites as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Among the various metabolites measured (Table II), only the level of cystathionine was remarkably different, i.e. 10–20-fold higher, in monkey lens compared with the other species. The levels of homocysteine and dimethylglycine were marginally higher in the monkey.Table IILens sulfur metabolite levelsMonkeyCowRatμmol2-aValues are expressed as μmol/100-mg lens wet weight.Methionine11.61.2029.2Cysteine15.818.849.7Homocysteine4.622.221.23Dimethylglycine2.760.871.22Cystathionine21.61.112.11Metabolite levels in lens tissue from different species.

This study demonstrates that catalytically active BHMT is present at very high levels in the central region of rhesus monkey lens. At the very center of the lens it represents ∼10% of total protein, a value 5-fold higher than that previously reported for pig liver (13Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the cortex and epithelium BHMT was not detected on SDS-PAGE analysis, and activity was negligible. Because of its mode of growth, the oldest cells in the lens are at the center, and the youngest are at the periphery. All the cells in the lens are preserved from the embryonic to adult stages, and the central nucleus of the lens contains cells produced during embryonic and fetal development (10Garland D.L. Duglas-Tabor Y. Jimenez-Asensio J. Datiles M.B. Magno B. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells in the lens nucleus have terminally differentiated with loss of cell nucleus and other organelles. Because such cells have lost protein synthetic capacity, it follows that the proteins in those cells were synthesized at the time the cells were formed. Thus, the data indicate that BHMT expression in the lens is very high during embryonic and early fetal development, with down-regulation in cells formed subsequently. The vertebrate eye lens is a transparent, avascular structure, the function of which is to refract incident light onto the retina. Its refractive properties are determined by a small number of very abundant proteins called crystallins (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 18Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Davson H. The Eye. 3rd Ed. 1B. Academic Press, New York1984: 207-492Crossref Google Scholar). A protein is generally designated a crystallin if it constitutes ≥5% of the total protein of the lens (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Wistow G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 3De Jong W.W. Hendriks W. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 365-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is now believed that during vertebrate evolution, the composition and properties of eye lenses have been modified by the direct gene recruitment of enzymes and stress proteins as crystallins (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Wistow G. Trends Biochem.

Even the ubiquitously expressed α- and β/γ-crystallins are now known to have arisen from families of stress proteins, presumably quite early in vertebrate evolution (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu.

More than 10 enzyme-crystallins have been identified to date; all seem to be restricted to certain evolutionary lineages (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Wistow G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 3De Jong W.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4277-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and it has been presumed that these proteins have been recruited as crystallins more recently during evolution relative to the α- and β/γ-crystallins. Although it has been argued that gene recruitment by the lens is largely a random function of neutral evolution (3De Jong W.W. Hendriks W. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. Trends Biochem.

At present one can only speculate on the selective advantage provided by BHMT. It could be related to its role in methionine and sulfur amino acid metabolism (23Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F.

https://openalex.org/W2013291994,"Direct monitoring of the free Ca2+ concentration in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was carried out in rat skeletal myotubes transfected with a specifically targeted aequorin chimera (srAEQ). Myotubes were also transfected with a chimeric aequorin (erAEQ) that we have demonstrated previously is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunolocalization analysis showed that although both recombinant proteins are distributed in an endomembrane network identifiable with immature SR, the erAEQ protein was retained also in the perinuclear membrane. The difficulty of measuring [Ca2+] in 100-1000 microM range was overcome with the use of the synthetic coelenterazine analogue, coelenterazine n. We demonstrate that the steady state levels of [Ca2+] measured with srAEQ is around 300 microM, whereas that measured with erAEQ is significantly lower, i.e. around 200 microM. The effects of caffeine, high KCl, and nicotinic receptor stimulation, in the presence or absence of external calcium or after blockade of the Ca-ATPase, were investigated with both chimeras. The kinetics of [Ca2+] changes revealed by the erAEQ were similar, but not identical, neither quantitatively nor qualitatively, to those monitored with the srAEQ, indicating that at this stage of muscle development, differences exist between SR and ER in their mechanisms of Ca2+ handling. The functional implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2120961959,"We have previously demonstrated that expression of a Sauromatum guttatum alternative oxidase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe confers cyanide-resistant respiratory activity on these cells (Albury, M. S., Dudley, P., Watts, F. Z., and Moore, A. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 17062–17066). Using this functional expression system we have investigated the active site of the plant alternative oxidase, which has been postulated to comprise a non-heme binuclear iron center. Mutation of a conserved glutamate (Glu-270), previously postulated to be a bridging ligand within the active site, to asparagine abolishes catalytic activity because mitochondria containing the E270N mutant protein do not exhibit antimycin A-resistant respiration. Western blot analysis, using antibodies specific for the alternative oxidase, revealed that the E270N mutant protein was targeted to and processed byS. pombe mitochondria in a manner similar to that of the wild-type protein. It is possible that lack of antimycin A-insensitive respiration observed in mitochondria containing the E270N mutant protein is due to incorrect insertion of the mutant alternative oxidase into the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, Western blot analysis of subfractionated mitochondria shows that both wild-type and E270N alternative oxidase are specifically located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, suggesting that misfolding or lack of insertion is unlikely.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In addition to a cytochrome c oxidase, higher plants contain an alternative oxidase, an integral membrane protein, which branches from the cytochrome pathway at the level of the ubiquinone pool (1Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway catalyzes the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water (1Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Unlike cytochrome c oxidase, electron flow through the alternative oxidase is not coupled with proton translocation, and the resultant free energy is lost as heat (1Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The alternative oxidase is insensitive to inhibitors of the cytochrome pathway such as antimycin A, cyanide, and myxothiazol but is inhibited by octyl- and propyl-gallates and SHAM (3Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).1 In non-thermogenic plants expression of the alternative oxidase is induced by a number of stresses including chilling and wounding (see Refs. 2Day D.A. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Siedow J.N. Wiskich J.T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 4Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and appears to be developmentally regulated (5Lennon A.M. Pratt J. Leach G. Moore A.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in a tissue-specific manner (6Finnegan P.M. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Zhang Q.S. Smith M.K. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Activity of the alternative oxidase appears to be regulated by a number of systems including the redox state of a sulfhydryl/disulfide linkage (7Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and by α-keto acids, in particular pyruvate (8Millar A.H. Wiskich J.T. Whelan J. Day D.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The role of the alternative oxidase in thermogenesis is well known (4Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and in non-thermogenic plants the enzyme is thought to provide an overflow pathway involved in the turnover of trichloroacetic acid cycle intermediates (9Lambers H. Physiol. Plant. 1982; 55: 478-485Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and has also recently been proposed to play a role in the defense mechanism against oxidative stress (10Purvis A.C. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 165-170Crossref Google Scholar, 11Wagner A.M. Moore A.L. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). cDNA sequences encoding the alternative oxidase have been isolated from a variety of plant species, as well as from fungi and trypanosomes (4Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Amino acid comparison shows a high degree of homology especially between the plant sequences. Hydropathy analysis reveals the presence of two hydrophobic regions, thought to be transmembrane α-helices, with hydrophilic regions flanking each side and extending into the mitochondrial matrix (1Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Rasmusson A.G. Moller I.M. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 311-314Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis shows the presence of three copies of an iron-binding motif (Glu-X-X-His), two of which are located in the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain of the protein at the base of the second transmembrane helix (13Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These two motifs correspond to those found in the class I group of di-iron-carboxylate proteins such as R2 (R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase) and MMO. Based upon the presence of these motifs and using the highly conserved residues located in the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain of the protein a hypothetical structure of the catalytic site of the alternative oxidase has been proposed (13Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this hypothetical structure (Fig. 1) the active site contains a coupled binuclear iron center analogous to that found in MMO and R2. Analysis of the proposed structure for the primary ligation sphere of the di-iron center in the alternative oxidase suggests that it is intermediate, in similarity, to both MMO and R2 (13Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Modelling studies suggest that a key residue within the active site is Glu-270, which acts as a bidentate ligand ligating the two iron atoms (13Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The remaining ligands are a histidine, a monodentate aspartate, and water co-ordinated to Fe1 and a histidine, a glutamate, and water to Fe2. We have previously reported on the first successful functional expression of the Sauromatum guttatum alternative oxidase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe mitochondria (15Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of the alternative oxidase in S. pombe confers cyanide-insensitive respiration upon these cells with characteristics similar to those observed in plants. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of S. pombe mitochondria reveals that the alternative oxidase contributes up to 20% toward the total mitochondrial respiratory activity and that its expression decreases the growth rate and yield of the yeast cells. 2C. Affourtit and A. L. Moore, unpublished observations. Expression of a functional plant alternative oxidase in yeast is of particular significance because it facilitates an investigation of the structure-function relationship of the alternative oxidase by site-directed mutagenesis particularly with reference to the nature of the active site. In this communication we report on the use of the yeast inducible heterologous expression system to investigate the nature of the active site of the alternative oxidase and hence to test the validity of the proposed structural model. It is shown that mutation of Glu-270 to asparagine yields an alternative oxidase protein that is fully processed and is correctly integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane in a manner identical to the wild-type protein. However, expression of the E270N protein does not confer antimycin-resistant respiration upon S. pombe mitochondria, and it is therefore concluded that Glu-270 is essential for the catalytic activity of the alternative oxidase. To our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence to indicate that this carboxylate is essential for alternative oxidase activity, probably because, according to the structural model, it acts as bridging ligand connecting both iron atoms. The S. pombestrain used was sp.011 (ade6–704, leu1–2,ura4-D18, h −). Yeast media and growth conditions were as described previously (15Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TheEscherichia coli strains JM101 and JM110 were used for amplification of plasmids. Overlap extension PCR (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar) was used to convert glutamate (GAG) to asparagine (AAT), which also introduced a recognition site for the restriction enzymeBsmI. PCR reactions were carried out in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 200 ng of each primer, 10 ng of template DNA, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) made up to 100 μl and overlaid with mineral oil. Samples were subjected to an initial denaturation period (94 °C, 5 min) and then 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (67 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min) followed by a final extension (72 °C, 3 min) using a TRIO thermoblock (Biometra, Maidstone, UK). Primers Sg162 (5′-ACCGACATCTTCTTCCAGCGGCGGTACGCAT-3′) and Sg265 (5′-TAGGAGTGGATGGCATTCTCCTCCAGGTAGC-3′) (alteration underlined) were used to generate a 343-base pair fragment from plasmid pAOSG81 (17Rhoads D.M. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Primers Sg267 (5′-GGAGGAGAATGCCATCCACTCCTACACCGAG-3′) (alteration underlined) and T7-plus (5′-CGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTACCGGG-3′) were used to generate a 595-base pair fragment from the same plasmid. An overlap extension reaction containing 100–200 ng of purified PCR-generated fragments and primers Sg162 and T7-plus was performed using the conditions described above. The resultant fragment was treated with polynucleotide kinase and ligated toSmaI-digested, phosphatase-treated pUC18. The mutation was initially identified by restriction analysis. The mutant fragment was excised on a SphI-HindIII fragment and ligated to pAOSG81 digested with SphI and HindIII. The entire cloned fragment was sequenced using the Sequenase kit, version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The orientation of the mutant cDNA in the Bluescript vector was reversed by digestion withEcoRI followed by ligation of the resultant fragments. The mutant alternative oxidase on a BspHI-BamHI fragment was ligated to pREP1N (a modified version of pREP1 (18Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the NdeI site was replaced with NcoI) that had been digested with NcoI and BamHI. The resultant plasmid pREP1-E270N contained the mutant alternative oxidase under control of the nmt1 promoter. S. pombecells were transformed using lithium acetate (19Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6485-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Other methods were as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S. pombe mitochondria were prepared from logarithmic phase 2-liter cultures grown overnight in minimal medium in the presence or absence of thiamine. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (21Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but without the initial incubation in β-mercaptoethanol and final purification step on a Percoll gradient. Subfractionation of the mitochondria was based on the method of Moore and Proudlove (22Moore A.L. Proudlove M.O. Hall J.L. Moore A.L. Isolation of Membranes and Organelles from Plant Cells. Academic Press, London1983: 153-184Google Scholar). Mitochondria (approximately 20 mg/ml protein concentration) were diluted in 10 volumes of hypotonic shock medium (5 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium succinate, 10 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) without mixing. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the mitoplast fraction was resuspended in 10 volumes of shock medium and passed through a 20K French Pressure Cell (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 8,000 kg cm−2. The mitoplast fraction was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction, containing inner membrane fragments and matrix proteins, was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet containing inner membrane fragments was resuspended in a minimal amount of shock medium. The supernatant containing the matrix fraction was dried by rotary evaporation and then resuspended in water. Respiratory activity was measured polarographically using a Rank oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers, Cambridge, UK) in 2 ml of reaction medium (0.65 m mannitol, 0.35 mm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmK2HPO4, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin) as described previously (21Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Separation of proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and probing with antibodies were carried out as described previously (15Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the alternative oxidase were raised in mice (23Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against mtHSP70 (heat shock protein of 70 kDa located in the mitochondrial matrix) were raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide representing ten amino acids from the Pisum sativum mitochondrial protein (24Watts F.Z. Walters A.J. Moore A.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK) Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the S. guttatum alternative oxidase to mutate Glu-270 to asparagine. The presence of the E270N mutation was initially identified by restriction analysis and confirmed by sequencing. Both the wild-type and mutated alternative oxidase were introduced into S. pombe by transformation with pREP1-AOX (15Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and pREP1-E270N, respectively, with selection for leucine prototrophy. Fig. 2 shows the results of typical respiratory and Western blot analyses performed with S. pombe mitochondria containing the wild-type or E270N alternative oxidase prepared from cells grown in the presence or absence of thiamine. Respiratory activity measurements (Fig. 2 A) indicate that mitochondria from the three types of cells readily oxidized NADH as a respiratory substrate and that all were coupled to oxidative phosphorylation because oxygen uptake rates could be stimulated by 1 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone. Close scrutiny of the state 4 rates suggests that the NADH-dependent rate was the highest in mitochondria isolated from cells expressing the alternative oxidase protein (Fig. 2 A, panel 1). At first glance this may be in accordance with the idea that expression of a heterologous integral membrane protein, such as the alternative oxidase, may result in non-specific effects on membrane proton permeability (25Brookes P.S. Rolfe D. Brand M.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the state 4 rate in comparison with the control (Fig. 2 A, panel 2). Analysis of a number of mitochondrial preparations (n = 21) in which the alternative oxidase was either present (−thiamine) or absent (+thiamine), however, revealed that this difference in state 4 rates was not significant. Instead it was found that the highest state 4 rate was observed in mitochondria in which the alternative oxidase had not been expressed (Fig. 2 A, panel 2). Fig. 2 A (panel 1) also reveals that the respiratory activity of mitochondria isolated from cells containing wild-type oxidase, grown in the absence of thiamine, was partially resistant to the addition of 3.5 μm antimycin A. Subsequent addition of 2.5 μm octyl-gallate totally inhibited this activity, demonstrating that the antimycin-resistant respiration was due to alternative oxidase activity. Respiratory activity of mitochondria isolated from cells grown in the presence of thiamine (Fig. 2 A, panel 2) was completely inhibited by antimycin A. Western blot analysis, using AOA antibodies, reveals that the alternative oxidase protein was only expressed in mitochondria isolated from cells grown in the absence of thiamine (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to the wild-type alternative oxidase, mitochondria isolated from cells transformed with pREP1-E270N grown in the absence of thiamine did not exhibit any antimycin A-insensitive respiration (Fig. 2 A, panel 3). However, it can be seen from Fig. 2 B that the alternative oxidase antibodies do recognize a protein (lane 3) that has the same molecular mass as both the wild-type alternative oxidase (lane 1) and a control from Arum maculatum. It is also apparent from Fig. 2 B that identical unprocessed forms (15Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of both the wild-type and mutant oxidase can be detected (lanes 1 and 3, respectively). It is conceivable that lack of respiratory activity observed with the E270N form of the alternative oxidase (Fig. 2 A, panel 3) is not a result of changes in the active site but is merely due to incorrect folding or lack of insertion of the protein into the inner mitochondrial membrane. To establish that the mutant alternative oxidase was correctly targeted to the inner membrane, mitochondria from cells expressing the wild-type or mutated form of the alternative oxidase were subfractionated into inner membrane and matrix fractions. When these fractions were probed with AOA antibodies (Fig. 3 A) a protein was recognized in the inner membrane fraction from cells expressing the wild-type (lane 2) and the E270N mutant protein (lane 5). However, the AOA antibodies did not identify any protein within the matrix fraction from either type of cells (lanes 3 and 6). Probing with mtHSP70 antibodies (Fig. 3 B), which recognize an HSP70 protein located in the mitochondrial matrix or loosely associated with the inner surface of the inner membrane (24Watts F.Z. Walters A.J. Moore A.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), confirms that matrix fraction did indeed contain protein. It can therefore be concluded that the immunoblots shown in Fig. 3 are consistent with the idea that the E270N mutant protein is targeted to and integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane in a manner identical to that of wild-type protein. Such results make it highly unlikely that lack of antimycin A-insensitive respiration of the mutant protein (Fig. 2 A, panel 3) is due to incorrect insertion of this protein into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Successful incorporation into the inner membrane, in turn, suggests that the E270N mutant protein is correctly folded and that lack of activity is not due to misfolding of the protein. In the present work we have probed the active site of the plant alternative oxidase by site-directed mutagenesis. Although a number of other groups have employed mutagenesis techniques to investigate the plant alternative oxidase, specifically residues involved in inhibitor binding (26Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the role of the conserved cysteines in the regulation of oxidase activity (27Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114 (suppl.): 204-205Google Scholar), to our knowledge none have used such techniques to investigate the active site of this enzyme. Although the nature of the active site of the alternative oxidase has remained elusive for a considerable number of years, analysis of a number of cDNAs from a variety of organisms has revealed that the carboxyl-terminal portion of all of the alternative oxidase sequences contain two copies of a Glu-X-X-His iron binding motif (see Refs. 1Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Day D.A. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Siedow J.N. Wiskich J.T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar and 11Wagner A.M. Moore A.L. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Identification of these sequence motifs led to a structural model of the alternative oxidase being proposed in which the catalytic site comprises a binuclear iron center comparable with that found in MMO and R2 (Refs. 13Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 14Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). One of the key residues within the binuclear iron site in both MMO and R2 is a glutamate residue that serves as a bidentate ligand bridging the two iron atoms (28Nordlund P. Eklund H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the model of the catalytic site of the plant alternative oxidase the bridging carboxylate residue is Glu-270 (Fig. 1), which is analogous to Glu-144 of MMO and Glu-115 of R2. In R2 this glutamate residue has previously been demonstrated to be essential for enzyme activity because the mutation severely inhibits iron binding (reducing the amount of bound iron to less than half of that observed with wild-type protein) by eliminating a bridging ligand, thereby resulting in loss of activity (29Persson B.O. Karlsson M. Climent I. Ling J.S. Loehr J.S. Sahlin M. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 247-256Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The close similarity of the proposed active site of the alternative oxidase to that of R2 would suggest that mutation of the corresponding bridging ligand in the plant oxidase should equally destabilize iron binding and hence inhibit enzyme activity. To test the model of the active site and the pivotal importance of the bridging carboxylate, we engineered Glu-270 of the S. guttatum alternative oxidase expressed in S. pombe to an asparagine residue. Immunoblots (Figs. 2 and 3) revealed that the E270N mutated form of the alternative oxidase is still effectively targeted to S. pombe mitochondria. As alternative oxidase protein was imported and processed to the same size as wild-type oxidase, such results suggest that the lack of antimycin-resistant respiration observed with the E270N mutant is not due to the absence of oxidase protein. Because the single difference between the wild-type and mutated form of the alternative oxidase is the conversion of Glu-270 to an asparagine residue, it can be concluded that mutation of this residue has profound inhibitory effects upon the activity of the alternative oxidase. Although we cannot be certain at present, it is highly likely that such inhibitory effects upon enzyme activity are due to the loss of bound iron within the di-iron center, suggesting that this residue is both structurally and functionally important. It is possible that mutation of a glutamate to an asparagine residue, which results in a loss of a negative charge, could have resulted in, following mitochondrial import and processing, a destabilization of the three-dimensional structure of the protein such that it either did not form an integral membrane protein or interfered with the protein fold of the active site. The subfractionation experiments summarized in Fig. 3 support the idea that the E270N mutant protein is specifically localized within the inner mitochondrial membrane in a manner similar to that observed with wild-type protein. Hence it can be concluded that loss of enzymic activity of the mutated protein is unlikely to be due to lack of integration of the protein within the inner membrane. Furthermore published results suggest that one of the remarkable features of di-iron proteins, such as R2, is the stability of its three-dimensional fold. For instance, crystallography studies have shown that the oxidized and reduced forms of R2 are identical (30Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Similarity in fold not only extends to a binuclear manganese form of R2 (31Atta M. Nordlund P. Aberg A. Eklund H. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20682-20688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also to all mutant structures solved to date (see Ref. 29Persson B.O. Karlsson M. Climent I. Ling J.S. Loehr J.S. Sahlin M. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 247-256Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Persson et al. (29Persson B.O. Karlsson M. Climent I. Ling J.S. Loehr J.S. Sahlin M. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 247-256Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) concluded from such results that metals contribute very little to the protein fold in R2 and furthermore that tolerance of the protein structure to charge differences and mobility of side chains within the vicinity of the di-iron site should be very high. It is therefore unlikely that lack of enzymic activity of the E270N alternative oxidase reported in this paper is due to disruption of protein fold, particularly because the mutation is located within the four-helix bundle that acts as the scaffold to bind the iron atoms. A more plausible explanation is, as indicated above, that such a mutation eliminates the bridging ligand and thus severely inhibits iron binding. Berthold (26Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) has used random mutagenesis to identify residues in theArabidopsis thaliana alternative oxidase expressed in E. coli, which may be involved in inhibitor binding. Interestingly, two of these mutations are located in helix 1 (see Refs.13Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 14Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) of the four-helix bundle and therefore place the binding site for the inhibitor SHAM close to the proposed active site. Because SHAM is thought to interfere with binding of reduced ubiquinone (26Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), such studies are compelling evidence in favor of the active site being located in the carboxyl-terminal region. Additional studies into the active site are focusing on the role of other carboxylates and the possible role of tyrosine, located in the putative hydrophobic pocket, in oxygen activation. The yeast heterologous expression system, which we are currently using to answer questions about the structure and function of the plant alternative oxidase can also be extended to allow analysis of the oxidase from other systems.

In the present study, human SMDF was expressed in cultured cell lines. The cells and the recombinant protein were used to examine the membrane association and biological activity of the growth factor. Transfection of cells with SMDF cDNA constructs bearing FLAG epitope tags at either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal ends of the polypeptide resulted in expression of anti-FLAG immunoreactive polypeptides of approximately 44 and 83 kDa. The 83-kDa polypeptide was the major form expressed on the cell surface, as demonstrated by sensitivity to proteolysis in intact cells and surface biotinylation. SMDF was tightly associated with membranes isolated from transfected cells but was solubilized by Triton X-100. Immunofluorescent staining and immunoprecipitation experiments using cells expressing amino- or carboxyl-terminal tagged SMDF revealed that only the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein is exposed on the cell surface. Membranes from SMDF-transfected cells stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-heregulin receptor ErbB3 in Schwann cells. Conditioned medium from transfected cells contained a similar activity, suggesting that SMDF is subject to proteolytic release from the plasma membrane. In contrast with other β-heregulin isoforms, SMDF failed to bind heparin. Stimulation of Schwann cell ErbB3 receptor phosphorylation by SMDF was not affected by inhibition of Schwann cell heparan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis.

Proliferation of Schwann cells during embryonic and early postnatal development is necessary to provide sufficient numbers of Schwann cells to ensheath and myelinate peripheral axons. A series of studies carried out with purified cultures of Schwann cells and sensory nerve cells established that the mitogenic signal that drives Schwann cell proliferation is associated with the axons of these nerve cells (1Wood P. Bunge R.P. Nature. 1975; 256: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Salzer J.L. Bunge R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 3Salzer J.L.

Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This mechanism, in which the Schwann cell mitogen is immobilized on the axonal surface, ensures proper matching of Schwann cell numbers and axons during development. Although the axon-associated mitogen has not been purified, there is evidence that it is a member of the heregulin family of polypeptide growth factors (5Morissey T.K. Levi A.D.O. Nuijens A.

At least 12 heregulin isoforms have been described, all of which appear to be generated by alternative splicing of a single gene (7Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-Mcdonogh O.

All heregulin isoforms contain a domain of approximately 50 amino acids that is homologous to the active domain of EGF and is responsible for receptor binding (9Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G.

Heregulins exert their biological activities by binding and activating receptor tyrosine kinases, called ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4, that bear structural similarity to the EGF receptor (10Holmes W.E.

This leads to activation of cytoplasmic signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which accounts for their mitogenic activity. Results of in situ hybridization studies suggest that the principal form of β-heregulin expressed by sensory nerve cells is sensory and motor neuron-derived factor (SMDF) (13Ho W.-H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Analyses of mouse embryos with targeted heregulin gene mutations provide indirect evidence that SMDF is important for early Schwann cell development (8Meyer D. Yamaai T. Garratt A. Reithmacher-Sonnenberg E. Kane D. Theill L.E. Birchmeier C. Development. 1997; 124: 3575-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMDF contains a β-heregulin EGF homology domain near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein (13Ho W.-H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). With the exception of this domain, however, the rest of the SMDF sequence appears to be unique to this heregulin isoform. The structural variation among isoforms produces multiple molecular forms of heregulins. Some heregulins contain amino-terminal signal peptides that can mediate secretion or membrane insertion of the polypeptides (7Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-Mcdonogh O. Kirk C.

There is evidence that both structural varieties can associate with membranes, however, and/or be released in soluble form into the medium of cultured cells expressing these proteins. These properties could result from the utilization of an internal hydrophobic sequence, present in most heregulins, to mediate membrane insertion and/or function as a membrane-spanning domain. The available data on membrane-associated forms of heregulins suggest these proteins are oriented with the amino-terminal ends exposed to the extracellular space and the carboxyl-terminal ends in the cytoplasm (14Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M. Levy R.B. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Yarden Y.

This orientation places the EGF homology domain of these heregulins on the external side of the plasma membrane. SMDF lacks an apparent amino-terminal signal peptide, but contains an internal hydrophobic sequence that could serve as a membrane insertion site (13Ho W.-H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The structure of SMDF differs from most other heregulin isoforms, however, in that it contains a cysteine-rich domain in place of the Ig domain. In SMDF, as well as some other heregulin isoforms, the EGF homology domain of SMDF is positioned near the carboxyl-terminal end of the polypeptide. Thus, the nature of the association of SMDF with the plasma membrane would have important consequences for its biological activity. Several heregulins have also been shown to bind to heparin and heparan sulfate (10Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D.

Binding of some growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, to cell surface heparan sulfate molecules has been shown to have important consequences for the activities of the factors (19Yayon A.

Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). There is evidence that heparan sulfate-dependent interactions are involved in Schwann cell mitogenesis (18Sudhalter J.

The ability of glial growth factor-2 to activate ErbB receptors and stimulate Schwann cell proliferation is inhibited by exogenous heparin or heparan sulfate or by incubation of the Schwann cells in medium containing an inhibitor of proteoglycan synthesis (18Sudhalter J. Whitehouse L. Rusche J.R. Marchionni M.A. Mahanthappa N.K. Glia. 1996; 17: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to address several specific questions related to SMDF structure and function. The data presented demonstrate that SMDF is a cell surface transmembrane protein that is oriented in the plasma membrane with the carboxyl-terminal EGF homology domain exposed to the extracellular compartment. Membrane-associated SMDF activates ErbB receptors on Schwann cells. In contrast with some heregulin isoforms, SMDF does not bind heparin, and its activity is not dependent on Schwann cell heparan sulfate molecules. Human SMDF cDNA was cloned by nested PCR amplification from a human brain stem cDNA library (LMG2, American Type Culture Collection, 37432). The primers were based on the published human SMDF cDNA sequence (13Ho W.-H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and are shown in Table I. Conditions for PCR reactions were 94 °C for 1 min (denaturation), 60 °C for 2 min (annealing) and 72 °C for 10 min (extension) for 30 cycles. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). The insert was excised from this vector by digestion with EcoRI and subcloned into the plasmid pCMVneo. For the addition of FLAG epitope tags, the insert was reamplified by PCR using primers that overlapped the ends of the protein coding sequence and were extended on their 5′-ends by sequence coding for the FLAG epitope sequence. These products were cloned into the T/A expression plasmid pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). Sequences of expression plasmids were verified by DNA sequence analysis.Table IPrimers used for PCR amplification of human SMDFPrimerSequenceFirst round SenseGCC TCT GCG TGG TAA TGG AC AntisenseAAT GTT CTC ATG CGA CAG GCSecond round SenseCTT CTG GAG GTG AGC CGA TG AntisenseAAG CAG CAC CAA CTG AGC AT Open table in a new tab Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonal kidney (293) cells were transfected with these plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured in DME medium/10% fetal calf serum on uncoated polystyrene tissue culture dishes. To isolate stably transfected lines, 3 days after transfection the cells were switched to growth medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml). Aliquots of cell lysates or membrane fractions were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis on 7.5% or 5–15% polyacrylamide gels. The resolved proteins were blotted onto Immobilon membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG or rabbit polyclonal anti-β-heregulin EGF homology domain antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. To digest SMDF exposed on the cell surface, the cells were incubated in trypsin (2.5 mg/ml) for 2 min. The trypsin solution was removed, the residual trypsin activity was blocked by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.5 mg/ml), and the cells were lysed for immunoblot analysis. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was carried out as follows. Transfected cells were rinsed twice with HBS buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2) and then incubated in HBS containing 0.2 mg/ml NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) for 1 h on ice. The medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed with 0.8 m glycine in HBS, followed by HBS. The cells were scraped into immunoprecipitation buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 × g, and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added (1:1000 final dilution). The samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and then the antibodies were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose. The bound proteins were eluted by incubation of the Sepharose beads in SDS gel sample buffer, separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and stained with anti-FLAG antibodies. To isolate membranes from transfected cells, the cells were lysed in hypotonic HME buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min to prepare a low speed pellet containing plasma membranes. The resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to prepare a high speed pellet, containing the remaining membranes. In some experiments, the membranes in the low speed pellet were purified further. The pellet was resuspended in HME buffer and layered over a solution of 40% sucrose. The tubes were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 1 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman). The purified membranes were recovered from the solution interphase. Cell surface proteins were selectively immunoprecipitated as follows. Transfected cells were rinsed twice with DME medium and then incubated in medium containing anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000 final dilution in DME medium) for 30 min on ice. The antibody solution was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with DME medium. The cells were subjected to hypotonic lysis in HME buffer as described above, and a crude membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 85,000 rpm for 25 min in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant solution was removed, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in HME buffer and layered over 40% sucrose. The tubes were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 1 h. The purified membranes were recovered from the solution interphase, diluted in HME buffer, and centrifuged in the TLA 100.3 rotor as described above. The membranes were dissolved in immunoprecipitation buffer, and the anti-FLAG antibodies were collected by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose. The immunoadsorbed proteins were solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG antibodies. As a control for surface immunoprecipitation, membranes were isolated from transfected cultures, incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies, dissolved in immunoprecipitation buffer, and then treated as described above. Triton X-100 extracts of membranes prepared from SMDF-expressing cells were subjected to heparin affinity chromatography. The extracts were diluted with 0.025 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, mixed overnight at 4 °C with heparin-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer, and then packed into a column. The column flow-through was collected, the beads were washed with equilibration buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by a NaCl step gradient. Aliquots of the flow-through, wash, and elution fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis. A 52-amino acid peptide corresponding to the EGF homology domain of β-heregulin (9Barbacci E.G.

The peptide was used to immunize rabbits using a synthetic adjuvant system (Ribi Immunochemicals). Anti- β-heregulin antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using the synthetic peptide covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. Cells to be used for immunofluorescence microscopy were grown on glass slide chambers. For surface staining, the cells were incubated with primary antibody solution before fixation and without permeabilization. For intracellular staining, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then permeabilized by incubation for 2 min in 0.05% Triton X-100 before incubation with the primary antibody. Blocking and washing steps were carried out as described previously (23Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Schwann cells were prepared from neonatal rat sciatic nerves and cultured as described previously (23Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Schwann cells were exposed to membrane fractions or conditioned medium obtained from SMDF-transfected cells for 15 min in serum-free medium (Ham's F-12, DME medium 1:1, 0.1 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml transferrin) and then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer. Aliquots were incubated with anti-ErbB3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads coated with anti-rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized in buffer containing 2% SDS, and the proteins were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon membranes. The membranes were stained with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Schwann cells were incubated in growth medium supplemented with 1 mm4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xyloside (Sigma) or 30 mm sodium chlorate (Sigma) for 24 h. The media were removed, and the cells were stimulated with SMDF as described above. Human SMDF cDNA was cloned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence of this cDNA matched the published human SMDF sequence reported previously (13Ho W.-H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and contained coding information for a polypeptide with a predicted M r of approximately 32,000. The SMDF cDNA was used to generate several full-length expression constructs, including forms with FLAG epitope tags at the amino-terminal (NT-SMDF) or carboxyl-terminal (CT-SMDF) end of the protein coding sequence (Fig. 1,top). These were used for transient and stable transfection of CHO cells and human embryonic kidney (293) cells. Similar results were obtained in all cases. Transfected cells expressed an 83-kDa polypeptide that was not seen in untransfected cells or cells transfected with vector lacking the SMDF cDNA insert. An apparently identical 83-kDa product was seen in cells transfected with NT-SMDF or CT-SMDF (detected on immunoblots with anti-FLAG antibody) or SMDF lacking an epitope tag (detected with anti-EGF homology domain antibodies). In most experiments, an additional band of 43 kDa was also seen in SMDF-transfected cells. Anti-FLAG immunoreactive polypeptides of identical sizes were seen in cells transfected with NT-SMDF or CT-SMDF. This suggests that these polypeptides contain the full-length SMDF sequence and that SMDF undergoes some type of processing or modification to produce the 83-kDa product. An alternative possibility that cannot be excluded is that the 43-kDa bands seen in NT-SMDF- and CT-SMDF-transfected cells are proteolytic fragments of SMDF that result from cleavage at a site that produces amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal products of identical size. Since the 83-kDa product is the cell surface form of SMDF (see below) the 43-kDa band was not characterized further. The deduced amino acid sequence of human SMDF lacks an apparent amino-terminal signal peptide to mediate either secretion or membrane insertion of the polypeptide. There is, however, an internal hydrophobic sequence that could function as an uncleaved membrane insertion signal. To determine whether SMDF was expressed on the cell surface, transfected cells were treated with trypsin. As shown in Fig. 2 A, trypsin removed completely the slow migrating form of SMDF, but it had no effect on the fast migrating form. These results suggest that the 83-kDa form of SMDF is expressed on the cell surface and that the 43-kDa form is intracellular. This conclusion was further supported by results of cell surface labeling of SMDF-expressing cells. Surface proteins were covalently labeled with biotin by incubation of intact cells with a membrane-impermeant protein-modifying reagent. Immunoprecipitation of lysates from these cells with anti-FLAG antibodies and detection of biotin-labeled polypeptides with an avidin-conjugated probe revealed mainly the 83-kDa form of SMDF (Fig. 2 B). To provide additional evidence for membrane association of SMDF, transfected cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation. When CHO cells that were stably transfected with NT-SMDF were lysed in the absence of detergent and subjected to differential centrifugation, the bulk of SMDF was present in the low speed pellet that was enriched in plasma membranes (Fig. 3 A). Only small amounts of SMDF were present in the high speed pellet, composed mainly of membranes of intracellular organelles. SMDF was not detected in the soluble fraction of the cells (Fig. 3 A). SMDF was also associated a purified membrane fraction obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to these results, when the fractionation was carried out in buffer containing the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, all of the SMDF was recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3 A). SMDF appeared to be tightly associated with cell membranes, based on the finding that extraction of the low speed pellet with 1m KCl did not solubilize the protein (Fig. 3 B). Some β-heregulins bind heparin/heparan sulfate and, thus, have the potential to associate with membranes by noncovalent binding to membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Extraction of the low speed pellet with buffer containing soluble heparin did not solubilize SMDF (Fig. 3 B), indicating that association of SMDF with the membranes was not dependent on interactions with heparan sulfate. Expression of SMDF on the plasma membrane has the potential to generate growth factor molecules that can activate heregulin receptors on adjacent cells. This property would be dependent on the orientation of the polypeptide within the plasma membrane, however. The EGF homology domain of SMDF is located near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein (Fig. 1 A). To determine the orientation of SMDF within the plasma membrane, CHO cells that were transiently transfected with either NT-SMDF or CT-SMDF were stained with anti-FLAG antibodies as either intact or permeabilized cells. As shown in Fig. 4, staining of SMDF on the surface of intact cells was observed only with CT-SMDF (A) and not with NT-SMDF (B). Staining of both forms of SMDF was observed when fixed cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Fig. 4, C and D). Identical results were obtained in 293 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that SMDF is oriented in the plasma membrane with the carboxyl-terminal end exposed to the extracellular space. This orientation is consistent with the utilization of an internal, uncleaved signal peptide, which would direct the insertion of SMDF as a type II transmembrane protein. Furthermore, this orientation places the active EGF homology domain of SMDF on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. Additional evidence for this membrane orientation was provided by results of immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells that were transfected with either CT-SMDF or NT-SMDF were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies. The unbound antibodies were removed, and the cells were lysed without use of detergent and used to prepare membrane fractions. The membranes were dissolved in immunoprecipitation buffer, and the FLAG antibodies were isolated by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the 83-kDa form of CT-SMDF, but not NT-SMDF, was isolated by this procedure. In contrast, when membranes were isolated from CT-SMDF- or NT-SMDF-transfected cells and then incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies and purified by adsorption to Protein A-Sepharose, both the 83- and 43-kDa forms of CT-SMDF and NT-SMDF were isolated (Fig. 5 A). These results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal, but not the amino-terminal, end of SMDF is exposed to the extracellular environment. They also demonstrate that the amino-terminal FLAG epitope is accessible to the antibody in the absence of detergent. Finally, these results provide additional evidence that the 83-kDa SMDF is the cell surface form. Essentially identical results were obtained when CT-SMDF- and NT-SMDF-transfected cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies and then lysed with detergent before the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Fig. 5 B). Significant amounts of SMDF were immunoprecipitated only from cells expressing the CT-SMDF. β-heregulins exert their biological activities by binding to and activating the receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB2, ErbB3"

Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP)1 has been of significant medical interest ever since tests screening for serum PAP levels were successfully used to diagnose and stage prostate cancer (1Gutman E.B. Sproul E.E. Gutman A.B. Am. J. Cancer. 1936; 28: 485-496Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Recently, the primary diagnostic protocol for detecting prostate cancer has shifted from evaluating serum PAP levels to utilizing the prostate specific antigen test. However, accurately detecting serum PAP levels is still of considerable interest because of its effectiveness in staging metastatic prostatic cancer and evaluating the progress of chemotherapy in prostate cancer patients (2Shetty S.D. Cerny J.C. Henry Ford Hosp. Med. J. 1992; 40: 93-98PubMed Google Scholar).PAP, which is produced by the prostate gland, is found in the seminal fluid at concentrations near 1 mg/ml (3Rönnberg L. Vihko P. Sajanti E. Vihko R. Int. J. Androl. 1981; 4: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The enzyme is categorized as an acid phosphatase, because its optimum pH range is between 4 and 7. PAP belongs to the family of high molecular weight phosphatases. Mature PAP is active as a glycosylated homodimer withM r = ∼100,000. The enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing a wide spectrum of substrates including alkyl, aryl, and acyl orthophosphate monoesters and phosphorylated proteins (4Apostol I. Kuciel R. Wasylewska E. Ostrowski W. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1985; 32: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). The natural substrate for PAP is uncertain, thus, the discovery of the specific biological function is of great interest and awaits further investigations.The catalytic mechanism has been intensely studied and it was concluded that the enzyme should be classified as a histidine phosphatase (5Van Etten R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 390: 27-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The crucial intermediate is phosphoroamidate, namely phosphohistidine. The rate-limiting step is the breakdown of this covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate through addition of a nucleophilic water molecule to phosphoroamidate with concomitant elimination of inorganic phosphate, via a SN2 mechanism, to form a noncovalent binary enzyme-inorganic phosphate complex.

It is specific for acid phosphatases; in addition to PAP, it also inhibits homologous lysosomal acid phosphatases and acid phosphatases isolated from such tissues as liver, bone, and kidney, which are usually not present in the blood serum (6Roy A.V. Brower M.E. Hayden J.E. Clin. Chem. 1971; 17: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The inhibition is a stereospecific property because d(−)-tartrate and mesotartrate are only very poor inhibitors. On the other hand, other α-hydroxycarboxylic acids have been tested, and it was concluded that the inhibitor must possess an α-hydroxyl group in thed-configuration. The β-carbon must be part of a carboxyl group or be attached to a carboxyl or hydroxyl group (7Kilsheimer G.S. Axelrod B. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, these studies were based on data at 3 Å resolution and yielded only poor density for the ligand. In addition, a wrong stereoisomer of the tartrate model was used.Nontoxic and specific inhibitors of PAP should be a valuable tool in the search for its natural substrate(s).

The purified enzyme migrated as a 45-kDa protein upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, but eluted as a 90-kDa protein upon Superose gel filtration in the presence of Nonidet P-40, suggesting that the enzyme forms homodimers under non-denatured conditions. The enzyme transferred glucuronic acid to various glycoprotein acceptors bearing terminal N-acetyllactosamine structure such as asialo-orosomucoid, asialo-fetuin, and asialo-neural cell adhesion molecule, whereas little activity was detected to paragloboside, a precursor glycolipid of the HNK-1 epitope on glycolipids. These results suggested that the enzyme is specifically associated with the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope on glycoproteins. Sphingomyelin was specifically required for expression of the enzyme activity. Stearoyl-sphingomyelin (18:0) was the most effective, followed by palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (16:0) and lignoceroyl-sphingomyelin (24:0).

Various cell surface carbohydrate moieties are thought to be involved in cell-to-cell interactions (1Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J. Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 2Jessell T.M. Hynes M.A. Dodd J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope, which is recognized by HNK-1 monoclonal antibody, is found on many neural cell adhesion molecules, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)1 (3Kruse J. Mailhammer R. Wernecke H. Faissner A. Sommer I. Goridis C. Schachner M. Nature. 1984; 311: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), myelin-associated glycoproteins (4McGarry R.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12149-12161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope is spatially and temporally regulated during development, and its highest expression is seen at the stages where the neural networks are constructed in the central and peripheral nervous systems (8Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 9Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Watanabe Y. Mori K. J.

Biol. 1987; 120: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The HNK-1 epitope is presumed to be involved in cell-to-cell interactions such as cell adhesion (11Keilhauer G. Faissner A. Schachner M. Nature. 1985; 316: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), migration (12Bronner-Fraser M. Dev.

Neurosci. 1992; 4: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The epitope is expressed not only on glycoproteins but also on glycolipids. The structures of the HNK-1 reactive glycolipids are: SGGL-1 (HSO3-GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer) and SGGL-2 (HSO3-GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer) (14Chou D.K.H.

The inner unit of their glycolipids, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1, is commonly found in mammalian glycoproteins and glycolipids, and the unique feature of this epitope is the terminal sulfo-3-glucuronyl group. This structure was shown to be essential not only for immunoreactivity with HNK-1 monoclonal antibodies (16Ilyas A.A. Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. Costello C. Quarles R.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1512-1516PubMed Google Scholar) but also for their functions (17Schmitz B. Schachner M. Ito Y. Nakano T. Ogawa T. Glycoconjugate J. 1994; 11: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to study the functions of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope during construction of the central and peripheral nervous systems, it is important to characterize the glucuronyltransferase that transfers glucuronic acid from uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid to the terminalN-acetyllactosamine structure of glycoproteins and glycolipids. In our previous study, it was demonstrated that there are two types of glucuronyltransferases associated with the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope in rat brain, one for glycolipid acceptors (18Kawashima C. Terayama K. Ii M. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the other for glycoprotein acceptors (19Oka S. Terayama K. Kawashima C. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22711-22714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar glucuronyltransferase activities were found in chick (20Das K.K. Basu M. Basu S. Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5238-5243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (21Chou D.K.H. Flores S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17941-17947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) brains with paragloboside as an acceptor. In this study, a glucuronyltransferase specific for glycoprotein acceptors (GlcAT-P) was purified to apparent homogeneity from postnatal 2-week rat forebrains by means of various column chromatographies. The enzyme is a 45-kDa protein, which requires sphingomyelin (SM) for the expression of its transferase activity. UDP-[14C]GlcA (10.2 GBq/mmol) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals.

Postnatal 2-week Wistar rats were purchased from Oriental Bio-service (Kyoto, Japan). The Wistar rats were anesthetized with diethylether and then sacrificed. Their brains were removed and immediately frozen on dry ice. The frozen rat brains were stored at −80 °C. ASOR-Sepharose 4B and anti-NCAM antibody-conjugated Sepharose 4B were performed by coupling ASOR (300 mg) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (30 ml) and AF11 antibody (5 mg) to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (5 ml), respectively, according to the procedure described previously (19Oka S.

UDP-GlcA-Sepharose 4B was prepared by coupling UDP-GlcA (1 g) to EAH-Sepharose 4B (100 ml) according to the procedure described by Anttinen and Kivurikko (24Anttinen H. Kivirikko K.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Glucuronyltransferase activity toward glycoprotein acceptors was measured essentially as described previously (19Oka S. Terayama K. Kawashima C. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22711-22714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Incubation was carried out 37 °C for 3 h in an assay mixture comprising 20 μg of ASOR, 100 μm UDP-[14C]GlcA (2×105dpm), 200 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 20 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 2 μl of a 2% Nonidet P-40 extract of rat forebrain, which had been treated at 100 °C for 3 min, in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation, the assay mixture was spotted onto a 2.5-cm Whatman No. 1 disc and the radioactivity of [14C]GlcA-ASOR on the discs was counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6000). Protein was quantitated with a Micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) unless otherwise stated. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Homogenizing buffer consisted of 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml PMSF.

Buffer K consisted of 10 mm MES butter, pH6.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mNaCl. Preparation of the enzyme source and the following purification procedure were carried out at 4 °C. Sixty frozen rat forebrains (60 g) were thawed and homogenized with five volumes of the homogenizing buffer. Each homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet was suspended in five volumes of the extracting buffer for 1 h, and then the suspension was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was reextracted once more with three volumes of the extracting buffer. To the combined extracts glycerol was added to give a final concentration of 20%. The resulting solution (Nonidet P-40 extract) could be stored at −20 °C for at least 2 months without loss of activity. CM-Sepharose CL-6B (50 ml) equilibrated with buffer A was added to the Nonidet P-40 extract prepared above. After shaking for 1 h, the suspension was filtered through a glass filter (CM-unbound fraction). The CM-unbound fraction was applied to a UDP-GlcA-Sepharose 4B column (100 ml; 5 × 5.5 cm), which had been equilibrated with 500 ml of buffer B. After washing the column, the enzyme was eluted with buffer C. The flow-through fraction was applied to a UDP-GlcA-Sepharose 4B column once more, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer C. To the combined eluate, glycerol, MnCl2, and UDP were added to final concentrations of 20%, 20 mm, and 0.1 mm, respectively. The eluate from the UDP-GlcA-Sepharose 4B column was applied to an ASOR-Sepharose 4B column (30 ml; 5 × 1.8 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer D. After washing the column with buffer D and then buffer E, glucuronyltransferase activity was eluted with 200 ml of buffer E containing 10 mm N-acetyllactosamine. The eluate from the ASOR-Sepharose 4B column was dialyzed against buffer F. The dialysate was applied to a Matrex gel Blue A column (2 ml; 1.5 × 1.2 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer F. The enzyme was recovered by elution with buffer G. The eluate from the Matrex gel Blue A column was dialyzed against buffer H, and then the dialysate was applied to a Mono Q column (1 ml; 0.6 × 5.2 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer H. Elution of the enzyme was carried out with buffer H containing a linear gradient of NaCl, from 10 mm to 1 m. The eluate from the Mono Q column was applied to a HiTrap chelating column (1 ml; 1.0 × 2.4 cm), which had been chelated with copper ions and equilibrated with buffer I. The enzyme was eluted with buffer I containing a linear gradient of glycine, from 0 to 30 mm. The eluate from the HiTrap chelating column was dialyzed against buffer J, and then applied to a HiTrap heparin column, which had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with buffer J containing a gradient of NaCl, from 0.1 to 1.5 m. Enzyme fractions were treated with dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 100 mm prior to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed with a 10% polyacrylamide gel and the buffer system of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The protein bands were stained with a silver stain kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Approximately 100 ng of the purified enzyme was applied to a Superose 12 column (25 ml; 1 × 30 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer K. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. Total lipids were extracted from lyophilized rat brains (8.4 g) twice with 200 ml of chloroform-methanol, 2:1 (v/v), and then once with 250 ml of chloroform-methanol, 1:1 (v/v). The chloroform-methanol extract was subjected to Folch's partitioning (26Folch J. Ascoli I. Less M. Meath J.A. LeBaron F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 833-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower phase (1.87 g) was charged onto a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (2 × 40 cm, acetate form; Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology) equilibrated with chloroform-methanol-water, 30:60:8 (v/v), and then the column was eluted successively with the same solvent (five bed volumes) and with 0.45 m ammonium acetate in methanol (five bed volumes). One-eighth of the unbound lipid fraction was applied to an Alumina column (1 × 20 cm, ICN Alumina N-Super I; ICN Biomedicals GmbH, Eschwege, Germany). The column was successively eluted with 200 ml each of chloroform, chloroform-methanol, 95:5 (v/v), and chloroform-methanol 80:20 (v/v), and then chloroform-methanol-water, 60:40:10 (v/v). Phosphatidylcholine (PC, 23 mg) was recovered from the chloroform-methanol (95:5) eluate in an almost homogeneous state, a mixture (40 mg) of PC, SM, and lyso-PC from the chloroform-methanol (80:20) eluate, and a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and lyso-PE from the chloroform-methanol-water eluate. Separation of PE and lyso-PE was carried out by Iatrobeads column (1 × 60 cm, 6RS-8060; Iatron Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) chromatography. The column was eluted with a solvent mixture of chloroform-methanol-water, 65:25:4 (v/v). The yields of PE and lyso-PE fractions were 14.9 and 7.0 mg, respectively. The phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) fractions, bound to the DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column, and then recovered by elution with 0.45 m ammonium acetate in methanol, were subjected to Iatrobeads column (2 × 60 cm, 6RS-8060) chromatography. The column was eluted with a solvent mixture of chloroform-methanol-water, 65:25:4 (v/v). The yields of the PS and PI fractions were 42 and 20 mg, respectively. One-fourth of the unbound lipid fraction recovered on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography was applied to a QAE-Sephadex A-25 (OH− form; Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology) column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with chloroform-methanol-water, 30:60:8 (v/v). The unbound lipid fraction from the column was evaporated, acetylated, and then fractionated on a Florisil column (1 × 20 cm, 60–100 mesh; Floriden Co., New York, NY) by the method of Saito and Hakomori (27Saito T. Hakomori S. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. The acetylated neutral glycolipid fraction and the acetylated SM fraction were deacetylated with 0.5 m KOH in methanol at 37 °C for 6 h. The yield of the deacetylated neutral glycolipid fraction containing ceramide mono-, di-, and trisaccharides was 2.7 mg. The deacetylated SM fraction was applied to an Iatrobeads column (4.6 mm × 25 cm, 6RS-8010), and the column was eluted with a solvent mixture of chloroform-methanol-water, 65:25:4 (v/v), at 40 °C. SMs were prepared by N-acylation of lyso-SM (sphingosylphosphorylcholine) with fatty acylchlorides (28Kopaczyk K.C. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 140-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SM isolated from bovine brain was partially hydrolyzed with 6m HCl-butanol, 1:1 (v/v), at 100 °C for 1 h for preparation of lyso-SM (29Kaller H. Biochem. Z. 1961; 334: 451-456PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hara A. Taketomi T. J. Biochem. 1983; 94: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A mixture of 5 mg of lyso-SM, 0.4 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and 0.5 ml of 50% aqueous sodium acetate was added to about 5 mg of fatty acylchloride (stearoylchloride, oleoylchloride, lignoceroylchloride, or nervonoylchloride; Funacoshi Co., Tokyo, Japan), and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for 2 h at 20 °C. The synthetic product was treated with 0.1 mmethanolic NaOH and then purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described above. The purified SM was identified by TLC and infrared spectroscopy. The yields were 2.1 mg forN-stearoyl-, 2.5 mg for N-oleoyl-, 3.0 mg forN-lignoceroyl-, and 3.1 mg for N-nervonoyl-SM, respectively. Frozen and thawed postnatal 2-week rat brains were homogenized with a Positron homogenizer in five volumes of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting pellet was suspended in five volumes of the same buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 to extract NCAM. After stirring for 1 h, the suspension was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 30 min. From the supernatant, NCAM was purified on an AF11-Sepharose 4B column (5 ml). NCAM bound to the column was eluted with 0.1 m diethylamine containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, and 1 mm EDTA. For desialization of the purified NCAM, 10 μg of NCAM was treated with 50 milliunits of neuraminidase (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 4 h. The results of purification of a glucuronyltransferase from rat brain are summarized in Table I. A preliminary study indicated that more than half of the glucuronyltransferase activity in the homogenate was recovered in the 105,000 ×g pellet, suggesting that the enzyme is mostly associated with the microsomal fraction. Treatment of the pellet with either 1m NaCl or phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C did not release the enzyme activity, suggesting that the enzyme is an intrinsic membrane protein. Extraction of the pellet with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 released the glucuronyltransferase activity into the soluble fraction.Table IPurification of the glucuronyltransferase specific for glycoprotein acceptorsTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgnmol/minnmol/mg/min%-fold0.5% Nonidet P-40 extract68,1002320.003411001CM-Sepharose CL-6B63,9002530.003961091.2UDP-GlcA-Sepharose 4B12,7002150.0078792.62.3ASOR-Sepharose 4B2.7821.37.65(9.16)1-aThe assay was carried out in the presence of N-acetyllactosamine and glycerol, both of which inhibited the glucuronyltransferase activity significantly.(2,250)1-aThe assay was carried out in the presence of N-acetyllactosamine and glycerol, both of which inhibited the glucuronyltransferase activity significantly.DyeMatrex Gel Blue A1.1588.376.838.022,500Mono Q0.092532.935614.2104,000HiTrap chelating0.03221.86819.4200,000HiTrap heparin (1st)0.004411.52,6005.0768,000HiTrap heparin (2nd)0.00229.44,3004.01,220,0001-a The assay was carried out in the presence of N-acetyllactosamine and glycerol, both of which inhibited the glucuronyltransferase activity significantly. Open table in a new tab As the first step of purification, the Nonidet P-40 extract was subjected to CM-Sepharose CL-6B cation exchange chromatography. Essentially all the glucuronyltransferase activity was recovered in the unbound fraction, with a specific activity increase of 1.2-fold. The next step of the purification involved UDP-GlcA affinity chromatography. A preliminary experiment indicated that essentially all (97%) the glucuronyltransferase activity toward glycolipid acceptors, with neolactotetraose-phenyl-C14H29(nLc-PA14) as a substrate (19Oka S. Terayama K. Kawashima C. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22711-22714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was recovered in the pass-through fraction, while a larger portion of the activity toward glycoprotein acceptors, with ASOR as a substrate, was recovered in the eluate fraction. Consistent with this preliminary result, approximately 93% of the glucuronyltransferase activity in the CM-Sepharose CL-6B-unbound fraction was recovered in the eluate fraction with a purification of about 2-fold. The third step of the purification involved ASOR-conjugated Sepharose affinity chromatography. Among several buffers tested, a buffer containing 10 mm N-acetyllactosamine was effective for elution of the activity from the column. BecauseN-acetyllactosamine and glycerol inhibited the glucuronyltransferase activity, the apparent yield of the enzymatic activity in the eluate fraction was very low (9% that of the Nonidet P-40 extract; see Table I). However, after dialysis, the activity recovered to more than 30% that of the Nonidet P-40 extract. The purification achieved with this ASOR-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography was over 1,000-fold. The fourth step of the purification involved dye ligand affinity chromatography. A Matrex gel Blue A column was found to retain the glucuronyltransferase activity. 1 m NaCl was effective for dissociating the enzyme from the column, with a 10-fold increase in the specific activity. The fifth step of the purification involved Mono Q anion exchange chromatography. The glucuronyltransferase activity was mainly eluted in fractions 43–47 (Fig. 1), in which the concentration of NaCl was around 0.4 m. Because of the low amount of proteins in each fraction, protein quantification and SDS-PAGE were carried out with several (five to seven) fractions combined. Five-fold purification was achieved through this step. In the following purification steps (HiTrap chelating and HiTrap heparin columns), the protein concentrations were determined in the same way. The sixth step of the purification involved HiTrap chelating metal chelate affinity chromatography. Mono Q eluate fractions 43–47 were pooled and applied to a HiTrap chelating column, which had been chelated with Cu2+. The glucuronyltransferase activity was eluted at a glycine concentration of 15 mm (fractions 22–28 in Fig. 2). Two-fold purification was achieved at this step. The last step of the purification involved HiTrap heparin affinity chromatography, utilizing the inhibitory activity of heparin, as shown in Table II. The glucuronyltransferase bound to the column and was eluted in fractions 43–47 at a NaCl concentration of around 0.7 m (Fig. 3 A). Upon SDS-PAGE, a major band of 45 kDa was observed, with a few minor bands. Since these minor bands were predominant components in the previous fractions,i.e. fractions 38–42, the HiTrap heparin affinity chromatography was repeated. The glucuronyltransferase thus obtained gave a single band corresponding to 45 kDa upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B).Table IISubstrate specificity of the purified enzyme, as measured by inhibition assayingInhibitorConcentrationInhibition%N-Acetyllactosamine5 mm95Lacto-N-biose5 mm0.0Lactose5 mm23nLc-Cer5 mm13Heparin1.0 mg/ml90Heparan sulfate1.0 mg/ml36Hyaluronic acid1.0 mg/ml9.5Chondroitin1.0 mg/ml0.0GlcA10 mm0.0UDP10 mm98UDP-GlcA10 mm99UDP-GlcNAc10 mm67CMP-NeuAc10 mm1.5The glucuronyltransferase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of various inhibitors.

Open table in a new tab The glucuronyltransferase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of various inhibitors. The concentration of ASOR in the assay mixture was changed from 20 μg to 5 μg. The data are the mean values for three determinations in a representative experiment. The 45-kDa protein was shown to have a SH-group specifically protected by UDP-GlcA when the eluate fraction on Matrex gel Blue A column chromatography was treated withN-maleimidopropionyl-biocytin (MPB) according to the procedure of Pukazhenthi et al. (31Pukazhenthi B.S. Muniappa N. Vijay I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6445-6452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these results, the 45-kDa protein was tentatively concluded to be a glucuronyltransferase. This conclusion was finally confirmed by our recent successful cDNA cloning of a HNK-1-associated glucuronyltransferase on the basis of the partial amino acid sequence of the purified protein (32Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the glucuronyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope on glycoprotein acceptors (GlcAT-P) was purified to apparent homogeneity from postnatal 2-week rat forebrains, with 1,200,000-fold purification and a 4.0% overall recovery (Table I). Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography of the purified glucuronyltransferase indicated that the molecular mass of the enzyme was approximately 90 kDa, as shown in Fig. 4. This value is almost 2 times larger than that determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (45 kDa, Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the enzyme occurs as a homodimer of 45-kDa polypeptides under non-denaturing conditions. In order to study the substrate specificity of purified enzyme, we analyzed the effects of various compounds on the glucuronyltransferase activity toward ASOR (Table II).N-Acetyllactosamine at the concentration of 5 mmhad a very potent (95%) inhibitory effect. In contrast, lacto-N-biose (Galβ1–3GlcNAc) and lactose (Galβ1–4Glc) had no or little effect on the enzymatic activity (0% and 23%, respectively), indicating that the enzyme recognizes not only the terminal sugars on the acceptor molecules but also the penultimate sugars and their linkage positions. Hyaluronic acid and chondroitin had little or no inhibitory effect (9.5% and 0%, respectively), whereas heparin and heparan sulfate decreased the enzymatic activity (90% and 36%, respectively). These results may indicate that heparin and heparan sulfate act as acceptors for the enzyme but that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin do not. However, the purified enzyme did not show any transferase activity toward any of these glycosaminoglycans (data not shown). With regard to donor specificity, UDP and UDP-GlcA exhibited strong inhibitory effects (99% and 98%, respectively), followed by UDP-GlcNAc (67%). In contrast, GlcA and CMP-NeuAc had no or little effect on the activity (0.0% and 1.5%, respectively). These results suggest that the enzyme principally recognizes the terminal non-reducing N-acetyllactosamine structure in the sugar chains on glycoproteins and the nucleotide portion of UDP-GlcA. In order to determine the effect of the polypeptide portion of the acceptor glycoconjugates, various asialo-glycoproteins and glycolipids were tested as acceptors, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified enzyme sufficiently transferred the glucuronic acid to asialo-NCAM and asialo-fetuin (72% and 87% of that in the case of ASOR, respectively). In contrast, asialo-thyroglobulin, which contains high mannose-type sugar chains, as well as complex-type sugar chains, was a poor acceptor of the enzyme. Interestingly, GlcAT-P did not show any activity toward paragloboside, a precursor glycolipid of the HNK-1 epitope. The dependence of the rate of the glucuronyltransferase reaction on the concentrations of ASOR and UDP-GlcA was examined, and their kinetic parameters were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plotting (data not shown). The K m values for ASOR and UDP-GlcA were 1.9 and 22 μm, respectively. TheV max value of the enzyme (4.5 units/mg) is comparable to those reported for the purified glycosyltransferases from the Golgi apparatus, such as GM2/GD2 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (3.6 units/mg) (33Hashimoto Y. Sekine M. Iwasaki K. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25857-25864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α2,6-sialyltransferase (8.2 units/mg) (34Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13835-13844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α1,3-galactosyltransferase (4.3 units/mg) (35Blanken W.M. Van den Eijnden D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12927-12934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and β1,2-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (28 units/mg) (36Nishikawa Y. Pegg W. Paulson H. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8270-8281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of various divalent cations on the glucuronyltransferase activity were determined. Among those tested, Mn2+activated the enzyme most effectively. Co2+ and Mg2+ showed 20% and 14% of the activity of Mn2+, respectively. Ca2+, Ba2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ had no effect on the enzyme at all (data not shown). To our surprise, during the process of purification, the enzyme activity disappeared almost completely at the step of Matrex gel Blue A affinity chromatography (with approximately 22,500-fold purification). However, the activity was recovered when an aliquot of an Nonidet P-40 extract was added to the assay mixture, suggesting that GlcAT-P requires some kinds of activator(s) for its catalytic activity. This presumed activator was stable on heating at 100 °C for 3 min. Therefore, we carried out the enzyme assay in the presence of a saturating amount of the heat-treated Nonidet P-40 extract in the following purification steps, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We tried to identify the activator present in postnatal 14-day rat brains. First, we found that the chloroform-methanol extract of rat brains can substitute for the heat-inactivated Nonidet P-40 extract. Upon Folch partitioning (26Folch J. Ascoli I. Less M. Meath J.A. LeBaron F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 833-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the organic solvent layer (Folch lower phase) activated the enzyme effectively in a saturable manner, but the upper phase did not (Fig. 5, Aand B). These lines of evidence indicated that the activator is a kind of lipid. Then, the respective lipid components were prepared from the Folch's lower phase according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their stimulatory activity was measured. Table III shows the amount of each lipid that gives 50% of the full activity (in the presence of heat-treated Nonidet P-40 extract). It is clear that SM caused recovery of the enzymatic activity most effectively (5.2 μg for 50% recovery), followed by PC. In contrast, PE, PS, PI, and neutral glycolipids did not have a positive effect. It should be noted that almost all the stimulatory activity in the Folch lower phase was accounted for by SM.Table IIIEffects of various lipids on the catalytic activity of the partially purified glucuronyltransferaseLipidAmount of lipid giving 50% activationμgSphingomyelin5.2Phosphatidylcholine91.4Phosphatidylethanolamine>600Phosphatidylserine>1200Phosphatidylinositol>1200Neutral glycolipids>1200The glucuronyltransferase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of various amounts of lipids purified from the Folch lower phase.

The data indicate the amounts of lipids required to give 50% of the full activity observed in the presence of a saturating amount of the heat-treated Nonidet P-40 extract. In order to determine the effect of the fatty acid composition on the stimulatory activity, several SM molecules with a single species of acyl group were synthesized, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their activities were compared. Interestingly, the stimulatory activity of SM was extremely affected by the fatty acid composition (Table IV). As for the length of the acyl group, stearoyl-SM (18:0) was the most effective activator, followed by palmitoyl-SM (16:0) and lignoceroyl-SM (24:0). More interestingly, SM with a saturated acyl group activated the enzyme remarkably, while that with an unsaturated acyl group did not show any stimulatory activity regardless of the length of the acyl group. The most abundant acyl group in rat brain SM is the stearoyl group (37Abe T. Norton W.T. J. Neurochem. 1974; 23: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is in fact the most effective acyl group as an activator. Phosphatidylcholine, which has phosphocholine as a hydrophilic group like SM, stimulated the enzyme activity, although the activity was 20 times less than that of SM. It should be noted, in this context, that more than 90% of the phosphatidylcholine in the rat brain has an unsaturated acyl group. Ceramide, on the other hand, had no stimulatory effect, even if it had a stearoyl acyl group.Table IVEffects of various acyl groups of SM on the activity of the partially purified glucuronyltransferaseLipidAmount of lipid giving 50% activationμgSphingomyelin (16:0)4.2Sphingomyelin (18:0)3.8Sphingomyelin (18:1)>100Sphingomyelin (24:0)10.5Sphingomyelin (24:1)>100Ceramide>100The glucuronyltransferase activity in the eluate obtained on Matrex gel Blue A column chromatography was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of various amounts of lipids.

The data indicate the amounts of lipids required to give 50% of the control value (in the presence of the heat-treated Nonidet P-40 extract). Recently, some phospholipids were reported to stimulate the activities of glycosyltransferases, such as hepatic glucuronyltransferase (38Zakim D. Cantor M. Eibl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5164-5169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β1–4-galactosyltransferase (39Mitranic M.M. Boggs J.M. Moscarello M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13109-13115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcAT-P was activated dramatically in the presence of SM. Many glycosyltransferases that have so far been cloned are type II transmembrane proteins located in the Golgi apparatus (41Gillespie W. Kelm S. Paulson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21004-21010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcAT-P is also believed to be a type II transmembrane protein in the Golgi or ER membrane, on the basis of its characteristic hydropathy profile (32Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and also the requirement of detergents for its solubilization. Two phospholipids, which contain phosphocholine as a hydrophilic group, stimulated the enzymatic activity in common, suggesting that the phosphocholine group of these phospholipids interacts with the luminal portion of the enzyme through an electrostatic interaction. Interestingly, in the cellular membrane system, SM is localized predominantly in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and the Golgi lumen (42Nilsson O.S. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 464: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This is in good agreement with the putative location of the catalytic domain of this glucuronyltransferase, the Golgi lumen. These lines of evidence suggest that expression of the HNK-1 epitope on glycoproteins can be regulated not only by the expression of the enzyme protein but also by the micro-circumstances around the enzyme, especially by SM. We thank Hiroko Yamaguchi and Yasuko Nagao for their excellent secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1988607615,"While sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins interact predominantly in the DNA major groove, DNA polymerases bind DNA through interactions in the minor groove that are sequence nonspecific. Through functional analyses of alanine-substituted mutant enzymes that were guided by molecular dynamics modeling of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1-reverse transcriptase and DNA complex, we previously identified a structural element in reverse transcriptase, the minor groove binding track (MGBT). The MGBT is comprised of five residues (Ile94, Gln258, Gly262, Trp266, and Gln269) which interact 2–6 base pairs upstream from the polymerase active site in the DNA minor groove and are important in DNA binding, processivity, and frameshift fidelity. These residues do not contribute equally; functional analysis of alanine mutants suggests that Trp266contributes the most to binding. To define the molecular interactions between Trp266 and the DNA minor groove, we have analyzed the properties of eight mutants, each with an alternate side chain at this position. A refined molecular dynamics model was used to calculate relative binding free energies based on apolar surface area buried upon complex formation. In general, there was a strong correlation between the relative calculated binding free energies for the alternate residue 266 side chains and the magnitude of the change in the properties which reflect template-primer interactions (template-primer dissociation rate constant, K i,AZTTP, processivity, and frameshift fidelity). This correlation suggests that hydrophobic interactions make a major contribution to the stability of the polymerase-DNA complex. Additionally, tyrosine and arginine substitutions resulted in mutant enzymes with DNA binding properties better than predicted by buried surface area alone, suggesting that hydrogen bonding could also play a role in DNA binding at this position. While sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins interact predominantly in the DNA major groove, DNA polymerases bind DNA through interactions in the minor groove that are sequence nonspecific.

These residues do not contribute equally; functional analysis of alanine mutants suggests that Trp266contributes the most to binding. To define the molecular interactions between Trp266 and the DNA minor groove, we have analyzed the properties of eight mutants, each with an alternate side chain at this position. A refined molecular dynamics model was used to calculate relative binding free energies based on apolar surface area buried upon complex formation. In general, there was a strong correlation between the relative calculated binding free energies for the alternate residue 266 side chains and the magnitude of the change in the properties which reflect template-primer interactions (template-primer dissociation rate constant, K i,AZTTP, processivity, and frameshift fidelity). This correlation suggests that hydrophobic interactions make a major contribution to the stability of the polymerase-DNA complex. Additionally, tyrosine and arginine substitutions resulted in mutant enzymes with DNA binding properties better than predicted by buried surface area alone, suggesting that hydrogen bonding could also play a role in DNA binding at this position. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase template-primer minor groove binding track solvent accessible surface area 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Due to its central role in viral replication, HIV-11 reverse transcriptase (RT) is an ideal target for antiviral drug design. It has been extensively scrutinized both structurally and biochemically. RT is a heterodimer of 66- and 51-kDa polypeptides with three catalytic activities: RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis and RNase H endonuclease. The polymerase and RNase H active sites are located at opposite ends of the nucleic acid-binding cleft on p66 (1Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). The p51 subunit is derived by proteolytic carboxyl terminus truncation of p66 removing the RNase H subdomain. Although both p66 and p51 are composed of four common subdomains (fingers, palm, thumb, and connection), the spatial arrangement of the subdomains in the two subunits is very different. The connection subdomain, which joins the polymerase (fingers, palm, and thumb) and RNase H domains of p66, occludes the polymerase active site of p51. RT lacks a 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity (2Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and it is not highly accurate (2Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 3Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The low RT fidelity is believed to play an important role in generating modified forms of RT with decreased inhibitor sensitivity. In addition to misincorporation errors, RT frequently produces frameshifts and base substitutions initiated by primer and template strand misalignment (4Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fidelity and processivity of RT are strongly dependent on nucleic acid sequence. A correlation has been noted between sites of elevated termination and lower frameshift fidelity, and these parameters have been demonstrated to be influenced by the sequence of the DNA duplex template-primer (T-P) as much as 6 nucleotides from the 3′-primer terminus (5Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10324-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of RT complexed with DNA shows that DNA is A-like near the polymerase active site, and is B-form near the RNase H active site. A bend of 40–45° occurs at the junction between A-like and B-form DNA (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). The p66 thumb contacts the T-P over several base pairs upstream of the polymerase active-site. Two antiparallel α-helices (H and I) of the thumb subdomain interact in the region of the DNA bend. Whereas α-helix I appears to interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the template strand, α-helix H is partially embedded in the widened DNA minor groove and interacts primarily with the primer strand. It has been suggested that these helices serve as a track along which the DNA moves during translocation (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). We have examined the role of residues in α-helices H and I in nucleic acid binding by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and characterized the fidelity and kinetic properties of the mutant proteins (8Beard W.A.

This analysis revealed that while alanine substitution of individual residues of α-helix I did not influence T-P binding or fidelity, substitution to alanine at several residues of α-helix H resulted in decreased nucleic acid binding affinity, processivity, AZTTP sensitivity (K i, AZTTP), and frameshift fidelity (8Beard W.A.

Since the resolution of the crystallographic RT-DNA complex was insufficient to define detailed protein-DNA interactions (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C.

Luxon B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 3: 194-197Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of mutant RTs coupled with this molecular dynamics modeling identified a structural element, the minor groove binding track (MGBT), that is important for DNA binding and frameshift fidelity. The MGBT consists of five residues, four in the thumb (Gln258, Gly262, and Trp266 which are part of α-helix H, and Gln269) and one (Ile94) in β-sheet 5b of the palm (Fig. 1). These five residues protrude into the minor groove over a distance from the second through the sixth base pair from the 3′-hydroxyl primer terminus and provide important RT interactions to the T-P during processive synthesis. Amino acid sequence alignments indicate that all five residues are highly conserved among lentiviral reverse transcriptases, suggesting that the MGBT is present in these enzymes. RT mutants with a substitution to alanine at any of the MGBT residues have altered T-P interactions. However, the degree of the alteration varies depending on the amino acid substitution. While substitutions at Gln258, Gln269, and Ile94 have a modest effect on T-P binding and processivity, the strongest effect, a more than 400-fold increase in the T-P dissociation rate constant, is caused by replacement of the large tryptophan side chain at position 266, suggesting that this residue of the MGBT provides much of the binding of the RT to the T-P (8Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bebenek K. Beard W.A.

To understand the molecular interactions which occur between residue 266 and the DNA minor groove, alternate substitutions were made at this position. The mutant proteins were purified and their kinetic properties, nucleic acid binding, processivity, AZTTP sensitivity, and frameshift fidelity characterized. The results of the kinetic and fidelity characterization of these mutant RTs are discussed in light of a refined molecular dynamics model of the RT-DNA complex. T4 polynucleotide kinase, poly(rA), (dT)20, and dNTPs were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Sodium heparin (170 USP units/mg) was from U.

A high resolution structure of the unliganded HIV-1 RT (Protein Data Bank entry 1rtj, resolution = 2.35 Å) (13Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), in combination with the Cα positions in a lower resolution structure of RT complexed with DNA (Protein Data Bank entry1hmi, resolution = 3.0 Å) (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) was used to produce an all-atom model of the protein in the complex. The Cα positions of the 1rtjstructure were slowly forced onto those of the 1hmi structure. This was performed in stages, over more than 100 ps, while immersing the protein in water plus neutralizing counterions. Residues whose secondary structure assignments agreed in the 1rtj and 1hmi structures, using the DSSP program (18Kabsch W. Sanders C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar), were constrained. Secondary structures assigned to1rtj were preserved during this forcing process by constraining the appropriate hydrogen bonds. This simulation, as well as those described below, was performed with the AMBER simulation package (19Pearlman D. Case D. Caldwell J. Ross W. Cheatham T. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Physiol. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2605) Google Scholar) using the particle mesh Ewald option to accommodate long range interactions (20Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Physiol. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (19731) Google Scholar). The phosphate positions from the 1hmi structure were used to produce an all atom model of the DNA duplex in the complex. The DNA sequence was identical to that in the 1hmi structure. Starting from the structure of an ideal B-form DNA 19-mer duplex, the phosphate positions were slowly forced onto those of the 1hmi structure. Again, this was done in stages over several hundred picoseconds while immersing the DNA in water plus neutralizing counterions. During this process, the Watson-Crick base pair hydrogen bonds were constrained. After annealing the duplex to the1hmi phosphate positions, the terminal primer strand residue was removed to produce a 1-base overhang as in the 1hmi structure. The DNA was then docked into the protein model. There were no steric conflicts involving protein backbone atoms, however, the side chains of residues in the binding interface were not yet optimally oriented. A conformational search of the relevant side chains was performed, using a genetic algorithm with a vacuum molecular mechanics energy fitness function (21Li L. Darden T.A. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Smith H. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The model complex was centered in a large box of water, and 29 sodium atoms were added to neutralize the system. The total system size was approximately 180,000 atoms. The solvated model system was carefully equilibrated over 150 ps. This was followed by 850 ps of unconstrained molecular dynamics at constant temperature and pressure. A representative structure was generated by averaging the coordinates of the last 600 ps of the trajectory, followed by energy minimization. This average structure was then used to estimate differences in binding free energy between the DNA and wild-type and mutant polymerases. The binding free energy of the DNA model bound to the wild-type or mutant proteins was estimated by calculating the amount of apolar solvent accessible surface area (SASA) buried upon complex formation, and multiplying by −25 cal/mol·Å2 (22Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The conformation of the protein and DNA was assumed to be identical in the free and complexed state. Although this is not strictly correct (22Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), it was assumed that these errors would cancel one another when calculating differences in binding free energy between wild-type and mutant enzymes. The conformation of the wild-type complex was taken from the time averaged simulation structure, as described above. Conformations of the mutant RT-DNA complexes were obtained by optimal placement of the modified 266 side chains within the wild-type model complex, followed by limited energy minimization. The SASA buried upon complex formation is given by the SASA of the polymerase plus the SASA of the DNA minus the SASA of the complex. To calculate the SASA of an atom in a molecule, the van der Waals radius of each heavy atom of the molecule is extended by 1.4 Å, the assumed radius of a water molecule. The van der Waals radii for heavy atoms were taken from Chothia (23Chothia C. Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The SASA of an atom in a molecule is then given by the amount of surface area on its extended van der Waals sphere which is not occluded by the extended spheres of other atoms. The apolar SASA for a molecule is obtained by summing the atomic SASA over the apolar atoms. Carbon, sulfur, and phosphorous atoms are considered to be apolar, while nitrogen and oxygen are considered polar. A discrete approximation was used (24Shrake A. Rupley J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 351-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), wherein each atom's surface is represented by approximately 1000 points evenly distributed on its extended van der Waals sphere. Each such point on the surface is tested to see if it is occluded,i.e. within the extended van der Waals sphere of any other atoms in the molecule. The fraction of non-occluded points is multiplied by the surface area of the extended van der Waals sphere to get the SASA for that atom. The SASA of the RT, DNA, and RT-DNA complexes approximated this way are numerically accurate to within a fraction of a Å2 (22Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). To introduce changes at residue 266 in the RT coding sequence, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described by Kunkel et al. (25Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The complete coding sequence of the RT gene was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired substitution and the absence of any other change. Mutants were purified as described previously (9Beard W.A. Minnick D.T. Wade C.L. Prasad R. Won R.L. Kumar A. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the purified mutant enzymes were assayed for exonuclease activity. Additional purification to separate p66 homodimer, p66/p51 heterodimer, and/or exonuclease contaminants was accomplished with a ssDNA-cellulose column as described (8Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of contaminating 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity on a mismatched primer for each enzyme preparation was determined as described (2Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Enzyme preparations had at least 10-fold lower exonuclease activity than Klenow fragment. Enzyme activities were determined using a standard reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (22 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl. Other reaction conditions are described in the figure legends. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme (expressed as concentration of dimer), incubated at 22 °C, and stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5m EDTA, pH 8. Quenched reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman DE-81 filter discs and dried. Unincorporated [α-32P]dTTP was removed, and filters were counted as described (26Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The K i for AZTTP,k cat, and substrate Michaelis constants were determined as described previously (9Beard W.A. Minnick D.T. Wade C.L. Prasad R. Won R.L. Kumar A. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined from protein determinations (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) which had been calibrated by amino acid analysis. The dissociation rate constant (k off,T-P) for poly(rA)-oligo(dT)20 was determined as described (26Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the dissociation rate constant for many of the Trp266 mutant enzymes was too rapid to measure accurately under these conditions, the pH during the challenge phase of the assay was reduced to pH 6.2. The reduction in pH resulted in a significant reduction in the dissociation rate constant (see “Results”). Enzyme was preincubated with T-P for 5 min before challenging free polymerase with heparin (zero time). The concentration of components in the challenge mixture was 300 nm RT, 300 nm T-P (expressed as primer 3′ termini), 50 mm MES, pH 6.2, and 2 mg/ml heparin. To determine the concentration of RT remaining bound to T-P, 20-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 20 μl of a mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, and 60 μm [α-32P]dTTP at time intervals after adding challenge. After an additional 10-min incubation, the reaction was stopped with EDTA, and the incorporation of radioactive dTMP was determined as described above. Although the dissociation rate constant and kinetic constants were determined on a RNA template and the molecular modeling performed with a DNA template, we have previously demonstrated a quantitative correlation between the magnitude of the effect on the T-P dissociation rate constant for mutant RTs with either a homopolymeric RNA template or a heteropolymeric DNA template (9Beard W.A.

Termination probability represents the probability of the polymerase dissociating from the DNA at a defined site. The measurements were performed as described previously (5Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using M13mp2 DNA as template primed with a32P-5′-end-labeled 15-mer. The reactions (30 μl) were as described below for fidelity measurements except that they contained a severalfold molar excess of DNA over enzyme and were incubated at 37 °C for 5–30 min. Aliquots were removed and mixed with an equal volume of 99% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanole, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 16% polyacrylamide gel in parallel with products of sequencing reactions with the same template. Product bands were quantified by phosphorimagery and termination probability at each site expressed in percent, as the ratio of products at a site to the products at that site plus all greater length products. Reactions (25 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, four dNTPs each at 1 mm, 32 fmol of gapped DNA, and 0.5–9 pmol of RT were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and terminated by adding EDTA to 15 mm. Aliquots (20 μl) were analyzed by agarose electrophoresis to ensure complete gap filling. All reactions generated products that migrated coincident with nicked, double-stranded DNA. The frameshift reversion assay uses gapped substrate encoding a very light blue plaque phenotype due to an addition of a T between position 131 and 132, and a substitution of C → T at 132. These changes created a mutational target consisting of a 4-base C run flanked by 3 base T runs (underlined), 5′-CCTGCAGCACATTTCCCCTTTCGCCAGCTGG-3′. The addition of an extra base (C → TT) puts the sequence out-of-frame generating a stop codon downstream in the sequence. Deletion of a nucleotide from one of the T runs or the C run results in dark blue revertant plaques. Procedures for the assay have been described in Bebenek and Kunkel (17Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To define the nature of the interactions occurring between Trp266 of the MGBT and the nucleic acid minor groove, eight alternate side chains were introduced at this position. These side chains differ in their size, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen bonding potential: aliphatic (alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine), basic (arginine), acidic (glutamate), and aromatic (phenylalanine, tyrosine). The mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Their DNA binding properties were surveyed and compared with calculated relative binding free energies determined from a RT-DNA model constructed by molecular modeling. Using information from the HIV-1 RT structure of apoenzyme (1rtj, resolution = 2.35 Å) (13Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and from the lower resolution structure with DNA (1hmi, resolution = 3.0 Å) (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), we have built an all atom fully solvated model of the RT complexed with a DNA duplex (T-P: 19–18-mer). An earlier version of this model helped identify a structural motif which interacts in the DNA minor groove several base pairs upstream of the polymerase active site which we called the MGBT (11Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L. Prasad R. Luxon B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 3: 194-197Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The duplex DNA in that model did not have a template overhang; rather the product of one step of polymerization was modeled as a base pair with the 5′-terminal template base. Before proceeding with detailed modeling of the residue 266 mutants, we decided to refine our previous model: removing the 3′-nucleotide at the primer terminus, applying very careful initial modeling procedures, and using a much larger solvent layer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The calculation of the free energy of binding for a ligand such as DNA to a protein is a difficult task. In general, the gains in free energy from favorable polar interactions involved in binding are approximately canceled by the loss of solvent contact in the polar groups involved, whereas apolar binding interactions are always favorable (28Janin J.

We estimated binding free energies by calculating the amount of apolar SASA buried upon complex formation, and multiplying by −25 cal/mol·Å2 (22Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The calculated apolar SASA buried upon complex formation for each mutant is tabulated in Table I. From this, the binding free energies were calculated and expressed relative to that of the alanine mutant. The aromatic side chains (phenylalanine and tyrosine) are suggested to be most similar to the wild-type tryptophan residue in the amount of apolar surface area buried upon DNA binding. The larger aliphatic side chains (leucine and isoleucine) also buried more surface area than valine and alanine. Finally,"
https://openalex.org/W2098218885,"The molecular signaling events involved in the inhibition of breast cancer cell growth by retinoic acid and interferon-α were investigated. All-trans-retinoic acid and interferon-α acted synergistically to inhibit growth of both the estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the estrogen receptor-negative line BT-20. In MCF-7 cells, all-trans-retinoic acid potentiated the effects of interferon-α by up-regulating the expression of the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). Consequently, the synergism between all-trans-retinoic acid and interferon-α down-regulated the expression of c-Myc, but not its functional partner, Max. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with a dominant-negative mutant of PKR relieved c-Myc down-regulation and cell growth inhibition, indicating that PKR is directly involved in c-Myc down-regulation and that c-Myc down-regulation is responsible for the inhibition of cell growth. Corresponding with c-Myc down-regulation, c-Myc·Max heterodimers bound to their consensus DNA sequence were undetectable in cells treated with all-trans-retinoic acid and interferon-α, indicating diminished c-Myc functionality. When c-Myc was overexpressed ectopically via a c-Myc expression vector, MCF-7 cells became resistant to growth inhibition by all-trans-retinoic acid plus interferon-α. These experiments define the following pathway as a major pathway in the synergistic growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells by all-trans-retinoic acid plus interferon-α: all-trans-retinoic acid + interferon-α → ↑ double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase → ↓ c-Myc → cell growth inhibition.

Retinoids and interferons (IFNs)1 have each been actively investigated as anticancer agents. Although neither agent alone is effective against solid tumors, clinically encouraging results have been obtained using a combination of retinoic acid (RA) and IFNs as treatment against advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and cervix and renal cell carcinoma (1Lippman S.M. Lotan R. Schleuniger U. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In vitro, retinoids plus IFNs have been shown to suppress growth in several lines of breast cancer cells (2Widschwendter M. Daxenbichler G. Dapunt O. Marth C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2135-2139PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kolla V. Lindner D.J. Xiao W. Borden E.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10508-10514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This combination of agents also suppresses growth of breast and ovarian cancers in nude mice xenograft models (1Lippman S.M. Lotan R. Schleuniger U. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the growth inhibition by RA plus IFNs are largely unknown. To use these agents in a clinically beneficial manner, the RA and IFN signaling pathways and the cross-talk between them need to be defined. Retinoic acid, one of the most active retinoids, inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation in many normal and neoplastic cells (4Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 5Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). The biological effects of RA are believed to be largely mediated by nuclear retinoid receptors, the RARs (RARα, RARβ, RARγ, and their isoforms) and the RXRs (RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ and their isoforms). These receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). Liganded RAR·RXR heterodimers or RXR·RXR homodimers bind to retinoic acid response elements and transduce the RA signal to the transcription machinery and the chromatin template to activate or repress the transcription of target genes (6Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Interferons have also been shown to play critical roles in cell growth and differentiation (7Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Jaramillo M.L. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Invest. 1995; 13: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to RA, the biological effects of IFNs are mediated through species-specific, cell-surface receptors. After IFNs bind to their receptors, signal events lead to the activation of Janus protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of STAT (signal transducer andactivator of transcription) proteins, and ultimately induction of gene transcription. One of the IFN-inducible genes, pkr, encodes for a double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) that has been shown to be involved in tumor proliferation and differentiation (7Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Jaramillo M.L. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Invest. 1995; 13: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKR inhibits cell growth (9Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 10Lengyel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5893-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), whereas expression of catalytically inactive PKR mutants results in malignant transformation and tumor formation in mice (9Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 11Meurs E.F. Watanabe Y. Kadereit S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Chong K. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5805-5814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the mechanism of action of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) plus IFN-α on growth inhibition of both estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7) and estrogen receptor-negative (BT-20) breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that atRA potentiates the action of IFN-α by up-regulating the expression of PKR in these breast cancer cells. We then targeted our efforts to the expression of c-Myc and its functional partner, Max, since c-Myc plays critical roles in cell cycling and is overexpressed in ∼30% of breast cancers (12Garcia I. Dietrich P.Y. Aapro M. Vauthier G. Vandas L. Engel E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6675-6679PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated (13Watson P.H. Singh R. Hole A.K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that, in these cells, c-Myc expression is not efficiently down-regulated in response to differentiating agents, resulting in a reduced capacity of these cells to differentiate and an increased capacity to proliferate. c-Myc is also a transcription factor that forms heterodimers with Max and consequently binds to CACGTG enhancer elements and stimulates gene transcription (14Lemaitre J. Buckle R.S. Mechali M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 70: 95-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The dimerization of c-Myc with Max and the consequent binding to its enhancer element are a prerequisite for all known c-Myc transactivation activity (15Zornig M. Evan G.I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1553-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We investigated the hypothesis that atRA plus IFN-α can effectively down-regulate the expression of c-Myc and that PKR is directly involved in this action. These experiments show that the following pathway is a major effector of the synergistic action of atRA and IFN-α in MCF-7 cells and possibly other breast cancer cells: atRA + IFN-α → ↑ PKR → ↓ c-Myc. MCF-7 and BT-20 cells (4 × 103 cells/well; American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD) were cultured in phenol red-free Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum (Sigma) in 96-well cell culture plates. Different amounts of atRA (0–1000 nm; Sigma) and IFN-α (0–1000 units/ml; Sigma) were added, and cells were incubated for 4–5 days; the medium was replaced every other day. Cells were washed, fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h, and then stained with 1% sulforhodamine B for 1 h. Cells were washed again, and then 100 μl of 10 μm Tris-HCl (pH 10) was added to release the dye. The absorbance was measured at 562 nm. Cells not given atRA or IFN-α were designated controls; results from treated cells were expressed as a percentage of control. A plate seeded with the same number of cells and fixed immediately established 0% growth (16Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar). Loss of cells during treatments was considered cell death and was expressed as negative values. Cells from <15 passages were used for experiments. Solutions of atRA in absolute ethanol were made and used under lights that were covered with a UV-blocking film (CLHC, Sydlin, Inc., Lancaster, PA). The integrity of atRA was routinely monitored by spectrophotometry. MCF-7 cells grown in the same medium to 50% confluence were washed with serum-free growth medium. Two μg of a mutant PKR expression construct that carried the dominant mutant PKRΔ6 cDNA (pcDNA3.1/Zeo-PKRΔ6, from Dr. Antonis E. Koromilas, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) or the c-Myc expression construct (pSV2-cMyc, from Dr. Andrew Henderson, Pennsylvania State University) was mixed with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and added to cells for 5 h. Selection was initiated on the third day with 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for PKRΔ6 expression and 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for c-Myc expression and continued for 21 days until drug-resistant colonies emerged. Colonies were pooled, grown further, and used in experiments. Total cellular protein was separated on 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Transferred nitrocellulose blots were incubated with one of the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibody against human c-Myc (Calbiochem), rabbit polyclonal antibody against human Max, or rabbit polyclonal antibody against human PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After adding appropriate secondary antibodies, the blots were developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The results were analyzed using EagleEye® and OnedScan software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent, separated on 1.1 m formaldehyde and 1% agarose gels, and then transferred and cross-linked to GeneScreen nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). Hybridization was carried out using the following probes: T4 polynucleotide kinase-labeled antisense 40-mer of c-Myc mRNA (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) and random primer-labeled ∼850-base pairEcoRI fragment of human wild-type PKR cDNA. The results were analyzed with a phosphoimager (Bio-Rad). MCF-7 cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2 and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY). Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g and 4 °C. Nuclei were resuspended in 150 μl of glycerol storage buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 40% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2 and 0.1 mm EDTA and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear run-on assays were performed using 5 × 107 frozen nuclei and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Newly transcribed RNA was hybridized to the EcoRI fragment of PKR cDNA (see above) that was immobilized on nylon membranes. The results were analyzed with a phosphoimager. To prepare nuclear extracts, untreated (control) and treated MCF-7 cells were collected; washed; and suspended in hypotonic buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The swollen cells were homogenized, and nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in a low salt buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Gentle dropwise addition of a high salt buffer (same as the low salt buffer, except that the KCl concentration was 0.02 m) then released soluble proteins from the nuclei. Following extraction, the nuclei were removed by centrifugation; the nuclear extract was dialyzed into a moderate salt solution; and any precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. Fifteen μg of the nuclear extract was mixed with 10,000 cpm of Myc·Max consensus oligonucleotides (5′-GGA AGC AGA CCA CGT GGT CTG CTT CC-3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 300 ng/μl bovine serum albumin and loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film. For confirming the oligonucleotide-bound protein, mouse monoclonal antibody against human c-Myc and rabbit polyclonal antibody against human Max were used as specific antibodies, and a mouse monoclonal antibody against insulin-like growth factor II was used as a nonspecific antibody. To study the effects of retinoids and IFNs on the growth of breast cancer cells, we chose atRA because it is a natural ligand for both RAR and RXR, and it is used in clinical trials; we selected IFN-α because it is a strong inducer of PKR (8Jaramillo M.L. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Invest. 1995; 13: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). atRA (0, 10, 100, or 1000 nm) was added alone or in combination with 0, 10, 100, or 1000 units/ml IFN-α to MCF-7 cell cultures (Fig. 1 A) and BT-20 cell cultures (Fig. 1 B). Cells were incubated for 4 days, and growth was measured by sulforhodamine staining. atRA alone had very little inhibitory effect on the growth of MCF-7 cells, although at the highest concentration (1000 nm), ∼10% growth inhibition was observed (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, IFN-α alone failed to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells, even at the highest concentration. But when added together, each combination of atRA and IFN-α strongly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells. At high concentrations of atRA (1000 nm) plus IFN-α (1000 units/ml), negative cell growth was observed, indicating cell death. Median effect analysis (17Chou T.C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6007) Google Scholar) demonstrated a synergistic inhibitory effect of atRA and IFN-α on cell growth. Similar synergistic effects have been reported using a combination of atRA and IFN-β (3Kolla V. Lindner D.J. Xiao W. Borden E.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10508-10514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our results for atRA differ from those reported in several other studies (18Toma S. Isnardi L. Raffo P. Dastoli G. Francisci E.D. Riccardi L. Palumbo R. Bollag W. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Marth C. Daxenbichler G. Daunt O. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 77: 1197-1202PubMed Google Scholar, 20Van der Burg B. Van der Leede B.M. Kwakkenbos-Isbrucker L. Salverda S. de Laat S.W. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in that, at low concentrations, atRA had no growth inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and, at the highest dose, only marginal inhibition was observed. We believe that these differences may be attributed to our choice of dosage levels and culture medium. Specifically, in our experiments, we used relatively low concentrations of RA that are clinically achievable, and we used phenol red-free medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped serum. Phenol red is known to have estrogen-like activity (21Wakeling A.E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); bovine serum contains unknown amounts of retinol, a precursor of RA, and possibly RA itself. Similar experiments using BT-20 cells, an estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell line that has been shown to be refractory to RA treatment (22Marth C. Mayer I. Daxenbichler G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Fontana J.A. Miranda D. Burrows Mezu A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1977-1982PubMed Google Scholar), yielded similar results (Fig. 1 B). atRA or IFN-α alone failed to inhibit the growth of BT-20 cells, but combinations of the two inhibited growth by >80% (Fig. 1 B); at high concentrations, cell death was observed. To investigate the mechanism involved in the synergism of atRA and IFN-α, we investigated the impact of the order of their application on the growth of MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were chosen for the remaining experiments. Cells were incubated with 500 nm atRA for 16 h and then washed with serum-free medium. IFN-α (0, 10, 100, or 1000 units/ml) was added. We used a lower concentration of atRA in this experiment because 1000 nm caused ∼10% growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells (see above; Fig. 1 A). Preliminary experiments with 500 nm atRA showed that maximal potentiation of the IFN-α effect on MCF-7 cells occurred at 16 h of pretreatment (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, pretreatment with atRA endowed MCF-7 cells with responsiveness to IFN-α. As little as 10 units/ml IFN-α inhibited the growth of pretreated MCF-7 cells by >90%. At higher concentrations of IFN-α (1000 units/ml), negative cell growth (cell death) was observed. In contrast, pretreatment with 500 units/ml IFN-α for 16 h and subsequent treatment with atRA (Fig. 2) did not result in a parallel responsiveness of MCF-7 cells. Thus, we conclude that atRA is necessary to potentiate the IFN-α effect on MCF-7 cells, but the opposite does not occur under the conditions tested here. We were interested in PKR because it is an IFN-inducible protein kinase that is considered to be a primary mediator of the effects of IFN on cell growth regulation (6Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 7Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular events involved in the enhancement of IFN-α action by atRA, MCF-7 cells were pretreated with 0, 10, 100, or 1000 nm atRA for 16 h. atRA was then removed, and 500 units/ml IFN-α was added for another 16 h. Cells were collected, and PKR mRNA and protein were analyzed using Northern blotting and Western blotting, respectively. Fig. 3(lane 2) shows that no PKR mRNA or protein was detected in MCF-7 cells treated with atRA alone; surprisingly, nopkr gene expression was detected in IFN-α treated cells either (lane 3). However, when cells were pretreated with atRA, both PKR mRNA and protein were strongly induced by IFN-α in an atRA pretreatment dose-dependent fashion (lanes 4–6). Because a previous study with neuroblastoma cells (24Higuchi T. Hannigan G.E. Malkan D. Yeger H. Williams B.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3958-3964PubMed Google Scholar) and a recent study with breast cancer cells (25Langenfeld J. Kiyokawa Sekula D. Boyle J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12071-12074Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar) showed that RA is able to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, we investigated whether atRA is able to regulate pkr gene transcription. Nuclear run-on assays were performed on nuclei isolated from MCF-7 cells that had been pretreated with 500 nm atRA for 16 h, followed by 500 units/ml IFN-α for 45 min. Fig. 4 shows that no pkrtranscription occurred in nuclei isolated from control cells or from cells treated with 500 nm atRA or 500 units/ml IFN-α (strips 1–3). However, when cells were pretreated with atRA, pkr transcription was strongly induced by IFN-α (strip 4). β-Actin, a housekeeping gene, was transcribed normally under each of these conditions. Next we investigated which downstream genes are regulated by atRA- and IFN-α-induced PKR action. Because c-Myc is one of the most important regulators of the cell cycle (14Lemaitre J. Buckle R.S. Mechali M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 70: 95-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and is overexpressed in some breast cancers (12Garcia I. Dietrich P.Y. Aapro M. Vauthier G. Vandas L. Engel E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6675-6679PubMed Google Scholar), we targeted our efforts to c-Myc and its functional partner, Max. MCF-7 cells were pretreated with 10, 100, or 1000 nm atRA for 16 h, followed by incubation with 500 units/ml IFN-α for 16 h (for RNA analysis) or 48 h (for protein analysis). Cells were collected, and protein and RNA were isolated and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment with atRA alone (A, lane 2; and B, second bar) or IFN-α alone (A, lane 3; and B, third bar) did not affect c-Myc expression. However, pretreatment with atRA strongly down-regulated c-Myc expression in MCF-7 cells (A, lanes 4–6; and B, fourth through sixth bars). Pretreatment with as little as 10 nm atRA significantly decreased the expression of c-Myc (p < 0.01), whereas at higher concentrations of atRA pretreatment, >80% of c-Myc protein expression was suppressed. Interestingly, the changes occurring in c-Myc protein expression were not reflected in c-Myc mRNA under all experimental conditions (Fig. 6 A). This result supports the hypothesis that PKR is directly involved in the growth suppression of MCF-7 cells because a major function of PKR is inhibition of protein synthesis (26Samuel C.E. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 65: 227-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 6 B, PKR inhibition of protein synthesis was not global because Max expression under these same experimental conditions was unaffected.Figure 6atRA plus IFN-α do not affect the level of c-Myc mRNA and the expression of Max in MCF-7 cells. A, c-Myc mRNA was measured by Northern blotting from the cells described in the legend to Fig. 5 A; the lane assignment is the same as described for Fig. 5 A.B, Max protein was assayed by Western blotting. The treatments and lane assignments are the same as described forA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether PKR is directly involved in the down-regulation of c-Myc, MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with a dominant-negative PKR cDNA construct (PKRΔ6). PKRΔ6 was derived from PKR cDNA by deleting 6 amino acids between catalytic domains V and VI, and it has been shown to inhibit the actions of wild-type PKR (9Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Transfectants were pooled after 26 days and grown further for c-Myc protein analysis. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the PKRΔ6 transfection of MCF-7 cells resulted in relief of the suppression of c-Myc expression (fourth through sixth lanes). Growth inhibition experiments were also performed on these transfectants by pretreatment with 10, 100, and 1000 nmatRA, followed by 500 units/ml IFN-α. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the growth of these transfectants was inhibited by only ∼25% even at the highest level of atRA pretreatment. To test whether the down-regulation of the c-Myc protein level by atRA plus IFN-α indeed corresponds with an alteration in c-Myc functionality, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to assess the level of c-Myc·Max heterodimers bound to their consensus DNA sequence. Dimerization of c-Myc with Max and the consequent binding to its enhancer element are a prerequisite for all known c-Myc transactivation activity (15Zornig M. Evan G.I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1553-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In untreated MCF-7 cells, the c-Myc·Max heterodimers were abundant (Fig. 8, lane 1), but after treatment with 500 nm atRA and 500 units/ml IFN-α, c-Myc·Max heterodimers were undetectable (lane 2). Mad·Max heterodimers and Max·Max homodimers were still present in treated cells, but in contrast to our expectation, their abundance was not increased. The binding specificity of c-Myc·Max·DNA complexes was confirmed by incubating untreated nuclear extracts with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human c-Myc (lane 4) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human Max (lane 5). When antibodies were added to nuclear extracts, they interfered with the formation of c-Myc·Max, Mad·Max, and Max·Max dimers and/or, consequently, binding to the consensus DNA sequence (lanes 4 and 5). As expected, a nonspecific antibody (a mouse monoclonal antibody against human insulin-like growth factor II) did not interfere with the dimerization and DNA binding of c-Myc, Mad, and Max proteins (lane 3). Mad·Max heterodimers and Max·Max homodimers were suggested based on the disappearance of all dimers after using antibodies against Max and the migration of these dimers on the gel (Max is a 21–22-kDa protein, and Mad proteins have molecular masses of 25–34 kDa). Finally, we were interested in whether overexpressing c-Myc in MCF-7 cells could render resistance to growth inhibition induced by atRA plus IFN-α. MCF-7 cells were transfected with the c-Myc expression vector pSV2-cMyc. Positive colonies were pooled, grown further, and treated with a combination of 500 nm atRA and 500 units/ml IFN-α. The same treatments were also applied to vector-transfected and parental MCF-7 cells. Cell growth was measured by sulforhodamine staining. The results are expressed as a percentage of untreated parental MCF-7 cells. As documented in Fig. 9, although similar growth inhibition patterns were observed over a 4-day period of atRA plus IFN-α treatment in parental and vector-transfected MCF-7 cells, c-Myc-transfected MCF-7 cells were indeed resistant to such treatments. At the end of the experiments (day 4), ∼65% growth was still observed in c-Myc-transfected MCF-7 cells, whereas negative growth was observed in parental and vector-transfected cells. The results indicate that c-Myc overexpression in MCF-7 cells rendered these cells resistant to the combination of the two agents. Hence, we conclude that c-Myc down-regulation by atRA plus IFN-α in parental MCF-7 cells is a major event in the growth inhibition by these two agents. Although various retinoids have been shown to be highly effective as chemotherapeutic agents in some hematologic malignancies, single retinoid treatment of solid tumors is generally ineffective. Combinations of retinoids plus other antiproliferative agents have been investigated for the treatment of solid tumors, and clinical studies of retinoids plus IFNs have yielded encouraging results (1Lippman S.M. Lotan R. Schleuniger U. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To use these agents in a clinically beneficial manner, the molecular mechanisms involved in their action need definition. Here we demonstrated a strong synergistic growth inhibition by atRA and IFN-α in both an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and an estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell line (BT-20) in which neither atRA nor IFN-α alone was effective. Since the growth of MCF-7 cells was inhibited by IFN-α when cells were pretreated with atRA, but not the inverse, we conclude that the signal transduction pathway for IFN-α is not functional in these cells, but could be restored by atRA treatment. Indeed, we found that, in MCF-7 cells treated with IFN-α alone, the expression of an important antiproliferative gene,pkr, was not detectable. Pretreatment with atRA restored the ability of IFN-α to induce the expression of PKR. These results agree well with other recent studies (3Kolla V. Lindner D.J. Xiao W. Borden E.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10508-10514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Matikainen S. Ronni T. Lehtonen A. Sareneva T. Melen K. Nordling S. Levy D.E. Julkunen I. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 687-698PubMed Google Scholar) that showed that RA is able to up-regulate STAT proteins and to enhance the action of IFNs. Taken together, these observations indicate that, in MCF-7 cells, the IFN-α signal is not transduced, and consequently, PKR is not expressed. After treatment with atRA, the IFN-α signal transduction pathway is operative, and PKR expression is strongly inducible. PKR is an IFN-inducible gene product that has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and tumorigenesis (26Samuel C.E. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 65: 227-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKR is a double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase that inhibits mRNA translation by phosphorylating the protein synthesis factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2. However, the inhibition of protein synthesis by PKR is not global. Rather, it has been proposed that PKR binds to and regulates the translation of a discrete set of mRNAs that encode proteins important in the control of normal cell growth. The activation of PKR may occur in a localized manner such that phosphorylation and inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α function lead to a discriminatory effect on the translation of these mRNAs (8Jaramillo M.L. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Invest. 1995; 13: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this context, we demonstrated that c-Myc is regulated by PKR, whereas Max is not. Our experiments define c-myc as a downstream gene that is regulated by PKR in MCF-7 cells. In cell cultures in which PKR was not induced, c-Myc protein was expressed, whereas in cell cultures in which PKR was induced, c-Myc was down-regulated. The magnitude of the down-regulation corresponds to the level of PKR induction. Additionally, the induction of PKR and the decreased expression of c-Myc corresponded closely to the atRA- and IFN-α-induced growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells. To clearly establish the PKR link to c-Myc, we showed that the transfection of MCF-7 cells with a dominant-negative PKR cDNA (PKRΔ6) relieved the down-regulation of c-Myc expression and largely eliminated the growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells. Since dimerization of c-Myc with Max and the consequent DNA binding are a prerequisite for all known c-Myc functions (15Zornig M. Evan G.I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1553-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine the relative amount of c-Myc that bound to its consensus DNA sequence. Our experiments showed that, in untreated MCF-7 cells, c-Myc·Max heterodimers bound to their consensus DNA sequence were abundant, but in atRA- and IFN-α-treated MCF-7 cells, the level of this heterodimer was undetectable. These results suggest that treatment with atRA plus IFN-α indeed affects c-Myc functionality. The c-Myc network is rather complicated. In addition to the formation of c-Myc·Max heterodimers and Max·Max homodimers, Max also forms heterodimers with proteins from the Mad protein family (27Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It is believed that c-Myc and Mad proteins compete for the binding of Max inside the cell (15Zornig M. Evan G.I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1553-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that Max·Max homodimers and Mad·Max heterodimers counteract the mitogenic actions of c-Myc·Max. The predominance of one particular dimer corresponds to the relative concentration of Max partners (28Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 110-183Google Scholar, 29Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this context, the observation that the Max·Max homodimers and Mad·Max heterodimers did not significantly increase in cells treated with atRA and IFN-α was unexpected. To further support the hypothesis that c-Myc is the target of atRA plus IFN-α in growth inhibition, we overexpressed c-Myc by introducing a c-Myc expression vector into MCF-7 cells. These cells acquired resistance to growth inhibition by atRA plus IFN-α. Presumably, in c-Myc-transfected MCF-7 cells, ectopic expression of c-Myc was not affected by PKR, and hence, these cells became resistant to the experimental treatment. Since high concentrations of atRA caused ∼10% growth inhibition of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and since ameliorating the down-regulation of c-Myc did not totally relieve the growth inhibition caused by atRA and IFN-α, it is likely that additional pathways exist to signal the antiproliferative action of atRA and that additional cell growth regulators are targeted by atRA plus IFN-α. Nevertheless, our results show that the following pathway is a major one involved in the growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells by atRA and IFN-α: atRA + IFN-α → ↑ PKR → ↓ c-Myc → cell growth inhibition. In addition, our results provide further support for the importance of PKR and c-Myc as regulators of cell growth. We thank Dr. Antonis E. Koromilas for providing the PKRΔ6 expression plasmid, Dr. Andrew Henderson for the c-Myc expression plasmid, and Dr. Sally Johnson (Pennsylvania State University) for useful discussions about this work.

This study evaluates a series of indoleamine analogs as alternate substrates of AANAT. 3-Indolepropylamine and 3-indolebutylamine were chemically synthesized and found to be processed by AANAT, although 20- and 60-fold less efficiently compared with the natural substrate serotonin, respectively. Racemic α-methyltryptamine and N ω-methyltryptamine were also shown to be substrates for AANAT, again with reducedk cat and k cat/K m compared with serotonin. The enzyme did exhibit ∼9:1 stereoselectivity for theR-enantiomer of α-methyltryptamine versus theS-enantiomer. By measuring the enzymatic ratesversus increasing buffer microviscosity, it was demonstrated that diffusional release of product is most likely the principal rate-determining step for the enzymatic transformation of tryptamine (which has similar k cat and k cat/K m compared with serotonin). Analysis of k cat and k cat/K m versuspH for the poor substrateN ω-methyltryptamine showed that an ionizable group on the enzyme with pK a ∼ 7, required to be in its deprotonated form, may be important in catalysis. The α-methyltryptamine analog α-trifluoromethyltryptamine was not processed by the enzyme, but served as a modest competitive inhibitor. Taken together with the pH-rate analysis, these results favor a model in which the serotonin substrate binds to the enzyme as the positively charged ammonium salt, and nucleophilicity of the amine is important in enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer.

Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamineN-acetyltransferase (AANAT)1) is the enzyme responsible for the circadian rhythmic cycle of melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine) (1Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M. Iuvone P.M. Rodriquez I.R. Begay V. Falcon J. Cahill G.M. Cassone V.M. Baler R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar). AANAT catalyzes the conversion of serotonin to N-acetylserotonin, the direct precursor to melatonin (Fig. 1). AANAT is expressed primarily in the pineal glands of vertebrates, where acetyltransferase activity rises in the night and falls in the daytime, regulating the production of melatonin. The recent cloning of AANAT (1Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M. Iuvone P.M. Rodriquez I.R. Begay V. Falcon J. Cahill G.M. Cassone V.M. Baler R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar) has facilitated advances in the understanding of its regulation (2Gastel J.A. Roseboom P.H. Rinaldi P.A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Science. 1998; 279: 1358-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and enzyme mechanism (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In principle, a detailed understanding of the substrate selectivity and catalytic mechanism of AANAT could lead to the development of specific AANAT inhibitors that might have therapeutic value in sleep and mood disorders. AANAT is a 24-kDa protein that belongs to the motif A/B superfamily, which includes >150 proteins, many of which are believed to be acetyltransferase enzymes (1Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H.

This superfamily is defined by the presence of two weakly conserved tandem sequences of ∼15 amino acids called motifs A and B. AANAT is itself highly conserved among vertebrates, displaying ∼80% amino acid identity among sheep, chicken, rat, and human AANATs (1Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M. Iuvone P.M. Rodriquez I.R. Begay V. Falcon J. Cahill G.M. Cassone V.M. Baler R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, recombinant sheep AANAT was overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Its kinetic mechanism was shown to be sequential (ternary complex) Ordered Bi Bi, with acetyl-CoA binding before serotonin (or the alternative substrate tryptamine) (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the substrate specificity of AANAT have revealed that the indole function is particularly important for efficient turnover (4Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R. Weller J.L. Namboodiri M.A.A. Koonin E.V. Klein D.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1681-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The design of specific AANAT inhibitors will be augmented by a thorough analysis of the tolerance of the AANAT active site for alternate substrates. The processing of alternative substrates can also yield insights into the catalytic and kinetic mechanisms of the enzyme. As part of a previous investigation of AANAT, a simple kinetic acetyltransferase assay was reported in which free CoASH was indirectly monitored by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In principle, this assay allows a variety of serotonin analogs to be tested as AANAT substrates in a convenient way. In this study, we report the results of the effects of substrate alterations on AANAT processing. Tryptamine, racemic α-methyltryptamine,N ω-methyltryptamine, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), Mops, Mes, and Epps were purchased from Sigma. 3-Bromo-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone,O-benzylhydroxylamine, 3-indolepropionic acid, 3-indolebutyric acid, LiAlH4, dimethylformamide, and tetrahydrofuran (anhydrous) were purchased from Aldrich. Sucrose was purchased from Bio-Rad. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-AANAT was overexpressed and purified as described previously (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All reagents and solvents were used as purchased without further purification. Preparatory TLC was performed on 1000-μm silica gel plates (20 × 20 cm; Analtech Uniplate®). Silica gel (200–425 mesh) for column chromatography was purchased from Fisher. 1H, 13C, and19F NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 400-MHz spectrometer. Optical rotations were measured using a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter. To a solution of 3-indolepropionic acid (3; 2.0 g, 10.6 mmol) in dimethylformamide (100 ml) was added Et3N (4.4 ml, 31.8 mmol) and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (3.4 g, 21.1 mmol). 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (4.0 g, 21.1 mmol) was added to the solution at 0 °C, and the resulting mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature. After 48 h of stirring under an atmosphere of N2, undissolved material was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to remove dimethylformamide. The resulting residue was partitioned between 0.5n HCl (100 ml) and EtOAc (200 ml). The organic layer was washed with 100 ml of 1n NaHCO3 and brine; dried over MgSO4; and concentrated in vacuo to give fairly pure product as a white solid (1.8 g, 58%), which was recrystallized from hot MeOH to give 1.2 g (first crop) of pure compound 5.

Preparation of purified recombinant sheep glutathioneS-transferase-AANAT has been described, and it has shown to be nearly identical in its kinetic behavior to purified glutathioneS-transferase-free AANAT (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Assays of the amine analog substrates were performed essentially as previously reported using a spectrophotometric assay in which CoASH levels were monitored indirectly by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To verify that N ω-methyltryptamine was forming the acetylated product, a large-scale reaction (20 mm, 3 ml) was performed, and N ω-acetyl-N ω-methyltryptamine was isolated and shown to have identical 1H NMR and TLC properties compared with the authentic material. ForK m measurements, at least five amine substrate concentrations ranging from <0.3 K m to >3K m were employed in the presence of near-saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA (>3 K m). Rates were measured under initial conditions (<10% turnover of the limiting substrate). All assays were performed in duplicate, and rate values generally agreed within 10%. Kinetic constants were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using a nonlinear curve fit (Kaleidograph), and the values are shown as means ± S.E. in Table I.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for tryptamine analogs as substrates or inhibitors of AANATTryptamine analogK mk catK imms−1mmSerotonin0.24 ± 0.0334 ± 1Tryptamine0.17 ± 0.0125 ± 1Compound10.77 ± 0.075.5 ± 0.2Compound21.7 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.1(±)-α-Methyltryptamine (7)2.7 ± 0.216 ± 0.4N ω-Methyltryptamine (8)3.8 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.1(±)-α-Trifluoromethyltryptamine (9)3 ± 1See “Experimental Procedures” for experimental details. Open table in a new tab See “Experimental Procedures” for experimental details. After showing that α-trifluoromethyltryptamine was not processed by AANAT (k cat/K m at least 1000-fold lower than for compound 7), it was tested as a competitive inhibitor using a Dixon analysis versus the substrateN ω-methyltryptamine. A range of five concentrations of compound 9 (up to 10 mm) was used in the inhibition experiment. The assay conditions were similar to those described previously (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. MeOH (final concentration of 5%) was included in the assay to improve the solubility of compound 9. Controls demonstrated that this concentration of MeOH had no detectable effect on turnover rate. In addition, 0.1 m Mes (pH 6.1) with 0.1 m NaCl was used in place of the standard phosphate buffer (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two separate assays were performed at two fixed subsaturating concentrations (4 and 6 mm) of N ω-methyltryptamine (K m = 4 mm). The concentration of acetyl-CoA (K m = 0.4 mm) was kept constant and near-saturating (2 mm). Dixon plots were fit using linear regression. The K i was calculated assuming a competitive inhibition model (versus N ω-methyltryptamine) from the slope of the line using the steady-state kinetic equation (Equation 1). Slope=Km/Vm Ki[S](Eq. 1) The calculated K i values from both experiments were in good agreement, and the values are shown as means ± S.E. in Table I. α-Methyltryptamine (20 mm) and acetyl-CoA (20 mm) were reacted with AANAT (10 μm) in a 3-ml reaction volume using previously described acetyltransferase conditions (pH 6.8 and sodium phosphate buffer) (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and reaction progress was monitored with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). After 20 min, when the reaction was shown to be ∼50% complete, the reaction mixture was vortexed vigorously for 2 min. A white precipitate formed, which was removed by centrifugation (3000 × g, swinging bucket). The resulting solution was diluted with CH2Cl2 (10 ml) and H2O (10 ml). The aqueous layer (pH ∼7) was separated and extracted with additional CH2Cl2(3 × 10 ml). The combined organic layers were dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo to give 6.8 mg (54%) of N-acetyl-α-methyltryptamine. The neutral aqueous layer was basified to pH ∼11 using 1n NaOH and then extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 ml). The combined extracts were dried (MgSO4) and concentratedin vacuo to give 5.5 mg (44%) of recovered α-methyltryptamine. The identity and purity of both materials (>95%) were verified by 1H NMR. The concentrations of the solutions used for measuring optical rotations were verified independently by measuring UV absorption at λ = 279 nm. The specific rotations are shown under “Results” and gave similar results on two separate occasions. To rule out the possibility that transfer of the acetyl group had occurred non-enzymatically at these concentrations of α-methyltryptamine and acetyl-CoA, the assay mixture, in the absence of AANAT, was stored at 30 °C for 2 h. No acetyl transfer could be detected (<5%) under these conditions. All assays were performed with the added viscogen sucrose to achieve the desired viscosity. Relative viscosities were previously measured with a Canon-Fenske viscometer at 30 °C as described previously (8Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose solutions used to achieve the viscosities in this work were 1.0 (0% (w/v) sucrose), 1.55 (16%), 1.99 (23%), 2.50 (30%), and 3.10 (35%). Measurements of k cat and K m were performed as described previously (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), except that Mops at pH 7.4 and 100 mm NaCl were employed. Under these conditions in the presence of saturating concentrations of N ω-methyltryptamine or tryptamine, theK m for acetyl-CoA was found to be 0.3 mmand did not significantly change with added sucrose. TheK m for tryptamine at near-saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA in the absence of sucrose was found to be 0.12 mm and was <0.1 mm with added sucrose. TheK m forN ω-methyltryptamine at near-saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA in the absence of sucrose was found to be 4 mm and fell with increasing sucrose concentrations as described under “Results.” The k cat values under these assay conditions without added sucrose were 27 and 2.5 s−1 for tryptamine and N ω-methyltryptamine, respectively. UsingN ω-methyltryptamine as substrate, the measurements for k cat and K mwere performed in the pH range 6–8.6 following the general spectrophotometric assay procedures previously described (3De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Accurate rate measurements were not possible above pH 8.6 because of high background aminolysis/hydrolysis rates of acetyl-CoA. All reactions were initiated with enzyme (which was maintained at pH 6.8, but did not significantly affect the final pH), and the activities proved to be linear for at least 3 min, suggesting that altered kinetics were not caused by protein instability under the assay conditions. Enzyme assays showed Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior at each pH investigated. All assays were performed with near-saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA (>3 K m, verified at each pH) throughout the pH range. The following buffers were used to obtain the pH values described in the experiments: pH 6.1–6.7 (Mes), pH 6.7–7.6 (Mops), and pH 7.7–8.6 (Epps). Fits for the k cat data were performed using Equation 2, log(kcat)app=log(kcat/(1+H/K1))(Eq. 2) where H is the proton concentration and K 1 is the dissociation constant for the ionizable group that facilitates the reaction in its deprotonated form. Fits for the k cat/Km data were performed using Equation 3, log(kcat/Km)app=log(kcat/Km(1+H/K1+K2/H))(Eq. 3) where H is the proton concentration,K 1 is the dissociation constant for the ionizable group that facilitates the reaction in its deprotonated form, and K 2 is the dissociation constant for the ionizable group that facilitates the reaction in its protonated form. Both equations were fit using the computer program Kinetasyst II (Intellikinetics), and the kinetic constants ± S.E. are shown under “Results.” The known substrates serotonin and tryptamine contain an ethyl side chain extending from the indole 3-position. The initial objective of these studies was to determine the tolerance of AANAT for substrate alkyl chain length variations. We thus set out to prepare the alkyl chain-extended propylamine (1) and butylamine (2) analogs of tryptamine (5Kayumov V. Smushkevich Y.I. Suvorov N.N. Zh. Vses. Khim. Obshchest. (D I Mendeleeva). 1973; 18: 342Google Scholar). Synthesis of these compounds was achieved in two steps, starting from the corresponding commercially available carboxylic acids 3 and4 (Fig. 2). The carboxylic acids were converted to the hydroxamic acid derivatives 5and 6 and then exhaustively reduced with LiAlH4to afford the desired amines 1 and 2. Kinetic analysis of these compounds was carried out with recombinant sheep AANAT in the presence of saturating levels of acetyl-CoA and with an indirect spectrophotometric assay that monitors CoASH formation. Both of the chain-extended indoleamine substrates 1 and2 were found to be AANAT substrates and displayed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior, although with somewhat reduced catalytic efficiency compared with serotonin (Table I). Propylamine analog 1 was 20-fold reduced in catalytic efficiency, exhibiting both a higherK m and lower k cat compared with serotonin. Butylamine analog 2 was only 3-fold less active as a substrate compared with propylamine analog 1,and the difference was primarily in K m. These results show that AANAT has an optimal preference for indole substrates with 3-ethylamine side chains, corresponding to the natural substrate, but is reasonably tolerant of side chain extension by at least two more methylene groups from the indole ring. Another important issue related to AANAT selectivity is the ability to accommodate α-branching or nitrogen substitution (secondary amines). Tryptophan (both d- and l-isomers) was shown not to be processed by AANAT. The commercially available racemic α-methyltryptamine (7) and N ω-methyltryptamine (8) were next evaluated as AANAT substrates (Fig. 3). Both of these analogs were utilized as substrates by AANAT and displayed Michaelis-Menten behavior, although again with diminished catalytic efficiency compared with tryptamine (Table I). In addition to monitoring amine-induced CoASH generation in the presence of AANAT, direct characterization of the acetamide product derivatives of compounds 7 and8 was accomplished using TLC and 1H NMR, ruling out indoleamine-promoted acetyl-CoA hydrolysis. Racemic α-methyltryptamine (7) exhibitedk cat = 16 ± 0.4 s−1 and K m = 2.7 ± 0.2 mm.N ω-methyltryptamine (8) was still a less efficient substrate, showing k cat = 2.0 ± 0.1 s−1 and K m = 3.8 ± 0.7 mm. Although the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for compound8 with AANAT compared with the standard substrate tryptamine was ∼300-fold reduced, it was still much greater (>300-fold) than the non-enzyme-catalyzed background acetylation rate. That α-methyltryptamine and N ω-methyltryptamine were AANAT substrates allowed further investigation into active-site stereochemical accessibility and enzymatic rate-determining step(s). Most enzyme reactions demonstrate stereoselectivity because of the well defined structure of enzyme active sites. Although racemic α-methyltryptamine (7) was shown to be a substrate for AANAT, the spectrophotometric assay described above was insufficient to reveal potential stereochemical selectivity. A larger scale reaction of AANAT with racemic α-methyltryptamine (7) was allowed to proceed to ∼50% completion over 20 min, and the product and the unreacted starting material were isolated in pure form. The specific rotation ([α]d25) of the recovered α-methyltryptamine from the enzyme reaction was found to be +26° ± 3° (+32° = 100% S-enantiomer (9Kitaguchi H. Fitzpatrick P.A. Huber J.E. Klibanov A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3094-3095Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar)), indicating that it was a 9:1 mixture of S/R-isomers. Furthermore, the specific rotation of the enzymatic productN-acetyltryptamine (+9°) confirmed it to be principally the R-enantiomer by demonstrating its similar magnitude to and opposite sign from (−8.4°) the chemical acetylation product of the enantiomerically enriched (S)-α-methyltryptamine (i.e. the recovered starting material from the AANAT reaction). These results establish unequivocally that AANAT shows stereoselect"

Nature. 1997; 390: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and equilibrium sedimentation studies (33Johnston S.C. Whitby F.G. Realini C. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2469-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas REGβ is monomeric under many conditions (34Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). REGα, by itself, is capable of activating the proteasome, but to a lesser extent than REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers (34Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have shown that amino acids Arg141 to Gly149 in REGα are critical for proteasome activation, and this region forms a loop in the REGα crystal structure (35Zhang Z. Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, we call this region the activation loop. There are two reports that REGβ is inactive (36Kuehn L. Dahlmann B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Song X. Kampen J.V. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and it has recently been proposed that REGβ functions only to modulate the activity of REGα (37Song X. Kampen J.V. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, several publications from our laboratory have shown that REGβ, by itself, activates the proteasome (34Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Z. Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9501-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, a single-site mutation in the presumed activation region of REGβ produces an inactive protein, REGβ(N135Y), that is still capable of binding the proteasome (35Zhang Z. Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although we know that REGβ activates the proteasome, our previous studies did not directly address whether REGβ contributes to proteasome activation in REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers. Consequently, we have now measured proteasome activation by REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers formed from wild-type REGα, wild-type REGβ, and α or β subunits bearing mutations in the activation loops. In contrast to the conclusions reached by DeMartino and colleagues that REGβ serves only to modulate REGα activity (37Song X. Kampen J.V. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we have found that in the 11 S REG both α and β subunits contribute to proteasome activation. We also provide evidence that C-terminal regions of the three homologs, REGα, REGβ, and REGγ, play an important role in proteasome binding. The fluorogenic peptide succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA (LLVY-MCA) was purchased from Sigma. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Cappel. Western blot chemiluminescence reagents were from DuPont NEN. Site-directed mutagenesis kits were from Bio-Rad. Isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside was from Boehringer Mannheim. Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) and DH5α competent cells were from Novagen. The plasmids used were pAED4, pET11a and pET26b. All of the single-site REGα mutants used in the study were isolated by screening randomly mutagenized REGα cDNA libraries as described (35Zhang Z. Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). REGα241γ8, a REGα variant bearing the eight C-terminal amino acids of REGγ, was produced by the Kunkel site-directed mutagenesis method. This method was also used to obtain the REGβ mutants described in these studies. A detailed description on how to make a REGβ mutant and REGα241γ8 using this method can be found in an article by Zhang et al. (38Zhang Z. Realini C. Clawson A. Endicott S. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9501-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of REGα and REGβ subunits was performed essentially as described (35Zhang Z. Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Zhang Z. Realini C. Clawson A. Endicott S. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9501-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria containing plasmids with the desired mutation were grown at 30 °C and induced for 2 h with either 0.6 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside when theA 600 was between 0.2 and 0.3 or 0.8 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside when theA 600 was between 0.4 and 0.5. For most REGα mutants, sufficient protein could be purified from 1 liter of LB (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl/liter, pH 7.5) culture for the biochemical studies described below. Wild-type and mutant REGs were purified as described (34Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Each REGα mutant was at least 85% pure as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of overloaded 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The concentration of REGα or a REGα mutant protein was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm or by using the Pierce Coomassie Blue protein assay. The extinction coefficient of each REGα variant was calculated based on its amino acid composition according to the method described by Gill and Von Hippel (39Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The concentrations of those selected REGαs determined by both methods agreed well with each other within the experimental errors. The concentration of REGβ or REGβ mutants was determined only by the Pierce Coomassie Blue protein assay. This assay was performed essentially the same as described (34Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A Superdex 200 column (Hiload 26/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to purify all of the proteins used in these studies and to determine whether a REGα mutant interacts with REGβ. To determine whether a given REGα mutant binds REGβ, equal amounts of the REGα mutant and REGβ were mixed and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then loaded to the Superdex 200 column and eluted with TSD (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1.1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.2), 175 mm KCl. Selected fractions were then analyzed on 15% SDS gels and/or assayed to determine whether active REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers formed. To purify REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers, we applied the same incubation procedure described above, and proteins from fractions containing REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 0.5 × TSD before use. Purified human red blood cell proteasomes were used for all of the activity assays. Typically, 170 ng of proteasomes in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with REGs or mutants at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were started by adding 50 μl of 200 μmfluorogenic peptide LLVY-MCA. After additional incubation, as indicated in the figure legends, the reactions were quenched with 200 μl of cold ethanol, and the fluorescence was measured as described (34Realini C. Jensen C.

The proteasome binding assay was performed essentially as described (34Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Briefly, REGα, REGβ, and their variants (e.g. mutants and REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers) were incubated with proteasomes tethered to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate. After washing away unbound proteins, proteins that bound the proteasome were eluted with a high-salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mNaCl), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with either REGα- or REGβ-specific antiserum as described (34Realini C.

The apparent molar ratio of REGα and REGβ subunits in hetero-oligomers was determined by HPLC as described (38Zhang Z. Realini C. Clawson A. Endicott S. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9501-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We previously characterized 36 single-site REGα mutants. Most are monomers that are unable to bind or activate the proteasome (35Zhang Z. Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thirty-four REGα mutant proteins were dot-blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter and probed with [35S]methionine-labeled REGβ. Twenty-five of the inactive REGα mutants bound to REGβ, three bound REGβ less tightly than wild-type REGα, and six did not bind REGβ (Table I). Each of the six REGα mutants that failed to bind REGβ in the filter assay, and REGα(D205V), a weak REGβ binder, were mixed with an equal amount of REGβ and incubated overnight at 4 °C. These mixtures were then analyzed on a Superdex 200 column. Whereas REGα(R181C) (Fig. 1, B and D, and Table I) and REGα(D205V) (Table I) failed to form active oligomers, the other five REGα mutants did (for example, see Fig. 1,A and C; also see Table I). As an indirect method to assay for hetero-oligomer formation, we measured proteasome stimulation by each inactive REGα mutant after mixing with wild-type REGβ. Such an assay is possible because at low concentrations (<10 μg/ml) REGβ barely stimulates the peptidase activity of the proteasome (34Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Twenty six of 36 mtREGα/REGβ combinations were as active as hetero-oligomers formed from wild-type subunits; 9 were partially active compared with REGα/REGβ but considerably more active than wild-type REGβ alone. Only one combination, REGα(R181C)/REGβ, did not stimulate the proteasome more than the REGβ control (Table I). Seven mutants that bound REGβ on filters and showed enhanced proteasome activation when mixed with REGβ were further analyzed using gel filtration chromatography. Each formed active hetero-oligomers with REGβ (Table I). Taken together, these analyses lead to the conclusion that in our collection of REGα mutants, all variants, except REGα(R181C) and possibly REGα(D205V), form hetero-oligomers with REGβ. Moreover, in every case the resulting hetero-oligomers activate the proteasome.Table IBiochemical properties of inactive REGα mutants mixed with wild-type REGβREGα variantsBinding to REGβHetero-oligomer activity (mtREGα/REGβ)Filter assayGel filtration assaywtREGα+++++P34L+++++K36R−+++P47T++ND++L49H++ND++N50Y−+++D123GND+++T133S++ND++L135S+++++R141W++ND+(30)G145S++ND+(40)N146Y++++(60)N146S++ND+(80)G149E++++(40)V156M++ND++L167P++ND++S175F+++++S179PND+++R181C−−−D196V−+++R198W++ND++L200P+++(30)D205V+−+(30)L214P−ND++M217V+ND++I219N+ND++R220S++ND++Y223N++ND++Y223H++ND++A224V++ND++D228G++ND++D228N++ND++I230N−+++K232M+++++P240A+++++P240H++ND+(50)P240T++ND+(20)First column, amino acid changes in REGα mutants.

Saddle-shaped structures are present in each protein that are proposed to bind DNA. At the putative endonucleolytic active sites, the superposition reveals that two lysine (Lys-301 and Lys-403 in PI-SceI and Lys-98 and Lys-98′ in I-CreI) and two aspartic acid residues (Asp-218 and Asp-326 in PI-SceI and Asp-20 and Asp-20′ in I-CreI) are related by 2-fold symmetry. The critical role of Lys-301, Asp-218, and Asp-326 in the PI-SceI reaction pathway was reported previously. Here, we demonstrate the significance of the active-site symmetry by showing that alanine substitution at Lys-403 reduces cleavage activity by greater than 50-fold but has little effect on the DNA binding activity of the mutant enzyme. Substitution of Lys-403 with arginine, which maintains the positive charge, has only a modest effect on activity. Interestingly, even though the Lys-301 and Lys-403 residues display pseudosymmetry, PI-SceI mutant proteins with substitutions at these positions have different behaviors.

The presence of similar basic and acidic residues in many LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases suggests that these enzymes use a common reaction mechanism to cleave double-stranded DNA. Homing endonucleases are a group of enzymes that mediate DNA rearrangement processes (for reviews see Refs. 1Mueller J.E. Bryk M. Loizos N. Belfort M. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases.

The genes that encode these proteins are frequently associated with inteins and Group I introns, and homing endonucleases initiate the mobility of these elements to loci that lack them by creating double strand breaks. The LAGLIDADG subfamily of homing endonucleases, including the yeast PI-SceI protein, typically contain two LAGLIDADG motifs (also termed EN1 and EN3 (4Pietrokovski S.

The crystal structure of the PI-SceI intein was recently determined, the first for a homing endonuclease and a protein generated by protein splicing (7Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The structure shows that the endonucleolytic and protein splicing active sites are situated in separate domains. Residues within the two LAGLIDADG motifs in the endonuclease domain form two parallel α-helices that are tightly packed. Two conserved acidic residues (Asp-218 and Asp-326) are located at the C termini of these two helices and play a critical role in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme because substitution of these amino acids with alanine eliminates cleavage activity but permits substrate binding (8Gimble F.S.

Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments indicate that a conserved lysine (Lys-301), which is 6 Å distant from Asp-218 and occurs in another conserved motif (Block D), is also critical for catalytic activity (7Duan X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We remarked previously that the spatial arrangement of the Asp-218, Asp-326, and Lys-301 residues resembles that of residues at the active sites of several restriction enzymes and suggested that the different endonucleases employ similar reaction mechanisms (7Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). PI-SceI forms two protein-DNA complexes with its asymmetric 31-base pair recognition sequence in gel mobility shift experiments, one in which contacts are made between the protein splicing domain and a region of the substrate (region II) that is situated adjacent to the cleavage site, and a second that includes these contacts as well as additional interactions between the endonuclease domain and the cleavage site itself (region I) (9He Z.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By contrast, I-CreI interacts with a shorter, pseudosymmetric 19–24-base pair sequence to yield a single complex (12Wang J. Kim H.-H. Yuan X. Herrin D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3767-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we report that a structural comparison of the PI-SceI and I-CreI proteins (7Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reveals a lysine residue at the PI-SceI active site, Lys-403, that is related by local 2-fold symmetry to Lys-301. Analysis of mutant PI-SceI proteins with substitutions at Lys-403 demonstrates the importance of this residue in the reaction pathway. This previously unrecognized symmetry relationship in PI-SceI necessarily implies that two identical pairs of residues (Asp-218 and Lys-301 and Asp-326 and Lys-403) form either one or two active sites. Superposition of I-CreI and PI-SceI indicates that each pair of residues overlaps with a similar pair in each of the symmetry-related monomers of I-CreI and suggests that the LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases share a common active-site architecture and catalytic mechanism. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. TALON metal affinity resin was obtained fromCLONTECH, and SP-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmid pET PI-SceI C-His contains a PI-SceI gene that encodes a 479-amino acid PI-SceI derivative with a polyhistidine C-terminal extension (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S.

The K403A and K403R substitutions were introduced into the PI-SceI gene using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers in a two-step overlapping polymerase chain reaction amplification protocol (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). All mutations and inserted sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Wild-type PI-SceI and the PI-SceI mutant derivatives were purified as described previously (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol.

Protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 5.03 × 104/m/cm (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol.

A 219-base pair duplex DNA probe that contains a single PI-SceI recognition site was prepared for native gel mobility shift assays by polymerase chain reaction and end-labeled with [32P]ATP (9He Z.

Purified wild-type PI-SceI and the K301A, K301R, K403A, and K403R variant proteins (0.7 nm) were used in gel mobility shift experiments to measure DNA binding as described previously (9He Z. Crist M.

Protein-DNA complexes were separated from unbound DNA on a 7% native polyacrylamide gel and were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel to film. Rates of DNA cleavage were measured under single-cycle conditions where enzyme was in excess over substrate. A linear plasmid substrate (pBS-PISce36, 7 nm) containing a single PI-SceI recognition site was incubated as described previously with either purified wild-type, K403A, or K403R proteins (100 nm) for various lengths of time at 37 °C (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The amounts of undigested linear plasmid DNA and of the two cleavage products were determined by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics), and cleavage rates were determined by curve-fitting of the data using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). The yeast PI-SceI and the ChlamydomonasI-CreI homing endonucleases, in common with all characterized LAGLIDADG endonucleases, require Mg2+co-factor for DNA cleavage activity and cut DNA to yield a 4-base pair extension with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl groups (1Mueller J.E. Bryk M. Loizos N. Belfort M. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 111-143Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that these enzymes utilize a common reaction mechanism. An important functional difference between the proteins is that PI-SceI, but not I-CreI, catalyzes protein splicing and contains motifs located at the N- and C-terminal regions that are specific to splicing proteins (5Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consequently, I-CreI is a much smaller protein (163 residues) than PI-SceI (454 residues). A second reason for the large size difference between the proteins is that the PI-SceI endonuclease domain is likely to have evolved by duplication and fusion of a gene similar to the one that encodes I-CreI. This idea is supported by the observation of a tandemly repeated sequence and protein footprinting pattern in homing endonucleases (15Lykke-Andersen J. Garrett R.A. Kjems J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3982-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PI-SceI contains two LAGLIDADG motifs and binds DNA as a monomer (11Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas I-CreI has only a single motif and exists in solution as a homodimer (12Wang J. Kim H.-H. Yuan X. Herrin D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3767-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To elucidate common and distinctive features of homing endonucleases that contribute to substrate recognition and cleavage, we first compared the PI-SceI and I-CreI structures. The PI-SceI structure reveals that the endonuclease domain (domain II) is folded from two similar α/β substructures (identified as N- and C-subdomains) that are related by an approximate or pseudo 2-fold symmetry (7Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). I-CreI is structurally similar to only the endonuclease domain of PI-SceI as is evident from superimposing the Cα atoms of the endonuclease domain onto those of the I-CreI homodimer (Fig. 1, a–c). The two PI-SceI subdomains and the I-CreI homodimer form a saddle-shaped structure with the underside lined by the two β sheets and the convex upper surface topped by α helices. Models of DNA docked to both proteins indicate involvement of the saddle in DNA binding (7Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The length of the saddle in PI-SceI is about 40 Å, whereas that in I-CreI is about 70 Å. This size difference is because of a long extended structure in the I-CreI homodimer comprised of β1 and β2 strands and a connecting loop that form parts of the two diagonally opposite sides of the homodimer saddle that is significantly shorter in the analogous structures in the N-subdomain (a short loop and β14) and C-subdomain (β19 and β20) of PI-SceI (Fig. 1 a–d). The length of the groove formed by the underside of the I-CreI saddle is sufficient to bind a roughly 20-base pair pseudo-symmetric DNA homing sequence (13Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, the groove length in PI-SceI is sufficient to cover only about 12 base pairs of DNA, far shorter than the required 31 base pairs. Fewer binding contacts may be required by the PI-SceI endonuclease domain because additional contacts are made by the protein-splicing domain (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Grindl W. Wende W. Pingoud V. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1857-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We speculate that PI-SceI lost the extended saddle architecture present in I-CreI once it became associated with a protein splicing domain that acquired DNA binding activity.Figure 1Superpositioned structures of the endonuclease domain of PI-SceI (blue) and the homodimer structure of I-CreI (yellow and gold). a, a stereo view of the overlapped structures viewed down the 2-fold symmetry. The saddles in both proteins are upside down. The first or N-subdomain (top) and the second or C-subdomain (bottom) of the PI-SceI nuclease domain are overlapped with one subunit (yellow, top) and the other subunit (gold, bottom), respectively, of the I-CreI homodimer structure. The residues colored cyan in PI-SceI are the two pairs of residues related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry: Asp-218 and Lys-301 in the N-subdomain and Asp-326 and Lys-403 in the C-subdomain. The two symmetry-related residues, Asp-20 and Lys-98, in both monomers of I-CreI are colored red.b, same as in a but rotated by 90 Å about a horizontal axis for a view down the groove. The N-subdomain of PI-SceI is in the front. c, identical tob but rotated by 180 Å about a vertical axis to bring the C-subdomain of PI-SceI in the front. d, schematic diagram of the secondary structures of PI-SceI (left) and I-CreI homodimer (right). The lengths of the α-helices (green cylinders) and β strands (flat pink arrows) are approximately to scale. Disordered loops are indicated by broken lines. In PI-SceI, the loop that follows α4 makes only one hydrogen bond with the adjacent β14, insufficient to qualify as a β strand, although it overlaps with β1 of I-CreI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The topology of the secondary structure elements of the two PI-SceI subdomains is similar to that of the I-CreI homodimer except for the presence of two additional helices (α7 and α8) at the C-terminal end of I-CreI (Fig. 1 d). Of the 200 residues that are topologically similar between the PI-SceI endonuclease domain and the I-CreI homodimer, 102 Cα atoms overlap with a root mean square of 2 Å and a sequence similarity of 27%. Despite the topological similarity, the extent of overlap of the I-CreI homodimer with the two subdomains differs considerably; of the 102 overlapped residues, 67 are made with the C-subdomain and 35 with the N-subdomain. Interestingly, the number of superimposed residues made with the C-subdomain is similar to that in the overlap between the two PI-SceI subdomains (63 residues with a root mean square of 1.7 Å). This supports the idea that the endonuclease domain of PI-SceI evolved by tandem duplication of a common ancestor of the I-CreI monomer and of one PI-SceI subdomain. Once the gene fusion occurred in PI-SceI, each subdomain could evolve independently to optimize substrate specificity. The structural comparison suggests that the N-subdomain diverged further from the evolutionary ancestor than the C-subdomain because it is far less similar to the I-CreI subunit. The ability of the two subdomains to evolve at different rates, which is not possible in a homodimeric protein, may have permitted PI-SceI to recognize an asymmetric substrate. The overlap between the two structures extends to the conserved Asp residues at the C-terminal end of the LAGLIDADG repeats that comprise part of the active site. In our alignment, Asp-218 and Asp-326 of PI-SceI superimpose with Asp-20 and Asp-20′ in the two monomers of the I-CreI structure with a root mean square of less than 1 Å between both pairs of Cα atoms (Fig. 1 a–c). Substitution of any of these acidic residues with asparagine eliminates cleavage activity (8Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Seligman L.M. Stephens K.M. Savage J.H. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that these Asp residues play the same functional role in the endonuclease activity of both proteins, which may be to chelate the essential Mg2+ ion co-factor(s). However, the coordination of the cation is unknown in both structures. A new finding that results from the structural comparison is that Lys-98 and Lys-98′ of the two I-CreI monomers superimpose on Lys-301 of the PI-SceI N-subdomain and the pseudosymmetrically related Lys-403 in the C-subdomain (Fig. 1). The symmetry relationship of Lys-301 and Lys-403 has not been previously reported. The closest distance between the pair of lysines in PI-SceI is about 15 Å, which is very similar to the 14-Å distance that separates the identical pair in the I-CreI homodimer. The Lys residues are located outside the overlapped secondary structural elements used to perform the structural comparison and, thus, deviate in their Cα position (2.4 Å between Lys-301 and Lys-98 and 3.5 Å between Lys-403 and Lys-98′). However, all their side chains point from the same direction to the well overlapped active-site Asp residues (Fig. 1). To elucidate the role of Lys-403 in the PI-SceI reaction pathway, variant PI-SceI proteins containing alanine and arginine substitutions were expressed, and purified proteins were assayed for DNA cleavage and binding activities. As the purification properties of the K403A and K403R proteins were indistinguishable from those of wild-type PI-SceI, gross changes in conformation of either mutant protein are unlikely. In kinetic experiments performed in the presence of Mg2+, the K403A protein is more than 50-fold less active than wild-type PI-SceI, whereas the K403R protein is about 5-fold less active (Table I). Amino acid substitutions at Lys-301 and Lys-403 do not have identical effects because the K301A variant is inactive, whereas the K403A protein is partially active (Ref. 9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and Table I). However, for both the Lys-301 and Lys-403 mutant proteins, an increase in the level of cleavage activity is observed when manganese is replaced with magnesium in the cleavage buffer, which is known to increase the enzymatic activity of wild-type PI-SceI (Table I). It is also evident from our data that the K301R and K403R variants are more active than the respective K301A and K403A proteins, suggesting that the positive charge at these positions is critical for activity.Table ICleavage activity of wild-type and mutant PI-SceI proteinsMg2+Mn2+Activity × 10−3 1-aUnits are m DNA cleaved/min ×m enzyme.

Open table in a new tab Gel mobility shift experiments indicate that the large decrease in cleavage activity of the K403A protein is not because of reductions in DNA binding. Fig. 2 shows that the upper and lower protein-DNA complexes that are generated by wild-type PI-SceI are also apparent for the K403A and K403R proteins, and the measured level of binding is not markedly different from that for wild-type PI-SceI. 1M. Crist and F. S. Gimble, unpublished results. The ratio of upper to lower complex is slightly higher for the Lys-403 mutant proteins relative to wild-type PI-SceI. The large reduction in catalytic activity of the Lys-403 variants coupled with their near wild-type binding behavior is consistent with a role for Lys-403 in catalysis. In contrast, no conclusions about the role of Lys-301 in catalysis can be drawn because of the fact that nonconservative substitutions at Lys-301 eliminate substrate binding to region I. Fig. 2 shows that as reported previously, no upper complex is produced by the K301A protein, and the K301R variant yields an upper complex that migrates faster than that of wild-type PI-SceI (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The two lysines (Lys-98 and Lys98′) in I-CreI that superimpose on Lys-301 and Lys-403 occur in two identical monomer subunits and necessarily have identical functions. Consistent with the finding that Lys-301 and Lys-403 are critical for DNA cleavage activity, substitution of Lys-98 and Lys-98′ of I-CreI with glutamine inactivates the protein in a genetic system in vivo (17Seligman L.M. Stephens K.M. Savage J.H. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no biochemical studies have been performed, and the basis of the phenotype is unknown (17Seligman L.M. Stephens K.M. Savage J.H. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, because I-CreI is a homodimer, both lysines are necessarily altered in the mutant, and analysis of proteins with single substitutions at these positions will require engineering differentially tagged monomers as has been done for EcoRV (18Stahl F. Wende W. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6175-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It cannot be concluded that Lys-301 and Lys-403 of PI-SceI have identical functions given that proteins with mutations at these positions behave differently. In PI-SceI, where the two monomer subunits are fused, the two lysines occur in different local environments and may have evolved somewhat different functions during evolution. If indeed Lys-301 and Lys-403 have identical functions, the different binding behaviors of the K301A and K403A proteins could be because of differing abilities of the protein to accommodate the substituted amino acids at each position. Lys-403 is located in the middle of the large loop connecting α9 of domain II with β23 of domain I, whereas Lys-301 is located at the end of β18, which is part of the two-stranded short β sheet connecting the two subdomains of domain II. Because β strand is not as flexible as the loop, the mutation of Lys-301 to arginine may be unable to be positioned correctly to achieve full catalytic function like the K403R mutant. A critical role in the homing endonuclease reaction pathway for two symmetrically related positively charged residues would be reflected by their conservation among the LAGLIDADG protein family. Indeed, conserved lysine residues analogous to Lys-301 have been reported in Block D of inteins (5Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and an alignment based on a Hidden Markov model indicates that conserved lysines and arginines occur at or near this position in virtually all LAGLIDADG proteins (19Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). By contrast, none of the alignments specifically identified Lys-403 of PI-SceI as a conserved residue. The Hidden Markov model alignment did identify a conserved lysine in some of the homing endonucleases only a few residues removed from Lys-403, and we presume that this residue plays an analogous role in these enzymes (19Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To illustrate the relative positions of the symmetrically related acidic and basic residues at the putative active site, an alignment of PI-SceI, the related yeast Ho (F-SceII) endonuclease, and I-CreI is shown in Fig. 3. Conservation of Lys-403 may not have been detected in sequence alignments because this residue occurs in a loop whose sequence may have diverged significantly. Does PI-SceI use two active sites to effect double strand cleavage or a single site that acts sequentially? Our finding of two symmetrically related lysines is consistent with a two-active-site model. In this scenario, the two active sites would be comprised of Lys-301 and Asp-218 and of Lys-403 and Asp-326, respectively. The two aspartic acids either act together to bind a single metal ion that is shared by both active sites or bind two metal ions, one for each active site, in conjunction with other acidic residues, the polypeptide backbone carbonyl oxygens, or phosphate oxygens. According to this model, each I-CreI monomer subunit contains a single active site, as has been suggested previously (13Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Seligman L.M. Stephens K.M. Savage J.H. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If PI-SceI contains two independent active sites, it might be expected that they could be uncoupled by mutation to produce a nicking activity. However, no nicking activity is apparent for the K301A and K403A mutant proteins. 2D. Hu and F. S. Gimble, unpublished results. Furthermore, no nicking occurs when either Asp-218 or Asp-326 is substituted with alanine (8Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), although this result might be expected if these residues function to bind metal ion(s) required by both sites. These observations suggest that either the two putative sites are tightly coupled and cannot be separated (11Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or there is only a single active site in PI-SceI that cuts both strands. The architecture of the PI-SceI and I-CreI active sites can be compared with that of the two active sites in homodimeric restriction endonucleases, each of which contains at least two acidic residues that chelate a metal ion and a lysine whose function is unclear (20Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Substitution of the acidic residues in restriction endonucleases that bind a catalytic metal ion eliminates activity (20Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and similar results are observed when Asp-218 and Asp-326 substitutions are made in PI-SceI (8Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whether the conserved lysine residues in both families of enzymes are functionally analogous is less certain. Lys-403 of PI-SceI may be involved in catalysis because mutations at this position reduce cleavage activity but do not affect DNA binding. However, the residue is unlikely to play an essential role in the catalytic reaction mechanism, such as generating the activated water molecule, because a larger reduction in activity would have been expected for the mutant enzymes, but it may still function in other capacities, such as helping to neutralize accumulated negative charge on the presumed pentavalent transition state or binding to the cleavage products. Similarly, an alanine substitution at the conserved Lys-92 of EcoRV reduces cleavage activity (21Selent U. Rüter T. Kàhler E. Liedtke M. Thielking V. Alves J. Oelgeschläger T. Wolfes H. Peters F. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4808-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A key difference between EcoRV and PI-SceI is that arginine substitution at Lys-403 of PI-SceI yields a protein with near wild-type activity, but a K92R mutant of EcoRV is inactive (22Vipond I.B.

Thus, additional mechanistic information for both the restriction enzymes and the homing endonucleases will be required to determine whether the lysine residues are functionally analogous. Besides the conserved acidic and basic residues discussed above, I-CreI residues Gln-47, Arg-51, and Arg-70 and their symmetric partners have also been implicated in the catalytic pathway by mutagenesis experiments (17Seligman L.M. Stephens K.M. Savage J.H. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies of the related homodimeric endonuclease I-CeuI identified Gln-93 and 93′, which are homologues of Gln-47 and 47′ in I-CreI, as critical amino acids (23Turmel M. Otis C. Côté V. Lemieux C. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1997; 25: 2610-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In PI-SceI, Asp-229 occupies a similar position in an analogous β structure as Gln-47, but the side chains of the two residues do not overlap because the carboxyl group of Asp-229, unlike the Gln-47 amide, points away from the active site (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We suggested previously that Asp-229 may be involved in catalysis because a D229A mutant protein is reduced >500-fold in cleavage activity but is only slightly reduced in substrate binding (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that an acidic residue is conserved at or near this position (19Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is possible that Asp-229 functions to coordinate a metal ion in conjunction with Asp-218 as part of one active site, but if this is true, rotation of the Asp-229 side chain and additional conformational changes would be required when the protein binds to the substrate. PI-SceI residue Thr-341 is related to Asp-229 by pseudosymmetry and overlaps Gln-47′ in I-CreI. A T341A mutant protein does not form an upper complex in gel mobility shift experiments, and this reduced binding may account for the ∼11-fold reduction in catalytic activity of the protein relative to wild-type PI-SceI. 3M. Crist and F. S. Gimble, unpublished results. However, it is unlikely that Thr-341 is involved in binding the metal co-factor in a second active site because a larger decrease in activity would be expected for the mutant protein. The side chains of PI-SceI residues Arg-231 and His-343 are close to, but do not overlap, those of Arg-51 and -51′ in I-CreI. R231A and H343A mutant proteins are 14- and 5-fold reduced in activity, respectively, and the H343A protein displays a modest reduction in binding (9He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whether these residues are functional analogues of I-CreI residues Arg-51 and -51′ is unclear. Finally, Arg-70 in one I-CreI monomer is located in a position similar to Asp-254 or Arg-255 of PI-SceI, and Arg 70′ in the other monomer closely overlaps with Glu-366 in PI-SceI. However, these PI-SceI residues are unlikely to be Arg-70 analogues because alanine substitutions at these positions do not adversely affect PI-SceI activity. Taken together, these data indicate that in some cases there are PI-SceI and I-CreI residues that occur at analogous positions that may play analogous functions in the cleavage reaction. A structure of a homing endonuclease bound to its substrate will help support this conclusion. We are grateful to Michael Crist for useful discussions and excellent technical assistance."

DNA can be damaged by a variety of physical and chemical agents. Most types of lesions are efficiently removed from DNA by repair mechanisms. The nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 system is able to correct a broad spectrum of adducts, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts caused by ultraviolet light, intrastrand cross-links formed by cis-diamine-dichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin), as well as O6-methylguanine (O6meG) produced by methylating agents such asN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (1Huang J.-C.

The mutHLS-like mismatch-repair pathway efficiently corrects most base-base mismatches and small DNA loops, which frequently occur during replication by misincorporation of bases and strand slippage, respectively (4Modrich P.

A defect in the human geneshMSH2 (a homologue of Escherichia coli MutS),hMLH1, hPMS1, or hPMS2 (all of which are MutL homologues) is responsible for the heritable cancer syndrome hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. The clinical symptoms of patients with homozygously mutated hMSH2, hMLH1, orhPMS2 genes are accompanied by microsatellite instability and mismatch repair deficiency, whereas there is no indication thathPMS1 has a role in mismatch repair (4Modrich P.

Thus, mismatch-repair proteins and NER proteins might compete in repair of some types of DNA lesions. Whereas repair mediated by the NER system normally restores wild type information, the action of mismatch-repair proteins on lesions rather contribute to cytotoxicity (11Branch P. Aquilina G. Bignami M. Karran P. Nature. 1993; 362: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 12Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several high mobility group (HMG) proteins are known to bind to GpG intrastrand cross-links (13Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Binding by HMG-1 shields the lesion from excision by the human excinuclease protein complex (14Huang J.-C.

Consistently, aSaccharomyces cerevisiae mutant, defective in the HMG-box gene IXR1, is more resistant to cisplatin than wild type (15Brown S.J. Kellet P.J. Lippard S.J. Science. 1993; 261: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have identified a mismatch-binding activity in Schizosaccharomyces pombe crude extracts showing high affinity to cytosine-containing mismatches (16Fleck O. Schär P. Kohli J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5289-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the purification of this activity, Cmb1, and cloning of the respective gene. DNA sequencing revealed that Cmb1 contains a HMG domain. Cmb1 was purified from an E. coli overexpression strain and tested for binding to mismatches, small DNA loops, and substrates containing either GpG intrastrand cross-links or O6meG. Furthermore, we addressed the question of whether a cmb1 mutant responds differently to the chemicals cisplatin, transplatin, and MNNG. Binding of Cmb1 protein to DNA substrates was tested with a band shift assay. Substrates and competitor DNA used to test binding to mismatches, loops, and O6meG lesions are in the M13mp9 polylinker sequence context (16Fleck O. Schär P. Kohli J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5289-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The sequence of the platinated substrates and their unplatinated controls is shown in Fig. 6 A. For platination, 1 pmol of plus strand was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing either 0.1 mmcisplatin or 0.1 mm transplatin (Sigma). Unreacted cisplatin or transplatin was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The extent of platinated oligonucleotides was checked on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and was estimated to be approximately 60–80%. Modified and unmodified strands were 5′-end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with their complementary strands as described (16Fleck O. Schär P. Kohli J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5289-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To test binding to the various substrates, 20-μl reactions were performed for 15 min at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01 mm ZnCl2, 50–200 mm NaCl in the presence of 40 fmol radiolabeled substrate. The amount of unlabeled homoduplex DNA as competitor and the source of protein samples are indicated in the text. Reaction samples were separated by electrophoresis (110 V, 4 °C) in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA. Subsequently, gels were subjected to autoradiography. The procedure for obtaining S. pombe cells for protein extracts was as described (16Fleck O. Schär P. Kohli J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5289-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except that we used Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, adjusted at room temperature), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.1 mm spermine, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for washing and suspending cells. To estimate the degree of purity of Cmb1, protein samples from different purification steps were separated on 12–13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis and analyzed after staining with silver nitrate or Coomassie Blue. For protein purification, all steps were done at 4 °C. 485 g of cells (720 ml), previously frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C, were thawed. A 400-ml chamber for a Bead beater (Biospec Products) loaded with 350 g of acid-washed glass beads (0.5 mm in diameter) was used for four consecutive steps of cell disruption. Each step included ten 30-s intervals, with at least 2 min of cooling on ice between each interval. The suspensions were pooled and centrifuged for 1 h at 32,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman). The 510-ml supernatant was separated from cell debris and lipids (fraction I). (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 50%, and the precipitate was collected by 20 min of centrifugation at 13,000 × g, suspended in Buffer B150 (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, adjusted at room temperature), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and dialyzed twice against 5.5 liters of Buffer B150 (fraction II). The 310-ml fraction II was loaded at a flow rate of 140 ml/h on two parallel DEAE-cellulose columns (DE52, Whatman, 20 cm2 × 22 cm), equilibrated with Buffer B150. The flow-through (420 ml of fraction III) was loaded at a flow rate of 43 ml/h on a double-stranded DNA-cellulose column (Sigma, 4.5 cm2 × 20 cm), equilibrated with B150. Bound proteins were eluted by a 480-ml linear gradient from 100% B300 to 100% B700 (same buffers as B150, except that they contain 0.3 and 0.7m NaCl, respectively). Active fractions (between 0.4 and 0.6 m) were pooled and dialyzed twice against 4 liters of Buffer B150 to give 290 ml of fraction IV. Fraction IV was loaded at a flow rate of 27 ml/h on a heparin-agarose column (type I, Sigma, 1.8 cm2 × 7 cm), equilibrated with Buffer B150. Bound proteins were eluted step-wise with 2 column volumes of B400, B550, and B700, respectively (buffers differ from Buffer B150 in NaCl concentrations of 0.4, 0.55, and 0.7 m, respectively). The mismatch-binding activity Cmb1 eluted at 0.55 m NaCl. A 4-ml aliquot was stored for N-terminal peptide sequencing (see below). The remainder of the fractions were pooled, dialyzed twice against 2 liters of B150 (18 ml of fraction V) and then loaded on a 1 ml MonoQ column (HR5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted by 2 ml of B300 followed by a 14-ml linear gradient from 0.3 to 1 m NaCl. Cmb1 peaked at 0.4m NaCl of the gradient but was also detected in the flow-through and in the fractions eluted by 0.3 m NaCl, indicating that the MonoQ column was overloaded. Nevertheless, the use of this column enabled the identification of the mismatch binding activity as a 22-kDa protein (Fig. 1). Active fractions were separately dialyzed against Buffer S (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −20 °C (fraction VI). For N-terminal sequencing, a 4-ml aliquot of fraction V was concentrated to 280 μl by 75 min of centrifugation at 3600 ×g in two 2-ml Centricon-10 tubes (Amicon Inc.). Proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an Immobilon membrane by electroblotting, and stained with Amido Black, and the 22-kDa protein band (400 pmol) was excised. The N-terminal sequence EKNGLQKLIPPRLKTIWNQMLVETKGAGN of 29 amino acids was obtained by Johann Schaller and Urs Kämpfer (Protein Analytical Service, Institute of Biochemistry, Bern, Switzerland) using a pulsed-liquid phase Sequenator 477A (Applied Biosystems Inc.). PCRs were performed in a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler. Standard reactions of 50 μl contained 10–100 pmol of each of two primers, 0.1 mm each dNTP, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Appligene) in a standard PCR buffer (Appligene). As templates, either 300 ng of genomic S. pombe DNA (for PCR cloning) or about 10 ng of plasmid DNA (for hybridization probes, for the construction of thecmb1::his3 + gene disruption, and for cloning of cmb1 into the E. coli expression vector pT7–7) were used. Reactions included 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at a temperature depending on the composition of the primer (annealing temperatures are specified below for individual experiments), and 1 min of synthesis at 72 °C. Finally, a 10-min extension step at 72 °C was applied. Differences from this standard protocol are indicated in the text. The 29 amino acid sequence determined from the Cmb1 protein was used to isolate a PCR clone of thecmb1 + gene from chromosomal S. pombeDNA. Four degenerate primers derived from the ends (primers CC-1a, CC-1b, and CC-3) or from a middle part (primer CC-2) of this sequence were used for PCR: primer CC-1a, 5′-CTCGGATCCAA(A/G)AA(C/T)GG(A/C/G/T)CT(A/C/G/T)CA(A/G)AA-3′, primer CC-1b, 5′-CTCGGATCCAA(A/G)AA(C/T)GG(A/C/G/T)TT(A/G)CA(A/G)AA-3′ (both derived from the amino acid sequence KNGLQK), primer CC-2, 5′-CAT(C/T)TG(A/G)TTCCA(A/G/T)AT(A/C/G/T)GT(C/T)TT-3′ (derived from KTIWNQM), and primer CC-3, 5′-CACGGATCCTT(A/C/G/T)CC(A/C/G/T)GC(A/C/G/T)CC(T/C)TT-3′ (derived from KGAGN). Primers CC-1a, CC-1b, and CC-3 contain aBamHI restriction site and three additional bases at their 5′-ends. A PCR product of the expected size was obtained with primer pair CC-1b/CC-3 but not with CC-1a/CC-3. Amplification was performed by three initial cycles with an annealing temperature of 40 °C, followed by 30 cycles with an annealing temperature of 65 °C. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. A band of the expected size (102 bp) was eluted from the gel (17Wu W. Welsh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and used for reamplification with primers CC-1b and CC-3 and for PCR with primers CC-1b and CC-2. This reaction (annealing at 47 °C) produced a 67-bp fragment, indicating that the 102-bp fragment contained the sequence of interest. The reamplified 102-bp DNA fragment was digested withBamHI, cloned into pUC18, and sequenced. One clone (pOL50) was used for further screening. The pOL50-insert was random-prime-labeled with 32P (Ready to Go DNA labeling kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to screen a plasmid-based library of S. pombe (18Barbet N. Muriel W.J. Carr A.M. Gene. 1992; 114: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) by colony hybridization. From this library several clones with a truncated open reading frame (ORF) of cmb1 + were identified. A region containing 264 bp of the ORF was amplified by PCR with primer CC-6 (5′-CTGTTTGACGCAATGCCTCC-3′) and primer CC-7 (5′-GATCTCATCGGCAGTCAAAG-3′) (annealing at 54 °C). The PCR product was radiolabeled with 32P and hybridized to ordered cosmid and P1 libraries (19Hoheisel J.D. Maier E. Mott R. McCarthy L. Grigoriev A.V. Schalkwyk L.C. Nizetic D. Francis F.

Genet. 1992; 1: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Two cosmids and four P1 clones were obtained which all map on chromosome I between ras1 + and cdc3 + (19Hoheisel J.D. Maier E. Mott R. McCarthy L. Grigoriev A.V. Schalkwyk L.C. Nizetic D. Francis F. Lehrach H. Cell. 1993; 73: 109-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). From one cosmid (ICRFc60H037), three fragments from the region of interest were subcloned in pUC18 (pOL54 to pOL59). Double-stranded plasmid–DNA (pOL54 to pOL59) was sequenced by the dideoxy method using a sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). The cmb1 + ORF was determined from both strands with primers derived from pUC18 and with primers derived from the inserts (not shown). Sequences were analyzed with the Wisconsin program package, version 9 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The following strategy resulted in replacement of the complete ORF of cmb1 + by his3 +. A 342-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking region and a 512-bp fragment of the 3′-flanking region of cmb1 + were amplified by PCR (annealing at 50 °C) with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). For the 5′-flanking region, primers DC-1 (5′-ATAGTCTATGGTGAGTAATG-3′) and DC-2 (5′- TCAAGTACTGAGTAAATATCG-3′) were used, and for the 3′-flanking region, primers DC-3 (5′-ACACTCTACTTGCCCAGATC-3′) and DC-4 (5′-TATTGGGCGTGCAAATTGTG-3′) were used. The primers contain restriction sites at their 5′-ends for cloning (not shown). PCR products were inserted to the left and right of the his3 + gene, previously cloned in pBluescript KS. A 1.5-kb fragment containing thiscmb1::his3 + construction was transformed into a S. pombe h + his3-D1 strain (21Burke J.D. Gould K.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). His+ transformants were checked by Southern hybridization for correct gene disruption (data not shown). Strain OL142 (h + cmb1::his3 + his3-D1) was stored for further experiments. The full-length cmb1 gene was amplified by PCR (annealing at 54 °C) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), primer EC1 (5′-CTTGCTAGCCATATGCGTCTGTTTGACGCAATG-3′), and primer EC2 (5′-GTAGGATCCTCATCATCGAAATCCGGCTTC-3′), derived from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding region, respectively. A truncated cmb1gene missing the 5′ nucleotide sequence coding for the amino acids 2–41 was amplified with primer EC3 (5′-CTTCATATGGAAAAGAATGGATTACAGAAG-3′) and primer EC2 (annealing at 55 °C). Primers EC1 and EC3 contain a NdeI restriction site, and primer EC2 contains a BamHI restriction site. The PCR products were digested with NdeI/BamHI and then ligated with digested pT7–7. The ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli strain XL1blue, and plasmids containing correct inserts were checked for mutations by sequencing. For expression of the protein, the plasmids were transformed intoE. coli strain BL21/DE3. Stationary phase cultures of the expression strains were inoculated 1:40 in fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C until anA 600 of about 0.7 was reached. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 5 h of induction, cells were harvested by 10 min of centrifugation at 8300 × gand suspended in Buffer A. After brief freezing in liquid nitrogen, cells were stored at −70 °C until further use. To prepare crude protein extracts containing Cmb1 or Cmb1Δ41, Buffer B150 was added to the thawed cells (13 of the total volume). Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice (10 times for 30 s, with at least 1 min cooling on ice between each round). After 20 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was removed (crude protein extracts, fraction I). The strain BL21/DE3 containing pT7–7 with the truncatedcmb1 gene was used for purification of the respective protein, Cmb1Δ41. Fraction I (137 mg of protein in 28 ml) was obtained from a 750-ml E. coli culture and loaded at a flow rate of 19 ml/h on a Heparin-agarose column (type I, Sigma, 1.8 cm2 × 11 cm) previously equilibrated with Buffer B150. Bound proteins were eluted by 20 ml of Buffer B300 followed by a 100-ml gradient from 300 to 800 mm NaCl. Cmb1Δ41 peaked at 580 mm. The purest fractions were collected and dialyzed in B150 to give fraction II (2.8 mg of protein in 7 ml). Fraction II was loaded at a flow rate of 8 ml/h on a P11 phosphocellulose column (Whatman, 0.64 cm2 × 4.7 cm). Bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of B350 (Buffer B containing 350 mm NaCl), followed by a 60-ml gradient from 350 to 800 mm NaCl. Cmb1Δ41 eluted between 400 and 550 mm and peaked at 480 mm. At this step, a few faint bands of other proteins were detected in early fractions (around 400 mm) but not in the other fractions containing Cmb1Δ41. However, an additional purification step was included with later fractions. These fractions were pooled and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 300 mm by addition of Buffer B0 (same as Buffer B150 but without NaCl). The resulting fraction III (1.9 mg of protein in 7.3 ml) was loaded at a flow rate of 7 ml/h on a double-stranded DNA-cellulose column (United States Biochemical Corp., 0.64 cm2 × 4.7 cm), equilibrated with B300. After washing, a 40-ml gradient from 300 to 600 mm NaCl was applied. Cmb1Δ41 peaked at 400 mm. No other proteins could be detected in a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cmb1Δ41 was then dialyzed against Buffer S and stored in aliquots at −20 °C (fraction IV, 1.8 mg of protein in 7 ml). To test sensitivity of S. pombe cells to various chemicals, 1 × 107 cells derived from stationary phase cultures were incubated with shaking in 2 ml of 0.25% yeast extract; 1.5% glucose, adenine, histidine, and uracil (each 0.005%); and varying concentrations of cisplatin (0–0.8 mm), transplatin (0–3 mm), or MNNG (0–400 μg/ml). Cells were incubated with either cisplatin or transplatin for 90 min or with MNNG for 30 min. The cells were harvested, washed with 5 ml of 0.85% NaCl, pelleted again, and resuspended in 0.85% NaCl. Appropriate dilutions were plated on YEA (0.5% yeast extract; 3% glucose; and 1.5% agar supplemented with adenine, histidine and uracil (each 0.01%)). Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C before scoring colonies. The experiments were carried out six times in the case of cisplatin, two times with transplatin, and six times with MNNG. An activity binding to cytosine-containing single-base mismatches was previously identified in S. pombe crude extracts (16Fleck O. Schär P. Kohli J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5289-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We enriched this activity, Cmb1, from extracts of an S. pombe wild type strain (fraction I) by ammonium sulfate precipitation (fraction II), followed by chromatography through DEAE-cellulose (fraction III), double-stranded DNA-cellulose (fraction IV), Heparin-agarose (fraction V), and MonoQ columns (fraction VI) (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of the fractions from the last purification step by a band-shift assay revealed a strong enrichment of the mismatch-specific activity in fractions 30 and 31 (Fig. 1 A). The intensity of the band shift correlated well with the intensity of a 22-kDa band visualized in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 B). The purest fractions also contained a second dominant protein of about 65 kDa and a few other proteins at low concentrations. These fractions were tested for their mismatch-binding ability. We found strong affinity to C/A, T/C, and C/Δ and some binding to C/C and T/T. No or weak binding was observed to homoduplex and to substrates with a T/G, A/A, G/G, or G/A mismatch (Fig. 1 C). 400 pmol of the 22-kDa Cmb1 protein were used for N-terminal sequencing and resulted in the determination of 29 amino acids (Fig. 2 A). Four degenerate primers derived from the peptide sequence of Cmb1 were used for PCR (Fig. 2 A). A band of the expected size, obtained with primer pair CC-1b/CC-3, was eluted from the gel and subjected to PCR with primer pair CC-1b/CC-2. A single 67-bp band was produced, indicating that the 102-bp fragment contained the sequence of interest. Sequencing of the 102-bp fragment from five clones revealed inserts with the coding capability for the amino acid sequence determined from the Cmb1 peptide. The insert of one clone (pOL50) was used to screen a plasmid-based S. pombe library (18Barbet N. Muriel W.J. Carr A.M. Gene. 1992; 114: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Several clones were identified, but all contained only part of the open reading frame of cmb1 + at one end of the inserts (Fig. 2 B). This truncated ORF (270 bp) contained 126 bp upstream and 61 bp downstream of the sequence previously determined from the PCR clones. A PCR product of this ORF was used as hybridization probe for ordered cosmid and P1 libraries (19Hoheisel J.D. Maier E. Mott R. McCarthy L. Grigoriev A.V. Schalkwyk L.C. Nizetic D. Francis F.

From one cosmid (ICRFc60H037), three fragments from the region of interest were subcloned in pUC18 (Fig. 2 C). By sequencing the 3′-flanking region of cmb1 +, thearg3 + gene (22Van Huffel C. Dubois E. Messenguy F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was found to be located approximately 600 bp downstream from the ORF of cmb1 +, which is consistent with the mapping of cmb1 + between ras1 + and cdc3 +. Double-stranded sequencing of cmb1 + revealed an intronless ORF of 669 bp encoding a 26-kDa protein. The partially purified Cmb1 has a molecular mass of 22 kDa. Judged from its N-terminal amino acid sequence used for cloning, it represents a proteolytic product without the N-terminal 41 amino acids encoded in the ORF of cmb1 +. By data base searches with the deduced amino acid sequence of cmb1 +, a HMG domain was identified in the C-terminal part (Fig. 3). This DNA-binding motif is common to a large family of HMG domain proteins characterized in various eukaryotes (13Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 23Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Originally, HMG-1 and HMG-2 were found to be abundant non-histone components of chromatin, migrating with high mobility in gels (28Johns E.W. Johns E.W. The HMG Chromosomal Proteins. Academic Press, London1982: 1-9Google Scholar). A number of proteins were then identified that contain one to six regions of significant homology to regions of HMG-1 and HMG-2 (23Grosschedl R.

Some HMG domain proteins are transcription factors that recognize specific DNA sequences, whereas some are known to bind to specific DNA structures, such as four-way junctions (30Bianchi M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2050171932,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) causes G1-phase growth arrest of A375-C6 human melanoma cells by hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product Rb. Because p53 and p21/WAF1 proteins are key components of growth arrest pathways involving Rb hypophosphorylation, we tested the functional role of these two proteins in IL-1 action. Exposure to IL-1 caused induction of both p53 and p21/WAF1 proteins. However, inhibition of p53 function by the K1 mutant of SV40-T antigen or by m175 (Arg to His) dominant-negative mutant of p53 did not result in abrogation of IL-1 action, suggesting that p53 function is not required for growth arrest by IL-1. Studies aimed at testing the role of p21/WAF1 in IL-1 action indicated that IL-1 induced p21/WAF1 expression independently of the p53 status of the cells. However, inhibition of p21/WAF1 expression resulted in only a marginal rescue from the growth-arresting action of IL-1. These findings imply that despite their induction, neither wild-type p53 nor p21 can fully account for the growth arrest by IL-1. Thus, a p53- and p21-independent pathway(s) mediates IL-1 action."
https://openalex.org/W1971984509,"The ribonuclease active site harbored by the Flp site-specific recombinase can act on two neighboring phosphodiester bonds to yield mechanistically distinct chain breakage reactions. One of the RNase reactions apparently proceeds via a covalent enzyme intermediate and targets the phosphodiester position involved in DNA recombination (Flp RNase I activity). The second activity (Flp RNase II) targets the phosphodiester immediately to the 3′ side but appears not to involve an enzyme-linked intermediate. Flp RNase I is absolutely dependent upon Tyr-343 of Flp and is competitive with respect to the normal strand joining reaction. It can utilize the 2′-hydroxyl group from any one of the four ribonucleotides with comparable efficiencies in the cleavage reaction. On the other hand, the RNase II reaction mediated by Flp(Y343F) is specific for U and cannot utilize the 2′-hydroxyl group from ribo-A, -G, or -C under standard reaction conditions. The RNase II activity is also sensitive to the 3′-neighboring base. Although dT is functional, the activity is stimulated by U or U-2′-OMe. The Flp RNase II reaction effectively competes with the normal strand cleavage reaction mediated by Tyr-343, even though their phosphodiester targets are not the same."
https://openalex.org/W2035306523,"We identified new, potentially unstable loci in the human genome containing 5′-(CGG)n-3′ trinucleotide repeats by screening a human subgenomic library as well as a chromosome 16 library with a 5′-(CGG)17-3′ oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe. Five different clones were isolated, two from the chromosome 16 library and three from the subgenomic library. Determinations of the nucleotide sequences have revealed that the E7 clone displayed, in addition to the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ trinucleotide repeat, a 5′-(CAG)n-3′ and a 5′-(CCT)n-3′ trinucleotide repeat. Two clones, CL16-1 and P5-5, had homologies to known genes, the human casein kinase II α′ subunit (chromosome 16) and the human calcium-activated potassium channel (chromosome 10), respectively. Clones E7 and P4 were assigned to chromosome 6, whereas CL16-8 mapped to chromosome 16. Their potential coding capacities were assessed by RNA transfer (Northern blotting) experiments. Four different transcripts were identified by using the E7 clones as hybridization probes, three of them being brain-specific. The P4 clone was expressed in placenta and skeletal muscle. Minor polymorphisms within the repeats were observed in normal and in fragile X individuals.

Fragile sites can be classified into two major groups, rare and common ones. Among the rare fragile sites, at least 19 are folate-sensitive. So far, five folate-sensitive fragile sites have been characterized at the molecular level: FRAXA, FRAXE, FRAXF, FRA16A, and FRA11B. They are associated with an expansion of 5′-(CGG)n-3′ trinucleotide repeats, with three of them being linked to clinical phenotypes. Whereas expansion at the FRAXA locus results in the fragile X syndrome, expansion at the FRAXE locus leads to mild mental retardation, and the FRA11B locus can be involved in the Jacobsen syndrome. The amplified FRA16A and FRAXF loci are not linked to known phenotypes, and genes have not yet been found near these fragile sites. Several severe human diseases have been associated with the expansion of naturally occurring triplet repeats in the human genome (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Ashley Jr., C.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 703-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 2Warren S.T. Science. 1996; 271: 1374-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3Koshy B.T. Zoghbi H.Y.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The cause of these instabilities in human DNA has remained unknown. In eight different loci, a 5′-(CAG)n-3′ repeat as part of the coding region of genes can be amplified and cause a lengthening of a normal polyglutamine sequence. Severe neurological disorders, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 6, and 7, Huntington disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (Haw River syndrome), and Machado-Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3) are associated with the expansion of polyglutamine tracts. In Friedreich's ataxia, the only disease in this group with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, a 5′-(GAA)n-3′ repeat is expanded in the first intron of the X25 gene (6Campuzano V. Montermini L. Moltò M.D. Pianese L. Cossée M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A. Zara F. Cañizares J. Koutnikova H. Bidichandani S.I. Gellera C. Brice A. Trouillas P.

Surprisingly, in myotonic dystrophy, the expanded 5′-(CTG)n-3′ repeat lies in the 3′-untranslated region, allegedly affecting the structure of the 3′-region of the messenger RNA (7Buxton J. Shelbourne P. Davies J. Jones C. Van Tongeren T. Aslanidis C. de Jong P. Jansen G. Anvret M. Riley B. Williamson R. Johnson K.

But the same region also constitutes the 5′ segment of the myotonic dystrophy-associated homeobox gene (9Thornton C.A. Wymer J.P. Simmons Z. McClan C. Moxly III R.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Klesert T.R. Otten A.D. Bird T.D. Tapscott J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The fragile X syndrome has been the first disease to be linked to a fragile site in the human genome. The FRAXA fragile site on the X chromosome in location A can be elicited by culturing the cells in a medium devoid of folic acid and thymidine (for reviews, see Refs. 11Sutherland G.R. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1991; 8: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholarand 12Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By now, in excess of 100 fragile sites have been identified in the human genome, their recognition being dependent on the addition of specific chemicals to the culture medium, such as 5-bromo-deoxyuridine, thymidine, distamycin A, aphidicolin, 5-azacytidine, and others. Most of these fragile sites exhibit no genetic phenotype, e.g.those at chromosomes XF (FRAXF) or 16A (FRA16A). The fragile sites FRAXA at Xq27.3 or FRAXE at Xq28 are linked to varying degrees of mental retardation. At several of the fragile sites in the human genome, expansions of naturally occurring 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats have been documented. The pathologically expanded repeats and adjacent nucleotide sequences can become de novo5′-(CG)-3′-methylated (13Oberlé I. Rousseau F. Heitz D. Kretz C. Devys D. Hanauer A. Boue J. Bertheas M.F. Mandel J.-L. Science. 1991; 252: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In the FRAXA syndrome, typically presenting with severe mental retardation, facial dysmorphologies, macroorchidism, and joint hyperextensibility, the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat amplification is located in the 5′-untranslated region and promoter regions of theFMR1 gene. The 5′-(CG)-3′ methylation is associated with the inactivation of the FMR1 promoter. In a few cases, this methylation has been absent despite a marked 5′-(CGG)n-3′ expansion, theFMR1 gene continued to be expressed, and the probands with the full expansion have failed to exhibit the FRAXA phenotype (14Oostra B.A. Acta Genet. Med. Gemellol. (Roma). 1996; 45: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent results of genomic sequencing experiments in the FMR1repeat region indicate that methylation mosaics exist in healthy and some fragile X individuals. 1B. Genç, H. Müller-Hartmann, M.

Because most of the previously isolated 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat-containing fragments are located in noncoding regions, genomic libraries were screened with a32P-labeled 5′-(CGG)17-3′ oligodeoxyribonucleotide. We report here the isolation of new genomic sequences containing 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats, mostly from the 5′-upstream segments of gene-rich regions. The cell lines KB (human oral carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma), 293 (adenovirus type 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells), HEp-2 (human epidermoid larynx carcinoma), Hep G2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), A549 (human lung carcinoma), LoVo and SW480 (human colon carcinomas), and A172 and U138 (human glioblastoma cell lines) were cultivated in Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. DNA was prepared from peripheral blood as described (16Behn-Krappa A. Hölker I. Sandaradura da Silva U. Doerfler W. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

Restriction enzyme cleavage, gel electrophoresis, 32P-labeling of hybridization probes, hybridization and autoradiography were carried out as described (19Koetsier P.A. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-262PubMed Google Scholar,20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21440) Google Scholar) and Northern transfer experiments, a downward blotting protocol was used (19Koetsier P.A. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-262PubMed Google Scholar). The filter with the human somatic cell hybrid panel was obtained from Oncor. The human RNA master blot and the human multiple tissue Northern blot were purchased fromCLONTECH. All hybridization steps were performed using the prehybridization and hybridization solutions described elsewhere (19Koetsier P.A. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-262PubMed Google Scholar). In hybridization experiments with the RNA master blot, 40 μg of Cot-1 DNA and 50 μg of herring sperm DNA were added to the labeled probe before hybridization. All DNA-RNA hybridizations were carried out at 65 °C. A 4–8 kilobase pair size-selected fraction of human genomic DNA cleaved withEcoRI was isolated by velocity sedimentation on a sucrose density gradient and ligated into the EcoRI-precleaved ZAP express or ZAP II vector (Stratagene), packaged, and screened according to the manufacturer's protocol. The filters were hybridized as described (19Koetsier P.A. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-262PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 104 colonies of a human chromosome 16-specific library (22Colins C. Kuo W.L. Segraves R. Fuscoe J. Pinkel D. Gray J.W. Genomics. 1991; 11: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were screened as follows. Oriented filters were incubated for 5 min in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) and 5% SDS and dried for 2 min in a microwave oven at full power. The hybridization was carried out overnight at 68 °C in 5 × SSC, 1% sarkosyl. The posthybridization washes were twice for 10 min in 2 × SSC, 0.5% sarkosyl followed by twice 10 min in 0.5 × SSC, 0.5% sarkosyl. The probe used in all screening experiments was a32P-end-labeled 5′-(CGG)17-3′ oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The template DNAs were from seven fragile X full-expansion patients or from healthy individuals. The primers used in the PCRs were synthesized at Life Technology, Inc. (5′ → 3′): P4 locus (P1, CGGAATTCCAGCTCGGGGTCTCTCCGCCGCCCC; P2, AAGCAGTGAACTGCGGCGGCTTCGC); E7 locus (P9, CAACCACAAACTGAAAACCGTTGG; P10, CCATGTTGCGGCTGCTCCATGTCG); (P11 CGAGCACCCAAGCTTGGGCGCCC; P12 CTCAGCACCCGGTACCCCGCGGAC); (P13 CCGCCAGGCCTCGCCACGCCGC; P14 GGTTGGGTACCAGCCCCGTCTCCATGG); (P15C GCCGGCCAGAACCAGCACCG; P16C GTTGCGCGGCCGCCCAGGCC). Amounts of 200 to 400 ng of genomic DNA were amplified in 50 μl of 1 × Pfu of polymerase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin/ml) (Stratagene), 10% Me2SO, 200 mm each dNTP, 100 to 200 ng of primers, and 2.5 to 5 units of cloned Pfu polymerase. In the P13/P14 reaction, a dGTP:7-deaza-dGTP ratio of 1:3 was used. Conditions for PCR were 1 cycle for 5 min at 96 °C, 25 cycles for 2 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C (in the P9/P10 reaction annealing was at 61 °C), and for 2 to 2.3 min at 72 °C. One-tenth of the PCR products was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The specificities of PCR products were ascertained by Southern blot hybridization using a 32P-end-labeled 5′-(CGG)8-3′ probe. A subset of PCR products from reactions P1/P2, P9/P10, and P11/P12 with DNA from three fragile X patients and from five normal individuals was used for cloning. PCR products from the primer set P1/P2 were cleaved with EcoRI and NotI and cloned in EcoRI/NotI precleaved pBluescript KS+. The PCR products from the primer set P9/P10 were cut with AciI and cloned intoAccI-precleaved pBluescript KS+. PCR products from the primer set P11/P12 were directly cloned into the PCRscript vector from Stratagene. Single clones were used to determine nucleotide sequences. Plasmid DNAs were sequenced with a Taq fluorescent dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG) package versions 9.0 and 9.1 were used for sequence analyses such as homology search and restriction mapping. Expressed sequence-tagged (EST) and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. Human peripheral blood cells from the buffy coat layer were grown for 72 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum enriched with 26 μg of phytohemagglutinin/ml of medium. The cells were then arrested in metaphase by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h with 10 μg of ethidium bromide and 50 ng of Colcemid/ml. The chromosome harvesting, hybridization, and detection procedures were as described (23Lichter P. Tang C.-J. Call K. Hermanson G. Evans G.A. Hausman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The BAC clones were labeled by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP, and the chromosome 6-specific probe 6q27 (Oncor) was digoxygenin-labeled. Undesirable cross-hybridizations with the labeled BAC probe was suppressed by adding 20 μg of human Cot1 DNA to the hybridization mixture, which was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before adding the mixture to the chromosome preparation. The chromosomal DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide or 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole when two different probes had to be detected. A subgenomic library was constructed by ligating EcoRI-cleaved genomic DNA from human white blood cells into the Zap express and Zap II λ vectors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In addition, chromosome-specific libraries (22Colins C. Kuo W.L. Segraves R. Fuscoe J. Pinkel D. Gray J.W. Genomics. 1991; 11: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were screened, and we began to isolate positive clones from the chromosome 16 library, since the DNA on this chromosome had already shown expansions in the 5′-(CGG)n-3′-containing region of the locus FRA16A at 16p13.11 in some individuals (24Nancarrow J.K.

All the clones isolated so far are schematically presented in Fig. 1. The total lengths of the nucleotide sequences and the nature and locations of the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats actually detected in each of the cloned DNA segments are also indicated. In addition to the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats, repeats with different sequences were also present in two of these DNA segments. The actual nucleotide sequences were not reproduced here. They are available via accession numbers AJ001215, AJ001216, AJ001217, AJ001218, and AJ001219 from the EMBL data base for clones P4, E7, P5-5, CL16-1, and CL16-8, respectively.

Thomas P. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The CL16-1 and the CL16-8 clones were confirmed to be derived from human chromosome 16, and the P5-5 clone was located on chromosome 10 (data not shown). The mapping results of the CL16-1 and P5-5 clones were in line with the locations of their homologous sequences (Table I). The E7 and P4 clones mapped to chromosome 6q. The E7 genomic fragment mapped to 6q25-26 (Fig. 2 a) and the P4 segment to 6q22-23 (Fig. 2 b). The clone P4 has been more precisely assigned to a chromosomal location by radiation hybrid mapping that has been performed at the Sanger Center in Cambridge, UK. The P4 clone is closely linked to the marker stSG11083, which lies between markers D6S1004 and D6S1620 on the long arm of chromosome 6 at position 510.7 cR3000 of the Sanger Center's radiation hybrid map (data not shown). The 32P-labeled subfragments of the clones were hybridized to a multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH), to a Master blot (CLONTECH), or to a Northern blot on which poly(A)-selected RNAs from different tumor cell lines were immobilized. The human DNA segment in clone P4 was transcribed in skeletal muscle into RNAs of 5.1, 3.3, 2.8, and 1.8 kb and in placenta into RNA of 2.8-kb lengths (Fig. 3 a). This apparently tissue-specific 2.8-kb RNA was also present in the human tumor cell lines A172, 293, A549, KB, HeLa, and Hep2 (Fig. 3 b). In all the tissues tested, the DNA segment in the E7 clone was transcribed into a 5-kb RNA molecule (Fig. 4, a and b). None of the tested tumor cell lines expressed this segment. The brain-specific transcripts, detected by theEcoRI-EcoRI fragment as hybridization probe were 9.6, 4.8, and 3.8 kb in lengths (Fig. 4 c). The 5-kb transcript present in all tested tissues (Fig. 4 b) was not detected with the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of E7 in Fig. 4 c. To assess the extent of this brain-specific expression, we probed a master blot carrying dot-blotted poly(A) RNAs from 50 different human tissues (Fig. 4 d). Transcripts were mainly found in different parts of the brain, with a stronger signal in cerebellum. Significant expression was also seen in some glandular tissues like the pituitary gland (D4), the thymus (E5), and to a lesser extent in the thyroid (D6) and the adrenal gland (D5), as well as in fetal brain, kidney, and thymus (Fig. 4 c). Transcription analyses were not conducted for the CL16-1 and P5-5 clones. However, the CL16-8 clone did not allow the detection of RNA molecules by hybridization to the multiple tissue Northern or the master blot. We next searched for polymorphisms within the repeats in the DNA loci E7, P4, and CL16-8 from healthy individuals. The possibility existed that in fragile X patients 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats outside the bona fide location on Xq27.3 would also become subject to expansions. Therefore, DNAs from several full expansion fragile X patients were analyzed. Southern blotting experiments did not reveal abnormal mobility of the corresponding P4 (Fig. 5, a–c), E7 (Fig. 5,d–f), or CL16-8 bands (data not shown) in normal individuals (Fig. 5, a and d) or in fragile X individuals (Fig. 5, b and e). Minor variations in the repeat-containing regions were assessed by PCR using primers indicated in the scheme of each clone (see maps in Fig. 1, aand b). Changes in sizes could not be detected in the tested DNAs. Because the trinucleotide repeats observed were cryptic and complex, we cloned some of the PCR products from P4 and regions R2 plus R3 of the E7 DNA segment in a suitable vector to sequence individual clones, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only minor polymorphisms were observed in region R2 of the E7 locus in healthy and fragile X individuals (Table II). The control PCR products from the E7 plasmid remained constant throughout the cloning procedure. It is concluded that the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats in various segments of the human genome outside the Xq27.3 locus are not expanded in fragile X patients. The P4 and E7 loci are not markedly polymorphic.Table IIThe various alleles of the E7 repeat R2 observed in normal individual (N2) and in full expansion fragile X individual (RF)R2 Consensus(CTT)4(CGG)8N2(CTT)3(CCG)8(CCT)4(CCG)7(CCT)4(CCG)8RF(CCT)4(CCG)7(CCT)4(CCG)8The relevant part of R2 is reproduced here; the sequences were analyzed after sequencing the single clones. The 10 isolated clones from the plasmid control E7 did not show any variations. Open table in a new tab The relevant part of R2 is reproduced here; the sequences were analyzed after sequencing the single clones. The 10 isolated clones from the plasmid control E7 did not show any variations. Because of the differences in expression of the E7 and P4 DNA segments between different human tissues and human tumor-derived cell lines, we decided to analyze repeats in the DNAs from these cell lines as well as from two colon carcinoma cell lines, RER(−) SW480 and RER(+) LoVo. The latter is known to exhibit (CA)nmicrosatellite instabilities. Analyses of the DNAs from these tumor cell lines by Southern blotting (Fig. 5, c and f) or by PCR experiments (data not shown) did not reveal any major rearrangements in either locus. Therefore, the observed differential expression (loss of tissue specificity) could be attributed to alterations of DNA methylation in the P4 region. However, some deletions occurring upstream and/or downstream the 6170-bp E7 fragment and/or mutations in the E7 sequence could still be responsible for the complete absence of E7 expression in tumor cell lines. In several human genomic DNA fragments we have identified 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats located 5′ to the previously identified cDNA sequences of the genes for the Ca2+-activated potassium channel and the casein kinase II α′ subunit. These repeats might play a role in the regulation or altered functions of the corresponding proteins. The human Ca2+-activated potassium channel (Kca) proteins are a large and diverse family of ion channels. All the different isoforms of the Kca are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene mapped on 10q22.3 (28Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 29McCobb D.P. Fowler N.L. Featherstone T. Lingle C.J. Saito M. Krause J.E. Salkoff L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H767-H777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the expression of the Kca is widely distributed, the highest levels of expression are found in brain, aorta, and skeletal muscle (28Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). So far, only the different cDNA sequences of the gene were reported. The genomic clone P5-5 isolated here contains the 5′ region of the different spliced mRNA molecules, and only a part of the complete 5′-(GCC)n-3′-rich region is included in the different transcripts reported. Clone CL16-1 is a genomic DNA fragment comprising the 5′ region of the casein kinase II α′ subunit (CSNK2A2). This enzyme is known to have three possible isoforms α2β2, αα′β2, and α′2β2. The α and α′ polypeptides are the catalytic subunits. The α′ cDNA can detect several mRNAs in Northern blot experiments (26Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Alterations of the repeat-rich region located 5′ to the CSNK2A2 gene might play a role in the regulation of different levels of mRNAs. In the case of spinocerebellar ataxia 6, the gene had been known for a long time before it could be assigned to a disease (32Matsuyama Z. Kawakami H. Maruyama H. Izumi Y. Komure A. Udaka F.

Genet. 1997; 15: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human DNA segments investigated here exhibit a combination of several types of repeats, CGG, CAG, CCT, GGA, and GAG. Within a 1.8-kb fragment, the DNA segment E7 clone carries most of the identified repeat sequences. So far, none of the new 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat-containing segments have been found expanded in fragile X patients, nor are these repeats highly polymorphic in the tested healthy individuals. The instability observed at the expanded FRAXA locus in fragile X patients is most likely not the result of a widespread instability in the genome but rather confined to this single locus. A similar conclusion has been reached by Goellner et al. (35Goellner G.M. Tester D. Thibodeau S. Almqvist E. Goldberg Y.P. Hayden M.R. McMurray C.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 879-890PubMed Google Scholar) on the instabilities within simple tandem repeats (STR) at 10 loci in 29 Huntington disease families that have been compared with instabilities at the same loci in 29 colon cancer patients with defects in mismatch repair enzymes. The hypothesis that secondary structures adopted by CAG, CGG, or GAA repeats in the trinucleotide repeat diseases might mediate instability is supported by the work of Gacy et al. (36Gacy A.M. Goellner G.M. Spiro C. Chen X. Gupta G. Bradbury E.M. Dyer R.B. Mikesell M.J. Yao J.Z. Johnson A.J. Richter A. Melancon S.B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 583-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This group has suggested that the improper DNA structure at the repeat region is responsible for GAA instability in Friedreich's ataxia. The tissue-specific transcription displayed by the P4 DNA segment is apparently erased in the tumor cell lines. In only one of the two glioblastoma cell lines, the 2.8-kb transcript has been identified. The location of the P4 clone, 6q22-23, and its strong muscle expression renders it a possible candidate gene for muscular dystrophy. Indeed it maps close to some other genes also expressed in muscle,e.g. lamA2 and lamA4. ThelamA2 gene is involved in merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (37Naom I.S. D'Allessandro M. Topaloglu H. Sewry C. Ferlini A. Helbling-Leclerc A. Guicheney P. Weissenbach J. Schwartz K. Bushby K. Philpot J. Dubowitz V. Muntoni F. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 99-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the 5-kb transcripts ubiquitous in many tissues were absent in all tumor cell lines tested. Could this region be involved in the process of tumorigenesis because of its location at 6q25-26? Several authors reported that the telomeric part of the long arm of chromosome 6 might contain tumor suppressor genes (15Banga S.S. Kim S.-H. Hubbard K. Dasgupta T. Jha K.K. Patsalis P.

Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5586-5589PubMed Google Scholar). The region R3 with its 5′-(CAG)n-3′ triplet repeat and region R4 of the E7 locus were transcribed. The EST1 clone, which is homologous to the E7 region detecting the brain-specific transcripts, was only 1,283 nucleotide pairs long. The sequence available in the data base from the DAN15 clone is 575 bp long. By isolating the full-length cDNA of both genes, one might be able to identify the location of the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ and other repeats. The E7 DNA fragment maps to 6q25-26, is repeat-rich, and expressed specifically in brain.
