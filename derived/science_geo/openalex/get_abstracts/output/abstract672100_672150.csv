https://openalex.org/W3156343712,"Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Manaus, Brazil, resurged in late 2020 despite previously high levels of infection. Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54 to 79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3142246475,"Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations, including P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa, and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10, and 9 changes in the spike, respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site, with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet (E484K, K417N/T, and N501Y), which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced antibody responses than B.1.351, suggesting that changes outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) impact neutralization. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 222 neutralizes all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2-binding site mutations. We explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies."

Using daily data from state health offices, Castro et al. analyzed the pattern of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country from February to October 2020. Clusters of deaths before cases became apparent indicated unmitigated spread. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month as it spread north from Sã o Paulo. In Manaus, transmission reached unprecedented levels after a momentary respite in mid-2020. Faria et al. tracked the evolution of a new, more aggressive lineage called P.1, which has 17 mutations, including three (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) in the spike protein. After a period of accelerated evolution, this variant emerged in Brazil during November 2020. Coupled with the emergence of P.1, disease spread was accelerated by stark local inequalities and political upheaval, which compromised a prompt federal response.

https://openalex.org/W3154396532,"Out of equilibrium, a lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the exception. Non-reciprocity occurs, for instance, in active matter1-6, non-equilibrium systems7-9, networks of neurons10,11, social groups with conformist and contrarian members12, directional interface growth phenomena13-15 and metamaterials16-20. Although wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been closely studied1,16-20, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the collective behaviour of many-body systems. Here we show that non-reciprocity leads to time-dependent phases in which spontaneously broken continuous symmetries are dynamically restored. We illustrate this mechanism with simple robotic demonstrations. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by spectral singularities called exceptional points21. We describe the emergence of these phases using insights from bifurcation theory22,23 and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics24,25. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three archetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization, flocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these systems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point-enforced pattern formation and hysteresis. Our work lays the foundation for a general theory of critical phenomena in systems whose dynamics is not governed by an optimization principle."
https://openalex.org/W3152848834,"Cellular versatility depends on accurate trafficking of diverse proteins to their organellar destinations. For the secretory pathway (followed by approximately 30% of all proteins), the physical nature of the vessel conducting the first portage (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] to Golgi apparatus) is unclear. We provide a dynamic 3D view of early secretory compartments in mammalian cells with isotropic resolution and precise protein localization using whole-cell, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy with cryo-structured illumination microscopy and live-cell synchronized cargo release approaches. Rather than vesicles alone, the ER spawns an elaborate, interwoven tubular network of contiguous lipid bilayers (ER exit site) for protein export. This receptacle is capable of extending microns along microtubules while still connected to the ER by a thin neck. COPII localizes to this neck region and dynamically regulates cargo entry from the ER, while COPI acts more distally, escorting the detached, accelerating tubular entity on its way to joining the Golgi apparatus through microtubule-directed movement."
https://openalex.org/W3152535485,"Antibiotics that target Gram-negative bacteria in new ways are needed to resolve the antimicrobial resistance crisis1-3. Gram-negative bacteria are protected by an additional outer membrane, rendering proteins on the cell surface attractive drug targets4,5. The natural compound darobactin targets the bacterial insertase BamA6-the central unit of the essential BAM complex, which facilitates the folding and insertion of outer membrane proteins7-13. BamA lacks a typical catalytic centre, and it is not obvious how a small molecule such as darobactin might inhibit its function. Here we resolve the mode of action of darobactin at the atomic level using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, native mass spectrometry, in vivo experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Two cyclizations pre-organize the darobactin peptide in a rigid β-strand conformation. This creates a mimic of the recognition signal of native substrates with a superior ability to bind to the lateral gate of BamA. Upon binding, darobactin replaces a lipid molecule from the lateral gate to use the membrane environment as an extended binding pocket. Because the interaction between darobactin and BamA is largely mediated by backbone contacts, it is particularly robust against potential resistance mutations. Our results identify the lateral gate as a functional hotspot in BamA and will allow the rational design of antibiotics that target this bacterial Achilles heel."
https://openalex.org/W3155078366,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a highly cytotoxic form of DNA damage and the incorrect repair of DSBs is linked to carcinogenesis1,2. The conserved error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway has a key role in determining the effects of DSB-inducing agents that are used to treat cancer as well as the generation of the diversity in antibodies and T cell receptors2,3. Here we applied single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to visualize two key DNA-protein complexes that are formed by human NHEJ factors. The Ku70/80 heterodimer (Ku), the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), DNA ligase IV (LigIV), XRCC4 and XLF form a long-range synaptic complex, in which the DNA ends are held approximately 115 Å apart. Two DNA end-bound subcomplexes comprising Ku and DNA-PKcs are linked by interactions between the DNA-PKcs subunits and a scaffold comprising LigIV, XRCC4, XLF, XRCC4 and LigIV. The relative orientation of the DNA-PKcs molecules suggests a mechanism for autophosphorylation in trans, which leads to the dissociation of DNA-PKcs and the transition into the short-range synaptic complex. Within this complex, the Ku-bound DNA ends are aligned for processing and ligation by the XLF-anchored scaffold, and a single catalytic domain of LigIV is stably associated with a nick between the two Ku molecules, which suggests that the joining of both strands of a DSB involves both LigIV molecules."

IntroductionOnce the deadliest cancer in the world, cervical cancer mortality rates have declined significantly since the discovery of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cancer pathogenesis and development of successful screening strategies (Horn et al., 2019Horn J.

Preventive care via vaccination at a young age, regular Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and additional HPV DNA testing have led to a reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. However, in low-income countries with limited access to high-quality healthcare, cervical cancer remains the leading cause of death from cancer among women (Randall and Ghebre, 2016Randall T.C. Ghebre R. Challenges in Prevention and Care Delivery for Women with Cervical Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa.Front. Oncol. 2016; 6: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Shrestha et al., 2018Shrestha A.D. Neupane D. Vedsted P. Kallestrup P. Cervical Cancer Prevalence, Incidence and Mortality in Low and Middle Income Countries: A Systematic Review.Asian Pac. J. Cancer Prev. 2018; 19: 319-324PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, prophylactic vaccination is not mandatory and only effective when administered at a young age and does not protect against all oncogenic strains of the virus. Thus, challenges for better understanding the pathogenesis of cervical cancer and finding effective treatment strategies still remain.The most common subtypes of cervical cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (SqCa) and adenocarcinoma (AdCa), which account for up to 70% and 25% of all cases, respectively (Cohen et al., 2019Cohen P.A. Jhingran A. Oaknin A. Denny L. Cervical cancer.Lancet. 2019; 393: 169-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). These tumors arise from distinct regions of the uterine cervix: the outer ectocervical canal, inner endocervical canal, and transformation zone. The ectocervix is lined with stratified squamous epithelium and is the origin of SqCa, whereas the endocervix is composed of glandular columnar cells that can give rise to AdCa-s. The majority of SqCa-s is caused by sexually acquired infection with high-risk HPVs, such as HPV16 and HPV18 (Bosch et al., 2002Bosch F.X. Lorincz A. Muñoz N. Meijer C.J. Shah K.V. The causal relation between human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 244-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar). Viral tropism toward the ectocervix is associated with the dynamic life cycle of HPVs. The virus infects the proliferating basal cells of the stratified epithelium and requires the host cell’s squamous differentiation for completion of its own life cycle (Kajitani et al., 2012Kajitani N. Satsuka A. Kawate A. Sakai H. Productive Lifecycle of Human Papillomaviruses that Depends Upon Squamous Epithelial Differentiation.Front. Microbiol. 2012; 3: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During productive infection in host cells, the virus expresses specific oncogenes (E6 and E7) that deregulate the cell cycle and, thus, promotes tumorigenesis (Androphy et al., 1987Androphy E.J.

Structure and transcription of human papillomavirus sequences in cervical carcinoma cells.Nature. 1985; 314: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar).To date, cervical cancer studies have relied on a limited number of cell lines and xenograft and transgenic mouse models (Larmour et al., 2015Larmour L.I. Jobling T.W. Gargett C.E. A Review of Current Animal Models for the Study of Cervical Dysplasia and Cervical Carcinoma.Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer. 2015; 25: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Most of the broadly used cell lines, such as HeLa or CaSki, were established decades ago and have gone through extensive passaging. Therefore, their value for preclinical testing is limited. On the other hand, organotypic raft cultures are able to support the viral life cycle but cannot be maintained beyond 2–3 weeks (Ozbun and Patterson, 2014Ozbun M.A. Patterson N.A. Using organotypic (raft) epithelial tissue cultures for the biosynthesis and isolation of infectious human papillomaviruses.Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2014; 34: 14B.3.1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Xenograft models are another approach to study the human disease. However, generation of such models for cervical cancer has been reported to be of low efficiency (Hoffmann et al., 2010Hoffmann C. Bachran C. Stanke J. Elezkurtaj S. Kaufmann A.M. Fuchs H.

Oncol. 2010; 118: 76-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Engineered mouse models that express viral oncogenes under basal cell-specific reporters have enhanced our understanding of the role of the viral oncogenes in cervical tumorigenesis (Herber et al., 1996Herber R. Liem A. Pitot H. Lambert P.F. Squamous epithelial hyperplasia and carcinoma in mice transgenic for the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncogene.J.

The human papillomavirus type 16 E6 gene alone is sufficient to induce carcinomas in transgenic animals.J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5887-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Development of novel human-based model systems is anticipated to further increase our understanding of this unique disease.In the past decade, much progress has been made in culturing adult stem cell-based organoids, organ-like structures that self-organize in 3D culture (Huch et al., 2015Huch M.

Following similar strategies, tumors from affected individuals can also be grown as 3D organoids (van de Wetering et al., 2015van de Wetering M. Francies H.E. Francis J.M. Bounova G. Iorio F.

Here we report establishment of long-term human organoid cultures from healthy ecto- and endocervical tissue as well as from the associated malignancies.ResultsDerivation of healthy cervical organoids and infection with HSV-1For organoid establishment, healthy endo- and ectocervical tissues were dissected carefully from the cervical canal of women undergoing total hysterectomy. The tissues were subjected to different enzymatic treatments using collagenase (endocervix) or dispase-trypsin (ectocervix) (see STAR Methods for more details; Figure 1A). After digestion, the cells were embedded into basement membrane extract (BME) matrix and submerged in culture medium. The medium composition of both cultures was optimized for long-term expansion. Our initial basal medium (M1) contained 5 components: Noggin, nicotinamide (NIC), p38 inhibitor (p38i), B27 supplement, and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y27632) (Figure 1B). Noggin was selected to inhibit differentiation cues from bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signals and generally facilitates expansion of stem cells (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3953) Google Scholar). Addition of NIC and p38i has been reported previously to be important for long-term organoid maintenance (Sato et al., 2011Sato T. Stange D.E. Ferrante M. Vries R.G. Van Es J.H. Van den Brink S. Van Houdt W.J. Pronk A. Van Gorp J. Siersema P.D. Clevers H.

The supplement B27 is commonly used in various organoid media to increase sphere formation efficiency. Y27632 was added to increase proliferation and prevent cell death through anoikis. In the basal medium, we observed emergence of small organoids from both lineages. However, addition of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7; M2) was required to significantly increase outgrowth of the organoids (Figures 1B and 1C). Because organoid growth and maintenance were still limited under these basic conditions, we tested additional factors used in other 3D culture systems: N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) inhibitor A83, forskolin (FSK), FGF10, and the canonical Wingless/Int (WNT) signaling pathway potentiator RSPO1 (Figure 1B). Stepwise addition of these growth factors improved organoid outgrowth efficiency, most notably in ectocervical cultures, for which the full medium (M7) yielded the highest organoid outgrowth number (Figures 1B and 1C). The outgrowth efficiency of endocervical organoids was found to be comparable for media M2–M6 but increased slightly in complete medium (M7) (Figures 1B and 1C). Although M7 medium was initially promising for endocervical cultures, we observed an increase in differentiated structures after 5–8 passages in culture (Figure S1A). To improve long-term maintenance, we tested supplementation of additional factors, such as epithelial growth factor (EGF), hormone β-estradiol (β-Est), and WNT activators (i.e., WNT surrogate and Chir99021 [CHIR]), which together rescued the lines from growth arrest (Figure S1A).Under the respective optimized medium conditions, organoids from both lineages emerge within 7 days and expand fully within 14 days (Figure 1D). The endocervical organoids formed hollow cystic structures, whereas ectocervical organoids showed a dense phenotype (Figure 1D). On average, organoids could be passaged every 10–14 days, diluting the organoids 1:4 or 1:10 in endo- and ectocervical cultures, respectively. Established organoid lines could be expanded long term (to date, endocervical lines more than 20 and ectocervical lines more than 30 passages), cryopreserved, and recovered successfully upon thawing. Following this protocol, healthy endo- and ectocervical organoids could be derived with a high success rate (82% and 93%, respectively). Normal organoid nomenclature and data for affected individuals for 6 thoroughly characterized healthy organoid lines are given in Table S1.The debate regarding the presence of universal bi-potent progenitors in the human cervix that can fuel homeostasis of both types of cervical epithelium has not been settled conclusively (Chumduri, 2018Chumduri C.G. K R. Berger H. Koster S. Brinkmann V. Klemm U. Mollenkopf H.-J. Herbst H. Mangler M. Meyer T.F.

USA. 2012; 109: 10516-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Observation of WNT dependency in endocervical organoids raised the question of whether this pathway could affect transdifferentiation between the ecto- and endocervical organoid phenotype. Our data showed that exposing ectocervical organoids to WNT over a 10-day time course inhibited expansion of these organoids (Figure S1B) but did not induce expression of endocervix-specific genes such as PAX8 and MUC5B (Figure S1D). Conversely, under WNT deprivation conditions, endocervical organoids collapsed, displaying a denser phenotype and growth inhibition (Figure S1B), but, similarly, this condition did not upregulate ectocervical-specific gene sets, such as TP63, KRT14, and KRT13 (Figure S1C). These data suggested no role of the WNT pathway in transdifferentiation between the ecto- and endocervical fate. Nevertheless, our data do not exclude that cervical transdifferentiation can still be possible under other conditions.Successful culture protocols for deriving organoids from the ecto- and endocervix can open up new doors for modeling cervical biology and diseases, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To show the potential of the established organoid cultures in modeling viral infection, we infected ecto- and endocervical organoid lines with tdTomato-tagged genital herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which resulted in the emergence of a clear fluorescent signal in both lineages already 24 h after exposure, indicating successful infection (Figure 1E). Using the tdTomato-tagged virus, the viral infection could be followed visually over time by live-cell imaging in both organoid systems (Videos S1 and S2). Because this type of virus is characterized by a lytic reproduction cycle, collapse and death of the infected organoids became evident visually during the time course of exposure (Videos S1 and S2). Additionally, a substantial increase in viral DNA content was observed throughout the week after infection, confirming that the virus is able to replicate readily in both organoid types (Figure 1F).eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4MmExODU1MzhmY2ZjMGY2YWEzNGI4ZWZiMWUzYTJiNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjcwNjU2MTYxfQ.Uv-W7-ITHOE4twtf1liCrno-C1TGK1UgRkhOEkplzsLsL_Jxtr7ix-Tw4_8EJHskuThWUgoBdsnBzPjCQjOECePAakgErW4CDzcC-yF_2RN6YX2fzO79dSIRYxxdN4gpsUvTvhIDO4TQCrK1VZdddV_3nAU_8D-LEk2pyqp-1Pu680nCMC_RBhw35vxplvfEoxs-SqdrvwLfknewGlp_BBzrqFUgbIZ3SHFa5Gv3tOs-Nob6a-72psgG3gqOXaVwHK5n26yqYf6aeDV4vFXBM57BGaxGoBK1qSK4cgM1XhCo3U08Bd9fzc6kXs93Z7daS7CYYqMpDQo5WmDBzwf35g Download .mp4 (3.75 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

Time-lapse imaging of HSV-1 infection in endocervical organoids, related to Figure 1Endo- and ectocervical organoids are miniature replicas of the originating tissuesEndo- and ectocervical epithelia display distinct morphological and transcriptional profiles. The endocervix is a glandular monolayered epithelium with pronounced secretory properties to carry out its main function: supplying mucus to lubricate the cervical canal. In contrast, stratified ectocervical architecture is maintained by basal cells that undergo proliferation and differentiation to form the dynamic multilayered squamous epithelium, which is predominantly protective in function. To better characterize the established culture systems, gene expression profiles and histological properties of both organoid lineages were analyzed and compared with their respective tissues of origin (Figures 2A–2D).Figure 2Marker characterization in endo- and ectocervical organoidsShow full caption(A) PCA plot of RNA-seq data of normal ecto- and endocervical tissues as well as organoids in early (earlier than P5) and late (later than P10) passages (n = 3 each).(B) Heatmap of RNA-seq data, depicting expression of the 40 most significantly differentially expressed genes between normal endo- and ectocervical tissues as well as organoids.

Furthermore, both organoid lineages showed stable transcriptomes over long-term passaging (Figure 2A). Differential gene expression analysis of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data separated the samples into two lineage-specific subgroups (Figure 2B). In concordance with the secretory function of endocervix, the respective tissue as well as the organoids expressed a variety of different mucins, such as MUC5AC and MUC5B (Figure 2B). In contrast, the ectocervical counterpart displayed a distinctive keratinization-associated gene signature, showing expression of a plethora of different keratins, including the basal cell marker KRT14 and the differentiated cell marker KRT13 but also the terminal differentiation marker IVL, among the most differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B). The latter implies similar stratification programs between the ectocervical tissue and organoids. Furthermore, the gene signatures were maintained between early- and late-passaged organoids, implying that the transcriptional programs of organoids remained stable during long-term passaging (Figure 2B).This expression profile was validated by immunohistochemistry analysis (Figures 2C and 2D; Figure S2A). Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed a polarized monolayered architecture of endocervical organoids (Figure 2C), whereas a stratified multilayered phenotype was observed in ectocervical organoids (Figure 2D), both reminiscent of the respective native tissues. Under homeostatic conditions, the endocervix exhibits little capacity to proliferate, whereas the ectocervix constantly self-renews, with the latter supported by frequent division of basal cells located at the basement membrane (Figure S2A). The longevity of our organoid cultures is driven by continuous stem cell proliferation and self-renewal, which was confirmed by staining for the common proliferation marker MKI67 (Figure S2A). However, the organoids maintained an equilibrium between proliferation and maturation because mature marker expression was detected readily in both established organoid cultures.The endocervical tissue as well as the organoids expressed the well-established secretory cell transcription marker PAX8, confirming their identity. Secretory products of the glandular cells were also visible in the cultures, as revealed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive stain, confirming the functionality of the organoids (Figure 2C). Similarly, ectocervical organoids maintained a tissue-like differentiation pattern with proliferative KRT14-positive basal-like cells at the periphery of the organoids which, upon differentiation, move inward, changing in shape and size, to give rise to more differentiated KRT13-positive layers in the organoids (Figure 2D).Further analysis of the distinct transcriptomics profile of the ectocervical organoids mainly returned keratinization-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure S2B), whereas endocervical organoids showed enrichment in GO terms associated with cell motility and cilia (Figure S2C). In addition to secretory cells, the endocervical lining is known to also harbor ciliated cells that mediate even distribution of mucus and guidance of sperm movement along the cervical canal. The presence of ciliated cells in our endocervical organoids was further supported by high expression of ciliogenesis-related genes, including the primary ciliary transcription factor FOXJ1 (Figure S2D), and was validated by staining for acetylated α-tubulin, which marks primary cilia (Figure S2E).Although analysis of gene expression profiles between the organoid lines and the respective tissue samples suggested strong overlap, some degree of divergence still existed (Figure 2A). The major collective differences between healthy organoids and tissue samples could be credited to the considerably higher “replication” and “extracellular process activity” in the highly prolife"

We report here that TBI induces tau acetylation (ac-tau) at sites acetylated also in human AD brain. This is mediated by S-nitrosylated-GAPDH, which simultaneously inactivates Sirtuin1 deacetylase and activates p300/CBP acetyltransferase, increasing neuronal ac-tau. Subsequent tau mislocalization causes neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral impairment, and ac-tau accumulates in the blood.

Ac-tau is thus a therapeutic target and potential blood biomarker of TBI that may represent pathologic convergence between TBI and AD.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is typically caused by motor vehicle crashes, falls, contact sports, or assaults. The annual incidence of TBI in the United States alone is ∼3.5 million, with ∼5 million people currently living with TBI-related disabilities at an annual cost of ∼$80 billion (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015Centers for Disease Control and PreventionReport to Congress on Traumatic Brain Injury in the United States: Epidemiology and Rehabilitation.

At present, treatments for TBI focus on patient stabilization and mitigation of symptoms, and there are no medicines that specifically target the pathophysiological processes that drive neurodegeneration after brain injury. TBI also significantly increases the risk of later developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Johnson et al., 2010Johnson V.E. Stewart W. Smith D.H.

This suggests common pathologic mechanisms, and emerging evidence points to S-nitrosylation and acetylation (Uehara et al., 2006Uehara T. Nakamura T. Yao D. Shi Z.-Q. Gu Z. Ma Y. Masliah E. Nomura Y.

Nitrosylation of GAPDH augments pathological tau acetylation upon exposure to amyloid-β.Sci. Signal. 2018; 11: eaao6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, a small post-mortem study recently reported increased acetylation of tau at lysine (K) 280 in the brains of three patients with AD and three patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (Lucke-Wold et al., 2017Lucke-Wold B. Seidel K. Udo R. Omalu B. Ornstein M. Nolan R. Rosen C. Ross J. Role of tau acetylation in Alzheimer’s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy: the way forward for successful treatment.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. 2017; 4: 140PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate study, the same rise in ac-tau at K280 was documented in the brains of ten additional patients with AD, five patients with corticobasal degeneration, and five patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (Irwin et al., 2012Irwin D.J. Cohen T.J. Grossman M. Arnold S.E. Xie S.X. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Acetylated tau, a novel pathological signature in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies.Brain. 2012; 135: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Tau acetylation at both K274 and K281 was additionally reported in upwards of a dozen patients with severe AD (Tracy et al., 2016Tracy T.E. Sohn P.D. Minami S.S. Wang C. Min S.-W. Li Y. Zhou Y. Le D.

However, these studies did not establish the driving forces or pathologic significance of the findings. Given the interrelationship between TBI and AD, we sought to determine whether elevated ac-tau was a causal pathophysiologic factor in TBI, and thus a potential locus of convergence, and if so, then whether this might provide an experimental platform to understand in vivo pathophysiology related to ac-tau in the brain. To begin, we employed a mouse model of multimodal TBI incorporating global concussive impact, acceleration/deceleration, and early-phase blast wave exposure (Shin et al., 2021Shin M.-K. Vázquez-Rosa E. Cintrón-Pérez C. Riegel A. Harper M.M. Ritzel D. Pieper A.A. Characterization of the jet-flow overpressure model of traumatic brain injury in mice.Neurotrauma Rep. 2021; 2: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model produces a complex brain injury with neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral impairment, beginning with acute axonal degeneration that persists chronically and eventually leads to blood-brain barrier degradation and nerve cell death (Yin et al., 2014Yin T.C.

Already an established preclinical model of TBI, its clinical relevance is further strengthened here through nonbiased whole metabolomic analysis. Specifically, 1 week after injury, mice displayed altered plasma levels of fatty acids, amino acids, 5-oxoproline, and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (Figure S1A), resembling published data from nonbiased plasma metabolomic analysis of human TBI (Orešič et al., 2016Orešič M.

Using antibodies to mouse acetylated-tau (ac-tau) at K263 and K270 (Min et al., 2010Min S.-W. Cho S.-H. Zhou Y. Schroeder S. Haroutunian V. Seeley W.W. Huang E.J. Shen Y. Masliah E. Mukherjee C. et al.Acetylation of tau inhibits its degradation and contributes to tauopathy.Neuron. 2010; 67: 953-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar; Figure S1B), which correspond respectively to human tau K274 and K281, we observed rapid and specific elevation of ac-tau in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the brain after injury (Figure 1A). Importantly, the increased ac-tau was observed selectively in neurons of the brain (Figure 1B) and correlated with injury intensity (Figure 1C), while total tau levels remained unchanged (Figures 1A–1C). Our observation of the low-level presence of tau in non-neuronal cell types is consistent with previous reports (http://www.brainrnaseq.org; Perea et al., 2019Perea J.R. López E. Díez-Ballesteros J.C. Ávila J. Hernández F. Bolós M. Extracellular monomeric tau is internalized by astrocytes.Front.

Absence of CX3CR1 impairs the internalization of Tau by microglia.Mol. Neurodegener. 2017; 12: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and no change in non-neuronal tau was noted as a function of injury. The injury-dependent increase in neuronal ac-tau was observed in both males and females (Figure S1C) and also generalized to multiple forms and stages of TBI. For example, we determined that this is not only an acute, but also a chronic response to injury, as ac-tau remained elevated 17 months after injury in mice (Figure S1D). Ac-tau was also elevated 7 months after acoustic blast overpressure TBI in rats (Figure S1E), and at a range of times after controlled cortical impact TBI in mice (Figure S1F). In addition, ac-tau was acutely elevated in cerebellum after multimodal TBI (Figure S1G), but not in hypothalamus (Figure S1H), consistent with the previous observation of hypothalamic resistance to neurodegeneration in this model (Yin et al., 2014Yin T.C. Britt J.K. De Jesús-Cortés H. Lu Y. Genova R.M. Khan M.Z. Voorhees J.R. Shao J. Katzman A.C. Huntington P.J. et al.P7C3 neuroprotective chemicals block axonal degeneration and preserve function after traumatic brain injury.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By contrast, tau phosphorylation after brain injury was unchanged at S202 (Figures S2A and S2B), which is part of the basis for AD Braak staging (Neddens et al., 2018Neddens J. Temmel M. Flunkert S. Kerschbaumer B. Hoeller C. Loeffler T. Niederkofler V. Daum G. Attems J. Hutter-Paier B. Phosphorylation of different tau sites during progression of Alzheimer’s disease.Acta Neuropathol. Commun. 2018; 6: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and reduced at S396 and S404, sites that mediate tau’s ability to polymerize tubulin (Evans et al., 2000Evans D.B. Rank K.B. Bhattacharya K. Thomsen D.R. Gurney M.E. Sharma S.K. Tau phosphorylation at serine 396 and serine 404 by human recombinant tau protein kinase II inhibits tau’s ability to promote microtubule assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24977-24983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; Figures S2A and S2B). Tau phosphorylation was also somewhat reduced at S262 (Figures S2A and S2B). Although phosphorylation of S262 has been linked to tau acetylation in other contexts (Cook et al., 2014Cook C. Carlomagno Y. Gendron T.F. Dunmore J. Scheffel K. Stetler C. Davis M. Dickson D. Jarpe M. DeTure M. Petrucelli L. Acetylation of the KXGS motifs in tau is a critical determinant in modulation of tau aggregation and clearance.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), inhibiting tau acetylation after brain injury had no effect on S262 phosphorylation (Figure S2C). Taken together, the data suggest a prominent role for tau acetylation and a lesser role for tau phosphorylation in the acute period following brain injury. Notably, the post-injury increase in ac-tau was also not associated with tau seeding (Figures S2D and S2E), nor with reduced expression of postsynaptic kidney/brain (KIBBRA) protein (Figures S2F–S2I), a previously suggested consequence of tau acetylation (Tracy et al., 2016Tracy T.E. Sohn P.D. Minami S.S. Wang C. Min S.-W. Li Y. Zhou Y. Le D. Lo I. Ponnusamy R. et al.Acetylated tau obstructs KIBRA-mediated signaling in synaptic plasticity and promotes tauopathy-related memory loss.Neuron. 2016; 90: 245-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Clues to the possible function of ac-tau in brain injury were uncovered from published post-mortem studies of AD patients’ brains, in which the magnitude of K274 and K281 acetylation correlated inversely with amounts of ankyrin-G (AnkG) and βIV-spectrin (Sohn et al., 2016Sohn P.D. Tracy T.E. Son H.-I. Zhou Y. Leite R.E.P. Miller B.L. Seeley W.W. Grinberg L.T. Gan L. Acetylated tau destabilizes the cytoskeleton in the axon initial segment and is mislocalized to the somatodendritic compartment.Mol. Neurodegener. 2016; 11: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), principle components of the axon initial segment (AIS). The AIS normally maintains neuronal health and limits tau distribution predominantly to axons (Schafer et al., 2009Schafer D.P. Jha S. Liu F. Akella T. McCullough L.D. Rasband M.N. Disruption of the axon initial segment cytoskeleton is a new mechanism for neuronal injury.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13242-13254Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After injury, we observed a rapid reduction in the levels of AnkG and βIV-spectrin (Figure 1D) that correlated with amounts and time course of increased tau acetylation (Figure 1A). AIS degradation also led to pathologic tau mislocalization into the somatodendritic compartment of neurons throughout the brain (Figure 1E). To determine whether ac-tau was directly toxic to neurons, both in vitro and in vivo genetic tests were conducted. To begin, transfection of cultured human neuroblasts with either human tau acetylation mimetic or acetylation-resistant human tau showed that tau acetylation specifically increased neuronal cell death in an in vitro model of TBI, as measured by both cleaved caspase 3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay (Figure 1F). For in vivo investigation, a mouse correlate of this model, known as tauKQhigh mice, was used. These transgenic mice express human tau with lysine-to-glutamine mutations that mimic acetylation at K274 and K281, which correspond to mouse K263 and K270, respectively. TauKQhigh mice have been previously shown to exhibit memory deficits and impaired long-term potentiation (Tracy et al., 2016Tracy T.E. Sohn P.D. Minami S.S. Wang C. Min S.-W. Li Y. Zhou Y. Le D. Lo I. Ponnusamy R. et al.Acetylated tau obstructs KIBRA-mediated signaling in synaptic plasticity and promotes tauopathy-related memory loss.Neuron. 2016; 90: 245-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, ∼1-year-old tauKQhigh mice displayed a significant degree of axonal degeneration, which was not observed in either nontransgenic wild-type littermates or human wild-type tau transgenic mice (Figures 1G, S2J, and S2K). The interesting observation that the hypothalamus of tauKQhigh mice showed prominently increased axonal neurodegeneration contrasts with previously noted protection of this region in TBI (Yin et al., 2014Yin T.C. Britt J.K. De Jesús-Cortés H. Lu Y. Genova R.M. Khan M.Z. Voorhees J.R. Shao J. Katzman A.C. Huntington P.J. et al.P7C3 neuroprotective chemicals block axonal degeneration and preserve function after traumatic brain injury.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that the hypothalamus in mice may be physically protected from injury relative to other regions of the brain, rather than composed of a subpopulation of neurons endowed with unique protective properties. Synaptic integrity in these animals was also assessed, through immunohistochemical staining for synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2). As shown in Figure S2L, tauKQhigh mice displayed reduced SV2 in the hippocampus relative to nontransgenic wild-type littermates. Taken together, these results indicate that human ac-tau is directly toxic to neurons, both in vitro and in vivo in the brain. In cellular models of AD, protein acetylation has been linked to S-nitrosylation of GAPDH, which coordinately enhances p300/CBP acetyltransferase activity and inhibits Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) deacetylase activity to increase overall amounts of acetylation. Inhibitory S-nitrosylation of Sirt1 is mediated by aberrant transnitrosylase activity of GAPDH, whereas S-nitrosylated-GAPDH (SNO-GAPDH) also stimulates activation and acetylation of p300/CBP acetyltransferase (Hara and Snyder, 2006Hara M.R.

After TBI, we found that both GAPDH and Sirt1 were S-nitrosylated (Figure 2A). Increased protein acetylation was further confirmed by measuring acetylation of histone H2AK5, a p300/CBP and Sirt1 substrate (Figures S3A and S3B). Initiation of daily treatment 15 min after injury with CGP3466B (0.014 mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP]), a specific inhibitor of GAPDH nitrosylation also known as omigapil (Waldmeier et al., 2000Waldmeier P.C.

Furthermore, protein or activity levels of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which can deacetylate tau (Cohen et al., 2011Cohen T.J. Guo J.L. Hurtado D.E. Kwong L.K. Mills I.P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

Because salsalate has anti-inflammatory properties, a low dose that inhibited p300/CBP (Figures S5A–S5D) without blocking elevated levels of neuroinflammatory cytokines after injury (Figures S5E and S5F) was identified. Daily administration of this low non-anti-inflammatory dose of salsalate, beginning 24 h after TBI, reduced amounts of ac-tau in the brain without changing the total amount of tau protein (Figure 3A) or GAPDH S-nitrosylation (Figure S5G). This same low-dose salsalate treatment also preserved the AIS after injury, as evidenced by unchanged levels of AnkG and βIV-spectrin (Figure 3B). Encouragingly, compared with sham-injured animals, low-dose salsalate preserved normal axonal localization of tau (Figures 3C and S5H) and protected mice from axonal degeneration (Figure 3D).Figure 3Low-dose salsalate-mediated inhibition of p300/CBP acetyltransferase protects mice from post-TBI-induced elevated ac-tau, AIS degradation, tau mislocalization, neurodegeneration, and cognitive deficitsShow full caption(A) Low-dose salsalate dose-dependently reduces post-TBI elevations in ac-tau in the brain (n = 3, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus TBI+vehicle group, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey’s post hoc analysis).(B) Low-dose salsalate protects mice from post-TBI AIS degradation (scale bar, 5 μm).(C) Low-dose salsalate protects mice from post-TBI tau mislocalization (scale bar, 5 μm).(D) Low-dose salsalate protects mice from post-TBI axonal degeneration (scale bar, 5 μm).In (B)–(D), each group n = 3, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 versus TBI+vehicle group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc analysis.(E) Low-dose salsalate protects mice from post-TBI impairments in motor (foot slip assay) and cognitive (learning and memory in the Barnes maze) behavioral assays.

https://openalex.org/W3153066328,"Fundamental features of 3D genome organization are established de novo in the early embryo, including clustering of pericentromeric regions, the folding of chromosome arms and the segregation of chromosomes into active (A-) and inactive (B-) compartments. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive de novo organization remain unknown1,2. Here, by combining chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), 3D DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D DNA FISH) and polymer simulations, we show that heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) is essential for de novo 3D genome organization during Drosophila early development. The binding of HP1a at pericentromeric heterochromatin is required to establish clustering of pericentromeric regions. Moreover, HP1a binding within chromosome arms is responsible for overall chromosome folding and has an important role in the formation of B-compartment regions. However, depletion of HP1a does not affect the A-compartment, which suggests that a different molecular mechanism segregates active chromosome regions. Our work identifies HP1a as an epigenetic regulator that is involved in establishing the global structure of the genome in the early embryo."
https://openalex.org/W3153185694,"Mammalian development, adult tissue homeostasis and the avoidance of severe diseases including cancer require a properly orchestrated cell cycle, as well as error-free genome maintenance. The key cell-fate decision to replicate the genome is controlled by two major signalling pathways that act in parallel-the MYC pathway and the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-retinoblastoma protein (RB) pathway1,2. Both MYC and the cyclin D-CDK-RB axis are commonly deregulated in cancer, and this is associated with increased genomic instability. The autophagic tumour-suppressor protein AMBRA1 has been linked to the control of cell proliferation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that AMBRA1 is an upstream master regulator of the transition from G1 to S phase and thereby prevents replication stress. Using a combination of cell and molecular approaches and in vivo models, we reveal that AMBRA1 regulates the abundance of D-type cyclins by mediating their degradation. Furthermore, by controlling the transition from G1 to S phase, AMBRA1 helps to maintain genomic integrity during DNA replication, which counteracts developmental abnormalities and tumour growth. Finally, we identify the CHK1 kinase as a potential therapeutic target in AMBRA1-deficient tumours. These results advance our understanding of the control of replication-phase entry and genomic integrity, and identify the AMBRA1-cyclin D pathway as a crucial cell-cycle-regulatory mechanism that is deeply interconnected with genomic stability in embryonic development and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W3155134627,"The fundamental topology of cellular structures-the location, number and connectivity of nodes and compartments-can profoundly affect their acoustic1-4, electrical5, chemical6,7, mechanical8-10 and optical11 properties, as well as heat1,12, fluid13,14 and particle transport15. Approaches that harness swelling16-18, electromagnetic actuation19,20 and mechanical instabilities21-23 in cellular materials have enabled a variety of interesting wall deformations and compartment shape alterations, but the resulting structures generally preserve the defining connectivity features of the initial topology. Achieving topological transformation presents a distinct challenge for existing strategies: it requires complex reorganization, repacking, and coordinated bending, stretching and folding, particularly around each node, where elastic resistance is highest owing to connectivity. Here we introduce a two-tiered dynamic strategy that achieves systematic reversible transformations of the fundamental topology of cellular microstructures, which can be applied to a wide range of materials and geometries. Our approach requires only exposing the structure to a selected liquid that is able to first infiltrate and plasticize the material at the molecular scale, and then, upon evaporation, form a network of localized capillary forces at the architectural scale that 'zip' the edges of the softened lattice into a new topological structure, which subsequently restiffens and remains kinetically trapped. Reversibility is induced by applying a mixture of liquids that act separately at the molecular and architectural scales (thus offering modular temporal control over the softening-evaporation-stiffening sequence) to restore the original topology or provide access to intermediate modes. Guided by a generalized theoretical model that connects cellular geometries, material stiffness and capillary forces, we demonstrate programmed reversible topological transformations of various lattice geometries and responsive materials that undergo fast global or localized deformations. We then harness dynamic topologies to develop active surfaces with information encryption, selective particle trapping and bubble release, as well as tunable mechanical, chemical and acoustic properties."
https://openalex.org/W3155333011,"The initiation of cell division integrates a large number of intra- and extracellular inputs. D-type cyclins (hereafter, cyclin D) couple these inputs to the initiation of DNA replication1. Increased levels of cyclin D promote cell division by activating cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (hereafter, CDK4/6), which in turn phosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor. Accordingly, increased levels and activity of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes are strongly linked to unchecked cell proliferation and cancer2,3. However, the mechanisms that regulate levels of cyclin D are incompletely understood4,5. Here we show that autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1) is the main regulator of the degradation of cyclin D. We identified AMBRA1 in a genome-wide screen to investigate the genetic basis of the response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Loss of AMBRA1 results in high levels of cyclin D in cells and in mice, which promotes proliferation and decreases sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. Mechanistically, AMBRA1 mediates ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D as a substrate receptor for the cullin 4 E3 ligase complex. Loss of AMBRA1 enhances the growth of lung adenocarcinoma in a mouse model, and low levels of AMBRA1 correlate with worse survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Thus, AMBRA1 regulates cellular levels of cyclin D, and contributes to cancer development and the response of cancer cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3156007823,"D-type cyclins are central regulators of the cell division cycle and are among the most frequently deregulated therapeutic targets in human cancer1, but the mechanisms that regulate their turnover are still being debated2,3. Here, by combining biochemical and genetics studies in somatic cells, we identify CRL4AMBRA1 (also known as CRL4DCAF3) as the ubiquitin ligase that targets all three D-type cyclins for degradation. During development, loss of Ambra1 induces the accumulation of D-type cyclins and retinoblastoma (RB) hyperphosphorylation and hyperproliferation, and results in defects of the nervous system that are reduced by treating pregnant mice with the FDA-approved CDK4 and CDK6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor abemaciclib. Moreover, AMBRA1 acts as a tumour suppressor in mouse models and low AMBRA1 mRNA levels are predictive of poor survival in cancer patients. Cancer hotspot mutations in D-type cyclins abrogate their binding to AMBRA1 and induce their stabilization. Finally, a whole-genome, CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified AMBRA1 as a regulator of the response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Loss of AMBRA1 reduces sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors by promoting the formation of complexes of D-type cyclins with CDK2. Collectively, our results reveal the molecular mechanism that controls the stability of D-type cyclins during cell-cycle progression, in development and in human cancer, and implicate AMBRA1 as a critical regulator of the RB pathway."

For example, studies of dynamical properties of magnetic vortices and skyrmions3,4 have not only deepened our understanding of many-body physics but also offered potential applications in data processing and storage7. Topological structures constructed from electrical polarization, rather than electron spin, have recently been realized in ferroelectric superlattices5,6, and these are promising for ultrafast electric-field control of topological orders. However, little is known about the dynamics underlying the functionality of such complex extended nanostructures. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond X-ray diffraction measurements, we observe ultrafast collective polarization dynamics that are unique to polar vortices, with orders-of-magnitude higher frequencies and smaller lateral size than those of experimentally realized magnetic vortices3. A previously unseen tunable mode, hereafter referred to as a vortexon, emerges in the form of transient arrays of nanoscale circular patterns of atomic displacements, which reverse their vorticity on picosecond timescales. Its frequency is considerably reduced (softened) at a critical strain, indicating a condensation (freezing) of structural dynamics. We use first-principles-based atomistic calculations and phase-field modelling to reveal the microscopic atomic arrangements and corroborate the frequencies of the vortex modes. The discovery of subterahertz collective dynamics in polar vortices opens opportunities for electric-field-driven data processing in topological structures with ultrahigh speed and density. A dynamical study shows that vortices of electrical polarization have higher frequencies and smaller size than their magnetic counterparts, properties that are promising for electric-field-driven data processing."

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an important transcription factor associated with the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Though a promising potential therapeutic target, there are no specific drug candidates for STAT3. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles generated by all cell types with a capacity to efficiently enter cells across different biological barriers. Here, we utilize exosomes as delivery conduit to specifically target STAT3 in liver fibrosis. Exosomes derived from clinical grade fibroblast-like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were engineered to carry siRNA or antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting STAT3 (iExosiRNA-STAT3 or iExomASO-STAT3 ). Compared to scrambled siRNA control, siRNA-STAT3, or ASO-STAT3, iExosiRNA-STAT3 or iExomASO-STAT3 showed enhanced STAT3 targeting efficiency. iExosiRNA-STAT3 or iExomASO-STAT3 treatments suppressed STAT3 levels and ECM deposition in established liver fibrosis in mice, and significantly improved liver function. iExomASO-Stat3 restored liver function more efficiently when compared to iExosiRNA-STAT3 .

In correlated quantum materials, it was predicted3 and then confirmed experimentally4,5 that a critical point terminates the line of Mott metal–insulator transitions, which are also first-order with a discontinuous charge carrier density. In quantum spin systems, continuous quantum phase transitions6 have been controlled by pressure7,8, applied magnetic field9,10 and disorder11, but discontinuous quantum phase transitions have received less attention. The geometrically frustrated quantum antiferromagnet SrCu2(BO3)2 constitutes a near-exact realization of the paradigmatic Shastry–Sutherland model12–14 and displays exotic phenomena including magnetization plateaus15, low-lying bound-state excitations16, anomalous thermodynamics17 and discontinuous quantum phase transitions18,19. Here we control both the pressure and the magnetic field applied to SrCu2(BO3)2 to provide evidence of critical-point physics in a pure spin system. We use high-precision specific-heat measurements to demonstrate that, as in water, the pressure–temperature phase diagram has a first-order transition line that separates phases with different local magnetic energy densities, and that terminates at an Ising critical point. We provide a quantitative explanation of our data using recently developed finite-temperature tensor-network methods17,20–22. These results further our understanding of first-order quantum phase transitions in quantum magnetism, with potential applications in materials where anisotropic spin interactions produce the topological properties23,24 that are useful for spintronic applications. The pressure dependence and magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of a quantum magnet, SrCu2(BO3)2, demonstrate that its phase diagram contains a line of first-order transitions terminating at a critical point, in analogy with water."

Some deubiquitinases (DUB), in particular those from the ovarian tumor (OTU) family, and E3 ubiquitin ligases such as members of the homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) family have shown specificity for particular ubiquitin chains. This, combined with the difference in the three-dimensional structure of these ubiquitin polymers, further suggests that they represent distinct signals (13Komander D.

Nevertheless, the role and function of polyubiquitin chains beyond those assembled through homotypic (i.e., assembled through one lysine only) such as K48 and K63 linkages are only starting to emerge (19Kulathu Y.

More recently, polyubiquitin has been found to exist as heterotypic and also branched chains. For example, branched K11/K48-linked chains increase the degradation rate of mitotic cyclins by the UPS, while branched K48/K63 chains regulate NF-kB gene activation through recognition by TAB2, a subunit of the TAK1 complex (22Meyer H.-J.

TRABID (also known as ZRANB1) belongs to OTU DUB family (24Evans P.C. Smith T.S. Lai M.J. Williams M.G. Burke D.F. Heyninck K. Kreike M.M. Beyaert R. Blundell T.L. Kilshaw P.J.

Molecular discrimination of structurally equivalent Lys 63-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The expansion of the ubiquitin toolbox through, for example, the chemical synthesis of ubiquitin dimers, has been instrumental in determining TRABID’s specificity for K29-linked ubiquitin chains (27Virdee S. Ye Y. Nguyen D.P. Komander D. Chin J.W. Engineered diubiquitin synthesis reveals Lys29-isopeptide specificity of an OTU deubiquitinase.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Further analysis using the full set of eight ubiquitin dimers revealed that in addition to K29-linked ubiquitin dimers, TRABID also cleaves K33-linked ubiquitin chains and that the activity toward K29 and K33-linked dimers is greater than for K63-linked diubiquitin (28Licchesi J.D.F.

The discovery of the AnkUBD as a novel UBD abutting the N-terminus of TRABID OTU domain revealed that it is required for full DUB activity and to some extent specificity too. These findings as well as recent studies, which identified TRABID’s NZF 1 as the minimal UBD required for the recognition of K29- and K33-linked diubiquitin, establish TRABID as a unique DUB highly tuned for the recognition and processing of these atypical ubiquitin chains (29Kristariyanto Y.A.

TRABID has been proposed to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway through APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli), the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through Twist, as well as the innate immune response, with these studies implicating the deubiquitination of K63-linked chains as potential mechanism (32Tran H.

More recently, TRABID was shown to process K29 and K33-linked chains on UVRAG, a Beclin 1 complex component, thereby inhibiting autophagy and increasing hepatocellular cellular carcinoma growth (36Feng X.

Ubiquitination of UVRAG by SMURF1 promotes autophagosome maturation and inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma growth.Autophagy. 2019; 15: 1130-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding came through phenotypic studies of Trabid KO mice, which revealed that in dendrocytes, Trabid loss of function led to proteasomal degradation of the histone demethylase Jmjd2 (37Jin J. Xie X. Xiao Y. Hu H. Zou Q. Cheng X. Sun S.-C. Epigenetic regulation of the expression of Il12 and Il23 and autoimmune inflammation by the deubiquitinase Trabid.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This in turn decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 12 and 23 and dampened inflammatory T-cell responses. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 also appears to be a target of TRABID DUB activity, and TRABID depletion has been shown to decrease EZH2 levels (38Zhang P. Xiao Z. Wang S. Zhang M. Wei Y. Hang Q. Kim J. Yao F. Rodriguez-Aguayo C. Ton B.N. Lee M. Wang Y. Zhou Z. Zeng L.

These studies highlight a role for TRABID in transcriptional regulation as well as novel cross talk between protein ubiquitination and epigenetics mechanisms although the types and composition of ubiquitin chains involved remain to be determined. Proteomics studies have been useful in identifying TRABID candidate interactors including components of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and inase (STRIPAK) complex and the E3 ubiquitin ligases HECTD1 and HERC2 (33Tran H. Bustos D. Yeh R. Rubinfeld B. Lam C. Shriver S. Zilberleyb I. Lee M.W. Phu L. Sarkar A.A. Zohn I.E. Wertz I.E. Kirkpatrick D.S. Polakis P.

Defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape.Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Yet whether these proteins represent substrates of TRABID DUB activity rather than interactors has remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to further expand on our understanding of TRABID as well as the atypical ubiquitin chains that it regulates. We first used two catalytic dead TRABID constructs, a single point mutation in the catalytic OTU domain (TRABIDC443S) and a construct lacking the OTU domain entirely (TRABID ΔOTU), to specifically trap ubiquitinated substrates. By comparing the interactome of these two constructs, we identified NZF- and OTU-specific TRABID interactors, including several E3 ubiquitin ligases as candidate interactors and potential substrates of TRABID DUB activity. We validated HECTD1 as a substrate of TRABID activity and used in vitro autoubiquitination assays, ubiquitin chain restriction analysis (UbiCREST) and ubiquitin-absolute QUAntification (Ub-AQUA) to show that the catalytic HECT domain of HECTD1 preferentially assembles K29- and K48-linked ubiquitin chains. Interestingly, our data indicate that although UBE3C and HECTD1 both use K29 and K48 linkages to assemble ubiquitin chains, the topology of the chains is different. Indeed, we found that to achieve its full activity, HECTD1 assembles ubiquitin chains, which contain branched K29/K48 linkages. Finally, we explored the functional relationship between TRABID and HECTD1 using transient siRNA knockdown as well as CRISPR/Cas9 TRABID KO in mammalians cells and mice. Loss-of-function and rescue assays showed that TRABID stabilizes HECTD1 protein levels, further establishing this novel and functional DUB-E3 pair as key regulators of K29-linked polyubiquitination. TRABID is highly tuned for recognizing and processing K29 and K33 ubiquitin linkages. Yet, most cellular mechanisms reported to date have implicated a K63-specific DUB activity. To explore this further, we analyzed the interactome of two catalytic dead TRABID constructs following transient expression in HEK293ET cells (Fig. 1, A–C). Both TRABIDC443S and TRABID ΔOTU are catalytically inactive but can still efficiently trap ubiquitin through the ubiquitin binding property of the NZF domains (32Tran H. Hamada F. Schwarz-Romond T. Bienz M.

Chem. 2013; 288: 3753-3767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To validate this, we used immunoprecipitation assays and a cellular puncta formation assay, which we previously used as a readout to visualize polyubiquitin trapped by catalytic dead TRABID in cells (Fig. S1, A–C) (28Licchesi J.D.F. Mieszczanek J. Mevissen T.E.T. Rutherford T.J. Akutsu M. Virdee S. El Oualid F. Chin J.W. Ovaa H. Bienz M. Komander D.

Trabid, a new positive regulator of Wnt-induced transcription with preference for binding and cleaving K63-linked ubiquitin chains.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 528-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Point mutations (TY to LV) in each of the NZF domains reduced ubiquitin trapping as shown by a reduced ubiquitin smear and complete loss of puncta formation (Fig. S1, B and C, respectively) (25Alam S.L. Sun J. Payne M. Welch B.D. Blake B.K. Davis D.R. Meyer H.H. Emr S.D. Sundquist W.I.

Trabid, a new positive regulator of Wnt-induced transcription with preference for binding and cleaving K63-linked ubiquitin chains.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 528-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Together, this data confirms that loss of TRABID DUB activity results in the trapping of ubiquitinated species, visualized as puncta in cells, and this requires functional NZFs. Although a minimal construct consisting of TRABID NZF 1 to 3 (AA1-200) should in theory suffice to trap ubiquitin, such a construct was less efficient in both our trapping immunoprecipitation and puncta formation assays. This likely reflects the additional contribution of AnkUBD in enhancing ubiquitin trapping (28Licchesi J.D.F. Mieszczanek J. Mevissen T.E.T. Rutherford T.J. Akutsu M. Virdee S. El Oualid F. Chin J.W. Ovaa H. Bienz M. Komander D. An ankyrin-repeat ubiquitin-binding domain determines TRABID’s specificity for atypical ubiquitin chains.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 19: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By comparing the interactome of TRABIDC443S to that of TRABID ΔOTU, we aimed to differentiate between bona fide substrates and interactors since it is the NZF domains, and not the OTU domain, that mediate substrate recognition. 3xFLAG_empty vector (Ev), 3xFLAG_full-length-TRABIDC443S and 3xFLAG_TRABID ΔOTU were transiently expressed in HEK293ET cells, immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 magnetic beads, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap (Fig. S1D). The initial list included 2225 proteins with at least two unique peptides in either TRABID interactomes and zero unique peptide in the empty vector control condition (Table S1). Our working list included 23 proteins exclusive to 3xFLAG_TRABID ΔOTU and 103 proteins exclusive to full-length 3xFLAG_TRABIDC443S. Nearly all the components of the STRIPAK complex including Striatin 3, CTTNBP2/CTTNBP2L, SLMAP, and FAM40A/FAM40B were identified in the 3xFLAG-full-length-TRABIDC443S, but not the 3xFLAG_TRABID ΔOTU condition. Although this kinase/phosphatase complex had already been identified in the original full-length TRABIDWT interactome, our data now show that the interaction between STRIPAK and TRABID is primarily mediated by the catalytic OTU domain rather than the ubiquitin binding properties of TRABID NZF (Fig. 1, B and C) (39Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape.Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We also identified 50 proteins common to both 3xFLAG_TRABID ΔOTU and 3xFLAG_ FL TRABIDC443S (Table S1) and therefore reasoned that this list likely represented direct substrates of TRABID DUB activity. DUBs often exist as part of protein complexes, which can include other DUBs as well as E3 ubiquitin ligases, and we found both classes of enzymes in our candidate substratome list (Fig. 1, B and C; Table S1) (40Wilkinson K.D. DUBs at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The identification of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1 as a candidate substrate of TRABID had been previously suggested (33Tran H. Bustos D. Yeh R. Rubinfeld B. Lam C. Shriver S. Zilberleyb I. Lee M.W. Phu L. Sarkar A.A. Zohn I.E. Wertz I.E. Kirkpatrick D.S. Polakis P. HectD1 E3 ligase modifies adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) with polyubiquitin to promote the APC-axin interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 3753-3767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape.Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). However, the nature of this interaction remained puzzling given that HECTD1 has been suggested to assemble K63-linked chains, while TRABID preferentially recognizes and cleaves K29 and K33 linkages. Therefore, we further explored the TRABID-HECTD1 interaction in order to reconcile and also expand on these observations. First, we determined whether the trapping of E3 ubiquitin ligases by catalytic dead TRABID was dependent on ubiquitin. For this, we immunoprecipitated the indicated endogenous HECT ligases from HEK293ET cells overexpressing 3xFLAG_TRABID ΔOTU or 3xFLAG_TRABID ΔOTUTY>LV, a ubiquitin binding deficient mutant (Figs. 1D and 2A). We chose HECTD1, TRIP12, UBE3C, HERC2, since these had the highest number of unique peptides identified in our pull-down LC/MS-MS experiments. NEDD4 was used as negative control since it was not identified in any of our interactome studies. Endogenous HECTD1 and HERC2 could both be immunoprecipitated by the trapping construct 3xFLAG_TRABID ΔOTU, and this interaction required functional NZFs since the TY>LV mutant abrogated these interactions (Fig. 1D). In contrast, we could not validate TRIP12 and UBE3C as interactors/substrates trapped by catalytic dead TRABID although this could reflect the abundance and/or expression pattern of these E3s. For instance, TRIP12 has been shown to primarily localize to the nucleus, and its low recovery in our immunoprecipitation assay could be due to the lysis buffer used. We next used immunoprecipitation assays to show that FL TRABIDC443S indeed traps higher-molecular-weight species corresponding to ectopically expressed full-length mouse Hectd1 (Fig. 1E, lane 8, Hectd1HMW). In contrast, in the condition where TRABID is active (Fig. 1E, lane 5), or if catalytic dead FL mouse Hectd1C2587G is used (Fig. 1E, lane 9), Hectd1HMW species were markedly reduced. This suggests that catalytic dead TRABID traps higher-molecular-weight species of Hectd1 and that these species are dependent upon the ubiquitin ligase activity of Hectd1. We obtained similar data when switching 3xFLAG and EGFP tags around (Fig. S1E). Conjointly, this indicates that TRABID regulates Hectd1 autoubiquitination in cells. Importantly, these observations held true for endogenous HECTD1 (Fig. 2). By using deletion constructs in immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that TRABID NZF 1 to 3 is required for its interaction with endogenous HECTD1 (Fig. 2, A and B). In fact, with increased exposure of the membrane, we were able to detect endogenous HECTD1HMW species trapped by TRABID ΔOTU, FL-TRABIDC443S, and to a lesser extent TRABID NZF 1 to 3 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2, 4, 6). Importantly, HECTD1HMW could not be trapped by the corresponding NZF TY>LV mutants, nor by active/wild-type TRABID (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 5, 7 and 8). Further mapping using 3xFLAG-tagged and EGFP-tagged TRABID NZF constructs narrowed down the minimal domains involved as NZF 1 + 2 (Fig. 2D-F). Since individual TRABID NZF constructs expressed better when GFP tagged, we repeated the immunoprecipitation assay shown in Figure 2E with these constructs and identified NZF 1 has the minimal domain mediating interaction with endogenous HECTD1 (Fig. 2F, lane 3). This is important since TRABID NZF 1 is a K29/K33-specific UBD (29Kristariyanto Y.A. Abdul Rehman S.A. Campbell D.G. Morrice N.A. Johnson C. Toth R. Kulath"
https://openalex.org/W3153665177,"Sepsis must be diagnosed quickly to avoid morbidity and mortality. However, the clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and emergency department (ED) clinicians often must make rapid, impactful decisions before laboratory results are known. We previously developed a technique that allows the measurement of the biophysical properties of white blood cells as they are stretched through a microfluidic channel. In this study we describe and validate the resultant output as a model and score—the IntelliSep Index (ISI)—that aids in the diagnosis of sepsis in patients with suspected or confirmed infection from a single blood draw performed at the time of ED presentation. By applying this technique to a high acuity cohort with a 23.5% sepsis incidence ( n = 307), we defined specific metrics—the aspect ratio and visco-elastic inertial response—that are more sensitive than cell size or cell count in predicting disease severity. The final model was trained and cross-validated on the high acuity cohort, and the performance and generalizability of the model was evaluated on a separate low acuity cohort with a 6.4% sepsis incidence ( n = 94) and healthy donors ( n = 72). For easier clinical interpretation, the ISI is divided into three interpretation bands of Green, Yellow, and Red that correspond to increasing disease severity. The ISI agreed with the diagnosis established by retrospective physician adjudication, and accurately identified subjects with severe illness as measured by SOFA, APACHE-II, hospital-free days, and intensive care unit admission. Measured using routinely collected blood samples, with a short run-time and no requirement for patient or laboratory information, the ISI is well suited to aid ED clinicians in rapidly diagnosing sepsis."

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, individuals must adopt preventive behaviors. However, to encourage behavior change, we must first understand current knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) that inform response to this health threat. Methods We explored KAPs among Venezuelans using a cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire. The questionnaire explored individuals’ knowledge about COVID-19; their attitudes toward the world’s and the Venezuelan authorities’ abilities to control it; and their self-reported practices. We also collected demographic data. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to predict the adoption of preventive behaviors based on demographic variables, individual knowledge level, and individual attitudes. Results 3122 individuals completed the questionnaire. Participants had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19. They expressed high levels of optimism that the world would eventually control COVID-19, but they were very pessimistic about the public authorities in Venezuela. Most participants adopted preventive practices. Binomial regression suggests younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers hold lower levels of knowledge, and these groups, as well as men, were less likely to adopt preventive practices. Knowledge, by itself, had no association with optimism and little association with self-reported practices. Conclusions As other KAP studies in Latin America found, knowledge is not sufficient to prompt behavior change. Venezuelans’ pessimism about their own country’s ability should be explored in greater depth. Health promotion in Venezuela may wish to target the most at risk groups: men, younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers."
https://openalex.org/W3152920957,"Aging is accompanied by chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation, termed inflammaging, a main driver of age-associated diseases. Such sterile inflammation is typically characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species causing organ damage. Lipid mediators play important roles in the fine-tuning of both the promotion and the resolution of inflammation. Yet, it remains unclear how lipid mediators fit within the concept of inflammaging and how their biosynthesis and function is affected by aging. Here, we provide comprehensive signature profiles of inflammatory markers in organs afflicted with inflammation of young and old C57BL/6 mice. We reveal an organ-specific footprint of inflammation-related cytokines, chemokines and lipid mediators, which are distinctively affected by aging. While some organs are characterized by a pronounced pro-inflammatory microenvironment and impaired resolution during aging, others display elevated levels of pro-resolving mediators or an overall decrease in inflammatory signaling. Our results demonstrate that it proves difficult to establish a unifying concept for alterations of immunomodulatory mediators as consequence of aging and that organ specificity needs to be considered. Moreover, our data imply that inclusion of lipid mediators into the concept of inflammaging provides a comprehensive tool to characterize the inflammatory microenvironment during aging on a broader and yet, more detailed scope."

The objective is to analyze the association between air pollution and birth weight by infant sex and neighborhood socioeconomic index. All birth weights (2008–2011) were geocoded at census block level. Each census block was assigned a socioeconomic deprivation level, as well as daily NO 2 and PM 10 concentrations. We performed a multilevel model with a multiple statistical test and sensible analysis using the spline function. Our findings suggest the existence of a differential association between air pollution and BW according to both neighborhood socioeconomic level and infant sex. However, due to multiple statistical tests and controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), all significant associations became either not statistically significant or borderline. Our findings reinforce the need for additional studies to investigate the role of the neighborhood socioeconomic which could differentially modify the air pollution effect."

In this present study, D-galactose treated aging mice models were used to reveal the effects of different animal sources and different doses of whey protein (WP) on the immune indexes organs and intestinal flora. A total of 9 groups were set up, including normal control (NC), negative control (NS), positive control (Vc), low-, medium- and high-doses of cow WP intervention groups (CL, CM and CH for short, correspondingly) and low-, medium- and high-doses of goat WP intervention groups (GL, GM and GH for short, correspondingly). The body weight gain, thymus/body weight ratio, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, spleen immunoglobulins G (IgG), spleen interleukin-2 (IL-2) and spleen interleukin-2 (IL-6) were measured. Then, the intestinal contents were collected, and 16s genes of intestinal bacteria were sequenced to reveal the changes in bacterial flora structure. WP intervention significantly increased the weight gain, thymus/body ratio and SOD activity, but decrease the content of MDA. WP intervention increased some immune indicators. All the WP treated aging mice showed similar values of physiological indexes to that of the Vc group, even better. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Stenotrophomonas was increased and decreased, respectively, by both cow and goat WP. Lactobacillus may be involved in regulating the functional repair of organisms. In contrast, Stenotrophomonas might play a negative role in the immune and antioxidant capacity of the body. Combining physiological indicators and intestinal flora structure, low-concentration WP for cow and goat might be optimal for aging models."
https://openalex.org/W3156047850,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of feed restriction on mammary miRNAs and coding gene expression in midlactation cows. Five Holstein cows and 6 Montbéliarde cows underwent 6 days of feed restriction, during which feed allowance was reduced to meet 50% of their net energy for lactation requirements. Mammary biopsies were performed before and at the end of the restriction period. Mammary miRNA and mRNA analyses were performed using high-throughput sequencing and microarray analyses, respectively. Feed restriction induced a negative energy balance and decreased milk production and fat and protein yields in both breeds. Feed restriction modified the expression of 27 miRNAs and 374 mRNAs in mammary glands from Holstein cows, whereas no significant miRNA change was observed in Montbéliarde cows. Among the 27 differentially expressed miRNAs, 8 miRNAs were associated with dairy QTL. Analysis of target genes indicate that the 8 most abundantly expressed miRNAs control transcripts related to lipid metabolism, mammary remodeling and stress response. A comparison between the mRNAs targeted by the 8 most strongly expressed miRNAs and 374 differentially expressed mRNAs identified 59 mRNAs in common. The bioinformatic analyses of these 59 mRNAs revealed their implication in lipid metabolism and endothelial cell proliferation. These effects of feed restriction on mammary miRNAs and mRNAs observed in Holstein cows suggest a potential role of miRNAs in mammary structure and lipid biosynthesis that could explain changes in milk production and composition."
https://openalex.org/W3156657937,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in adipogenesis. However, studies on circRNA expression profiles associated with the development of abdominal adipose tissue are lacking in chickens. In this study, 12 cDNA libraries were constructed from the abdominal adipose tissue of Chinese domestic Gushi chickens at 6, 14, 22, and 30 weeks. A total of 1,766 circRNAs were identified by Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing. These circRNAs were primarily distributed on chr1 through chr10 and sex chromosomes, and 84.95% of the circRNAs were from gene exons. Bioinformatic analysis showed that each circRNA has 35 miRNA binding sites on average, and 62.71% have internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. Meanwhile, these circRNAs were primarily concentrated in TPM &lt; 0.1 and TPM &gt; 60, and their numbers accounted for 18.90% and 80.51%, respectively, exhibiting specific expression patterns in chicken abdominal adipose tissue. In addition, 275 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were identified by comparison analysis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the parental genes of DE circRNAs were primarily involved in biological processes and pathways related to lipid metabolism, such as regulation of fat cell differentiation, fatty acid homeostasis, and triglyceride homeostasis, as well as fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. Furthermore, ceRNA regulatory networks related to abdominal adipose development were constructed. The results of this study indicated that circRNAs can regulate lipid metabolism, adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and cell junctions during abdominal adipose tissue development in chickens through complex ceRNA networks between circRNAs, miRNAs, genes, and pathways. The results of this study may help to expand the number of known circRNAs in abdominal adipose tissue and provide a valuable resource for further research on the function of circRNAs in chicken abdominal adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3153952188,"Cognitive impairment affects patients suffering from various neuropsychiatric diseases, which are often accompanied by changes in the glutamatergic system. Epidemiological studies indicate that predispositions to the development of neuropsychiatric diseases may be programmed prenatally. Mother's improper diet during pregnancy and lactation may cause fetal abnormalities and, consequently, predispose to diseases in childhood and even adulthood. Considering the prevalence of obesity in developed countries, it seems important to examine the effects of diet on the behavior and physiology of future generations. We hypothesized that exposure to sugar excess in a maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation would affect memory as the NMDA receptor-related processes. Through the manipulation of the sugar amount in the maternal diet in rats, we assessed its effect on offspring's memory. Then, we evaluated if memory alterations were paralleled by molecular changes in NMDA receptors and related modulatory pathways in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of adolescent and young adult female and male offspring. Behavioral studies have shown sex-related changes like impaired recognition memory in adolescent males and spatial memory in females. Molecular results confirmed an NMDA receptor hypofunction along with subunit composition abnormalities in the medial prefrontal cortex of adolescent offspring. In young adults, GluN2A-containing receptors were dominant in the medial prefrontal cortex, while in the hippocampus the GluN2B subunit contribution was elevated. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a maternal high-sugar diet can affect the memory processes in the offspring by disrupting the NMDA receptor composition and regulation in the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus."

https://openalex.org/W3156589973,"We document changes in the number of sightings and timing of humpback ( Megaptera novaeangliae ), blue ( Balaenoptera musculus ), and gray ( Eschrichtius robustus ) whale migratory phases in the vicinity of the Farallon Islands, California. We hypothesized that changes in the timing of migration off central California were driven by local oceanography, regional upwelling, and basin-scale climate conditions. Using 24 years of daily whale counts collected from Southeast Farallon Island, we developed negative binomial regression models to evaluate trends in local whale sightings over time. We then used linear models to assess trends in the timing of migration, and to identify potential environmental drivers. These drivers included local, regional and basin-scale patterns; the latter included the El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, which influence, wind-driven upwelling, and overall productivity in the California Current System. We then created a forecast model to predict the timing of migration. Humpback whale sightings significantly increased over the study period, but blue and gray whale counts did not, though there was variability across the time series. Date of breeding migration (departure) for all species showed little to no change, whereas date of migration towards feeding areas (arrival) occurred earlier for humpback and blue whales. Timing was significantly influenced by a mix of local oceanography, regional, and basin-scale climate variables. Earlier arrival time without concomitant earlier departure time results in longer periods when blue and humpback whales are at risk of entanglement in the Gulf of the Farallones. We maintain that these changes have increased whale exposure to pot and trap fishery gear off the central California coast during the spring, elevating the risk of entanglements. Humpback entanglement rates were significantly associated with increased counts and early arrival in central California. Actions to decrease the temporal overlap between whales and pot/trap fishing gear, particularly when whales arrive earlier in warm water years, would likely decrease the risk of entanglements."
https://openalex.org/W3154062920,"Background Preeclampsia is a common obstetric complication. The rate of preeclampsia is increased in twin pregnancies. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical risk factors for developing preeclampsia in twin pregnancies. Methods A case-control study was carried out among women with twin pregnancies who delivered at gestational age more than 23 weeks at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, from 2003 to 2019. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to find the risk factors. Results A total of 1,568 twin pregnancies were delivered during the study period and 182 cases (11.6%) developed preeclampsia. 172 cases with preeclampsia and 516 controls were selected for analysis. After certain variables were adjusted in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the clinical factors associated with preeclampsia in twin pregnancies were nulliparity (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–2.41) and chronic hypertension (adjusted OR 6.22, 95%CI 1.98–19.57). Low gestational weight gain was a significant protective factor against the development of preeclampsia (adjusted OR 0.50; 95%CI 0.32–0.77). Conclusion The clinical risk factors for developing preeclampsia in twin pregnancies were nulliparity and chronic hypertension. These risk factors are of value to identify twin pregnant women at risk for preeclampsia and in implementing primary prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3156085437,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve and/or maintain penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual relations, and aging is one of the main risk factors involved. The D-(+)-Galactose aging model is a consolidated methodology for studies of cardiovascular aging; however, its potential for use with ED remain unexplored. The present study proposed to characterize a new experimental model for ED, using the D-(+)-Galactose aging model. For the experiments, the animals were randomly divided into three groups receiving: vehicle (CTL), D-galactose 150 mg/kg (DGAL), and D-(+)-galactose 150 mg/Kg + sildenafil 1.5 mg/Kg (DGAL+SD1.5) being administered daily for a period of eight weeks. All of the experimental protocols were previously approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals at the Federal University of Paraíba n° 9706070319. During the treatment, we analyzed physical, molecular, and physiological aspects related to the aging process and implicated in the development of ED. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that D-(+)-Galactose-induced aging represents a suitable experimental model for ED assessment. This was evidenced by an observed hyper-contractility in corpora cavernosa, significant endothelial dysfunction, increased ROS levels, an increase in cavernous tissue senescence, and the loss of essential penile erectile components."
https://openalex.org/W3154852104,"Impaired function of filaggrin (FLG) is a major predisposing factor for atopic dermatitis (AD). Several studies on FLG-deficient (Flg-/- ) mice have indicated an essential role for FLG in the skin barrier and the development of AD, but none of the studies have described the characteristics on Flg-/- mice with calcipotriol (CPT)-induced atopic dermatitis, which restricts the comprehensive understanding of functions of FLG. The present study sought to generate Flg-/- mice and applied CPT to produce AD-like dermatitis for in vivo analysis of the FLG functions. CPT was applied on the skin of Flg-/- mice to establish the AD-like dermatitis mouse model. The lesion inflammation was evaluated by gross ear thickness, histopathology, immunofluorescence, and cytokine production. Also, mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) and ceramide were used to observe the therapeutic function in this model. The results showed that the inflammation of CPT-induced dermatitis in Flg-/- mice was more severer than that of wild-type (WT) mice, as evident by the increased level of gross appearance, ear thickness, inflammatory cell infiltration (mast cells and CD3+ T cells), and inflammatory cytokine expression (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-13, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)). The emollients MPS and ceramide partially restored the epidermal function and alleviated the skin inflammation in Flg-/- mice with CPT-induced AD-like dermatitis. The current study demonstrated that skin barrier protein FLG is critical in the pathogenesis of AD. Also, the AD mouse model induced by CPT in Flg-/- mice could be utilized to search for drug targets in AD."
https://openalex.org/W3156419416,"This study aimed to evaluate the 3-year long-term outcomes of primary Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI) surgery for neovascular glaucoma (NVG). We retrospectively evaluated 27 consecutive patients with NVG between November 2013 and November 2017. All the patients were treated with panretinal photocoagulation and pars plana vitrectomy before BGI surgery without anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. The surgical success of the BGI was defined as an IOP of &lt;22 mmHg and &lt;5 mmHg with or without antiglaucoma medication. The outcomes were assessed on the basis of intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, postoperative complications, and cumulative success rate. Except for 2 mortality cases, 25 eyes (92.6%) were followed up for 3 years. The mean IOPs (mmHg)/numbers of glaucoma medications ± standard error of the mean before and 12 and 36 months after BGI surgery were 41.6/4.6 ± 1.9/0.2, 14.8/2.2 ± 0.8/0.4 and 16.9/2.6 ± 1.1/0.3, respectively. In all of the follow-up time points, the postoperative mean IOP and number of glaucoma medications were statistically significantly lower than the preoperative values (analysis of variance, P &lt; 0.001). At 3 years after surgery, the rates of visual acuity improvement (logMAR ≤ −0.3), invariance (−0.3 &lt; logMAR &lt; 0.3), and worsening (logMAR ≥ 0.3) were 56.0% (14/25 eyes), 24.0% (6/25 eyes), and 20.0% (5/25 eyes), respectively. The most common postoperative complications were hyphema (4 eyes, 14.8%) and vitreous hemorrhage (5 eyes, 18.5%), and serious complications such as expulsive hemorrhage, endophthalmitis, and tube/plate exposure did not occur. The cumulative probabilities of surgical success after the operation were 100% at 1 year, 85.2% at 2 years, and 77.4% at 3 years. In conclusion, combined non-valved pars plana tube placement in conjunction with vitrectomy was successful at lowering IOP with relatively low complication rates."

How cell–ECM detachment is linked to downregulation of ERK signaling, however, is incompletely understood. We show here that focal adhesion protein Ras Suppressor 1 (RSU1) plays a critical role in cell–ECM detachment induced suppression of ERK signaling. We have identified prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a component of membrane lipid rafts, as a novel binding protein of RSU1, and mapped a major RSU1-binding site to PHB2 amino acids 150 to 206 in the C-terminal region of the PHB/SPFH (stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflKC) domain. The PHB2 binding is mediated by multiple sites located in the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region of RSU1. Depletion of PHB2 suppressed cell–ECM adhesion–induced ERK activation. Furthermore, cell–ECM detachment increased RSU1 association with membrane lipid rafts and interaction with PHB2. Finally, knockout of RSU1 or inhibition of RSU1 interaction with PHB2 by overexpression of the major RSU1-binding PHB2 fragment (amino acids 150–206) effectively suppressed the cell–ECM detachment induced downregulation of ERK signaling. Additionally, expression of venus-tagged wild-type RSU1 restored ERK signaling, while expression of venus-tagged PHB2-binding defective RSU1 mutant in which the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region is deleted did not.

For example, loss or reduced expression or mutations of RSU1 was often found in human cancers (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma and gliomas) (37Donthamsetty S. Bhave V.S. Mars W.M. Bowen W.C. Orr A.

Furthermore, overexpression of RSU1 significantly reduced human breast cancer and glioblastoma cell growth and tumorigenic potential (39Chunduru S. Kawami H. Gullick R. Monacci W.J. Dougherty G.

Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains found in eukaryotic cells, which are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and many lipid-linked proteins including caveolin (41Simons K. Ikonen E. Functional rafts in cell membranes.Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 42Simons K. Toomre D. Lipid rafts and signal transduction.Nat. Rev. Mol.

It has been shown that membrane lipid rafts are discrete platforms for anchoring important signaling molecules such as ERK and its upstream kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) to transduce signals critical for cell proliferation, growth, and migration (43Lingwood D.

PHB2 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed PHB complex that is present in various subcellular locations including membrane lipid rafts (49Merkwirth C. Langer T.

Acta. 2009; 1793: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 50Tatsuta T. Langer T. Prohibitins.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: R629-R631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Structurally, PHB2 is composed of an amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence that facilities its localization to the membrane, a large PHB/SPFH domain known to have affinity for binding to lipid rafts, and a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain required for the assembly of the PHB complex (49Merkwirth C. Langer T. Prohibitin function within mitochondria: essential roles for cell proliferation and cristae morphogenesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the PHB complex is essential for Ras-induced ERK activation (51Rajalingam K. Wunder C.

In the current study, we show that RSU1 plays a critical role in cell–ECM detachment induced downregulation of ERK signaling. We have identified PHB2 as a novel binding protein of RSU1 and mapped a major RSU1-binding site to PHB2 amino acids 150 to 206 in the C-terminal region of the PHB/SPFH domain. In addition, we have found that multiple sites in the N-terminal LRR region of RSU-1 mediate the PHB2 binding. Functionally, depletion of PHB2 suppressed cell–ECM adhesion–induced ERK activation. Furthermore, cell–ECM detachment promoted RSU1 association with membrane lipid rafts and interaction with PHB2. Finally, knockout (KO) of RSU1 or inhibition of RSU1 interaction with PHB2 by overexpression of the RSU1-binding PHB2 fragment (amino acids 150–206) effectively suppressed the cell–ECM detachment–induced downregulation of ERK signaling. Expression of venus-tagged wild-type RSU1, but not that of venus-tagged PHB2-binding defective RSU1 mutant in which the N-terminal LRR region is deleted, restored cell–ECM detachment–induced downregulation of ERK signaling. Our results identify a novel RSU1-PHB2 signaling axis that senses cell–ECM detachment and links it to downregulation of ERK signaling. To facilitate the studies on RSU1, we knocked out RSU1 from human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (hereinafter referred to as RSU1 KO cells) using the CRISPR/Cas9 techniques with the gRNA directing to exon 1 of RSU1. DNA sequencing revealed insertion mutations at RSU1 loci (Fig. 1B), and the disruption of RSU1 was further confirmed by Western blotting with anti-RSU1 antibody (Fig. 1A). Next, we tested the role of RSU1 in cell–ECM adhesion–induced regulation of MEK and ERK signaling. To do this, we allowed wild-type HT1080 cells and RSU1 KO cells to get adhered to fibronectin-coated surface or maintained them in suspension for the same period of time. As expected, loss of cell–ECM adhesion significantly reduced the levels of activating phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in wild-type HT1080 cells (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). The densiometric ratios of phosphorylated MEK to total MEK and that of phosphorylated ERK to total ERK were reduced to 51% (p < 0.05) and 41% (p < 0.01), respectively, in suspended HT1080 cells compared with those in HT1080 cells adhered to fibronectin (Fig. 1C). By marked contrast, the cell–ECM detachment–induced suppression of MEK and ERK activation was abolished in the absence of RSU1 (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that RSU1 is essential for cell–ECM detachment–induced suppression of MEK and ERK activation. To confirm these results, we re-expressed RSU1 or the empty vector as a control in the RSU1 KO cells. Cell–ECM detachment–induced suppression of MEK and ERK activation was restored in the cells re-expressing RSU1 (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 3 and 4) but not in the control cells (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2), confirming an essential role of RSU1 in this process. We have also tested the role of RSU1 in cell–ECM adhesion–induced regulation of MEK and ERK signaling in other cell types (e.g., human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells), in which RSU1 was depleted using the same CRISPR/Cas9 strategy. The results showed that similar to what we found in HT1080 cells, loss of RSU1 in MDA-MB231 cells impaired the cell–ECM detachment–induced suppression of MEK and ERK activation (Fig. S1). Again, re-expression of RSU1 in the RSU1 KO MD231 cells restored the cell–ECM detachment–induced suppression of MEK and ERK activation (Fig. S1). These results suggest that RSU1 is critically involved in the suppression of MEK and ERK activation in response to loss of cell–ECM adhesion. We next investigated the mechanism by which RSU1 functions to suppress MEK and ERK signaling in response to cell–ECM detachment. Because RSU1 does not possess intrinsic catalytic activity, we postulated that it might function in this process through interacting with a key regulator of the MEK–ERK signaling pathway. To begin to test this, we performed yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screening using RSU1 as bait and identified PHB2, a component of the PHB complex that is critical for regulation of the MEK–ERK signaling pathway (51Rajalingam K. Wunder C. Brinkmann V. Churin Y. Hekman M. Sievers C. Rapp U.R. Rudel T. Prohibitin is required for Ras-induced Raf-MEK-ERK activation and epithelial cell migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), as a novel binding partner of RSU1 (see Experimental procedures). To validate that RSU1 forms a complex with PHB2 in cells, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments using anti-RSU1 and anti-PHB2 antibodies, respectively. The results showed that PHB2 (Fig. 2A, lane 4), like PINCH-1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3), was coimmunoprecipitated with RSU1. No PHB2 or PINCH-1 was detected in the control IgG precipitants (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 2B, lane 2). Reciprocally, RSU1 was detected in anti-PHB2 (Fig. 2C, lane 3) but not control IgG immunoprecipitants (Fig. 2C, lane 2). We have also analyzed the interaction between RSU1 and PHB2 using GST-fusion protein pull-down assay. Recombinant GST–PHB2 fusion protein was expressed and tested whether it could pull down RSU1 from mammalian cells (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the coimmunoprecipitation results, RSU1 was readily pulled down by GST–PHB2 (Fig. 2D, lane 4) but not by GST lacking PHB2 sequence (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Collectively, these results confirm that RSU1 and PHB2 form a complex in mammalian cells. To test whether RSU1 directly interacts with PHB2, we expressed recombinant GST-tagged RSU1 and maltose-binding protein (MBP)–tagged PHB2 in Escherichia coli, respectively, and analyzed the ability of purified GST-RSU1 to interact with MBP–PHB2 in pull-down assays. The results showed that GST-RSU1 was readily pulled down by MBP–PHB2 (Fig. 2E, lane 3) but not by MBP (Fig. 2E, lane 2), suggesting that RSU1 binds to PHB2 directly. Next, we generated MBP-tagged PHB2 fragments containing the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–152), the middle region (amino acids 150–206), or the C-terminal region (amino acids 201–299) and tested their RSU1-binding activity using the pull-down assays. The results showed that GST-RSU1 was pulled down by MBP-tagged PHB2 fragment containing the middle region (amino acids 150–206) (Fig. 2E, lane 3) but not by that containing the C-terminal region (amino acids 201–299) (Fig. 2E, lane 4) or the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–152) (Fig. 2E, lane 6), suggesting that PHB2 middle region (amino acids 150–206) contains a major RSU1-binding site. However, GST-RSU1 was pulled down by MBP-tagged PHB2 mutant in which amino acids 150 to 206 were deleted (Δ(150–206)) (Fig. 2E, lane 5), albeit in a smaller amount compared with that of GST-RSU1 pulled down by the PHB2 middle region (amino acids 150–206) (Fig. 2E, compare lane 3 with lane 5), suggesting that deletion of amino acids 150 to 206 does not completely eliminate RSU1 binding. Next, we sought to identify the RSU1 region that mediates PHB2 binding. To do this, we generated GST-tagged proteins containing various RSU1 regions (Fig. 2F) and tested their PHB2-binding activity in a pull-down assay. The results showed that GST-tagged RSU1 N-terminal LRR region (amino acids 1–208) (Fig. 2F, lane 4), but not GST-tagged RSU1 C-terminal region (amino acids 209–277) (Fig. 2F, lane 3), pulled down venus-tagged PHB2. In control experiments, venus-tagged PHB2 was pulled down by GST-RSU1 (Fig. 2F, lane 2) but not by GST (Fig. 2F, lane 1), confirming the specificity of the pull-down assay. Venus-tagged PHB2 was also pulled down by GST-tagged LRR1-LRR2 (amino acids 1–66) (Fig. 2F, lane 6) or LRR3-LRR8 (amino acids 67–208) (Fig. 2F, lane 7) but not LRR1 (amino acids 1–43) (Fig. 2F, lane 5) or LRR2 (amino acids 44–66) (Fig. 2F, lane 8). Collectively, these results suggest that the PHB2 binding is mediated by multiple LRRs located in the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–208) of RSU1. We next tested whether PHB2 is involved in the regulation of cell–ECM adhesion–induced MEK and ERK activation. To do this, we knocked down PHB2 from HT1080 cells by siRNA (Fig. 3A).

Circulating monocytes are exposed to stimuli that alter their physiological state, and among them, lipids play a key role. Several studies investigated the mechanisms by which lipids affect monocyte functions promoting coronary atherosclerotic plaque initiation, but information on the relationship between lipid composition and function of monocyte is scant. We aimed at studying the migration of circulating monocytes isolated from patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at hospital presentation and investigating its correlation with cellular lipid profile. The migration of monocytes was tested using both fetal bovine serum (FBS) and autologous serum as chemoattractant stimuli. Monocyte lipid profile was evaluated through an untargeted lipidomics approach, using a liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry platform. We observed that AMI patients' monocytes showed a significant increase in FBS and autologous serum-mediated migration compared to controls. Moreover, a different monocyte lipidomic profile between the two study groups was detected. In particular, AMI patients' monocytes showed an altered composition in ceramides, with an increase in lactosylceramide and in phospholipids (ie, phosphatidylethanolamine and lisophosphatidylethanolamine). Of note, a positive correlation between lactosylceramide levels and monocyte migration was observed. Furthermore, the lactosylceramide synthase inhibition significantly reduced FBS-induced monocyte migration. Our results highlight the influence of lactosylceramide on the monocyte migration capacity, pointing out a new possible mechanism of lipids in the onset of atherothrombosis and, hence, in AMI."

This enzyme is found broadly across kingdoms of life and plays a critical role in polyamine biosynthesis and the regulation of agmatine concentrations. Here we describe the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the E. coli agmatinase, SPEB. The data showed a relatively high degree of pseudomerohedral twinning, was ultimately indexed in the P31 space group and led to a final model with eighteen chains, corresponding to three full hexamers in the asymmetric unit. There was a solvent content of 38.5% and refined R/Rfree values of 0.166/0.216. The protein has the conserved fold characteristic of the agmatine ureohydrolase family and displayed a high degree of structural similarity among individual protomers. Two distinct peaks of electron density were observed in the active site of most of the eighteen chains of SPEB. As the activity of this protein is known to be dependent upon manganese and the fold is similar to other dinuclear metallohydrolases, these peaks were modeled as manganese ions. The orientation of the conserved active site residues, in particular those amino acids that participate in binding the metal ions and a pair of acidic residues (D153 and E274 in SPEB) that play a role in catalysis, are similar to other agmatinase and arginase enzymes and is consistent with a hydrolytic mechanism that proceeds via a metal-activated hydroxide ion."

This study describes the DRM prevalence and its therapeutic impact in HIV-infected pediatric patients from Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC). Methods From 2016–2018, dried blood were collected from 71 HIV-infected children and adolescents under ART in two hospitals in Kinshasa for HIV-1 DRM pol analysis, predicted ARV-susceptibility by Stanford and phylogenetic characterization. Results HIV-1 sequences were recovered from 55 children/adolescents with 14 years of median-age. All had received nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, NNRTI), 9.1% protease inhibitors (PI) and only one integrase inhibitor (INI). Despite the use of ART, 89.1% showed virological failure and 67.3% carried viruses with major-DRM to one (12.7%), two (47.3%), or three (5.5%) ARV-families. Most children/adolescents harbored DRM to NNRTI (73.5%) or NRTI (61.2%). Major-DRM to PI was present in 8.3% and minor-DRM to INI in 15%. Dual-class-NRTI+NNRTI resistance appeared in 53.1% of patients. Viruses presented high/intermediate resistance to nevirapine (72.9% patients), efavirenz (70.9%), emtricitabine/lamivudine (47.9%), rilpivirine (41.7%), etravirine (39.6%), doravidine (33.3%), zidovudine (22.9%), among others. Most participants were susceptible to INI and PI. Great diversity of variants was found, with a high rate (40%) of unique recombinants. Conclusion The high DRM prevalence observed among HIV-infected children and adolescents in Kinshasa could compromise the 95-95-95-UNAIDS targets in the DRC. It also reinforces the need for routine resistance monitoring for optimal rescue therapy election in this vulnerable population to control the spread of resistant HIV in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3153364188,"Information that is encoded in relation to the self has been shown to be better remembered, yet reports have disagreed on whether the memory benefit from self-referential encoding extends to source memory (the context in which information was learned). In this study, we investigated the self-referential effect on source memory in recollection and familiarity-based memory. Using a Remember/Know paradigm, we compared source memory accuracy under self-referential encoding and semantic encoding. Two types of source information were included, a ""peripheral"" source which was not inherent to the encoding activity, and a source information about the encoding context. We observed the facilitation in item memory from self-referential encoding compared to semantic encoding in recollection but not in familiarity-based memory. The self-referential benefit to source accuracy was observed in recollection memory, with source memory for the encoding context being stronger in the self-referential condition. No significant self-referential effect was observed with regards to peripheral source information (information not required for the participant to focus on), suggesting not all source information benefit from self-referential encoding. Self-referential encoding also resulted in a higher ratio of ""Remember/Know"" responses rate than semantically encoded items, denoting stronger recollection. These results suggest self-referential encoding creates a richer, more detailed memory trace which can be recollected later on."
https://openalex.org/W3154833201,"Intercellular gap junction channels and single-membrane channels have been reported to regulate electrical synapse and the brain function. Innexin is known as a gap junction-related protein in invertebrates and is involved in the formation of intercellular gap junction channels and single-cell membrane channels. Multiple isoforms of innexin protein in each species enable the precise regulation of channel function. In molluscan species, sequence information of innexins is still limited and the sequences of multiple innexin isoforms have not been classified. This study examined the innexin transcripts expressed in the central nervous system of the terrestrial slug Limax valentianus and identified 16 transcripts of 12 innexin isoforms, including the splicing variants. We performed phylogenetic analysis and classified the isoforms with other molluscan innexin sequences. Next, the phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, and S-nitrosylation sites were predicted to characterize the innexin isoforms. Further, we identified 16 circular RNA sequences of nine innexin isoforms in the central nervous system of Limax . The identification and classification of molluscan innexin isoforms provided novel insights for understanding the regulatory mechanism of innexin in this phylum."

We aim to describe key properties of these samples to guide those using this method and to inform methodological research. Methods In 2019, authors who published respondent driven sampling studies were contacted with a request to share reported degree and network information. Of 59 author groups identified, 15 (25%) agreed to share data, representing 53 distinct study samples containing 36,547 participants across 12 countries and several target populations including migrants, sex workers and men who have sex with men. Distribution of reported network degree was described for each sample and characteristics of recruitment chains, and their relationship to coupons, were reported. Results Reported network degree is severely skewed and is best represented by a log normal distribution. For participants connected to more than 15 other people, reported degree is imprecise and frequently rounded to the nearest five or ten. Our results indicate that many samples contain highly connected individuals, who may be connected to at least 1000 other people. Conclusion Because very large reported degrees are common; we caution against treating these reports as outliers. The imprecise and skewed distribution of the reported degree should be incorporated into future RDS methodological studies to better capture real-world performance. Previous results indicating poor performance of regression estimators using RDS weights may be widely generalizable. Fewer recruitment coupons may be associated with longer recruitment chains."
https://openalex.org/W3152580076,"Tuberculosis caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a significant threat to global health. Elucidating the mechanisms of essential MTB genes provides an important theoretical basis for drug exploitation. Gene mtsp17 is essential and is conserved in the Mycobacterium genus. Although Mtsp17 has a structure closely resembling typical steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) family proteins, its biological function is different. This study characterizes the transcriptomes of Mycobacterium smegmatis to explore the consequences of mtsp17 downregulation on gene expression. Suppression of the mtsp17 gene resulted in significant down-regulation of 3% and upregulation of 1% of all protein-coding genes. Expression of desA1 , an essential gene involved in mycolic acid synthesis, and the anti-SigF antagonist MSMEG_0586 were down-regulated in the conditional Mtsp17 knockout mutant and up-regulated in the Mtsp17 over-expression strain. Trends in the changes of 70 of the 79 differentially expressed genes (Log 2 fold change &gt; 1.5) in the conditional Mtsp17 knockout strain were the same as in the SigF knockout strain. Our data suggest that Mtsp17 is likely an activator of desA1 and Mtsp17 regulates the SigF regulon by SigF regulatory pathways through the anti-SigF antagonist MSMEG_0586. Our findings indicate the role of Mtsp17 may be in transcriptional regulation, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of START family proteins, and uncover a new node in the regulatory network of mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3154858165,"Bilingual language experience, such as switching between languages, has been shown to shape both cognitive and neural mechanisms of non-linguistic cognitive control. However, the neural adaptations induced by language switching remain unclear. Using fMRI, the current study examined the impact of short-term language switching training on the neural network of domain-general cognitive control for unbalanced Chinese-English bilinguals. Effective connectivity maps were constructed by using the extended unified structural equation models (euSEM) within 10 common brain regions involved in both language control and domain-general cognitive control. Results showed that, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area (dACC/pre-SMA) lost connection from the right thalamus after training, suggesting that less neural connectivity was required to complete the same domain-general cognitive control task. These findings not only provide direct evidence for the modulation of language switching training on the neural interaction of domain-general cognitive control, but also have important implications for revealing the potential neurocognitive adaptation effects of specific bilingual language experiences."

Using data from a July 2020 sample of 28,503 patients receiving dialysis, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with laboratory surrogates of patient health. In separate logistic regression models, we assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with seven laboratory-based covariates (albumin, creatinine, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone), across the entire range of the laboratory and in comparison to a referent value. Models accounted for age, sex, region, race and ethnicity, and county-level COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. Odds of seropositivity for albumin 3 and 3.5 g/dL were 2.1 (95% CI 1.9–2.3) and 1.3 (1.2–1.4) respectively, compared with 4 g/dL. Odds of seropositivity for serum creatinine 5 and 8 mg/dL were 1.8 (1.6–2.0) and 1.3 (1.2–1.4) respectively, compared with 12.5 mg/dL. Lower values of hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone were associated with higher odds of seropositivity. Laboratory values associated with poorer health status and higher risk for mortality were also associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W3155765102,"Dispersal is an important life-history trait. In marine meiofauna, and particularly in nematodes, dispersal is generally considered to be mainly passive, i.e. through transport with water currents and bedload transport. Because nematodes have no larval dispersal stage and have a poor swimming ability, their per capita dispersal capacity is expected to be limited. Nevertheless, many marine nematode genera and even species have near-cosmopolitan distributions, and at much smaller spatial scales, can rapidly colonise new habitat patches. Here we demonstrate that certain marine nematodes, like the morphospecies Litoditis marina , can live inside macroalgal structures such as receptacula and–to a lesser extent–floating bladders, which may allow them to raft over large distances with drifting macroalgae. We also demonstrate for the first time that these nematodes can colonize new habitat patches, such as newly deposited macroalgal wrack in the intertidal, not only through seawater but also through air. Our experimental set-up demonstrates that this aerial transport is probably the result of hitchhiking on vectors such as insects, which visit, and move between, the patches of deposited algae. Transport by wind, which has been observed for terrestrial nematodes and freshwater zooplankton, could not be demonstrated. These results can be important for our understanding of both large-scale geographic distribution patterns and of the small-scale colonization dynamics of habitat patches by marine nematodes."

Our study evaluated the ingestive behavior of young lambs in different tropical pastures to identify which variables interfere in their grazing activity. Two years of study were carried out with 54 weaned lambs distributed in three different pasture canopies: 1) monoculture of an upright grass, guinea grass ( Panicum maximum ; GG); 2) monoculture of a shrubby legume pigeon pea ( Cajanus cajan ; PP) and 3) contiguous paddock with half GG and half PP (GP). The experiment was set out in a randomized complete block design (3 blocks). Lamb ingestive behavior was observed from sunrise to sunset with records every 5 minutes. To identify the main variables that affected lamb grazing activity, a multivariate analysis of the Decision Tree was performed. Our results showed that there was no difference in the ingestive behavior parameters of young lambs in different canopies ( P &gt; 0.05). There was interaction among the canopies and the experimental periods for the variables idleness time and biting rate ( P ≤ 0.05). Lambs in all canopies showed more idleness time in the first evaluation period. Lambs in canopies containing grass (GG and GP) exhibited greater bites per minute throughout the experimental period. Lamb grazing time increased 40% as experimental period progressed and plants matured. The Decision Tree identified leaf:stem ratio as the variable that most influenced lamb grazing time in GG and GP canopies while in the PP, grazing time was directly related to canopy height. The behavior of young lambs on tropical pasture is variable as there is a change in the behavioral response to canopy characteristics over time. In addition, the grazing time of these animals can be estimated by means of variables related to canopy structural characteristics (leaf:stem ratio and height) together with chemical variables."
https://openalex.org/W3153458467,"Background The aim of the study was to perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of the experience and image of one’s body among living kidney donors. Method The research was carried out using mixed methodology. The study on experiencing one’s own body was carried out using the sociological methodology of the grounded theory (qualitative research). This method was supplemented with psychometric measurement–the Body Esteem Scale (quantitative research). The basic research method was the in-depth interview. Using this method, a group of 25 living kidney donors who had not experienced any serious health or psychological problems after donation was examined. The participants of the study came from three transplant centers in Poland. Results The data from the sociological interviews indicate that the donors: 1. do not experience radical changes in the functioning of their body; 2. maintain full control over it and do not feel the absence of a kidney in the body; 3. consciously and reflectively take care of their body after donation. In addition, the sociological research indicates that caring for one’s own body also includes the transferred organ. The kidney donors experience a kind of bodily identity extension, including the recipient’s body. However, the personal and social identity of the studied kidney donors is not disturbed in any way. The psychometric data correspond to the sociological results and indicate: 1. a lack of extreme emotional assessments about one’s body; 2. awareness of one’s own body and consistency of its image; 3. reduced emotional assessment of body zones directly related to the surgery; 4. differences in body image between the sexes. Conclusions The research results presented in the text indicate not only the possibility, but also the need for triangulation of research methods in the study of the experience and image of one’s own body in living kidney donors. The proposed research approach employing mixed methodology within the fields of sociology and psychology for researching the phenomenon of living kidney donation is not very common."

Research on gene expression patterns of C . trachomatis has predominantly focused on non-native host cells, with limited data on growth kinetics and gene expression of chlamydia in keratinocytes. Here, we investigated whether early, mid, and late chlamydial genes observed in HeLa cell line studies were co-ordinately regulated at the transcriptional level even in the keratinized cell line model and whether the expression was stage-specific during the developmental cycle. HaCaT cell lines were infected with chlamydia clinical isolates (US151and serovar E) and reference strain (L2 434). Expression of groEL-1 , incB , pyk-F , tal , hctA , and omcB genes was conducted with comparative real-time PCR and transcriptional events during the chlamydial developmental cycle using transmission electron microscopy. The relative expression level of each gene and fold difference were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCT method. The expression of groEL-1 and pyk-F genes was highest at 2 hours post-infection (hpi) in the L2 434 and serovar E. The expression of incB gene increased at 2 hpi in L2 434 and serovar E but peaked at 12 hpi in serovar E. L2 434 and US151 had similar tal expression profiles. Increased expression of hctA and omcB genes were found at 2 and 36 hpi in L2 434. Both clinical isolates and reference strains presented the normal chlamydial replication cycle comprising elementary bodies and reticulate bodies within 36 hpi. We show different gene expression patterns between clinical isolates and reference strain during in vitro infection of keratinocytes, with reference strain-inducing consistent expression of genes. These findings confirm that keratinocytes are appropriate cell lines to interrogate cell differentiation, growth kinetics, and gene expression of C . trachomatis infection. Furthermore, more studies with different clinical isolates and genes are needed to better understand the Chlamydial pathogenesis in keratinocytes."

Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) are an important commercial and recreational gamefish, but nine Chinook subspecies are federally threatened or endangered due to anthropogenic impacts. Several San Francisco Bay Area streams and rivers currently host spawning Chinook populations, but government agencies consider these non-native hatchery strays. Through the morphology-based analysis of 17,288 fish specimens excavated from Native American middens at Mission Santa Clara (CA-SCL-30H), Santa Clara County, circa 1781–1834 CE, 88 salmonid vertebrae were identified. Ancient DNA sequencing identified three separate individuals as Chinook salmon and the remainder as steelhead/rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ). These findings comprise the first physical evidence of the nativity of salmon to the Guadalupe River in San Jose, California, extending their documented historic range to include San Francisco Bay’s southernmost tributary watershed."
