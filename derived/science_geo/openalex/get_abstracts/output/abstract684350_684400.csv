https://openalex.org/W3214596602,"A principal challenge in the analysis of tissue imaging data is cell segmentation—the task of identifying the precise boundary of every cell in an image. To address this problem we constructed TissueNet, a dataset for training segmentation models that contains more than 1 million manually labeled cells, an order of magnitude more than all previously published segmentation training datasets. We used TissueNet to train Mesmer, a deep-learning-enabled segmentation algorithm. We demonstrated that Mesmer is more accurate than previous methods, generalizes to the full diversity of tissue types and imaging platforms in TissueNet, and achieves human-level performance. Mesmer enabled the automated extraction of key cellular features, such as subcellular localization of protein signal, which was challenging with previous approaches. We then adapted Mesmer to harness cell lineage information in highly multiplexed datasets and used this enhanced version to quantify cell morphology changes during human gestation. All code, data and models are released as a community resource. Deep learning algorithms perform as well as humans in identifying cells in tissue images."
https://openalex.org/W3212761873,"All life forms defend their genome against DNA invasion. Eukaryotic cells recognize incoming DNA and limit its transcription through repressive chromatin modifications. The human silencing hub (HUSH) complex transcriptionally represses long interspersed element-1 retrotransposons (L1s) and retroviruses through histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3)1-3. How HUSH recognizes and initiates silencing of these invading genetic elements is unknown. Here we show that HUSH is able to recognize and transcriptionally repress a broad range of long, intronless transgenes. Intron insertion into HUSH-repressed transgenes counteracts repression, even in the absence of intron splicing. HUSH binds transcripts from the target locus, prior to and independent of H3K9me3 deposition, and target transcription is essential for both initiation and propagation of HUSH-mediated H3K9me3. Genomic data reveal how HUSH binds and represses a subset of endogenous intronless genes generated through retrotransposition of cellular mRNAs. Thus intronless cDNA-the hallmark of reverse transcription-provides a versatile way to distinguish invading retroelements from host genes and enables HUSH to protect the genome from 'non-self' DNA, despite there being no previous exposure to the invading element. Our findings reveal the existence of a transcription-dependent genome-surveillance system and explain how it provides immediate protection against newly acquired elements while avoiding inappropriate repression of host genes."
https://openalex.org/W3212236634,"Mechanisms governing how immune cells and their derived molecules impact homeostatic brain function are still poorly understood. Here, we elucidate neuronal mechanisms underlying T cell effects on synaptic function and episodic memory. Depletion of CD4 T cells led to memory deficits and impaired long-term potentiation. Severe combined immune-deficient mice exhibited amnesia, which was reversible by repopulation with T cells from wild-type but not from IL-4-knockout mice. Behaviors impacted by T cells were mediated via IL-4 receptors expressed on neurons. Exploration of snRNA-seq of neurons participating in memory processing provided insights into synaptic organization and plasticity-associated pathways regulated by immune cells. IL-4Rα knockout in inhibitory (but not in excitatory) neurons was sufficient to impair contextual fear memory, and snRNA-seq from these mice pointed to IL-4-driven regulation of synaptic function in promoting memory. These findings provide new insights into complex neuroimmune interactions at the transcriptional and functional levels in neurons under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3211868860,"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by a collapse in proteostasis, as shown by the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates in the brain. Proteostasis involves a balance of protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation, but how aggregates perturb these pathways is unknown. Using Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient midbrain cultures, we find that aggregated α-synuclein induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fragmentation and compromises ER protein folding capacity, leading to misfolding and aggregation of immature lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase. Despite this, PD neurons fail to initiate the unfolded protein response, indicating perturbations in sensing or transducing protein misfolding signals in the ER. Small molecule enhancement of ER proteostasis machinery promotes β-glucocerebrosidase solubility, while simultaneous enhancement of trafficking improves ER morphology, lysosomal function, and reduces α-synuclein. Our studies suggest that aggregated α-synuclein perturbs the ability of neurons to respond to misfolded proteins in the ER, and that synergistic enhancement of multiple proteostasis branches may provide therapeutic benefit in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3212102293,"Social competition plays a pivotal role in determining individuals' social status. While the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is essential in regulating social competition, it remains unclear how information is processed within its local networks. Here, by applying optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations in a dominance tube test, we reveal that, in accordance with pyramidal (PYR) neuron activation, excitation of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or inhibition of the parvalbumin (PV) interneurons induces winning. The winning behavior is associated with sequential calcium activities initiated by VIP and followed by PYR and PV neurons. Using miniature two-photon microscopic (MTPM) and optrode recordings in awake mice, we show that VIP stimulation directly leads to a two-phased activity pattern of both PYR and PV neurons-rapid suppression followed by activation. The delayed activation of PV implies an embedded feedback tuning. This disinhibitory VIP-PV-PYR motif forms the core of a dmPFC microcircuit to control social competition."
https://openalex.org/W3212356838,"Nutrients are emerging regulators of adaptive immunity1. Selective nutrients interplay with immunological signals to activate mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key driver of cell metabolism2-4, but how these environmental signals are integrated for immune regulation remains unclear. Here we use genome-wide CRISPR screening combined with protein-protein interaction networks to identify regulatory modules that mediate immune receptor- and nutrient-dependent signalling to mTORC1 in mouse regulatory T (Treg) cells. SEC31A is identified to promote mTORC1 activation by interacting with the GATOR2 component SEC13 to protect it from SKP1-dependent proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, loss of SEC31A impairs T cell priming and Treg suppressive function in mice. In addition, the SWI/SNF complex restricts expression of the amino acid sensor CASTOR1, thereby enhancing mTORC1 activation. Moreover, we reveal that the CCDC101-associated SAGA complex is a potent inhibitor of mTORC1, which limits the expression of glucose and amino acid transporters and maintains T cell quiescence in vivo. Specific deletion of Ccdc101 in mouse Treg cells results in uncontrolled inflammation but improved antitumour immunity. Collectively, our results establish epigenetic and post-translational mechanisms that underpin how nutrient transporters, sensors and transducers interplay with immune signals for three-tiered regulation of mTORC1 activity and identify their pivotal roles in licensing T cell immunity and immune tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W3213680168,"The striatum comprises multiple subdivisions and neural circuits that differentially control motor output. The islands of Calleja (IC) contain clusters of densely packed granule cells situated in the ventral striatum, predominantly in the olfactory tubercle (OT). Characterized by expression of the D3 dopamine receptor, the IC are evolutionally conserved, but have undefined functions. Here, we show that optogenetic activation of OT D3 neurons robustly initiates self-grooming in mice while suppressing other ongoing behaviors. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of these neurons halts ongoing grooming, and genetic ablation reduces spontaneous grooming. Furthermore, OT D3 neurons show increased activity before and during grooming and influence local striatal output via synaptic connections with neighboring OT neurons (primarily spiny projection neurons), whose firing rates display grooming-related modulation. Our study uncovers a new role of the ventral striatum's IC in regulating motor output and has important implications for the neural control of grooming."
https://openalex.org/W3214527257,"Arvicolinae is one of the most impressive placental radiations with over 150 extant and numerous extinct species that emerged since the Miocene in the Northern Hemisphere. The phylogeny of Arvicolinae has been studied intensively for several decades using morphological and genetic methods. Here, we sequenced 30 new mitochondrial genomes to better understand the evolutionary relationships among the major tribes and genera within the subfamily. The phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses based on 11,391 bp concatenated alignment of protein-coding mitochondrial genes confirmed the monophyly of the subfamily. While Bayesian analysis provided a high resolution across the entire tree, Maximum Likelihood tree reconstruction showed weak support for the ordering of divergence and interrelationships of tribal level taxa within the most ancient radiation. Both the interrelationships among tribes Lagurini, Ellobiusini and Arvicolini, comprising the largest radiation and the position of the genus Dinaromys within it also remained unresolved. For the first time complex relationships between genus level taxa within the species-rich tribe Arvicolini received full resolution. Particularly Lemmiscus was robustly placed as sister to the snow voles Chionomys in the tribe Arvicolini in contrast with a long-held belief of its affinity with Lagurini. Molecular dating of the origin of Arvicolinae and early divergences obtained from the mitogenome data were consistent with fossil records. The mtDNA estimates for putative ancestors of the most genera within Arvicolini appeared to be much older than it was previously proposed in paleontological studies."
https://openalex.org/W3214323499,"Although the classic symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) manifest in adulthood, neural progenitor cell behavior is already abnormal by 13 weeks' gestation. To determine how these developmental defects evolve, we turned to cell and mouse models. We found that layer II/III neurons that normally connect the hemispheres are limited in their growth in HD by microtubule bundling defects within the axonal growth cone, so that fewer axons cross the corpus callosum. Proteomic analyses of the growth cones revealed that NUMA1 (nuclear/mitotic apparatus protein 1) is downregulated in HD by miR-124. Suppressing NUMA1 in wild-type cells recapitulates the microtubule and axonal growth defects of HD, whereas raising NUMA1 levels with antagomiR-124 or stabilizing microtubules with epothilone B restores microtubule organization and rescues axonal growth. NUMA1 therefore regulates the microtubule network in the growth cone, and HD, which is traditionally conceived as a disease of intracellular trafficking, also disturbs the cytoskeletal network."
https://openalex.org/W3213352250,"Abstract Autophagy is an essential catabolic process that orchestrates cellular homeostasis and plays dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. However, the mechanism by which autophagy affects the self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy activation contributes to CSC properties of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The results showed that the autophagy level and CSC properties of HNSCC cells were elevated in response to several adverse conditions, including treatment with cisplatin, starvation, and hypoxia. Pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors, such as 3-MA and chloroquine, diminished the CSC properties acquired under adverse conditions. In addition, the isolated CSCs were endowed with stronger autophagic activity than non-CSCs, and the CSC properties were dampened when autophagy was inhibited either by 3-MA, chloroquine, or Beclin1 knockdown. Notably, the tumor-initiating activity of CSCs was decreased upon knocking down Beclin1. Further study revealed that FOXO3, a substrate for autophagy, was enriched in the nucleus of cells with lower autophagy levels. Nuclear FOXO3 directly bound to the promoter region of SOX2 and negatively regulated its transcriptional activity. Overexpression of FOXO3 decreased the expression of SOX2 and thereby impaired the CSC phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that the activation of autophagy is essential for the acquisition of CSC properties in adverse conditions and the self-renewal of CSCs. We clarify the role of autophagy in regulating the CSC phenotype and demonstrate that the noncanonical FOXO3/SOX2 axis is the intrinsic regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3213706593,"Numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) arise during meiosis to initiate homologous recombination. These DSBs are usually repaired faithfully, but here, we uncover a distinct type of mutational event in which deletions form via joining of ends from two closely spaced DSBs (double cuts) within a single hotspot or at adjacent hotspots on the same or different chromatids. Deletions occur in normal meiosis but are much more frequent when DSB formation is dysregulated in the absence of the ATM kinase. Events between chromosome homologs point to multi-chromatid damage and aborted gap repair. Some deletions contain DNA from other hotspots, indicating that double cutting at distant sites creates substrates for insertional mutagenesis. End joining at double cuts can also yield tandem duplications or extrachromosomal circles. Our findings highlight the importance of DSB regulation and reveal a previously hidden potential for meiotic mutagenesis that is likely to affect human health and genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3211408310,"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) are antibody mimetics with high and mostly unexplored potential in drug development. By using in silico analysis and a rationally guided Ala scanning, we identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play a key role in overall protein thermostability. The melting temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus internal repeat was increased by 8 °C to 10 °C when Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala, or Thr. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including clinically validated DARPin domains, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor-binding domain of the DARPin abicipar pegol. In all cases, these proteins showed improvements in the thermostability on the order of 8 °C to 16 °C, suggesting the replacement of Asp17 could be generically applicable to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, this beneficial Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development, indicating this mutation could be partly responsible for the very high melting temperature (>90 °C) of this promising anti-COVID-19 drug. Overall, such N-terminal capping repeats with increased thermostability seem to be beneficial for the development of innovative drugs based on DARPins."
https://openalex.org/W3212481195,"Professional burnout represents a significant threat to the American healthcare system. Organizational and individual factors may increase healthcare providers' susceptibility or resistance to burnout. We hypothesized that during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1) higher levels of perceived organizational support (POS) are associated with lower risk for burnout and anxiety, and 2) anxiety mediates the association between POS and burnout.In this longitudinal prospective study, we surveyed healthcare providers employed full-time at a large, multihospital healthcare system monthly over 6 months (April to November 2020). Participants were randomized using a 1:1 allocation stratified by provider type, gender, and academic hospital status to receive one of two versions of the survey instrument formulated with different ordering of the measures to minimize response bias due to context effects. The exposure of interest was POS measured using the validated 8-item Survey of POS (SPOS) scale. Primary outcomes of interest were anxiety and risk for burnout as measured by the validated 10-item Burnout scale from the Professional Quality (Pro-QOL) instrument and 4-item Emotional Distress-Anxiety short form of the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scale, respectively. Linear mixed models evaluated the associations between POS and both burnout and anxiety. A mediation analysis evaluated whether anxiety mediated the POS-burnout association.Of the 538 participants recruited, 402 (75%) were included in the primary analysis. 55% of participants were physicians, 73% 25-44 years of age, 73% female, 83% White, and 44% had ≥1 dependent. Higher POS was significantly associated with a lower risk for burnout (-0.23; 95% CI -0.26, -0.21; p<0.001) and lower degree of anxiety (-0.07; 95% CI -0.09, -0.06; p = 0.010). Anxiety mediated the associated between POS and burnout (direct effect -0.17; 95% CI -0.21, -0.13; p<0.001; total effect -0.23; 95% CI -0.28, -0.19; p<0.001).During a health crisis, increasing the organizational support perceived by healthcare employees may reduce the risk for burnout through a reduction in anxiety. Improving the relationship between healthcare organizations and the individuals they employ may reduce detrimental effects of psychological distress among healthcare providers and ultimately improve patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3213149933,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures, which are released upon neutrophil activation. It has previously been demonstrated that NETs are present in atherosclerotic lesions of both humans and animal models thus playing a decisive role in atherosclerosis. Besides, macrophages have a crucial role in disease progression, whereby classically activated M1 macrophages sustain inflammation and alternatively activated M2 macrophages display anti-inflammatory effects. Although NETs and macrophages were found to colocalize in atherosclerotic lesions, the impact of NETs on macrophage function is not fully understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of NETs on human and murine macrophages in respect to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and uptake of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in vitro. Human THP-1 and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured under M1 (LPS + IFN-γ)- and M2a (IL-4)-polarizing culture conditions and treated with NETs. To mimic intraplaque regions, cells were additionally cultured under hypoxic conditions. NETs significantly increased the expression of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in THP-M1 macrophages under normoxia but suppressed their expression in murine M1 macrophages under hypoxic conditions. Notably, NETs increased the number of oxLDL-positive M1 and M2 human and murine macrophages under normoxia, but did not influence formation of murine foam cells under hypoxia. However, oxLDL uptake did not strongly correlate with the expression of the LDL receptor CD36. Besides, upregulated MMP-9 expression and secretion by macrophages was detected in the presence of NETs. Again, hypoxic culture conditions dampened NETs effects. These results suggest that NETs may favor foam cell formation and plaque vulnerability, but exert opposite effects in respect to the inflammatory response of human and murine M1 macrophages. Moreover, effects of NETs on macrophages' phenotype are altered under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W3214379608,"Far-red light photoacclimation exhibited by some cyanobacteria allows these organisms to use the far-red region of the solar spectrum (700-800 nm) for photosynthesis. Part of this process includes the replacement of six photosystem I (PSI) subunits with isoforms that confer the binding of chlorophyll (Chl) f molecules that absorb far-red light (FRL). However, the exact sites at which Chl f molecules are bound are still challenging to determine. To aid in the identification of Chl f-binding sites, we solved the cryo-EM structure of PSI from far-red light-acclimated cells of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335. We identified six sites that bind Chl f with high specificity and three additional sites that are likely to bind Chl f at lower specificity. All of these binding sites are in the core-antenna regions of PSI, and Chl f was not observed among the electron transfer cofactors. This structural analysis also reveals both conserved and nonconserved Chl f-binding sites, the latter of which exemplify the diversity in FRL-PSI among species. We found that the FRL-PSI structure also contains a bound soluble ferredoxin, PetF1, at low occupancy, which suggests that ferredoxin binds less transiently than expected according to the canonical view of ferredoxin-binding to facilitate electron transfer. We suggest that this may result from structural changes in FRL-PSI that occur specifically during FRL photoacclimation."
https://openalex.org/W3212433299,"Smartphone usage is nearly ubiquitous worldwide, and Android provides the leading open-source operating system, retaining the most significant market share and active user population of all open-source operating systems. Hence, malicious actors target the Android operating system to capitalize on this consumer reliance and vulnerabilities present in the system. Hackers often use confidential user data to exploit users for advertising, extortion, and theft. Notably, most Android malware detection tools depend on conventional machine-learning algorithms; hence, they lose the benefits of metaheuristic optimization. Here, we introduce a novel detection system based on optimizing the random vector functional link (RVFL) using the artificial Jellyfish Search (JS) optimizer following dimensional reduction of Android application features. JS is used to determine the optimal configurations of RVFL to improve classification performance. RVFL+JS minimizes the runtime of the execution of the optimized models with the best performance metrics, based on a dataset consisting of 11,598 multi-class applications and 471 static and dynamic features."
https://openalex.org/W3213986051,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus genotype 2 (PRRSV-2) genetic diversity in the U.S. was assessed using a database comprising 10 years' worth of sequence data obtained from swine production systems routine monitoring and outbreak investigations. A total of 26,831 ORF5 PRRSV-2 sequences from 34 production systems were included in this analysis. Within group mean genetic distance (i.e. mean proportion of nucleotide differences within ORF5) per year according to herd type was calculated for all PRRSV-2 sequences. The percent nucleotide difference between each sequence and the ORF5 sequences from four commercially available PRRSV-2 vaccines (Ingelvac PRRS MLV, Ingelvac PRRS ATP, Fostera PRRS, and Prevacent PRRS) within the same lineage over time was used to classify sequences in wild-type or vaccine-like. The mean ORF5 genetic distance fluctuated from 0.09 to 0.13, being generally smaller in years in which there was a relative higher frequency of dominant lineage. Vaccine-like sequences comprised about one fourth of sequences obtained through routine monitoring of PRRS. We found that lineage 5 sequences were mostly Ingelvac PRRS MLV-like. Lineage 8 sequences up to 2011 were 62.9% Ingelvac PRRS ATP-like while the remaining were wild-type viruses. From 2012 onwards, 51.9% of lineage 8 sequences were Ingelvac PRRS ATP-like, 45.0% were Fostera PRRS-like, and only 3.2% were wild-type. For lineage 1 sequences, 0.1% and 1.7% of the sequences were Prevacent PRRS-like in 2009-2018 and 2019, respectively. These results suggest that repeated introductions of vaccine-like viruses through use of modified live vaccines might decrease within-lineage viral diversity as vaccine-like strains become more prevalent. Overall, this compilation of private data from routine monitoring provides valuable information on PRRSV viral diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4226278375,"OTUB1 is one of the most highly expressed deubiquitinases, counter-regulating the two most abundant ubiquitin chain types. OTUB1 expression is linked to the development and progression of lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in humans. However, the physiological function of OTUB1 is unknown. Here, we show that constitutive whole-body Otub1 deletion in mice leads to perinatal lethality by asphyxiation. Analysis of (single-cell) RNA sequencing and proteome data demonstrated that OTUB1 is expressed in all lung cell types with a particularly high expression during late-stage lung development (E16.5, E18.5). At E18.5, the lungs of animals with Otub1 deletion presented with increased cell proliferation that decreased saccular air space and prevented inhalation. Flow cytometry-based analysis of E18.5 lung tissue revealed that Otub1 deletion increased proliferation of major lung parenchymal and mesenchymal/other non-hematopoietic cell types. Adult mice with conditional whole-body Otub1 deletion (wbOtub1del/del ) also displayed increased lung cell proliferation in addition to hyperventilation and failure to adapt the respiratory pattern to hypoxia. On the molecular level, Otub1 deletion enhanced mTOR signaling in embryonic and adult lung tissues. Based on these results, we propose that OTUB1 is a negative regulator of mTOR signaling with essential functions for lung cell proliferation, lung development, adult lung tissue homeostasis, and respiratory regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3211665542,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence occurs in approximately 25% of the patients undergoing cryoballoon ablation (CBA), leading to repeated ablations and complications. Left atrial (LA) dilation has been proposed as a predictor of AF recurrence. However, LA strain is a surrogate marker of LA mechanical dysfunction, which might appear before the enlargement of the LA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the additional predictive value of LA function assessed using strain echocardiography for AF recurrence after CBA.172 consecutive patients (62.2 ± 12.2 years, 61% male) were prospectively analyzed. Echocardiography was performed before CBA. Blanking period was defined as the first three months post-ablation. The primary endpoint was AF recurrence after the blanking period.50 (29%) patients had AF recurrence. In the overall study population, peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) ≤ 17% had the highest incremental predictive value for AF recurrence (HR = 9.45, 95%CI: 3.17-28.13, p < 0.001). In patients with non-dilated LA, PALS≤17% remained an independent predictor of AF recurrence (HR = 5.39, 95%CI: 1.66-17.52, p = 0.005).This study showed that LA function assessed by PALS provided an additional predictive value for AF recurrence after CBA, over LA enlargement. In patients with non-dilated LA, PALS also predicted AF recurrence. These findings emphasize the added value of LA strain, suggesting that it should be implemented in the systematic evaluation of AF patients before CBA."
https://openalex.org/W3212357480,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in lymphopenic patients. Pulmonary macrophages comprise the first line of host defense upon inhalation of fungal spores by aiding in clearance but can also potentially serve as a niche for their dissemination. Given that macrophages play a key role in the outcome of a cryptococcal infection, it is crucial to understand factors that mediate phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Since lipid rafts (high-order plasma membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin [SM]) have been implicated in facilitating phagocytosis, we evaluated whether these ordered domains govern macrophages' ability to phagocytose C. neoformans. We found that cholesterol or SM depletion resulted in significantly deficient immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated phagocytosis of fungus. Moreover, repletion of macrophage cells with a raft-promoting sterol (7-dehydrocholesterol) rescued this phagocytic deficiency, whereas a raft-inhibiting sterol (coprostanol) significantly decreased IgG-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Using a photoswitchable SM (AzoSM), we observed that the raft-promoting conformation (trans-AzoSM) resulted in efficient phagocytosis, whereas the raft-inhibiting conformation (cis-AzoSM) significantly but reversibly blunted phagocytosis. We observed that the effect on phagocytosis may be facilitated by Fcγ receptor (FcγR) function, whereby IgG immune complexes crosslink to FcγRIII, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-subunit (FcRγ), an important accessory protein in the FcγR signaling cascade. Correspondingly, cholesterol or SM depletion resulted in decreased FcRγ phosphorylation. Repletion with 7-dehydrocholesterol restored phosphorylation, whereas repletion with coprostanol showed FcRγ phosphorylation comparable to unstimulated cells. Together, these data suggest that lipid rafts are critical for facilitating FcγRIII-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans.

Pulmonary macrophages comprise the first line of host defense in response to C. neoformans, as infection begins with inhalation of fungal spores commonly found in urban environments. A healthy host can typically kill and clear the pathogen.

Given that macrophages can determine the outcome of a cryptococcal infection, it is crucial to understand the factors that mediate phagocytosis of C. neoformans, a major function of macrophages. Phagocytosis is a process by which extracellular entities are internalized by phagocytic cells. It is a key weapon in the immune system's arsenal to defend against pathogens, but the process may often be subverted by pathogens to allow for internalization and dissemination throughout the body (18Sarantis H. Grinstein S. Subversion of phagocytosis for pathogen survival.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12: 419-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis is mediated by several signaling events that result in attachment and engulfment via rearrangements of the host cell's cytoskeleton. “Professional” phagocytes are able to recognize and bind to opsonins on the surface of the invading pathogen to signal for attachment and the formation of lamellipodia, which engulf the pathogen and form a phagosome (2Eisenman H.C. Casadevall A. McClelland E.E. New insights on the pathogenesis of invasive Cryptococcus neoformans infection.Curr. Infect. Dis. Rep. 2007; 9: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Macrophages are highly specialized cells that carry out protective functions that include seeking out and eliminating disease-causing agents, repairing damaged tissues, and mediating inflammation, most of these through the process of phagocytosis (18Sarantis H.

Previous work in other pathogen systems point to lipid rafts formed by cholesterol and sphingomyelin (SM) as having an important role to play in phagocytosis (20Rao M. Peachman K.K. Alving C.R.

In fact, a recent study implicated lipid rafts in the phagocytic response to Aspergillus fumigatus, another opportunistic fungal pathogen (27Schmidt F. Thywissen A. Goldmann M. Cunha C. Cseresnyes Z.

Cholesterol is the single most abundant lipid species in mammalian plasma membranes, comprising 25 to 50% of the cell membrane lipid content (28Crane J.M. Tamm L.K. Role of cholesterol in the formation and nature of lipid rafts in planar and spherical model membranes.Biophysical J. 2004; 86: 2965-2979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It has been found to play a role in modulating the biophysical properties of membranes by changing their rigidity (29Brown D.A. London E. Functions of lipid rafts in biological membranes.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and sphingolipids together form lipid microdomains within the membrane known as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts have been found to be involved in the formation of caveolae as well as activation of various signaling cascades, whereby domains favor specific protein–protein interactions (28Crane J.M.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1099-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Given their small size, it is difficult to study lipid rafts in vivo. One useful way to study the role of lipid rafts is to alter their constituents. Cyclodextrins and sphingomyelinase have been found to deplete, replace, or alter lipids from host mammalian membranes and are commonly used to study the role of lipid rafts (30Simons K. Toomre D.

Phospholipid exchange shows insulin receptor activity is supported by both the propensity to form wide bilayers and ordered raft domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297Google Scholar). In this study, several approaches were employed to alter cholesterol or SM on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane to examine how lipid rafts may play a role in phagocytosis of C. neoformans. We found that cholesterol and SM are critical for immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Moreover, repletion with domain-promoting sterols like cholesterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol promoted efficient antibody-mediated phagocytosis of the fungal cells, whereas domain-inhibiting sterols like coprostanol significantly reduced it. Using a photoswitchable SM (AzoSM), we observed that the raft-promoting conformation (trans-AzoSM) resulted in efficient phagocytosis whereas raft-inhibiting conformation (cis-AzoSM) significantly blunted phagocytosis in a reversible manner. Mechanistically, we found that cholesterol and SM-enriched ordered domains may be important for the function of Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), the class of immune receptors activated by IgG immune complexes (IgGICs). These findings provide more directed insights into the role of cholesterol- and SM-rich lipid rafts in mediating FcγR activation and IgG-dependent phagocytosis of C. neoformans. To investigate the role of cholesterol in phagocytosis of the fungal pathogen C. neoformans, we utilized methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to deplete cholesterol from the membrane of murine macrophages prior to infection with antibody-opsonized C. neoformans (38Bryan A.M. Farnoud A.M. Mor V. Del Poeta M. Macrophage cholesterol depletion and its effect on the phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; https://doi.org/10.3791/52432Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We previously showed that treatment with 10 mM or 30 mM MβCD depletes approximately 50% or 75% of the total cholesterol in the cells, respectively (38Bryan A.M. Farnoud A.M. Mor V. Del Poeta M. Macrophage cholesterol depletion and its effect on the phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; https://doi.org/10.3791/52432Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MβCD treatment did not significantly alter cell attachment or viability (38Bryan A.M. Farnoud A.M. Mor V. Del Poeta M. Macrophage cholesterol depletion and its effect on the phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; https://doi.org/10.3791/52432Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Most importantly, cholesterol depletion resulted in a significant decrease in antibody-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans (38Bryan A.M. Farnoud A.M. Mor V. Del Poeta M. Macrophage cholesterol depletion and its effect on the phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; https://doi.org/10.3791/52432Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This finding was recapitulated across two murine macrophage cell lines. Both alveolar (Fig. 1A) and peritoneally derived macrophages (J774.1; Fig. S1A) showed significant deficiency in phagocytosing C. neoformans cells opsonized with an anti-glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) IgG, an antibody specific to the cryptococcal capsule (39Casadevall A. Cleare W. Feldmesser M. Glatman-Freedman A. Goldman D.L. Kozel T.R. Lendvai N. Mukherjee J. Pirofski L.A. Rivera J. Rosas A.L. Scharff M.D. Valadon P. Westin K. Zhong Z.J. Characterization of a murine monoclonal antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans polysaccharide that is a candidate for human therapeutic studies.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When C. neoformans cells were instead opsonized with complement serum, phagocytosis was not affected (Fig. 1C). Given the collaborative role of cholesterol and SM in lipid rafts, we examined the effect of depleting SM on the plasma membrane of macrophages. One tool available for the study of SM is recombinant bacterial sphingomyelinase (bSMase) which directly probes for the role of SM on the plasma membrane, as the enzyme is too large to pass through the membrane (40Canals D. Jenkins R.W. Roddy P. Hernandez-Corbacho M.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Differential effects of ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate on ERM phosphorylation PROBING sphingolipid signaling at the outer plasma membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32476-32485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). bSMase catalyzes the transformation of SM into ceramide (Fig. S2) and phosphorylcholine (40Canals D. Jenkins R.W. Roddy P. Hernandez-Corbacho M.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 32476-32485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To confirm SM depletion, cellular lipids were analyzed following treatment with 250 mU/ml or 500 mU/ml bSMase for 20 min. We found that treatment of macrophages with bSMase resulted in a significant decrease in C16 SM, the most abundant SM species detected in the cells, and a corresponding increase in C16 ceramide (Fig. 2). To assess the effect of bSMase treatment on phagocytosis, cells were coincubated with C. neoformans cells opsonized with anti-GXM IgG after bSMase treatment. We found a significant decrease in phagocytosis after bSMase treatment with both alveolar (MH-S; Fig. 1B) and peritoneally derived macrophages (J774.1; Fig. S1B), albeit in a non–dose-dependent fashion. This effect was not observed when complement serum was used as an opsonin (Fig. 1C). Together, these data suggest that cholesterol and SM are critical for IgG-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Moreover, our data suggest that this phenomenon is not cell line dependent. Given that multiple factors confound the use of MβCD to deplete cholesterol from cell membranes, various sterols were added back into the cholesterol-depleted macrophages to investigate the role of cholesterol in IgG-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans. MβCD may remove cholesterol from both raft and nonraft domains, alter the distribution of cholesterol between plasma and intracellular membranes, and nonspecifically extract phospholipids (41Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Use of cyclodextrins to manipulate plasma membrane cholesterol content: Evidence, misconceptions and control strategies.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether cholesterol sensitivity of IgG-dependent phagocytosis of C. neoformans could be attributed to lipid rafts, cholesterol-depleted macrophages were repleted with cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, or coprostanol (Fig. S2). 7-dehydrocholesterol has been shown to be significantly more domain promoting than cholesterol, whereas coprostanol strongly inhibits domain formation (36Li G. Wang Q. Kakuda S. London E. Nanodomains can persist at physiologic temperature in plasma membrane vesicles and be modulated by altering cell lipids.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We found that repletion with 0.2 mM cholesterol in 2.5 mM MβCD resulted in a significant increase in total cellular cholesterol compared with the untreated control. On the other hand, repletion with 0.2 mM 7-dehydrocholesterol or 0.2 mM coprostanol in 2.5 mM MβCD resulted in a significant decrease in cellular cholesterol and a marked increase in substituted sterol comparable to the cellular cholesterol for the untreated control (Fig. 3A). When treated macrophages were coincubated with C. neoformans cells opsonized with anti-GXM IgG, we found that we were able to restore phagocytosis by cholesterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol repletion, whereas coprostanol repletion did not restore phagocytosis (Fig. 3B). To assess how sterol depletion/repletion may affect lipid raft stability in macrophages, we evaluated ordered nanodomains (rafts) in giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) derived from macrophages through FRET. When rafts are present, FRET donor and FRET acceptor become partially segregated in different (raft and nonraft) domains, and FRET decreases so the FRET donor is more fluorescent (i.e., F/F0 increases) As previously, we used the temperature at which the value of F/F0 is a minimum as an approximate temperature for the upper limit of when rafts were present, that is, a measure of their thermal stability (36Li G. Wang Q. Kakuda S. London E. Nanodomains can persist at physiologic temperature in plasma membrane vesicles and be modulated by altering cell lipids.J. Lipid Res. 2020; 61: 758-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We also used the total increase in F/F0 relative to the value at which F/F0 is a minimum in a sample as another rough measure of total raft formation over the entire temperature range. GPMVs prepared from cholesterol-depleted macrophages showed a significant shift in nanodomain stability (Fig. 4A and Table S1, raw unnormalized F/F0 values for FRET data are shown in Fig. S3A). The presence of detectable ordered nanodomains significantly decreased, with up to 20 °C decrease in Tend, the temperature at which ordered domains are completely melted (36Li G. Wang Q. Kakuda S. London E. Nanodomains can persist at physiologic temperature in plasma membrane vesicles and be modulated by altering cell lipids.J. Lipid Res. 2020; 61: 758-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Upon repletion with cholesterol, detectable ordered nanodomains significantly increased compared with the untreated and cholesterol-depleted macrophages with a corresponding recovery in Tend. As expected, repletion with 7-dehydrocholesterol resulted in significantly greater presence of detectable nanodomains as well as increased thermal stability (higher Tend compared with untreated control). On the other hand, repletion with coprostanol ablated both the presence of detectable ordered nanodomains and the GPMV thermal stability (Fig. 4B and Table S1; raw unnormalized F/F0 values for FRET data are shown in Fig. S3B). To ascertain whether SM depletion alters lipid raft stability in macrophages, we also evaluated nanodomain stability in GPMVs derived from bSMase-treated macrophages. We found that neither 250 nor 500 mU/ml bSMase treatment altered nanodomain stability, with Tend and GPMV levels comparable to the untreated control (Fig. S4 and Table S1; raw unnormalized F/F0 values for FRET data are shown in Fig. S4C). It should be noted that the lipid product of bSMase digestion, ceramide, is itself a raft-forming lipid but one that alters the lipid composition (e.g., resulting in displacement of cholesterol from rafts) and properties of lipid rafts (44Megha London E. Ceramide selectively displaces cholesterol from ordered lipid domains (rafts): Implications for lipid raft structure and function.J. Biol.

Together, these results not only suggest that the presence of ordered lipid domains mediate IgG-dependent phagocytosis of C. neoformans but that lipid domain stability is cholesterol dependent. Enhanced GFP (EGFP)-nakanori is a protein that labels cell surface domains in an SM-dependent and cholesterol-dependent manner. More specifically, nakanori only binds pre-existing SM/cholesterol domains as it is unable to induce formation of SM–cholesterol complexes (46Makino A. Abe M. Ishitsuka R. Murate M. Kishimoto T.

https://openalex.org/W3214384854,"Delirium is the most common central nervous system complication after surgery. Detection of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit in the serum reflects axonal damage within the central cervous system and is associated with the severity of postoperative delirium. Neuron-specific enolase and S100 calcium-binding protein β have been identified as possible serum biomarkers of postoperative delirium. This study examined the association of the levels of these markers with incidence of postoperative delirium and detection of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit.This study represents a post hoc analysis of 117 patients who participated in a prospective observational study of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Patients were clinically assessed for development of postoperative delirium within the first five days of surgery. Serum levels of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit, neuron-specific enolase, and S100 calcium-binding protein β levels were measured on postoperative day 3.Forty-one patients (35%) were clinically diagnosed with postoperative delirium. Neuron-specific enolase level (P < 0.0001) and the proportion of patients positive for phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit (P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in the group of patients with postoperative delirium. Neuron-specific enolase level discriminated between patients with and without clinically diagnosed postoperative delirium with significantly high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.95; P < 0.0001). Neuron-specific enolase level was associated with incidence of postoperative delirium independently of age (adjusted odds ratio, 8.291; 95% Cl, 3.506-33.286; P < 0.0001). The AUC for the serum neuron-specific enolase level in detecting phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit was significant (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.90; P < 0.0001).Elevated serum neuron-specific enolase was associated with postoperative delirium independent of age as well as detection of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit in serum. Serum neuron-specific enolase and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit might be useful as biomarkers of postoperative delirium.University Medical Information Network (UMIN) trial ID: UMIN000010329; https://clinicaltrials.gov/."

This study aimed to exam the performance of innovative biomarkers for AR positive TNBC in diagnosis and therapies. Four datasets (GSE42568, GSE45827, GSE54002 and GSE76124) were analyzed by bioinformatic methods and the differential expression genes (DEGs) between the AR positive TNBC tissues and normal tissues were firstly identified by limma package and Venn diagrams. Next, Gene Ontologies (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed to explore the relationship between these DEGs. Then, the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. CytoHubba and bioinformatic approaches including Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter and The Human Pro-tein Atlas (THPA) were used to identify the hub genes. Lastly, a miRNA-hub-gene regulatory axis was constructed by use of Target Scan database and ENCORI database. As a result, a total of 390 common DEGs were identified, including 250 up-regulated and 140 down-regulated. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated DEGs were mostly enriched in the cell division, mitotic nuclear division, nucleosome, midbody, protein heterodimerization activity, cadherin binding involved in cell-cell adhesion, systemic lupus erythematosus and alcoholism, while the down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in carbohydrate metabolic process, extracellular space, extracellular region, zinc ion binding and microRNAs in cancer. Then, 13 hub genes (CCNB2, FOXM1, HMMR, MAD2L1, RRM2, TPX2, TYMS, CEP55, AURKA, CCNB1, CDK1, TOP2A, PBK) were selected. The survival analysis revealed that only CCNB1 was associated with significantly poor survival (P <0.05) in TNBC patients. Finally, we found that hsa-miR-3163 took part in the regulation of CCNB1 and constructed a potential hsa-miR-3163-CCNB1 regulatory axis. The results of current study suggest that CCNB1 and hsa-miR-3163 may serve as highly potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for AR positive TNBC. Our findings may make contributions to the diagnosis and therapies of AR positive TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W3211582173,"China is vulnerable to zoonotic disease transmission due to a large agricultural work force, sizable domestic livestock population, and a highly biodiverse ecology. To better address this threat, representatives from the human, animal, and environmental health sectors in China held a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) workshop in May 2019 to develop a list of priority zoonotic diseases for multisectoral, One Health collaboration.Representatives used the OHZDP Process, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), to prioritize zoonotic diseases for China. Representatives defined the criteria used for prioritization and determined questions and weights for each individual criterion. A review of English and Chinese literature was conducted prior to the workshop to collect disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from China and the Western Pacific Region for zoonotic diseases considered for prioritization.Thirty zoonotic diseases were evaluated for prioritization. Criteria selected included: 1) disease hazard/severity (case fatality rate) in humans, 2) epidemic scale and intensity (in humans and animals) in China, 3) economic impact, 4) prevention and control, and 5) social impact. Disease specific information was obtained from 792 articles (637 in English and 155 in Chinese) and subject matter experts for the prioritization process. Following discussion of the OHZDP Tool output among disease experts, five priority zoonotic diseases were identified for China: avian influenza, echinococcosis, rabies, plague, and brucellosis.Representatives agreed on a list of five priority zoonotic diseases that can serve as a foundation to strengthen One Health collaboration for disease prevention and control in China; this list was developed prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps focused on establishing a multisectoral, One Health coordination mechanism, improving multisectoral linkages in laboratory testing and surveillance platforms, creating multisectoral preparedness and response plans, and increasing workforce capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3212634593,"The interrelationship between wasting and stunting has been poorly investigated. We assessed the association between two indicators of linear growth, height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) change and occurrence of accelerated linear growth, and selected indicators of wasting and wasting reversal in 5,172 Cambodian children aged less than 24 months at enrolment in the 'MyHealth' study. The specific objectives were to evaluate the relationship between temporal changes in wasting and 1) change in HAZ and 2) episodes of accelerated linear growth. At enrolment, the stunting and wasting prevalence were 22.2 (21.0;23.3) % and 9.1 (8.1;10.1) %, respectively, and reached 41.4 (39.3;43.6) %, and 12.4 (11.5;13.3) % respectively, two years later. Between 14-19% of stunted children were also wasted throughout the whole study period. For each centimetre increase in Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) from the previous assessment, the HAZ increased by 0.162 (0.150; 0.174) Z-score. We also observed a delayed positive association between the weight for height Z score (WHZ) unit increase and HAZ change of +0.10 to +0.22 units consistent with a positive relationship between linear growth and an increase in WHZ occurring with a lag of approximately three months. A similar positive correlation was observed for the occurrence of an episode of accelerated linear growth. These results show that interventions to prevent and treat wasting can contribute to stunting reduction and call for integrated wasting and stunting programming."
https://openalex.org/W3211504727,"Neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy and autism have been linked to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition (E/I) in the central nervous system. The simplicity and tractability of C . elegans allows our electroconvulsive seizure (ES) assay to be used as a behavioral readout of the locomotor circuit and neuronal function. C . elegans possess conserved nervous system features such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA receptors in inhibitory neurotransmission, and acetylcholine (Ach) and acetylcholine receptors in excitatory neurotransmission. Our previously published data has shown that decreasing inhibition in the motor circuit, via GABAergic manipulation, will extend the time of locomotor recovery following electroshock. Similarly, mutations in a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase called EEL-1 leads to impaired GABAergic transmission, E/I imbalance and altered sensitivity to electroshock. Mutations in the human ortholog of EEL-1, called HUWE1, are associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability. Both EEL-1 and its previously established binding protein, OGT-1, are expressed in GABAergic motor neurons, localize to GABAergic presynaptic terminals, and function in parallel to regulate GABA neuron function. In this study, we tested behavioral responses to electroshock in wildtype, ogt-1 , eel-1 and ogt-1; eel-1 double mutants. Both ogt-1 and eel-1 null mutants have decreased inhibitory GABAergic neuron function and increased electroshock sensitivity. Consistent with EEL-1 and OGT-1 functioning in parallel pathways, ogt-1; eel-1 double mutants showed enhanced electroshock susceptibility. Expression of OGT-1 in the C . elegans nervous system rescued enhanced electroshock defects in ogt-1; eel-1 double mutants. Application of a GABA agonist, Baclofen, decreased electroshock susceptibility in all animals. Our C . elegans electroconvulsive seizure assay was the first to model a human X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) associated with epilepsy and suggests a potential novel role for the OGT-1/EEL-1 complex in seizure susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W3211532988,"SARM1 is a toll/interleukin-1 receptor -domain containing protein, with roles proposed in both innate immunity and neuronal degeneration. Murine SARM1 has been reported to regulate the transcription of chemokines in both neurons and macrophages; however, the extent to which SARM1 contributes to transcription regulation remains to be fully understood. Here, we identify differential gene expression in bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from C57BL/6 congenic 129 ES cell-derived Sarm1-/- mice compared with wild type (WT). However, we found that passenger genes, which are derived from the 129 donor strain of mice that flank the Sarm1 locus, confound interpretation of the results, since many of the identified differentially regulated genes come from this region. To re-examine the transcriptional role of SARM1 in the absence of passenger genes, here we generated three Sarm1-/- mice using CRISPR/Cas9. Treatment of neurons from these mice with vincristine, a chemotherapeutic drug causing axonal degeneration, confirmed SARM1's function in that process; however, these mice also showed that lack of SARM1 has no impact on transcription of genes previously shown to be affected such as chemokines. To gain further insight into SARM1 function, we generated an epitope-tagged SARM1 mouse. In these mice, we observed high SARM1 protein expression in the brain and brainstem and lower but detectable levels in macrophages. Overall, the generation of these SARM1 knockout and epitope-tagged mice has clarified that SARM1 is expressed in mouse macrophages yet has no general role in macrophage transcriptional regulation and has provided important new models to further explore SARM1 function."
https://openalex.org/W3212423742,"Background The relationship between COVID-19 and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) has been shown during different phases of the first pandemic wave, but little is known about how to predict where cardiac arrests will increase in case of a third peak. Aim To seek for a correlation between the OHCAs and COVID-19 daily incidence both during the two pandemic waves at a provincial level. Methods We considered all the OHCAs occurred in the provinces of Pavia, Lodi, Cremona, Mantua and Varese, in Lombardy Region (Italy), from 21/02/2020 to 31/12/2020. We divided the study period into period 1, the first 157 days after the outbreak and including the first pandemic wave and period 2, the second 158 days including the second pandemic wave. We calculated the cumulative and daily incidence of OHCA and COVID-19 for the whole territory and for each province for both periods. Results A significant correlation between the daily incidence of COVID-19 and the daily incidence of OHCAs was observed both during the first and the second pandemic period in the whole territory (R = 0.4, p&lt;0.001 for period 1 and 2) and only in those provinces with higher COVID-19 cumulative incidence (period 1: Cremona R = 0.3, p = 0.001; Lodi R = 0.4, p&lt;0.001; Pavia R = 0.3; p = 0.01; period 2: Varese R = 0.4, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Our results suggest that strictly monitoring the pandemic trend may help in predict which territories will be more likely to experience an OHCAs’ increase. That may also serve as a guide to re-allocate properly health resources in case of further pandemic waves."
https://openalex.org/W3212616316,"Ceramide is a lipid molecule that regulates diverse physiological and pathological reactions in part through inverting the topology of certain transmembrane proteins. This topological inversion is achieved through regulated alternative translocation (RAT), which reverses the direction by which membrane proteins are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum during translation. However, owing to technical challenges in studying protein–ceramide interaction, it remains unclear how ceramide levels are sensed in cells to trigger RAT. Here, we report the synthesis of pac-C<sub>7</sub>-Cer, a photoactivatable and clickable short-chain ceramide analog that can be used as a probe to study protein–ceramide interactions. We demonstrate that translocating chain-associated membrane protein 2 (TRAM2), a protein known to control RAT of transmembrane 4 L6 subfamily member 20, and TRAM1, a homolog of TRAM2, interacted with molecules derived from pac-C<sub>7</sub>-Cer. This interaction was competed by naturally existing long-chain ceramide molecules. We showed that binding of ceramide and its analogs to TRAM2 correlated with their ability to induce RAT of transmembrane 4 L6 subfamily member 20. In addition to probing ceramide–TRAM interactions, we provide evidence that pac-C<sub>7</sub>-cer could be used for proteome-wide identification of ceramide-binding proteins. Our study provides mechanistic insights into RAT by identifying TRAMs as potential ceramide-binding proteins and establishes pac-C<sub>7</sub>-Cer as a valuable tool for future study of ceramide–protein interactions."

Between 12% and 25% of people diagnosed with TB are never linked to a primary health care facility for continued care. The TB health program is for creating processes that promote and facilitates easy access to care. We explored how TB patients experience TB services and how this influenced their choices around linkage to TB care and treatment.We enrolled 20 participants routinely diagnosed with TB in hospital or at primary health care facilities (PHC) in a high TB/HIV burdened peri-urban community in South Africa. Using the Western Cape Provincial Health Data centre (PHDC) which consolidates person-level clinical data, we used dates of diagnosis and treatment initiation to select participants who had been linked (immediately, after a delay, or never). Between June 2019 and January 2020, we facilitated in-depth discussions to explore both the participants' experience of their TB diagnosis and their journey around linking to TB care at a primary health care facility. We analysed the data using case descriptions.Twelve of twenty (12/20) participants interviewed who experienced a delay linking were diagnosed at the hospital. Participants who experienced delays in linking or never linked explained this as a result of lack of information and support from health care providers. Unpleasant previous TB treatment episodes made it difficult to 'face' TB again and being uncertain of their TB diagnosis. In contrast, participants said the main motivator for linking was a personal will to get better.The health care system, especially in hospitals, should focus on strengthening patient-centred care. Communication and clear messaging on TB processes is key, to prepare patients in transitioning from a hospital setting to PHC facilities for continuation of care. This should not just include a thorough explanation of their TB diagnosis but ensure that patients understand treatment processes. Former TB patients may require additional counselling and support to re-engage in care."
https://openalex.org/W3212753373,"To assess the reproducibility and clinical utility of clustering-based subtyping of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular (CV) disease.The cardiovascular outcome trial SAVOR-TIMI 53 (n = 16,492) was used. Analyses focused on T2D patients with established CV disease. Unsupervised machine learning technique called ""k-means clustering"" was used to divide patients into subtypes. K-means clustering including HbA1c, age of diagnosis, BMI, HOMA2-IR and HOMA2-B was used to assign clusters to the following diabetes subtypes: severe insulin deficient diabetes (SIDD); severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD); mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD); mild age-related diabetes (MARD). We refer these subtypes as ""clustering-based diabetes subtypes"". A simulation study using randomly generated data was conducted to understand how correlations between the above variables influence the formation of the cluster-based diabetes subtypes. The predictive utility of clustering-based diabetes subtypes for CV events (3-point MACE), renal function reduction (eGFR decrease >30%) and diabetic disease progression (introduction of additional anti-diabetic medication) were compared with conventional risk scores. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Cox-proportional hazard models.In the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial based dataset, the percentage of the clustering-based T2D subtypes were; SIDD (18%), SIRD (17%), MOD (29%), MARD (37%). Using the simulated dataset, the diabetes subtypes could be largely reproduced from a log-normal distribution when including known correlations between variables. The predictive utility of clustering-based diabetic subtypes on CV events, renal function reduction, and diabetic disease progression did not show an advantage compared to conventional risk scores.The consistent reproduction of four clustering-based T2D subtypes can be explained by the correlations between the variables used for clustering. Subtypes of T2D based on clustering had limited advantage compared to conventional risk scores to predict clinical outcome in patients with T2D and established CV disease."
https://openalex.org/W3213350016,"Bovine papillomaviruses types 1 and 2 (BPV1, BPV2) commonly induce skin tumours termed sarcoids in horses and other equids. Sarcoids seriously compromise the health and welfare of affected individuals due to their propensity to resist treatment and reoccur in a more severe form. We have developed influenza (Flu) A and B virus vectors that harbour a truncated NS1 gene (iNS) assuring interferon induction and co-express shuffled BPV1 E6 and E7 antigens for sarcoid immunotherapy. In a safety trial involving 12 healthy horses, intradermal administration of iNSA/E6E7equ and iNSB/E6E7equ was well tolerated, with the only transient side effect being mild fever in four horses. Repeated screening of secretions and faeces by RT-PCR and plaque assay revealed no virus shedding, thus also confirming biological safety. In a patient trial involving 29 horses bearing BPV1-induced single or multiple sarcoids, at least one lesion per horse was intratumourally injected and then boosted with iNSA/E6E7equ and/or iNSB/E6E7equ. The treatment induced a systemic antitumour response as reflected by the synchronous regression of injected and non-injected lesions. Irrespective of vaccination schemes, complete tumour regression was achieved in 10/29 horses. In 10/29 horses, regression is still ongoing (May 2021). Intriguingly, scrapings collected from former tumour sites in two patients tested negative by BPV1 PCR. Nine severely affected individuals with a history of unsuccessful therapeutic attempts did not (6/29) or only transiently (3/29) respond to the treatment. INSA/E6E7equ and iNSB/E6E7equ proved safe and effective in significantly reducing the tumour burden even in severe cases."

For this species, creation of a core collection is critical for future ecological and evolutionary studies, efficient economic utilization, and development and management of the broader collection of its germplasm resources. In this study, we sampled 158 accessions of P. sibirica from Russia and China using 30 pair of simple sequence repeat molecular markers and 30 different schemes to identify candidate core collections. The 30 schemes were based on combinations of two different sampling strategies, three genetic distances, and five different sample sizes of the complete germplasm resource. We determined the optimal core collection from among the 30 results based on maximization of genetic diversity among groups according to Number of observed alleles (Na), Number of effective alleles (Ne), Shannon's information index (I), Polymorphic information content (PIC), Nei gene diversity (H) and compared to the initial collection of 158 accessions. We found that the optimal core collection resulted from preferred sampling at 25% with Nei & Li genetic distance these ratios of Na, Ne, I, PIC and H to the complete 158 germplasm resources were 73.0%, 113%, 102%, 100% and 103%, respectively, indicating that the core collection comprised a robust representation of genetic diversity in P. sibirica. The proposed core collection will be valuable for future molecular breeding of this species and management of its germplasm resources."
https://openalex.org/W3211516705,"Social mobility and physical restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have posed a severe challenge to operate under conventional nine to five work practices in a physical office setting. As a coping strategy for the survival of business, economy, and livelihoods, certain organisations were compelled to transform to virtual office platforms. This was a sudden transformation of work practices and consequently, impacting with mixed outcomes on lifestyles of workers. Given that very limited studies have shed light into the context, this study contributes immensely to fill research gap. The main objective of this study is to identify the impact of the virtual office platform on work-life balance in the Sri Lankan context. The methodology adopted for this study is quantitative. An online questionnaire to collect data was primarily distributed to employees in the virtual platform. Analysis of this study is based on three regression models and results ascertain that both working and non-working environments have highly significant impact on the work-life balance, although non-working environment has a bigger influence on work balance (Gender and no of children). Findings are useful and unique, enabling both employers and employees to adopt a focused approach to maximize the potential of virtual platforms to enhance employee well-being so that mutual benefits can be materialized."
https://openalex.org/W3212053117,"The N-terminal region (NTR) of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels is critical for the regulation of Ca2+ release during excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in muscle. The NTR hosts numerous mutations linked to skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) myopathies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Here, we constructed two biosensors by labeling the mouse RyR2 NTR at domains A, B, and C with FRET pairs. Using fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection of intramolecular FRET signal, we developed high-throughput screening (HTS) assays with these biosensors to identify small-molecule RyR modulators. We then screened a small validation library and identified several hits. Hits with saturable FRET dose-response profiles and previously unreported effects on RyR were further tested using [3H]ryanodine binding to isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles to determine effects on intact RyR opening in its natural membrane. We identified three novel inhibitors of both RyR1 and RyR2 and two RyR1-selective inhibitors effective at nanomolar Ca2+. Two of these hits activated RyR1 only at micromolar Ca2+, highlighting them as potential enhancers of excitation-contraction coupling. To determine whether such hits can inhibit RyR leak in muscle, we further focused on one, an FDA-approved natural antibiotic, fusidic acid (FA). In skinned skeletal myofibers and permeabilized cardiomyocytes, FA inhibited RyR leak with no detrimental effect on skeletal myofiber excitation-contraction coupling. However, in intact cardiomyocytes, FA induced arrhythmogenic Ca2+ transients, a cautionary observation for a compound with an otherwise solid safety record. These results indicate that HTS campaigns using the NTR biosensor can identify compounds with therapeutic potential."

We surveyed top-tier football clubs in the four countries and interviewed representatives from football clubs and the clubs' charitable foundation who delivered EuroFIT. The findings showed large between-country differences, with football clubs in England reporting far greater healthy lifestyle provision than other countries. Relatively few health-promotion programmes targeted adults, particularly in the Netherlands, Portugal, and Norway. Club representatives reported that the motives for adopting the EuroFIT programme often involved adhering to both the social objectives of the football club or club's foundation and business-related objectives. They viewed the scientific evidence and evaluation underpinning EuroFIT as helpful in demonstrating the value and potential future impact of both the programme and the clubs' wider corporate social responsibility provision."

This study aims to introduce cluster analysis, unsupervised machine learning method, for classification of three-dimensional (3D) mandibular canal (MC) courses, and to visualize standard MC courses derived from cluster analysis in the Korean population.A total of 429 cone-beam computed tomography images were used. Four sites in the mandible were selected for the measurement of the MC course and four parameters, two vertical and two horizontal parameters were measured per site. Cluster analysis was carried out as follows: parameter measurement, parameter normalization, cluster tendency evaluation, optimal number of clusters determination, and k-means cluster analysis. The 3D MC courses were classified into three types with statistically significant mean differences by cluster analysis.Cluster 1 showed a smooth line running towards the lingual side in the axial view and a steep slope in the sagittal view. Cluster 2 ran in an almost straight line closest to the lingual and inferior border of mandible. Cluster 3 showed the pathway with a bent buccally in the axial view and an increasing slope in the sagittal view in the posterior area. Cluster 2 showed the highest distribution (42.1%), and males were more widely distributed (57.1%) than the females (42.9%). Cluster 3 comprised similar ratio of male and female cases and accounted for 31.9% of the total distribution. Cluster 1 had the least distribution (26.0%) Distributions of the right and left sides did not show a statistically significant difference.The MC courses were automatically classified as three types through cluster analysis. Cluster analysis enables the unbiased classification of the anatomical structures by reducing observer variability and can present representative standard information for each classified group."
https://openalex.org/W3212371276,"Signals from retinal photoreceptors are processed in two parallel channels-the ON channel responds to light increments, while the OFF channel responds to light decrements. The ON pathway is mediated by ON type bipolar cells (BCs), which receive glutamatergic synaptic input from photoreceptors via a G-protein-coupled receptor signaling cascade. The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6 is located at the dendritic tips of all ON-BCs and is required for synaptic transmission. Thus, it is critically important for delivery of information from photoreceptors into the ON pathway. In addition to detecting glutamate, mGluR6 participates in interactions with other postsynaptic proteins, as well as trans-synaptic interactions with presynaptic ELFN proteins. Mechanisms of mGluR6 synaptic targeting and functional interaction with other synaptic proteins are unknown. Here, we show that multiple regions in the mGluR6 ligand-binding domain are necessary for both synaptic localization in BCs and ELFN1 binding in vitro. However, these regions were not required for plasma membrane localization in heterologous cells, indicating that secretory trafficking and synaptic localization are controlled by different mechanisms. In contrast, the mGluR6 C-terminus was dispensable for synaptic localization. In mGluR6 null mice, localization of the postsynaptic channel protein TRPM1 was compromised. Introducing WT mGluR6 rescued TRPM1 localization, while a C-terminal deletion mutant had significantly reduced rescue ability. We propose a model in which trans-synaptic ELFN1 binding is necessary for mGluR6 postsynaptic localization, whereas the C-terminus has a role in mediating TRPM1 trafficking. These findings reveal different sequence determinants of the multifunctional roles of mGluR6 in ON-BCs."

Better understanding of reasons for participation can help improve recruitment. This study explored why participants enrolled in the Coaching for Healthy Ageing (CHAnGE) trial, including how their decision was influenced by recruitment strategies. CHAnGE was a cluster randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a healthy ageing program targeting inactivity and falls. Seventy-two groups of people aged 60+ were recruited from community organisations via informal presentations by the health coaches.We conducted a secondary thematic analysis of interview data from our wider qualitative evaluation in which 32 purposively sampled trial participants took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of CHAnGE. Data relating to recruitment and participation were analysed inductively to identify themes, then a coding framework comprising the core constructs from self-determination theory-autonomy, competence and relatedness-was used to explore if and how this theory fit with and helped to explain our data.Recruitment presentations promoted the CHAnGE intervention well in terms of addressing value expectations of structured support, different forms of accountability, credibility, achievability and, for some, a potential to enhance social relationships. Participation was motivated by the desire for improved health and decelerated ageing, altruism and curiosity. These factors related strongly to self-determination concepts of autonomy, competence and relatedness, but the intervention's demonstrated potential to support self-determination needs could be conveyed more effectively.Findings suggest that recruitment could have greater reach using: 1. Strengths-based messaging focusing on holistic gains, 2. Participant stories that highlight positive experiences, and 3. Peer support and information sharing to leverage altruism and curiosity. These theory-informed improvements will be used to increase participation in future trials, including people in hard-to-recruit groups. They may also inform other physical activity trials and community programs."
https://openalex.org/W3213133742,"This study explores processing characteristics of a glottal stop in Maltese which occurs both as a phoneme and as an epenthetic stop for vowel-initial words. Experiment 1 shows that its hyperarticulation is not necessarily mapped onto an underlying form, although listeners may interpret it as underlying at a later processing stage. Experiment 2 shows that listeners' experience with a particular speaker's use of a glottal stop exclusively as a phoneme does not modulate competition patterns accordingly. Not only are vowel-initial words activated by [ʔ]-initial forms, but /ʔ/-initial words are also activated by vowel-initial forms, suggesting that lexical access is not constrained by an initial acoustic mismatch that involves a glottal stop. Experiment 3 reveals that the observed pattern is not generalizable to an oral stop /t/. We propose that glottal stops have a special status in lexical processing: it is prosodic in nature to be licensed by the prosodic structure."

This study aimed at assessing factors influencing management practice, and QoL and its associated factors among ambulatory psoriatic patients visiting All Africa Leprosy, Tuberculosis and Rehabilitation Training (ALERT) Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.A cross sectional study was conducted in 207 patients with psoriasis attending the dermatology clinic of ALERT Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data were collected using structured questionnaire and patients' chart review. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was used to measure patients' QoL. Patients' characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics and predictors of QoL were identified by binary logistic regression.Among 207 study participants, 122 (58.9%) were females. The mean age of the study population was 37.92 (SD = 14.86) years (ranging from 16 to 68 years). The mean age at which diagnosis of psoriasis made was 32 (SD = 13.7) years ranging from 10 to 62 years. The duration of the disease in 112 (54.1%) patients were more than or equal to 5 years. Majority of study participants 145 (70.0%) had plaque psoriasis followed by sebopsoriasis, 24 (11.6%). The majority of plaque psoriasis (80%) cases were managed by topical corticosteroids with or without salicylic acid or coal tar and only 21 (14.5%) treated by methotrexate alone. The mean DLQI was 6.25 corresponding to a moderate effect. Symptoms and feelings were the most affected domains of QoL. Factors associated with poor QoL were female [AOR = 0.17 (95%CI: 0.06, 0.48)], low, above average and high family income ([AOR = 0.12 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.56)], [AOR = 0.06 (95% CI:0.01, 0.32)], and [AOR = 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.22)]), respectively, and primary education level [AOR = 0.14 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.64)] while being on systemic therapy [AOR = 4.26 (CI: 1.18, 15.35)] was predictor of better QoL. Poor QoL was predominant in females [AOR = 0.17 (95%CI: 0.06, 0.48)], low income [AOR = 0.12 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.56] patients, and patients with primary education level [AOR = 0.14 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.64)].

https://openalex.org/W4226398588,"Therapeutic angiogenesis would be clinically valuable in situations such as peripheral vascular disease in diabetic patients and tissue reperfusion following ischemia or injury, but approaches using traditional isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) have had little success. The isoform VEGF165 is both soluble and matrix-associated, but can cause pathologic vascular changes. Freely diffusible VEGF121 is not associated with pathologic angiogenesis, but its failure to remain in the vicinity of the targeted area presents therapeutic challenges. In this study, we evaluate the cellular effects of engineered VEGF variants that tether extracellular VEGF121 to the cell membrane with the goal of activating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in a sustained, autologous fashion in endothelial cells. When expressed by primary human retinal endothelial cells (hRECs), the engineered, membrane-tethered variants eVEGF-38 and eVEGF-53 provide a lasting VEGF signal that induces cell proliferation and survival, increases endothelial permeability, promotes the formation of a cord/tube network, and stimulates the formation of elongated filopodia on the endothelial cells. The engineered VEGF variants activate VEGFR2, MAPK/ERK, and the Rho GTPase mediators CDC42 and ROCK, activities that are required for the formation of the elongated filopodia. The sustained, pro-angiogenic activities induced by eVEGF-38 and eVEGF-53 support the potential of engineered VEGF variants-overexpressing endothelial cells as a novel combination of gene and cell-based therapeutic strategy for stimulating endothelial cell-autologous therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3211429666,"A new workflow for protein-based tumor heterogeneity probing in tissues is here presented. Tumor heterogeneity is believed to be key for therapy failure and differences in prognosis in cancer patients. Comprehending tumor heterogeneity, especially at the protein level, is critical for tracking tumor evolution, and showing the presence of different phenotypical variants and their location with respect to tissue architecture. Although a variety of techniques is available for quantifying protein expression, the heterogeneity observed in the tissue is rarely addressed. The proposed method is validated in breast cancer fresh-frozen tissues derived from five patients. Protein expression is quantified on the tissue regions of interest (ROI) with a resolution of up to 100 μm in diameter. High heterogeneity values across the analyzed patients in proteins such as cytokeratin 7, β-actin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using a Shannon entropy analysis are observed. Additionally, ROIs are clustered according to their expression levels, showing their location in the tissue section, and highlighting that similar phenotypical variants are not always located in neighboring regions. Interestingly, a patient with a phenotype related to increased aggressiveness of the tumor presents a unique protein expression pattern. In summary, a workflow for the localized extraction and protein analysis of regions of interest from frozen tissues, enabling the evaluation of tumor heterogeneity at the protein level is presented."
https://openalex.org/W3212095018,"Measurement error is a ubiquitous element of social science studies. In large-scale effectiveness intervention studies on child language, administration of the assessment of language and preliteracy outcomes by speech and language pathologists is costly in money and human resources. Alternatively, daycare educators can administer the assessment, which preserves considerable resources but may increase the measurement error. Using data from two nationwide child language intervention studies in Denmark, this article evaluates daycare educators' measurement error when administering a test of language and preliteracy skills of 3 to 5 year old children that in part is used in a national screening program. Since children were randomly assigned to educators, hierarchical linear models can estimate the amount of additional measurement error caused by educators' language assessments. The result shows that the amount of additional measurement error varied between different language subscales, ranging from 4% to 19%, which can be compensated for by increasing the sample size by the latter percentage. The benefits and risks of having daycare educators administer language assessments are discussed."

In this study, twenty oil palm accessions with distinct variation in vitamin E contents (171.30 to 1 258.50 ppm) were selected for genetic variation analysis and developing functional markers associated with vitamin E contents. Thirty-seven homologous genes in oil palm belonging to vitamin E biosynthesis pathway were identified via BLASTP analysis, the lengths of which ranged from 426 to 25 717 bp (average 7 089 bp). Multiplex PCR sequencing for the 37 genes found 1 703 SNPs and 85 indels among the 20 oil palm accessions, with 226 SNPs locating in the coding regions. Clustering analysis for these polymorphic loci showed that the 20 oil palm accessions could be divided into five groups. Among these groups, group I included eight oil palm accessions whose vitamin E content (mean value: 893.50 ppm) was far higher than other groups (mean value 256.29 to 532.94 ppm). Correlation analysis between the markers and vitamin E traits showed that 134 SNP and 7 indel markers were significantly (p < 0.05) related with total vitamin E content. Among these functional markers, the indel EgTMT-1-24 was highly correlated with variation in vitamin E content, especially tocotrienol content. Our study identified a number of candidate function associated markers and provided clues for further research into molecular breeding for high vitamin E content oil palm."
https://openalex.org/W3213871099,"Public health interventions such as social distancing and mask wearing decrease the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but it is unclear whether they decrease the viral load of infected patients and whether changes in viral load impact mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We evaluated 6923 patients with COVID-19 at six New York City hospitals from March 15-May 14, 2020, corresponding with the implementation of public health interventions in March. We assessed changes in cycle threshold (C T ) values from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests and in-hospital mortality and modeled the impact of viral load on mortality. Mean C T values increased between March and May, with the proportion of patients with high viral load decreasing from 47.7% to 7.8%. In-hospital mortality increased from 14.9% in March to 28.4% in early April, and then decreased to 8.7% by May. Patients with high viral loads had increased mortality compared to those with low viral loads (adjusted odds ratio 2.34). If viral load had not declined, an estimated 69 additional deaths would have occurred (5.8% higher mortality). SARS-CoV-2 viral load steadily declined among hospitalized patients in the setting of public health interventions, and this correlated with decreases in mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3214393957,"Prophylactic administration of antibiotics within 24 hours of surgery is recommended to reduce the risk of infection. We conducted a prospective study to compare the efficacy of single administration of antibiotics with a historical control of continuous administration of antibiotics for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of malignant liver tumors.Between February 1, 1999 and November 30, 2010, a total of 6,763 RFA treatments were performed in 2,355 patients, using a protocol with continuous administration of prophylactic antibiotics. On December 1, 2010, we began using a revised protocol with a single administration of prophylactic antibiotics, while continuing to use the old continuous administration protocol for patients who declined the new protocol. Interim analysis was performed to assess the safety of the single administration protocol. Thereafter, from April 1, 2012, all patients were treated using the new protocol. Risk factors for infectious complications of RFA were assessed using logistic regression.From December 2010 to March 2012, 766 RFA treatments were performed in 663 patients using the new antibiotic protocol. Infectious complications were observed following 4 of these treatments (0.52%). As the upper limit of the confidence interval (CI) resulting from a one-sided binomial test was exactly the prespecified limit of 1.0%, from April 2012 onwards, we treated all patients using the new protocol with single administration of prophylactic antibiotics. A total of 3,547 RFA treatments were performed using the single administration protocol. Univariable logistic regression indicated that prior transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and maximal tumor diameter were significant risk factors for infectious complications (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariable analysis indicated that the adjusted hazard ratio of single vs. continuous administration of antibiotics was 1.20 (95% CI: 0.53-2.75; P = 0.66).The rate of infectious complications related to RFA was acceptably low. Single administration of prophylactic antibiotics did not significantly increase the rate of infectious complications related to RFA, compared with a more intensive antibiotic protocol."
https://openalex.org/W3212379235,"Sustainable wildlife harvest is challenging due to the complexity of uncertain social-ecological systems, and diverse stakeholder perspectives of sustainability. In these systems, semi-complex stochastic simulation models can provide heuristics that bridge the gap between highly simplified theoretical models and highly context-specific case-studies. Such heuristics allow for more nuanced recommendations in low-knowledge contexts, and an improved understanding of model sensitivity and transferability to novel contexts. We develop semi-complex Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) models capturing dynamics and variability in ecological processes, monitoring, decision-making, and harvest implementation, under a diverse range of contexts. Results reveal the fundamental challenges of achieving sustainability in wildlife harvest. Environmental contexts were important in determining optimal harvest parameters, but overall, evaluation contexts more strongly influenced perceived outcomes, optimal harvest parameters and optimal harvest strategies. Importantly, simple composite metrics popular in the theoretical literature (e.g. focusing on maximizing yield and population persistence only) often diverged from more holistic composite metrics that include a wider range of population and harvest objectives, and better reflect the trade-offs in real world applied contexts. While adaptive harvest strategies were most frequently preferred, particularly for more complex environmental contexts (e.g. high uncertainty or variability), our simulations map out cases where these heuristics may not hold. Despite not always being the optimal solution, overall adaptive harvest strategies resulted in the least value forgone, and are likely to give the best outcomes under future climatic variability and uncertainty. This demonstrates the potential value of heuristics for guiding applied management."
https://openalex.org/W3212410865,"Political elites both respond to public opinion and influence it. Elite policy messages can shape individual policy attitudes, but the extent to which they do is difficult to measure in a dynamic information environment. Furthermore, policy messages are not absorbed in isolation, but spread through the social networks in which individuals are embedded, and their effects must be evaluated in light of how they spread across social environments. Using a sample of 358 participants across thirty student organizations at a large Midwestern research university, we experimentally investigate how real social groups consume and share elite information when evaluating a relatively unfamiliar policy area. We find a significant, direct effect of elite policy messages on individuals' policy attitudes. However, we find no evidence that policy attitudes are impacted indirectly by elite messages filtered through individuals' social networks. Results illustrate the power of elite influence over public opinion."
https://openalex.org/W3214179247,"Cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to spread around the world even one year after the declaration of a global pandemic. Those with weakened immune systems, due to immunosuppressive medications or disease, may be at higher risk of COVID-19. This includes individuals with autoimmune diseases, cancer, transplants, and dialysis patients. Assessing the risk and outcomes of COVID-19 in this population has been challenging. While administrative databases provide data with minimal selection and recall bias, clinical and behavioral data is lacking. To address this, we are collecting self-reported survey data from a randomly selected subsample with and without COVID-19, which will be linked to administrative health data, to better quantify the risk of COVID-19 infection associated with immunosuppression.Using administrative and laboratory data from British Columbia (BC), Canada, we established a population-based case-control study of all individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Each case was matched to 40 randomly selected individuals from two control groups: individuals who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., negative controls) and untested individuals from the general population (i.e., untested controls). We will contact 1000 individuals from each group to complete a survey co-designed with patient partners. A conditional logistic regression model will adjust for potential confounders and effect modifiers. We will examine the odds of COVID-19 infection according to immunosuppressive medication or disease type. To adjust for relevant confounders and effect modifiers not available in administrative data, the survey will include questions on behavioural variables that influence probability of being tested, acquiring COVID-19, and experiencing severe outcomes.This study has received approval from the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board [H20-01914]. Findings will be disseminated through scientific conferences, open access peer-reviewed journals, COVID-19 research repositories and dissemination channels used by our patient partners."
