https://openalex.org/W2922288722,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have strong potential in regenerative medicine applications; however, immune rejection caused by HLA mismatching is a concern. B2M gene knockout and HLA-homozygous iPSC stocks can address this issue, but the former approach may induce NK cell activity and fail to present antigens, and it is challenging to recruit rare donors for the latter method. Here, we show two genome-editing strategies for making immunocompatible donor iPSCs. First, we generated HLA pseudo-homozygous iPSCs with allele-specific editing of HLA heterozygous iPSCs. Second, we generated HLA-C-retained iPSCs by disrupting both HLA-A and -B alleles to suppress the NK cell response while maintaining antigen presentation. HLA-C-retained iPSCs could evade T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo. We estimated that 12 lines of HLA-C-retained iPSCs combined with HLA-class II knockout are immunologically compatible with >90% of the world's population, greatly facilitating iPSC-based regenerative medicine applications."
https://openalex.org/W2921646015,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a worldwide public health concern for which no vaccine is available. Elucidation of the prefusion structure of the RSV F glycoprotein and its identification as the main target of neutralizing antibodies have provided new opportunities for development of an effective vaccine. Here, we describe the structure-based design of a self-assembling protein nanoparticle presenting a prefusion-stabilized variant of the F glycoprotein trimer (DS-Cav1) in a repetitive array on the nanoparticle exterior. The two-component nature of the nanoparticle scaffold enabled the production of highly ordered, monodisperse immunogens that display DS-Cav1 at controllable density. In mice and nonhuman primates, the full-valency nanoparticle immunogen displaying 20 DS-Cav1 trimers induced neutralizing antibody responses ∼10-fold higher than trimeric DS-Cav1. These results motivate continued development of this promising nanoparticle RSV vaccine candidate and establish computationally designed two-component nanoparticles as a robust and customizable platform for structure-based vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2921912860,"While cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, how aggregates form and what drives its nuclear clearance have not been determined. Here we show that TDP-43 at its endogenous level undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within nuclei in multiple cell types. Increased concentration of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm or transient exposure to sonicated amyloid-like fibrils is shown to provoke long-lived liquid droplets of cytosolic TDP-43 whose assembly and maintenance are independent of conventional stress granules. Cytosolic liquid droplets of TDP-43 accumulate phosphorylated TDP-43 and rapidly convert into gels/solids in response to transient, arsenite-mediated stress. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets slowly recruit importin-α and Nup62 and induce mislocalization of RanGap1, Ran, and Nup107, thereby provoking inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport, clearance of nuclear TDP-43, and cell death. These findings identify a neuronal cell death mechanism that can be initiated by transient-stress-induced cytosolic de-mixing of TDP-43."

Exome sequences of 1,001 human cancer cell lines and 577 xenografts revealed most common mutational signatures, indicating past activity of the underlying processes, usually in appropriate cancer types. To investigate ongoing patterns of mutational-signature generation, cell lines were cultured for extended periods and subsequently DNA sequenced. Signatures of discontinued exposures, including tobacco smoke and ultraviolet light, were not generated in vitro. Signatures of normal and defective DNA repair and replication continued to be generated at roughly stable mutation rates. Signatures of APOBEC cytidine deaminase DNA-editing exhibited substantial fluctuations in mutation rate over time with episodic bursts of mutations. The initiating factors for the bursts are unclear, although retrotransposon mobilization may contribute. The examined cell lines constitute a resource of live experimental models of mutational processes, which potentially retain patterns of activity and regulation operative in primary human cancers.

Each mutational process operative in a cell leaves a mutational signature imprinted on its genome (Stratton et al., 2009Stratton M.R. Campbell P.J. Futreal P.A. The cancer genome.Nature. 2009; 458: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). Using mathematical approaches applied to thousands of catalogs of somatic mutations from the range of human cancer types (Alexandrov et al., 2013bAlexandrov L.B. Nik-Zainal S. Wedge D.C.

There is currently insight into the mutational processes underlying about half of these signatures (Helleday et al., 2014Helleday T. Eshtad S. Nik-Zainal S.

However, many questions remain pertaining to the biology of their underlying mechanisms, which require experimental models to be addressed. The somatic mutational catalog of a cancer genome is the aggregate of mutations that has been generated by multiple mutational processes active at any point during the cell lineage from the fertilized egg to the cancer cell (Stratton et al., 2009Stratton M.R. Campbell P.J. Futreal P.A. The cancer genome.Nature. 2009; 458: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). Some mutational processes may operate continuously and for the full duration of the cell lineage, as proposed for the processes underlying signatures 1 and 5, which are ubiquitous among cancer types and are found in normal cells (Alexandrov et al., 2015Alexandrov L.B. Jones P.H. Wedge D.C. Sale J.E. Campbell P.J. Nik-Zainal S. Stratton M.R. Clock-like mutational processes in human somatic cells.Nat.

Others may operate over only part of the lineage and may no longer be active when the cancer is sampled, for example, exposures to tobacco smoke and ultraviolet light. Comparisons of mutations generated during different phases of the evolution of individual human cancers in vivo suggest that some mutational processes show varying degrees of activity over time (Gerstung et al., 2017Gerstung M.

To provide a resource for experimental investigation of the biological mechanisms underlying the repertoire of mutational signatures, we first annotated mutational signatures on sets of publicly available models, including 1,001 immortal human cell lines (COSMIC Cell Line Project) and 577 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs; NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository) derived from a broad spectrum of cancer types. The panel includes most widely used models in cancer research and therapeutics testing and is being extensively characterized genomically, transcriptomally, epigenomically, and for biological responses to therapeutics (Garnett et al., 2012Garnett M.J.

We subsequently used a subset of the cancer cell lines to experimentally assess whether mutational processes underlying mutational signatures continue to be active during in vitro culture and to characterize their temporal patterns of activity. Cell lines continuing to acquire mutational signatures represent informative models for future investigation of their underlying mechanisms. The presence and relative contributions of single base substitution signatures (SBSs) were determined in each of 1,001 cancer cell lines (Figure 1; Table S3) and 577 PDX models (Table S3), derived from more than 40 cancer types using previously generated whole-exome DNA sequences (STAR Methods; signature patterns in Figure S1 and Table S1). The analysis revealed a novel signature of unknown origin in Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines characterized by T>A base substitutions (termed SBS25; Figures 1 and S1). During manuscript revision, attribution of a more limited set of mutational signatures to the same set of cancer cell lines was reported (Jarvis et al., 2018Jarvis M.C. Ebrahimi D. Temiz N.A.

The majority of the base substitution signatures observed in primary cancers (Alexandrov et al., 2018Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Ng A.W.T. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A.

These included signatures of exogenous environmental exposures such as SBS4, caused by tobacco-smoke exposure, in lung cancers; SBS7a-b and SBS38, caused by ultraviolet light, in melanoma models; SBS11, likely caused by temozolomide treatment, in melanoma and glioma cell lines; SBS22, caused by aristolochic acid (Poon et al., 2013Poon S.L.

Signatures associated with mutational processes of endogenous origins were also found, including SBS2 and SBS13, associated with APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminase DNA-editing activity (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012aNik-Zainal S.

Finally, signatures of uncertain and speculative origins (Alexandrov et al., 2018Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Ng A.W.T. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A. Bergstrom E. Lopez-Bigas N. et al.The Repertoire of Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/322859Crossref Google Scholar) were also observed, including SBS17a-b in gastric and esophageal models; SBS18, potentially due to reactive-oxygen-species-induced DNA damage, in neuroblastoma cell lines; SBS9, which might result from aberrant processing of AID-induced cytidine deamination by polymerase η, in lymphoma cell lines; and SBS28, SBS34, SBS39, and SBS40, which were found mainly in the cancer types in which they had been previously reported. SBS1 (associated with deamination of 5-methyl cytosine) and SBS5 (of unknown origin) are ubiquitous among cancer types (Alexandrov et al., 2015Alexandrov L.B. Jones P.H. Wedge D.C. Sale J.E. Campbell P.J. Nik-Zainal S. Stratton M.R. Clock-like mutational processes in human somatic cells.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and were present in most cancer cell lines and PDXs. However, some SBS1 and SBS5 mutations are likely attributable to residual germline variants, which remain because of the non-availability of normal DNAs from the same individuals for most cancer cell lines (STAR Methods) and which are also constituted of these two signatures (Rahbari et al., 2016Rahbari R. Wuster A. Lindsay S.J. Hardwick R.J. Alexandrov L.B. Turki S.A. Dominiczak A. Morris A. Porteous D. Smith B. et al.UK10K ConsortiumTiming, rates and spectra of human germline mutation.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). A small subset of signatures was absent from the examined datasets (SBS7c, SBS12, SBS16, SBS24) or found less often than expected (e.g., SBS3) (Alexandrov et al., 2018Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Ng A.W.T. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A. Bergstrom E. Lopez-Bigas N. et al.The Repertoire of Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/322859Crossref Google Scholar). These may be due to the small numbers of somatic mutations in exome sequences, the small numbers of mutations some signatures contribute to individual cancers, the obscuring presence of residual germline variants, the relatively featureless profiles of some signatures that may be more difficult to detect, and/or the genuine absence of the signatures (Alexandrov et al., 2013bAlexandrov L.B. Nik-Zainal S. Wedge D.C. Campbell P.J. Stratton M.R. Deciphering signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 246-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Some signatures were detected in a small proportion of models from cancer classes in which they have not been previously reported (Alexandrov et al., 2018Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Ng A.W.T. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A. Bergstrom E. Lopez-Bigas N. et al.The Repertoire of Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/322859Crossref Google Scholar). Such instances likely reflect past misclassification, past cross-contamination, or minor misattribution of mutational signatures. To investigate the patterns of activity of mutational processes underlying a wide range of signatures, we selected 28 cell lines derived from cancers of the breast, colorectum, uterus, lung, stomach, cervix, ovary, head and neck, skin (melanoma and squamous), white blood cells (B cell lymphoma and leukemia), and neuroblastoma (Figure 3A). One or more of these had high contributions from mutational signatures of tobacco smoke (SBS4); ultraviolet light (SBS7a-d); aberrant APOBEC cytidine deaminase activity (SBS2 and SBS13); defective DNA MMR with MSI (SBS6, SBS15, SBS21, SBS26); concurrent loss of MMR and proofreading functions in POLD (SBS20) and POLE (SBS14); aberrant POLE activity (SBS10a-b); deficiency of HR-DSB repair (SBS3); and signatures of uncertain origin including SBS17a-b (frequently found in esophageal and gastric cancers), SBS18 (found commonly in neuroblastoma), and SBS28 (common in colorectal and endometrial cancers with mutations in POLE). SBS1 and SBS5 were detected in most cell lines. One or more single-cell-derived subclones were established from the stock cultures of each of the 28 cancer cell lines (STAR Methods; Figure 2). These subclones of the stock culture were termed “parent” clones. Parent clones were then propagated in culture for up to 161 days (Table S2). Following this period of cultivation, a further round of subcloning was carried out on the cell population from each parent clone, and one or more single-cell subclones were derived (Figure 2). These single-cell subclones of the parent clone were termed “daughter” clones. Daughter clones were expanded in culture to generate a population of cells from which sufficient DNA for further analysis could be obtained. DNAs extracted from parent and daughter clones were whole-exome and/or whole-genome sequenced, and mutations were called (STAR Methods; Figure S7). Subtraction of mutations present in parent clones from those in related daughter clones yielded the mutation sets acquired predominantly during the periods of in vitro propagation between the two subcloning events (STAR Methods). Subtraction of mutations present in the stock cell lines from mutations in their corresponding parent clones (or in some instances, subtraction of mutations shared by two parent lines) revealed mutations acquired mostly between the establishment of the most recent common ancestor cell of the stock cell line and isolation of the single parent cells (STAR Methods). The signature profile of 100 whole-genome- and 41 whole-exome-sequenced daughter clones alongside their corresponding 58 parent clones was then generated (Figure 3; Table S3; STAR Methods). Certain mutational signatures present in stock cell lines were not generated during in vitro culture of their descendant clones (Figure 3; Table S3). These included SBS4 and SBS7 due to tobacco smoke and ultraviolet light, respectively, to which the examined lung cancer (NCI-H650) and melanoma (Mewo) cell lines were not exposed during in vitro culture. In addition, SBS17a-b did not continue to be acquired in vitro in the stomach (AGS) cell line overwhelmed with these signatures. All other signatures present in stock cell lines continued to be generated during culture of descendant clones from at least some cell lines. Multiple mutational signatures have previously been associated with defective mismatch repair (SBS6, SBS14, SBS15, SBS20, SBS21, SBS26) (Alexandrov et al., 2018Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Ng A.W.T. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A. Bergstrom E. Lopez-Bigas N. et al.The Repertoire of Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/322859Crossref Google Scholar). In some cell lines, the particular signature(s) present in the stock converted to different defective MMR signature(s) during in vitro culture (e.g., acute lymphocytic leukemia MOLT-4) or remained roughly stable (e.g., colorectal cancer CW-2) (Figure 3; Table S3). In others, certain signatures appeared to be present in the stock cell line but were absent from all or some clones and vice versa. However, visual inspection of mutation spectra indicated that this was likely due to misattribution of mutations to other MMR-deficiency signatures and that all cell lines with defective MMR (Table S4; Figure S2) continued to generate a subset of the corresponding signatures alongside the large numbers of small indels at short nucleotide repeats typical of this repair deficiency (Figure 3). The colorectal (SNU-81 and HT-115) and endometrial (ESS-1) cancer cell lines with mutations in POLE (Table S4) continued to generate the associated base substitution signatures. However, the relative contribution of SBS10b (composed predominantly of C>T mutations) compared to signature SBS10a (composed predominantly of C>A mutations) diminished markedly in vitro (Figure 3). Furthermore, signature 28, often found in cancers with mutations in POLE (Alexandrov et al., 2018Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Ng A.W.T. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A. Bergstrom E. Lopez-Bigas N. et al.The Repertoire of Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/322859Crossref Google Scholar), continued to be generated in all of these cell lines but not in the examined stomach cancer cell line (AGS) (Figure 3; Table S3). SBS3 is a relatively flat and featureless base substitution signature (Figure S1) that is associated with defective homologous recombination-based DNA repair and inactivating mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Alexandrov et al., 2013aAlexandrov L.B.

SBS3 was also generated in the ovarian (OVCAR-8) and breast (HCC38) cancer cell lines (Figure 3), which have attenuated BRCA1 expression due to promoter methylation as well as in lung adenocarcinoma (NCI-H650) and breast cancer (AU565) cell lines, which did not show obvious deficiencies in BRCA1 or BRCA2 function (Figure S2; Table S4). In contrast to MDA-MB-436, however, SBS3 in these lines was not accompanied by substantial numbers of deletions with microhomology or rearrangements (Figure S3B).

https://openalex.org/W2921819732,"Host defenses against pathogens are energetically expensive, leading ecological immunologists to postulate that they might participate in energetic trade-offs with other maintenance programs. However, the metabolic costs of immunity and the nature of physiologic trade-offs it engages are largely unknown. We report here that activation of immunity causes an energetic trade-off with the homeothermy (the stable maintenance of core temperature), resulting in hypometabolism and hypothermia. This immunity-induced physiologic trade-off was independent of sickness behaviors but required hematopoietic sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Metabolomics and genome-wide expression profiling revealed that distinct metabolic programs supported entry and recovery from the energy-conserving hypometabolic state. During bacterial infections, hypometabolic states, which could be elicited by competition for energy between maintenance programs or energy restriction, promoted disease tolerance. Together, our findings suggest that energy-conserving hypometabolic states, such as dormancy, might have evolved as a mechanism of tissue tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2952257365,"Higher-order thalamic nuclei, such as the visual pulvinar, play essential roles in cortical function by connecting functionally related cortical and subcortical brain regions. A coherent framework describing pulvinar function remains elusive because of its anatomical complexity and involvement in diverse cognitive processes. We combined large-scale anatomical circuit mapping with high-density electrophysiological recordings to dissect a homolog of the pulvinar in mice, the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP). We define three broad LP subregions based on correspondence between connectivity and functional properties. These subregions form corticothalamic loops biased toward ventral or dorsal stream cortical areas and contain separate representations of visual space. Silencing the visual cortex or superior colliculus revealed that they drive visual tuning properties in separate LP subregions. Thus, by specifying the driving input sources, functional properties, and downstream targets of LP circuits, our data provide a roadmap for understanding the mechanisms of higher-order thalamic function in vision."
https://openalex.org/W2920849273,"It has been recently shown that increased oxidative phosphorylation, as reflected by increased mitochondrial activity, together with impairment of the mitochondrial stress response, can severely compromise hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration. Here we show that the NAD+-boosting agent nicotinamide riboside (NR) reduces mitochondrial activity within HSCs through increased mitochondrial clearance, leading to increased asymmetric HSC divisions. NR dietary supplementation results in a significantly enlarged pool of progenitors, without concurrent HSC exhaustion, improves survival by 80%, and accelerates blood recovery after murine lethal irradiation and limiting-HSC transplantation. In immune-deficient mice, NR increased the production of human leucocytes from hCD34+ progenitors. Our work demonstrates for the first time a positive effect of NAD+-boosting strategies on the most primitive blood stem cells, establishing a link between HSC mitochondrial stress, mitophagy, and stem-cell fate decision, and unveiling the potential of NR to improve recovery of patients suffering from hematological failure including post chemo- and radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2921628317,"The signaling organelles of the innate immune system consist of oligomeric protein complexes known as supramolecular organizing centers (SMOCs). Examples of SMOCs include myddosomes and inflammasomes, which respectively induce transcription-dependent and -independent inflammatory responses. The common use of oligomeric structures as signaling platforms suggests multifunctionality, but each SMOC has a singular biochemically defined function. Here, we report that the myddosome is a multifunctional organizing center. In addition to promoting inflammatory transcription factor activation, the myddosome drives the rapid induction of glycolysis. We identify the kinase TBK1 as a myddosome component that promotes glycolysis, but not nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. Synthetic immunology approaches further diversified SMOC activities, as we created interferon- or necroptosis-inducing myddosomes, inflammasomes that induce interferon responses instead of pyroptosis, and a SMOC-like nanomachine that induces interferon expression in response to a chemical ligand. These discoveries demonstrate the flexibility of immune signaling organelles, which permits the design of user-defined innate immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2922356758,"Bacteria exhibit cell-to-cell variability in their resilience to stress, for example, following antibiotic exposure. Higher resilience is typically ascribed to ""dormant"" non-growing cellular states. Here, by measuring membrane potential dynamics of Bacillus subtilis cells, we show that actively growing bacteria can cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics through an alternative mechanism based on ion flux modulation. Specifically, we observed two types of cellular behavior: growth-defective cells exhibited a mathematically predicted transient increase in membrane potential (hyperpolarization), followed by cell death, whereas growing cells lacked hyperpolarization events and showed elevated survival. Using structural perturbations of the ribosome and proteomic analysis, we uncovered that stress resilience arises from magnesium influx, which prevents hyperpolarization. Thus, ion flux modulation provides a distinct mechanism to cope with ribosomal stress. These results suggest new approaches to increase the effectiveness of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and reveal an intriguing connection between ribosomes and the membrane potential, two fundamental properties of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2920879405,"The SOX2 transcription factor is critical for neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance and brain development. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chromatin interaction analysis (ChIA-PET), we determined genome-wide SOX2-bound regions and Pol II-mediated long-range chromatin interactions in brain-derived NSCs. SOX2-bound DNA was highly enriched in distal chromatin regions interacting with promoters and carrying epigenetic enhancer marks. Sox2 deletion caused widespread reduction of Pol II-mediated long-range interactions and decreased gene expression. Genes showing reduced expression in Sox2-deleted cells were significantly enriched in interactions between promoters and SOX2-bound distal enhancers. Expression of one such gene, Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (Socs3), rescued the self-renewal defect of Sox2-ablated NSCs. Our work identifies SOX2 as a major regulator of gene expression through connections to the enhancer network in NSCs. Through the definition of such a connectivity network, our study shows the way to the identification of genes and enhancers involved in NSC maintenance and neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2921077614,"Maintaining the optimal performance of cell processes and organelles is the task of auto-regulatory systems. Here we describe an auto-regulatory device that helps to maintain homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by adjusting the secretory flux to the cargo load. The cargo-recruiting subunit of the coatomer protein II (COPII) coat, Sec24, doubles as a sensor of folded cargo and, upon cargo binding, acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to activate the signaling protein Gα12 at the ER exit sites (ERESs). This step, in turn, activates a complex signaling network that activates and coordinates the ER export machinery and attenuates proteins synthesis, thus preventing large fluctuations of folded and potentially active cargo that could be harmful to the cell or the organism. We call this mechanism AREX (autoregulation of ER export) and expect that its identification will aid our understanding of human physiology and diseases that develop from secretory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2922437276,"Neurons are extraordinarily large and highly polarized cells that require rapid and efficient communication between cell bodies and axons over long distances. In peripheral neurons, transcripts are transported along axons to growth cones, where they are rapidly translated in response to extrinsic signals. While studying Tp53inp2, a transcript highly expressed and enriched in sympathetic neuron axons, we unexpectedly discovered that Tp53inp2 is not translated. Instead, the transcript supports axon growth in a coding-independent manner. Increasing evidence indicates that mRNAs may function independently of their coding capacity; for example, acting as a scaffold for functionally related proteins. The Tp53inp2 transcript interacts with the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA, regulating TrkA endocytosis and signaling. Deletion of Tp53inp2 inhibits axon growth in vivo, and the defects are rescued by a non-translatable form of the transcript. Tp53inp2 is an atypical mRNA that regulates axon growth by enhancing NGF-TrkA signaling in a translation-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2921094219,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate is a detergent that disrupts cell membranes, activates cell wall integrity signaling and restricts cell growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the underlying mechanism of how sodium dodecyl sulfate inhibits cell growth is not fully understood. Previously, we have shown that deletion of the MCK1 gene leads to sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate; thus, we implemented a suppressor gene screening revealing that the overexpression of TAT2 tryptophan permease rescues cell growth in sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated Δmck1 cells. Therefore, we questioned the involvement of tryptophan in the response to sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. In this work, we show that trp1-1 cells have a disadvantage in the response to sodium dodecyl sulfate compared to auxotrophy for adenine, histidine, leucine or uracil when cells are grown on rich media. While also critical in the response to tea tree oil, TRP1 does not avert growth inhibition due to other cell wall/membrane perturbations that activate cell wall integrity signaling such as Calcofluor White, Congo Red or heat stress. This implicates a distinction from the cell wall integrity pathway and suggests specificity to membrane stress as opposed to cell wall stress. We discovered that tyrosine biosynthesis is also essential upon sodium dodecyl sulfate perturbation whereas phenylalanine biosynthesis appears dispensable. Finally, we observe enhanced tryptophan import within minutes upon exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate indicating that these cells are not starved for tryptophan. In summary, we conclude that internal concentration of tryptophan and tyrosine makes cells more resistant to detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate."

Methods We assessed 100 young men (age: 24.4±2.8 years, BMI: 23.4±2.81 kg/m2). Appendicular lean mass index (ALM/H2) (ALMI), fat mass index (FM/ H2) (FMI), percentage of body fat, BMD at lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH), femoral neck (FN) and whole body (WB) were measured using DXA. Muscle strength was evaluated by handgrip strength. Pearson’s correlations and interactions between all variables were assessed using stepwise regression analyses. Results ALM index (ALMI) was positively correlated with BMD at all sites (r = 0.62 for WB p<0.05, r = 0.54 for FN p<0.05, r = 0.64 for TH p<0.05, r = 0.56 for LS p<0.05) whereas FMI was not correlated to BMD values. Stepwise regression analyses showed that ALMI produced a significant and positive influence on BMD (β = 0.07 for WB p<0.001, β = 0.04 for FN p<0.001, β = 0.06 for TH p<0.001). Conversely, FMI was negatively associated with BMD at all sites (β = -0.02 for WB p<0.001, β = - 0.03 for FN p<0.001, β = - 0.03 for TH p<0.001, β = - 0.07 for LS p<0.001). Handgrip strength and BMDs were significantly and positively associated at all sites. Conclusions Our data suggest that BMD was positively associated with ALMI while negatively with FMI. We confirm that ALMI is the strongest factor associated with BMD in a population of young men."

The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of the essential oil of fresh leaves was investigated on silica gel plates. The interactions of the key compounds with acetylcholinesterase were simulated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. In total, 75 compounds were identified, and oxygenated monoterpenes were the dominant components of all the plant parts, ranging from 19.48% to 84.99%. In the roots, the main compounds were saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, having contents varying from 39.5% to 32.17%, respectively. In the evaluation of the anticholinesterase activity, the essential oils (detection limit (DL) = 0.1 ng/spot) were found to be about ten times less active than that of physostigmine (DL = 0.01ng/spot), whereas thymol and thymol acetate presented DL values each of 0.01 ng/spot, equivalent to that of the positive control. Based on the docking and molecular dynamics studies, thymol and thymol acetate interact with the catalytic residues Ser203 and His447 of the active site of acetylcholinesterase. The binding free energies (ΔGbind) for these ligands were -18.49 and -26.88 kcal/mol, demonstrating that the ligands are able to interact with the protein and inhibit their catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2921007579,"Although animal studies provided significant insights in understanding the neural basis of learning and adaptation, they often cannot dissociate between different learning mechanisms due to the lack of verbal communication. To overcome this limitation, we examined the mechanisms of learning and its limits in a human intracortical brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm. A tetraplegic participant controlled a 2D computer cursor by modulating single-neuron activity in the anterior intraparietal area (AIP). By perturbing the neuron-to-movement mapping, the participant learned to modulate the activity of the recorded neurons to solve the perturbations by adopting a target re-aiming strategy. However, when no cognitive strategies were adequate to produce correct responses, AIP failed to adapt to perturbations. These findings suggest that learning is constrained by the pre-existing neuronal structure, although it is possible that AIP needs more training time to learn to generate novel activity patterns when cognitive re-adaptation fails to solve the perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2921663494,"Ral GTPases are RAS effector molecules and by implication a potential therapeutic target for RAS mutant cancer. However, very little is known about their roles in stem cells and tissue homeostasis. Using Drosophila, we identified expression of RalA in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and progenitor cells of the fly midgut. RalA was required within ISCs for efficient regeneration downstream of Wnt signaling. Within the murine intestine, genetic deletion of either mammalian ortholog, Rala or Ralb, reduced ISC function and Lgr5 positivity, drove hypersensitivity to Wnt inhibition, and impaired tissue regeneration following damage. Ablation of both genes resulted in rapid crypt death. Mechanistically, RALA and RALB were required for efficient internalization of the Wnt receptor Frizzled-7. Together, we identify a conserved role for RAL GTPases in the promotion of optimal Wnt signaling, which defines ISC number and regenerative potential."
https://openalex.org/W2922352062,"The 3D Tune-In Toolkit (3DTI Toolkit) is an open-source standard C++ library which includes a binaural spatialiser. This paper presents the technical details of this renderer, outlining its architecture and describing the processes implemented in each of its components. In order to put this description into context, the basic concepts behind binaural spatialisation are reviewed through a chronology of research milestones in the field in the last 40 years. The 3DTI Toolkit renders the anechoic signal path by convolving sound sources with Head Related Impulse Responses (HRIRs), obtained by interpolating those extracted from a set that can be loaded from any file in a standard audio format. Interaural time differences are managed separately, in order to be able to customise the rendering according the head size of the listener, and to reduce comb-filtering when interpolating between different HRIRs. In addition, geometrical and frequency-dependent corrections for simulating near-field sources are included. Reverberation is computed separately using a virtual loudspeakers Ambisonic approach and convolution with Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIRs). In all these processes, special care has been put in avoiding audible artefacts produced by changes in gains and audio filters due to the movements of sources and of the listener. The 3DTI Toolkit performance, as well as some other relevant metrics such as non-linear distortion, are assessed and presented, followed by a comparison between the features offered by the 3DTI Toolkit and those found in other currently available open- and closed-source binaural renderers."

In several animal lineages, gene duplication events resulted in multiple active Robo paralogs, with humans and other mammals having four Robos (1–4), along with three Slits (1–3), while Drosophila has three Robos (1–3) and one Slit. However, C. elegans has maintained a single cognate Robo/SAX-3 receptor and Slit/SLT-1 ligand. Following duplication, adaptive mutagenesis and alternative splicing led to a divergence in certain Robo functions. For example, mammalian Robo3 became insensitive for Slit, and instead of eliciting axon repulsion at the CNS midline, as Robo1/2 do, it facilitates attraction (Zelina et al., 2014Zelina P. Blockus H.

Interestingly, although Robo paralogs in insects and vertebrates are thought to have emerged from independent duplication events (Zelina et al., 2014Zelina P. Blockus H. Zagar Y. Péres A.

Except for the divergent mammalian Robo4, Robo homologs share a similar architecture, containing five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like and three Fibronectin type III (FnIII) extracellular domains (D1–8), a single-pass transmembrane segment, and an unstructured cytosolic region to which intracellular effectors bind (Figures 1A and S1) (Blockus and Chédotal, 2016Blockus H. Chédotal A. Slit-Robo signaling.Development. 2016; 143: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The basic architecture of Slits is also conserved and includes four leucine-rich repeat domains (LRR 1–4), 7–9 EGF repeats, a laminin-G domain, and a carboxy-terminal cysteine knot (Figure 1A). Slit-Robo interaction involves the Slit LRR2 (Howitt et al., 2004Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E.

Crystal and NMR structures of several Robo domains have been determined, notably the hRobo1D1-hSlit2LRR2 complex (PDB: 2V9T) (Morlot et al., 2007Morlot C. Thielens N.M. Ravelli R.B. Hemrika W.

More recently, our crystal structure of hRobo2D4–5 (PDB: 5NOI) (Yom-Tov et al., 2017Yom-Tov G. Barak R. Matalon O. Barda-Saad M. Guez-Haddad J. Opatowsky Y. Robo Ig4 Is a Dimerization Domain.J. Mol.

Also insightful is the low-resolution electron microscopy single particle structure of hRobo1D1–8 (Aleksandrova et al., 2018Aleksandrova N. Gutsche I. Kandiah E. Avilov S.V. Petoukhov M.V.

However, none of these provide the mechanistic insights needed to address how Robo receptors become stimulated and avoid premature activation.Figure S1Structure-Based Sequence Alignment of D1–8 to the Human Robo1, 2, and 3 and the C. elegans Homolog SAX-3, Related to Figure 1Show full captionColor coded symbols and Uniprot protein accession numbers are listed below.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Color coded symbols and Uniprot protein accession numbers are listed below. In this report, we first describe the hairpin-like architecture of intact hRobo2 ectodomain (domains D1–8). In this structure, D4 is intramolecularly blocked and unable to mediate dimerization. We show that D4 mediated dimerization is required for Robo signaling, leading to the conclusion that the hRobo2D1–8 structure displays an auto-inhibited conformation. The structure also reveals how intermolecular trans interactions can impose a tighter auto-inhibition, and cluster Robo molecules close together. Our cell assays support the importance of these intra and intermolecular contacts on Robo signaling, whereas genetic experiments in C. elegans and mouse neuronal outgrowth assays further substantiate the conservation of these observations. Based on the results presented here, we describe a mechanism for Robo auto-inhibition and activation, in which D4-mediated dimerization is key for Robo activation and D4 occlusion is key for maintaining Robo inactive. Accordingly, we suggest that stimulation by Slit involves dissociation of trans-interacting Robos, leading to relief of auto-inhibition that is followed by dimerization and signaling. The entire ectodomain of hRobo2 (24LRQ…KQP859) comprises eight domains, designated D1–8 (Figures 1 and S1), and was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Purified hRobo2D1–8 was subjected to extensive crystallization screening and optimization, followed by structural determination to a resolution of 3.6 Å (Table S1). For structure determination, a hRobo2D2–3 crystal structure (Table S1) was determined and used as a search model in molecular replacement to provide the first accurately located domains. This was followed by the positioning of individual D4, D5, D1, D6, D7, and D8 domains (in that order) available from crystal and NMR structures of hRobo1 and 2 (PDB: 2V9Q, 5NOI, 2EO9, 1UEM, and 4HLJ). hRobo2D1–8 shows an intricate hairpin-like domain arrangement with approximate dimensions of 130 × 80 × 165 Å (Figures 1B and 1C) and bears no resemblance to any other known protein structure in the PDB. The D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 domains have a typical Ig-like C2 fold, and domains D6, D7 and D8 have a FnIII fold (Figure S2). In D3 and D4, a 310 helix appears at the loop connecting strands E and F. A 9-residue alpha helix is located at the N terminus of D7, extending out from the main FnIII fold. There are three molecules of hRobo2D1–8 in the crystal asymmetric unit, baring only small cross-differences, resulting in root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of 1.9–2.6 Å between all atoms of the three copies. The overall high quality of the electron density maps, combined with the availability of high-resolution crystal structures of individual Robo domains, and the unbiased locations of Selenomethionine (SeMet) substructures (calculated from the anomalous signal of SeMet -derivatized hRobo2D1–8 crystals) allowed us to trace ∼85% of the residues with high confidence (Figure 1D). The exception is D8, in which the atomic side chain details are not clearly observed due to high B-factor values. The special domain organization of hRobo2D1–8 requires that the loops linking individual domains are of a particular length. In this way, short one-residue linkers between D1–2, D2–3, D3–4, and D7–8 enforce compact rod-like arrangements, whereas the 11-residue long D5–6 linker enables the antiparallel head-to-tail arrangement of the two domains, and the 9-residue long D6–7 linker facilitates the flanking of D4 on two opposing faces. Notably, while the sequence identities of the D5–6 and D6–7 linkers are not well conserved between Robo orthologs and paralogs (Figure S1), their lengths are no shorter than those of hRobo2, demonstrating the key role these linkers play in facilitating a correct domain organization. D4 is located at the center of the hRobo2D1–8 structure, flanked by D3 on its N′ terminal side, D5 and D6 on one domain face, and by D7 on the other (Figures 1B and 2C ). Remarkably, we have previously identified the same surface of D4, which is sequestered by D7 as a direct mediator of dimeric hRobo2 interactions (Yom-Tov et al., 2017Yom-Tov G. Barak R. Matalon O. Barda-Saad M. Guez-Haddad J. Opatowsky Y. Robo Ig4 Is a Dimerization Domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429: 3606-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Specifically, we showed that a predominantly hydrophobic surface on D4 mediates close homotypic contacts with a reciprocal D4 in the crystal lattice of hRobo2D4–5 (PDB: 5NOI) (Figures 2A, S1, and S3).Figure S3Robo D4 dimerization in two independent crystal lattices, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Crystallographically related dimers of hRobo1D1-4 (A) and hRobo2D4-5 (B) are presented, with one protomer displayed as a cartoon and the second with surface representation.

Note that we have used the hRobo1 isoform 5 in this work, in which the critical phenylalanine position is Phe358 (Figure S1). The identification of D4 as a Robo dimerization module is supported by the recently published structure of hRobo1D1–4 (PDB: 5O5G and 5OPE) (Aleksandrova et al., 2018Aleksandrova N. Gutsche I. Kandiah E. Avilov S.V. Petoukhov M.V. Seiradake E. McCarthy A.A. Robo1 forms a compact dimer-of-dimers assembly.Structure. 2018; 26: 320-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which forms identical crystal contacts with those observed in the hRobo2D4–5 structure (Figures 2A, 2B, and S3). Given the differences between the two Robo paralogs, in sequence (hRobo1 versus hRobo2), constructs used (D1–4 versus D4–5), and crystallization conditions in these two studies, we consider the overlapping crystal contacts to genuinely reflect a conserved role and functionality for D4 dimerization in Robo signaling. To study Robo extracellular (EC) dimerization at cell membranes, we developed a protein chimera system, replacing the catalytically inactive Robo cytosolic portion with the intracellular (IC) tyrosine kinase domain of the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor cKIT (Figure 3). The chimera readout system is based on the principle that cKIT cannot phosphorylate itself or a distant molecule. Rather, following cKIT dimerization by SCF, one cKIT phosphorylates in trans the now-juxtaposed second cKIT molecule (Figure 3A) (Lemmon et al., 1997Lemmon M.A. Pinchasi D. Zhou M. Lax I.

Structure, domain organization, and different conformational states of stem cell factor-induced intact KIT dimers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 1772-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In our RoboEC-cKITIC chimera system, the tyrosine phosphorylation intensity is indicative of the dimerization strength mediated by the extracellular Robo portion. First, we tested three hRobo2 constructs: hRobo2D1–8-cKITIC, and the truncated hRobo2D1–4-cKITIC and hRobo2D1–3-cKITIC. As a control, we measured the tyrosine phosphorylation of full-length cKITFL, before and after addition of the SCF-dimerizing ligand (Figure 3B). To confirm the surface expression of all protein constructs in this experiment, we used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-linked immunolabeling (Figure 3E). The results show a strong dimerization of hRobo2D1–4-cKITIC and weaker, but still considerable, responses of hRobo2D1–8-cKITIC and hRobo2D1–3-cKITIC, indicating that the latter two are not strictly monomeric. Next, we examined whether auto-inhibition of D4-mediated dimerization is conserved in other Robo orthologs and paralogs by comparing the dimerization of D1–8 and D1–4 constructs from hRobo1, hRobo3, and SAX-3 using the cKIT chimera phosphorylation assay. In all cases, the D1–8 constructs show a weaker level of dimerization when compared with their D1–4-based equivalents (Figure 3C), with the biggest and smallest observed difference for SAX-3 and Robo3, respectively. To support these results, we conducted sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (SE-AUC) measurements to determine the oligomeric state of hRobo2D1–8 and hRobo2D4–5 in solution. We found that hRobo2D1–8 is predominantly monomeric, with a weak estimated dimerization constant KD of 100–300 μM (Figure S4). In comparison, our previous AUC measurements of isolated hRobo2D4–5 (Yom-Tov et al., 2017Yom-Tov G. Barak R. Matalon O. Barda-Saad M. Guez-Haddad J. Opatowsky Y. Robo Ig4 Is a Dimerization Domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429: 3606-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed a significant dimeric fraction, with a calculated dimerization dissociation constant of 16.9 μM. Finally, because D7 directly sequesters the D4 dimerization interface in the hRobo2D1–8 structure, we postulated that removal of D7 should release the autoinhibitory constraints for D4 dimerization. Indeed, a hRobo2D1–8Δ7-cKITIC truncation mutant shows increased dimerization in comparison with intact hRobo2D1–8-cKITIC, and hRobo2D1–8Δ5-cKITIC and hRobo2D1–8Δ6-cKITIC deletion mutants (Figure 3D). Based on these results, we conclude that D4 makes a dominant contribution to hRobo2 dimerization, and that D4 is predominantly sequestered from cis-dimerization in the context of an intact Robo ectodomain. To investigate the functional role of Robo D4-mediated dimerization, and other aspects of Robo activation in vivo, we used the C. elegans AVM neuron model system. Specifically, we investigated how putative loss- and gain-of-function mutations in sax-3, designed based on the Robo structure, affect AVM migration pattern. Notably, unlike Drosophila and mouse Slit-Robo model systems with several Robo paralogs, C. elegans has maintained a single cognate Robo/SAX-3 and Slit/SLT-1, offering a simple and well characterized in vivo model to probe mechanistic elements of Robo activation. In this model, the knockout of sax-3 has severe consequences on C. elegans physiology (Zallen et al., 1998Zallen J.A. Yi B.A. Bargmann C.I.

Recently, 3D VWI sequences were introduced at 3 Tesla. We aimed to compare 2D and 3D VWI for detection of intracranial vessel wall enhancement (VWE) in patients suspected of cerebral vasculitis.44 MRI scans of 39 patients were assessed that included bi-planar 2D T1 and whole-brain 3D T1 SPACE dark blood VWI pre and post contrast. Visibility and VWE were analyzed in 31 pre-specified intracranial artery segments. Additionally, leptomeningeal and parenchymal contrast enhancement was assessed.Overall, more arterial segments were visualized with 3D VWI (p<0.0001). Detection of VWE showed fair agreement between 2D and 3D VWI (κ = 0.583). On segmental level, more VWE was detected in intradural ICA by 2D VWI (p<0.001) and in VA V4 segment by 3D VWI (p<0.05). 3D VWI showed more leptomeningeal (p<0.05) and parenchymal (p<0.01) contrast enhancement. In patients with positive diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis, sensitivity was of 67% (2D and 3D VWI) and specificity was 44% (2D VWI) and 48% (3D VWI); more VWE was seen in arteries distal to VA and ICA compared to non-vasculitic patients.2D and 3D VWI differed in the ability to detect VWE. Whole brain coverage with better evaluability of VAs and distal intracranial artery segments, and depiction of more parenchymal and leptomeningeal enhancement make 3D VWI more favorable. As VWE in arteries distal to VA and ICA may be used for discrimination of vasculitic and non-vasculitic patients, future increase in spatial resolution of 3D VWI sequences may be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2949662289,"Proton conductivity is important in many natural phenomena including oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and archaea, uncoupling membrane potentials by the antibiotic Gramicidin, and proton actuated bioluminescence in dinoflagellate. In all of these phenomena, the conduction of protons occurs along chains of hydrogen bonds between water and hydrophilic residues. These chains of hydrogen bonds are also present in many hydrated biopolymers and macromolecule including collagen, keratin, chitosan, and various proteins such as reflectin. All of these materials are also proton conductors. Recently, our group has discovered that the jelly found in the Ampullae of Lorenzini- shark’s electro-sensing organs- is the highest naturally occurring proton conducting substance. The jelly has a complex composition, but we proposed that the conductivity is due to the glycosaminoglycan keratan sulfate (KS). Here we measure the proton conductivity of hydrated keratan sulfate purified from Bovine Cornea. PdHx contacts at 0.50 ± 0.11 mS cm -1, which is consistent to that of Ampullae of Lorenzini jelly at 2 ± 1 mS cm -1. Proton conductivity, albeit with lower values, is also shared by other glycosaminoglycans with similar chemical structures including dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, heparan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. This observation supports the relationship between proton conductivity and the chemical structure of biopolymers."
https://openalex.org/W2921000942,"An antifungal active fraction (AAF) from the coelomic fluid (CF) of the earthworm Dendrobaena veneta was isolated. The aim of the study was to analyze the antifungal activity of the AAF and to carry out chemical characterization of the fraction. The active fraction showed antifungal activity against a clinical C. albicans isolate, C. albicans ATCC 10231, and C. krusei ATCC 6258. It effectively reduced the metabolic activity of C. albicans cells and influenced their morphology after 48 hours of incubation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed loss of integrity of the cell wall induced by the active fraction. Calcofluor White staining showed changes in the structure of the C. albicans cell wall induced by the AAF. The fungal cells died via apoptosis and necrosis after the treatment with the studied fraction. Electrophoresis under native conditions revealed the presence of two compounds in the AAF, while SDS/PAGE gel electrophoresis showed several protein and carbohydrate compounds. The active fraction was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, MALDI TOF/TOF, and ESI LC-MS. The Raman analysis confirmed the presence of proteins and determined their secondary structure. The MALDI TOF/TOF analysis facilitated detection of four main compounds with a mass of 7694.9 m/z, 12292.3 m/z, 21628.3 m/z, and 42923.2 m/z in the analyzed fraction. The presence of carbohydrate compounds in the preparation was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC-MS). The ATR-FTIR spectrum of the AAF exhibited high similarity to the spectrum of egg white lysozyme. The AAF showed no endotoxicity and cytotoxicity towards normal skin fibroblasts (HSF); therefore, it can be used for the treatment of skin and mucous membrane candidiasis in the future. Given its efficient and selective action, the fraction seems to be a promising preparation with antifungal activity against C. albicans."
https://openalex.org/W2920839099,"Introduction Weight gain during pregnancy is an important indicator of maternal and fetal nutrition during pregnancy. However, information regarding the effect of pregnancy weight gain on birth weight is lacking from developing countries. Objective To determine the effect of pregnancy weight gain on the newborn’s birth weight in mothers attending antenatal care (ANC) services from private clinics. Methods Health facility-based follow-up study was conducted among 332 pregnant mothers attending their antenatal care in Mekelle city, from October 2016 to June 2017. Before 28 weeks of gestation, pregnancy weight was collected retrospectively, then, mothers were followed-up until the time of infant delivery to record their birth weight. Data were also collected by a structured questionnaire and checklists and analyzed using SPSS version 21. The relationship between dependent and independent variables was assessed and presented using descriptive statistics, as well as t-test, ANOVA, and multivariable linear regression analysis. Variables:—pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal age, parity, decision making power on monetary resources, pregnancy interval, availability of housemaid, women dietary diversity score, maternal occupation, and pregnancy weight gain were included in the multivariable analysis. Results Maternal weight increased monthly at a mean ± SD rate of 2 ± 0.7 kg in the second trimester, and 1.5 ± 0.7 kg in the third trimester. The mean ± SD of pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and total pregnancy weight gain was 23.8 ± 4.6 kg/m2, and 12 ± 2.8 kg respectively. The mean ± SD of birth weight was 3440 ± 542 grams. Weight gain has a significant effect on infant birth weight, a 1 kg increase in the pregnancy weight was associated with 94 g increase in BW (β = 97, 95% CI: 73–120). After dividing the pre-pregnancy weight into four groups (< 18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9 and ≥30) kg/m2 based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM), we found a statistically significant birth weight difference between each group. Conclusion Pregnancy weight gain has a significant effect on birth weight. Thus, ANC counseling services should focus on maternal weight gain to prevent sub-optimal birth weight."
https://openalex.org/W2921076067,"Male Annihilation Technique (MAT) is a key tool to suppress or eradicate pestiferous tephritid fruit flies for which there exist powerful male lures. In the case of Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a highly invasive and destructive species, current implementations of MAT utilize a combination of the male attractant methyl eugenol (ME) and a toxicant such as spinosad (“SPLAT-MAT-ME”) applied at a high density with the goal of attracting and killing an extremely high proportion of males. We conducted direct comparisons of trap captures of marked B. dorsalis males released under three experimental SPLAT-MAT-ME site densities (110, 220, and 440 per km2) near Hilo, Hawaii using both fresh and aged traps to evaluate the effectiveness of varying densities and how weathering of the SPLAT-MAT-ME formulation influenced any density effects observed. Counterintuitively, we observed decreasing effectiveness (percent kill) with increasing application density. We also estimated slightly higher average kill for any given density for weathered grids compared with fresh. Spatial analysis of the recapture patterns of the first trap service per replicate x treatment reveals similar positional effects for all grid densities despite differences in overall percent kill. This study suggests that benefits for control and eradication programs would result from reducing the application density of MAT against B. dorsalis through reduced material use, labor costs, and higher effectiveness. Additional research in areas where MAT programs are currently undertaken would be helpful to corroborate this study’s findings."

The aim of this randomized, blinded, controlled, parallel-design trial was to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal ketamine and midazolam as the main component of the behavioral guidance approach for preschoolers during dental treatment. Materials and methods Children under seven years of age, with caries and non-cooperative behavior, were randomized into three groups: (KMIN) intranasal ketamine and midazolam; (KMO) oral ketamine and midazolam; or (MO) oral midazolam. The dental sedation appointments were videotaped, and the videos were analyzed using the Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale (OSUBRS) to determine the success of the sedation in each group. Intra- and postoperative adverse events were recorded. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests (P < 0.05, IBM SPSS). Results Participants were 84 children (28 per group; 43 boys), with a mean age of 3.1 years (SD 1.2). Children’s baseline and the dental sedation session characteristics were balanced among groups. The success of the treatment as assessed by the dichotomous variable ‘quiet behavior for at least 60% of the session length’ was: KMIN 50.0% (n = 14; OR 2.10, 95% CI 0.71 to 6.30), KMO 46.4% (n = 13; OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.40), MO 32.1% (n = 9) (P = 0.360). Adverse events were minor, occurred in 37 of 84 children (44.0%), and did not differ among groups (P = 0.462). Conclusion All three regimens provided moderate dental sedation with minor adverse events, with marked variability in the behavior of children during dental treatment. The potential benefit of the ketamine–midazolam combination should be further investigated in studies with larger samples. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02447289.

We also found that ATP11A and ATP11B are present at low levels. Mutations in the gene encoding ATP11C are responsible for blood and liver disorders, but the disease mechanisms are not known. Using heterologous expression, we show that the T415N substitution in the phosphorylation motif of ATP11C, responsible for congenital hemolytic anemia, reduces ATP11C expression, increases retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, and decreases ATPase activity by 61% relative to WT ATP11C. The I355K substitution in the transmembrane domain associated with cholestasis and anemia in mice was expressed at WT levels and trafficked to the plasma membrane but was devoid of activity. We conclude that the T415N variant causes significant protein misfolding, resulting in low protein expression, cellular mislocalization, and reduced functional activity. In contrast, the I355K variant folds and traffics normally but lacks key contacts required for activity. We propose that the loss in ATP11C phospholipid flippase activity coupled with phospholipid scramblase activity results in the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of RBCs, decreasing RBC survival and resulting in anemia.

https://openalex.org/W2921882423,"It is estimated that around 52,000 people live with Chagas in Spain, but only 10% have been diagnosed. Migrants from Bolivia bear the burden of Chagas infection in Spain. However, little is known about their current management of Chagas diagnosis and treatment patterns. This study aimed to assess the Chagas related disease perception and health behaviour of Bolivians living in Madrid.For a first time, a cross-sectional survey about Chagas' knowledges and practices was carried out in Madrid, Spain. A total of 376 Bolivians were interviewed about their Chagas health-seeking behaviour. Differences between men and women were assessed Most of Bolivians living in Madrid have access to the public health services. 44% of Bolivians included in the survey had a Chagas screening test done. However, while women did their test for Chagas mostly at hospital (59.2%), men also used the community campaigns (17.5%) and blood banks (14.3%). The prevalence reported among Bolivians tested was 27.7%. Unfortunately, more than half of those reporting a positive test for Chagas did not begin or completed treatment. Only 45.7% of positives reported having had their children tested for Chagas.Despite the increase in the number of Chagas diagnoses done in Madrid, the number of Bolivians who tested positive and then started or completed treatment remains very low. The fact that most Bolivians' access to the health system is through the primary healthcare services should be considered for improving management of cases and follow-up of treatment adherence. Local and national protocol establishing guidelines for the screening and treatment of Chagas disease would help improving case detection and management at all levels of the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2921541376,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes have spread at a remarkable pace in European countries over the past decades. Overweight/obesity and alcohol use are two leading risk factors contributing to both economic and epidemiological burden associated with NCDs. In OECD countries, the impact of indirect costs of obesity varies between 0.20% and 1.21% of GDP. Indirect costs of alcohol use range from 0.19% (Portugal) to 1.6% (Estonia) of GDP.To assess the longitudinal impact of alcohol use and high body-mass index (BMI) on labour market outcomes in the European region by modeling the direct effect of high BMI and alcohol use, and the effect via associated diseases.The impact of BMI, alcohol use, and associated diseases on employment likelihood, intent to retire early, days of absenteeism, and hours of work per week, were modelled via lagged Poisson and Zero-inflated Poisson regressions, adjusting for missingness via inverse probability weighting, as appropriate, using European SHARE data.Controlling for other chronic conditions, being overweight increases employment likelihood among men, but not among women. Obesity decreased female, but not male, employment chances. All chronic conditions linked with high BMI negatively affected employment likelihood, and increased the intention to retire early significantly. Alcohol use positively affects employment likelihood in women at all drinking levels relative to lifetime abstainers, but only in moderate (not heavy) male drinkers. There is super-additionality of impact of NCDs on absenteeism and hours worked, presenting a key economic argument to tackle NCD prevention and compression of morbidity.NCD prevention is not just important for employment and hours worked, but also for employee morale, especially given increasing retirement age in Europe and globally."
https://openalex.org/W2921043473,"The use of multidimensional statistical technique based on decision trees is of recent application in sports science. In the case of football, this technique has not yet been sufficiently proven. The aim of the present study was to search for different success models for the corners in the FIFA World Cup 2014 and FIFA Women's World Cup 2015. For this, the statistical analysis focused on the search for classification models for the different criteria considered (shot, shot between the three posts and goal), based on the creation of different decision trees that allow the most important variables to be identified quickly and efficiently. For this, 1117 corners were collected between the two competitions, performed in 116 international matches. It has been possible to establish multivariate models for the ""shot"" and ""shot between the three posts"" criteria, allowing, in some cases, to quadruple the potential for offensive success. On the other hand, we have been able to identify significant differences in the male and female model of execution. These findings suggest the need to continue deepening the study of tactical behavior in women's soccer from a multivariate perspective, and also propose a better optimization of the management and training of this type of actions for both male and female football. In addition, it has allowed to test the decision tree statistical technique in the analysis of high performance football, with satisfactory results and of great relevance in the applied field."
https://openalex.org/W2921658439,"Background & aims Elastography point quantification is a convenient method for measuring liver stiffness. It can be performed simultaneously with conventional ultrasonography. This study aimed to evaluate its diagnostic performance for assessing hepatic fibrosis in patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD), including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Methods The diagnostic performance of elastography point quantification (ElastPQ) was evaluated and compared with that of serum fibrosis markers, including the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), using the receiver operating characteristics analysis with histologic evaluation as the reference standard. Results In 49 AIH patients, sensitivity and specificity of ElastPQ were 93.6% and 44.4%, respectively, for significant fibrosis (≥ F2, cutoff 4.47 kPa), and 63.6% and 86.8% for cirrhosis (F4, cutoff 9.28 kPa). In 41 PBC patients, they were 81.8% and 73.3%, respectively, for significant fibrosis (≥ F2, cutoff 5.56 kPa), and 100% and 81.6%, respectively, for advanced fibrosis (≥ F3, cutoff 6.04 kPa). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of ElastPQ for significant fibrosis (0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.86) and cirrhosis (0.81, 95% CI 0.65–0.96) were higher than those of APRI and FIB-4 in AILD patients. According to the multivariable analysis, histological activity, steatosis, and body max index (BMI) were not significant factors that influenced the result of ElastPQ. Conclusions ElastPQ exhibited better diagnostic performance–without the influence of confounding factors–for assessing hepatic fibrosis in AILD patients than serum fibrosis markers."

Data from eye examinations provided to 949 pupils (mean age 10.7 years) was analysed to determine the prevalence and aetiology of visual deficiencies and reported eye care history. For 46.2% (n = 438) of pupils, a visual deficiency was recorded. 12.5% of all the children seen (n = 119) had a visual deficiency that was previously undiagnosed. Referral for a medical opinion was made for 3.1% (n = 29) of pupils seen by the service. Spectacle correction was needed for 31.5% (n = 299) of pupils; for 12.9% (122) these were prescribed for the first time. 3.7% (n = 11) of parents/carers of pupils needing spectacles chose not to use the spectacle dispensing service offered in school. Eye care history was available for 847 pupils (89.3%). Of the pupils for whom an eye care history was available, 44% (n = 373) reported no history of any previous eye care and10.7% (n = 91) reported a history of attending a community optical practice/opticians. Only one pupil from the school entry 4–5 age group (0.6% of age group n = 156) would have passed vision screening using current Public Health England screening guidelines. Children with a diagnosis of autism were significantly less likely to be able to provide a reliable measurement of visual acuity. This study supports previously published evidence of a very high prevalence of visual problems in children with the most complex needs and a significant unmet need in this group. It demonstrates routine school entry vision screening using current Public Health England guidelines is not appropriate for this group of children and very low uptake of community primary eye care services."
https://openalex.org/W2921168411,"In this study we investigated the relationships between muscle-tendon parameters and average/peak values of velocity, force and power in sprint running focusing on the acceleration phase. Eighteen male sprinters (100 m PB: 10.66±0.51 s) participated to the study. Instantaneous values of horizontal velocity (v) were recorded by means of a radar and instantaneous values of force (F) and power (P) were calculated based on these data. Muscle thickness, fascicle length and pennation angle of knee extensors and plantar flexors, as well as Achilles tendon length and CSA, were measured by means of ultrasonography. In the first 20 m of the sprint average and peak speed were 6.31±0.59 and 8.88±0.98 m·s-1, respectively; force was highest at the start of the sprint (Fpeak = 10.02±1.43 N·kg-1) and power peaked about 1 s after the start (26.64±5.99 W·kg-1). Muscle-tendon parameters showed stronger correlations with peak values of power (R range: 0.81–0.92), force (R range: 0.56–0.84) and speed (R range: 0.53–0.85) than with average values of velocity over the 20 m distance (R range: 0.41–0.61) (R <0.47 = NS; R >0.71 = P < .001). These data underline that the influence of muscle tendon parameters on sprint performance could be better appreciated when peak values of power can be calculated rather than by considering the simple measure of average velocity (e.g. distance/time)."
https://openalex.org/W2950162761,"Activation of the muscarinic M1 receptor is a promising approach to improve cognitive deficits associated with cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and schizophrenia. TAK-071 is an M1-selective positive allosteric modulator that improves cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, with reduced side effects on gastrointestinal function in rats. In this study, we explored changes in quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) power bands, with or without scopolamine challenge, as a non-invasive translational biomarker for the effect of TAK-071 in cynomolgus monkeys. Scopolamine has been reported to increase theta and delta power bands and decrease alpha power band in healthy volunteers. In line with the clinical observations, scopolamine (25-100 μg/kg, subcutaneous administration [s.c.]) increased theta and delta power bands in cynomolgus monkeys in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had the opposite effect on alpha power band. The effects of TAK-071 on scopolamine (25 μg/kg, s.c.)-induced qEEG spectral changes were examined using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil and a muscarinic M1/M4 receptor agonist xanomeline as comparative cholinomimetics. TAK-071 (0.3-3 mg/kg, oral administration [p.o.]), donepezil (3 mg/kg, p.o.), and xanomeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) suppressed the scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands. These results suggest that changes in specific qEEG power bands, in particular theta and delta power bands in the context of scopolamine challenge, could be used as translational biomarkers for the evaluation of TAK-071 in clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2921328093,"Background New immigrants to Canada with a history of tuberculosis or evidence of old healed tuberculosis on chest radiograph are referred to public health authorities for medical surveillance. This ostensible public health protection measure identifies a subgroup of patients (referrals) who are at very low risk (compared to non-referrals) of transmission. Methods To assess whether earlier diagnosis or a different phenotypic expression of disease explains this difference, we systematically reconstructed the immigration and transmission histories from a well-defined cohort of recently-arrived referral and non-referral pulmonary tuberculosis cases in Canada. Incident case chest radiographs in all cases and sequential past radiographs in referrals were re-read by three experts. Change in disease severity from pre-immigration radiograph to incident radiograph was the primary, and transmission of tuberculosis, the secondary, outcome. Results There were 174 cohort cases; 61 (35.1%) referrals and 113 (64.9%) non-referrals. Compared to non-referrals, referrals were less likely to be symptomatic (26% vs. 80%), smear-positive (15% vs. 50%), or to have cavitation (0% vs. 35%) or extensive disease (15% vs. 59%) on chest radiograph. After adjustment for referral status, time between films, country-of-birth, age and co-morbidities, referrals were less likely to have substantial changes on chest radiograph; OR 0.058 (95% CI 0.018–0.199). All secondary cases and 82% of tuberculin skin test conversions occurred in contacts of non-referrals. Conclusions Phenotypically different disease, and not earlier diagnosis, explains the difference in transmission risk between referrals and non-referrals. Screening, and treating high-risk non-referrals for latent tuberculosis is necessary to eliminate tuberculosis in Canada."
https://openalex.org/W2920986325,"The advent of online data aggregator infrastructures has facilitated the accumulation of Digital Accessible Knowledge (DAK) about biodiversity. Despite the vast amount of freely available data records, their usefulness for research depends on completeness of each body of data regarding their spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage. In this paper, we assess the completeness of DAK about terrestrial mammals distributed across the Iberian Peninsula. We compiled a dataset with all records about mammals occurring in the Iberian Peninsula available in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and in the national atlases from Portugal and Spain. After cleaning the dataset of errors as well as records lacking collection dates or not determined to species level, we assigned all occurrences to a 10-km grid. We assessed inventory completeness by calculating the ratio between observed and expected richness (based on the Chao2 richness index) in each grid cell and classified cells as well-sampled or under-sampled. We evaluated survey coverage of well-sampled cells along four environmental gradients and temporal coverage. Out of 796,283 retrieved records, quality issues led us to remove 616,141 records unfit for this use. The main reason for discarding records was missing collection dates. Only 25.95% cells contained enough records to robustly estimate completeness. The DAK about terrestrial mammals from the Iberian Peninsula was low, and spatially and temporally biased. Out of 5,874 cells holding data, only 620 (9.95%) were classified as well-sampled. Moreover, well-sampled cells were geographically aggregated and reached inventory completeness over the same temporal range. Despite the increasing availability of DAK, its usefulness is still compromised by quality issues and gaps in data. Future work should therefore focus on increasing data quality, in addition to mobilizing unpublished data."
https://openalex.org/W2921685640,"Personal shark deterrents offer the potential of a non-lethal solution to protect individuals from negative interactions with sharks, but the claims of effectiveness of most deterrents are based on theory rather than robust testing of the devices themselves. Therefore, there is a clear need for thorough testing of commercially available shark deterrents to provide the public with information on their effectiveness. Using a modified stereo-camera system, we quantified behavioural interactions between Carcharodon carcharias (white sharks) and a baited target in the presence of a commercially available electric anklet shark deterrent, the Electronic Shark Defense System (ESDS). The stereo-camera system enabled accurate assessment of the behavioural responses of C. carcharias when approaching an ESDS. We found that the ESDS had limited meaningful effect on the behaviour of C. carcharias, with no significant reduction in the proportion of sharks interacting with the bait in the presence of the active device. At close proximity (< 15.5 cm), the active ESDS did show a significant reduction in the number of sharks biting the bait, but this was countered by an increase in other, less aggressive, interactions. The ESDS discharged at a frequency of 7.8 Hz every 5.1 s for 2.5 s, followed by an inactive interval of 2.6 s. As a result, many sharks may have encountered the device in its inactive state, resulting in a reduced behavioural response. Consequently, decreasing the inactive interval between pulses may improve the overall effectiveness of the device, but this would not improve the effective deterrent range of the device, which is primarily a factor of the voltage gradient rather than the stimulus frequency. In conclusion, given the very short effective range of the ESDS and its unreliable deterrent effect, combined with the fact that shark-bite incidents are very rare, it is unlikely that the current device would significantly reduce the risk of a negative interaction with C. carcharias."
https://openalex.org/W2921840879,"Experimental and volunteer studies have reported pulmonary vasoconstriction during transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) stored for prolonged periods. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether transfusion of PRBCs stored over 21 days (standard-issue, siPRBCs) increases pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) to a greater extent than transfusion of PRBCs stored for less then 14 days (fresh, fPRBCs) in critically ill patients following cardiac surgery. The key secondary aim was to assess whether the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) increases after transfusion of siPRBCs to a greater extent than after transfusion of fPRBCs.The study was performed as a single-center, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. Leukoreduced PRBCs were transfused while continuously measuring hemodynamic parameters. Systemic concentrations of syndecan-1 were measured to assess glycocalyx injury. After randomizing 19 patients between January 2014 and June 2016, the study was stopped due to protracted patient recruitment.Of 19 randomized patients, 11 patients were transfused and included in statistical analyses. Eight patients were excluded prior to transfusion, 6 patients received fPRBCs (10±3 storage days), whereas 5 patients received siPRBCs (33±4 storage days). The increase in PAP (7±3 vs. 2±2 mmHg, P = 0.012) was greater during transfusion of siPRBCs than during transfusion of fPRBCs. In addition, the change in PVRI (150±89 vs. -4±37 dyn·s·cm-5·m2, P = 0.018) was greater after transfusion of siPRBCs than after transfusion of fPRBCs. The increase in PAP correlated with the change of systemic syndecan-1 concentrations at the end of transfusion (R = 0.64,P = 0.034).Although this study is underpowered and results require verification in larger clinical trials, our findings suggest that transfusion of siPRBCs increases PAP and PVRI to a greater extent than transfusion of fPRBCs in critically ill patients following cardiac surgery. Glycocalyx injury might contribute to pulmonary vasoconstriction associated with transfusion of stored blood."
https://openalex.org/W2922529092,"Machado Joseph Disease (MJD) (spinocerebellar ataxia 3) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease causing progressive ataxia and loss of mobility. It is the most common spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide. Among Aboriginal families of Groote Eylandt and related communities across Australia’s Top End, MJD is estimated to be more prevalent than anywhere else in the world. This study explored lived experiences of individuals and families with MJD to determine what is important and what works best to keep walking and moving around. A collaborative qualitative exploratory study, drawing from constructivist grounded theory methods, was undertaken for data collection and analysis. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with individuals with MJD (n = 8) and their family members (n = 4) from the Groote Eylandt Archipelago where ~1500 Aboriginal people (Warnumamalya) live. Interviews were led by Warnumamalya community research partners in participants’ preferred language(s). Participants described their experience of living with MJD, from ‘knowing about MJD’, ‘protecting yourself from MJD’ and ‘adjusting to life with MJD’. While the specific importance of walking and moving around differed widely between participants, all perceived that walking and moving around enabled them to do what mattered most to them in life. ‘Staying strong on the inside and outside’ (physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually) was perceived to work best to keep walking and moving around as long as possible. A framework that included personal and environmental strategies for staying strong emerged: ‘Exercising your body’, ‘having something important to do’, ‘keeping yourself happy’, ‘searching for good medicine’, ‘families helping each other’ and ‘going country’. This study, the first to explore lived experiences of MJD in Australia, highlights the importance of maintaining mobility as long as possible. Strategies perceived to work best address physical and psychosocial needs in an integrated manner. Services supporting families with MJD need flexibility to provide individualised, responsive and holistic care."
https://openalex.org/W2921737529,"Clinical and model studies indicate that low nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability due in part to profound hypoargininemia contributes to cerebral malaria (CM) pathogenesis. Protection against CM pathogenesis may be achieved by altering the diet before infection with Plasmodium falciparum infection (nutraceutical) or by administering adjunctive therapy that decreases CM mortality (adjunctive therapy). This hypothesis was tested by administering citrulline or arginine in experimental CM (eCM). We report that citrulline injected as prophylaxis immediately post infection (PI) protected virtually all mice by ameliorating (i) hypoargininemia, (ii) urea cycle impairment, and (iii) disruption of blood brain barrier. Citrulline prophylaxis inhibited plasma arginase activity. Parasitemia was similar in citrulline- and vehicle control-groups, indicating that protection from pathogenesis was not due to decreased parasitemia. Both citrulline and arginine administered from day 1 PI in the drinking water significantly protected mice from eCM. These observations collectively indicate that increasing dietary citrulline or arginine decreases eCM mortality. Citrulline injected ip on day 4 PI with quinine-injected ip on day 6 PI partially protected mice from eCM; citrulline plus scavenging of superoxide with pegylated superoxide dismutase and pegylated catalase protected all recipients from eCM. These findings indicate that ameliorating hypoargininemia with citrulline plus superoxide scavenging decreases eCM mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2922074324,"The relative contribution of ecological processes in shaping metacommunity dynamics in heavily managed landscapes is still unclear. Here we used two complementary approaches to disentangle the role of environment and spatial effect in farmland bird community assembly in an intensive agro-ecosystem. We hypothesized that the interaction between habitat patches and dispersal should play a major role in such unstable and unpredictable environments. First, we used a metacommunity patterns analysis to characterize species co-occurrences and identify the main drivers of community assembly; secondly, variation partitioning was used to disentangle environmental and geographical factors (such as dispersal limitation) on community structure and composition. We used high spatial resolution data on bird community structure and composition distributed among 260 plots in an agricultural landscape. Species were partitioned into functional classes, and point count stations were classified according to landscape characteristics before applying metacommunity and partitioning analyses within each. Overall we could explain around 20% of the variance in species composition in our system, revealing that stochasticity remains very important at this scale. However, this proportion varies depending on the scale of analysis, and reveals potentially important contributions of environmental filtering and dispersal. These conclusions are further reinforced when the analysis was deconstructed by bird functional classes or by landscape habitat classes, underlining trait-related filters, thus reinforcing the idea that wooded areas in these agroecosystems may represent important sources for a specific group of bird species. Our analysis shows that deconstructing the species assemblages into separate functional groups and types of landscapes, along with a combination of analysis strategies, can help in understanding the mechanisms driving community assembly."

A multi-disciplinary team investigated to characterize the outbreak; confirm the cause; and recommend control and prevention measures.Shibganj's residents with new onset of fever and joint pain or rash between 1 September and 15 December 2011 were defined as chikungunya fever (CHIKF) suspect cases. To estimate the attack rate, we identified 16 outpatient clinics in 16 selected wards across 16 unions in Shibganj and searched for suspect cases in the 80 households nearest to each outpatient clinic. One suspect case from the first 30 households in each ward was invited to visit the nearest outpatient clinic for clinical assessment and to provide a blood sample for laboratory testing and analyses.We identified 1,769 CHIKF suspect cases from among 5,902 residents surveyed (30%). Their median age was 28 (IQR:15-42) years. The average attack rate in the sub-district was 30% (95% CI: 27%-33%). The lowest attack rate was found in children <5 years (15%). Anti-CHIKV IgM antibodies were detected by ELISA in 78% (264) of the 338 case samples tested. In addition to fever, predominant symptoms of serologically-confirmed cases included joint pain (97%), weakness (54%), myalgia (47%), rash (42%), itching (37%) and malaise (31%). Among the sero-positive patients, 79% (209/264) sought healthcare from outpatient clinics. CHIKV was isolated from two cases and phylogenetic analyses of full genome sequences placed these viruses within the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL). Molecular analysis identified mutations in E2 and E1 glycoproteins and contained the E1 A226V point mutation.The consistently high attack rate by age groups suggested recent introduction of chikungunya in this community. Mosquito control efforts should be enhanced to reduce the risk of continued transmission and to improve global health security."

This method uses synthetic molecules for rapid isotopic coding of sulfenic acids, reduced cysteines, and disulfides in cells. Our approach utilizes isotopically distinct benzothiazine and halogenated benzothiazine probes to sequentially alkylate sulfenic acids and then free thiols and, finally, after a reduction step, cysteines oxidized to disulfides or other phosphine-reducible states. We ascertained that the iodinated benzothiazine probe has reduced cross-reactivity toward primary amines and is highly reactive with the cysteine of GSH, with a calculated rate constant of 2 × 105 m−1 s−1 (pH 8.0, 23 °C) (i.e. 10–20 times faster than N-ethylmaleimide). We applied iTORC to a mouse hepatocyte lysate to identify known sulfenylated and disulfide-bonded proteins, including elongation factor 1-α1 and mouse serum albumin, and found that iTORC reliably detected their expected oxidation status. This method can be easily employed to study the effects of oxidants on recombinant proteins and cell and tissue extracts, and the efficiencies of the alkylating agents enable completion of all three labeling steps within 2 h.

We applied iTORC to a mouse hepatocyte lysate to identify known sulfenylated and disulfide-bonded proteins, including elongation factor 1-α1 and mouse serum albumin, and found that iTORC reliably detected their expected oxidation status. This method can be easily employed to study the effects of oxidants on recombinant proteins and cell and tissue extracts, and the efficiencies of the alkylating agents enable completion of all three labeling steps within 2 h. In summary, we demonstrate here that halogenated benzothiazine-based alkylating agents can be utilized to rapidly measure the cellular thiol status in cells. Cysteine residues are known targets of oxidation due to the nucleophilic and reactive nature of sulfur atoms. Reaction of the cysteine thiol with a variety of oxidants (e.g. H2O2) has proven to be an important cellular signaling event that can elicit a diverse number of responses, including transcriptional changes and enzymatic regulation (1Parvez S.

Detecting and quantitating oxidatively modified cysteines is crucial to understanding their biological importance. One such oxidative modification is cysteine sulfenylation (Cys-SOH formation). Sulfenic acids can be reduced back to free thiols by reductants, and these protein modifications have short cellular half-lives (6Gupta V. Carroll K.S. Sulfenic acid chemistry, detection and cellular lifetime.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1840 (23748139): 847-87510.1016/j.bbagen.2013.05.040Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Additionally, sulfenic acids are involved in regulatory pathways and can directly function as enzymatic redox switches (7Devarie-Baez N.O. Silva Lopez E.I. Furdui C.M. Biological chemistry and functionality of protein sulfenic acids and related thiol modifications.Free Radic.

This oxidative modification readily participates in a variety of reactions including disulfide bond formation with free thiols and further oxidation to sulfinic (Cys-SO2−) and sulfonic (Cys-SO3−) acids (8Albertolle M.E.

Detection of sulfenic acids with 1,3-dicarbonyl moieties, particularly dimedone, has been known for over 40 years (9Benitez L.V. Allison W.S.

Synthetic efforts have recently been made to improve the detection of sulfenic acids, with several successes (10Carroll K. S., and Gupta V.

Specifically, benzothiazines are fast, selective alkylators of sulfenic acids and promising reagents for discovery of sites of sulfenylation (1Parvez S. Long M.J.C. Poganik J.R. Aye Y. Redox signaling by reactive electrophiles and oxidants.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118 (30148624): 8798-888810.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00698Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Fu L. Liu K. Ferreira R.B.

We used a straightforward chemical procedure to synthesize three stable, distinct benzothiazine isotopomers, and two were further iodinated to react with reduced thiol moieties (Fig. 1). These iodinated reagents proved to be very efficient alkylators of cysteine thiols. Additionally, three structurally identical isotopically unique reagents provide a combination of two heavily used techniques to study thiol redox status (14Alcock L.J. Perkins M.V. Chalker J.M.

Because of the reactivity and efficiency of these alkylating agents, all three labeling steps can be completed within 2 h. isotopic tagging of oxidized and reduced cysteines collision-induced dissociation elongation factor 1-α1 high-resolution MS 2-iodoacetamide 3-iodo-1-propyl-1H-benzo[c][1,2]thiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide N-ethylmaleimide 1-propyl-1H-benzo[c][1,2]thiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane automatic gain control. pBTD and ipBTD, with the appropriate isotopic substitutions, were readily synthesized in 32 and 20% overall yield, respectively, using the methods described. The synthesis of pBTD is a simple three-step sequence (Scheme S1), and the one-step iodination of pBTD yielded ipBTD in 70% yield. pBTD was reacted with the sulfenic acid-derivative of a dipeptide (N-carbobenzoxy-Cys-Val-OCH3), which is oxidized to a cyclic sulfenamide and ring-opens to form a sulfenic acid under aqueous conditions (Fig. S1) (11Gupta V. Carroll K.S. Profiling the reactivity of cyclic C-nucleophiles towards electrophilic sulfur in cysteine sulfenic acid.Chem. Sci. 2016; 7 (26819701): 400-41510.1039/C5SC02569ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rate constant for the reaction of pBTD with the model sulfenic acid–containing dipeptide (Fig. S2B) was measured to be 1.7 × 103 m−1 s−1, which can be compared with the value estimated for dimedone (12 m−1 s−1) and agrees with previously calculated rates reported for benzothiazine probes (11Gupta V. Carroll K.S. Profiling the reactivity of cyclic C-nucleophiles towards electrophilic sulfur in cysteine sulfenic acid.Chem. Sci. 2016; 7 (26819701): 400-41510.1039/C5SC02569ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. S2B, pH 8.0, 23 °C). The estimated rate constant for the reaction of ipBTD with the model peptide glutathione (GSH) was 2.0 × 105 m−1 s−1. Compared with rate constants previously reported for N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 2-mercaptoethanol, ipBTD was found to alkylate cysteines 10–20-fold faster (Fig. S2C, pH 8.0, 23 °C) (16Bednar R.A. Reactivity and pH dependence of thiol conjugation to N-ethylmaleimide: detection of a conformational change in chalcone isomerase.Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (2340265): 3684-369010.1021/bi00467a014Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To directly compare this rate with that of other alkylating agents in a pH-independent manner, ipBTD was reacted with 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate, which has a pKa of 4.4 (Fig. S2D, pH 7.4, 23 °C) (17Hansen R.E. Winther J.R. An introduction to methods for analyzing thiols and disulfides: reactions, reagents, and practical considerations.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 394 (19664585): 147-15810.1016/j.ab.2009.07.051Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The rate constant was measured to be 2.8 × 105 m−1 s−1, compared with 2.2 m−1 s−1 reported for iodoacetamide (IAM) and 46 m−1 s−1 for NEM (17Hansen R.E. Winther J.R. An introduction to methods for analyzing thiols and disulfides: reactions, reagents, and practical considerations.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 394 (19664585): 147-15810.1016/j.ab.2009.07.051Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Comparing ipBTD with IAM and NEM provides ∼120,000- and 6,000-fold rate differences, respectively. A rate constant of only 17 m−1 s−1 was estimated for amine modification using the model N-α-acetyl-l-lysine, demonstrating a 104-fold selectivity for thiol over amine moieties for ipBTD (Fig. S2E, pH 8.0, 23 °C). Reaction of ipBTD with the sulfenic acid dipeptide mentioned earlier provided a rate constant of 4.3 × 103 m−1 s−1, indicating 100-fold selectivity toward free thiols (Fig. S2F, pH 8.0, 23 °C). Such cross-reactivity would produce a sulfoxide product (+16 Da), but using pBTD with an initial incubation time of 1 h to alkylate sulfenic acids limits the cross-reactivity. Sulfoxide formation can also occur after the alkylation step, during sample handling, but proteins with all three labels (d0-, d7-, and 13C6-d7-pBTD–modified cysteines) should be oxidized at a similar rate under these conditions. The high reactivity of ipBTD allows for fast and efficient labeling of reduced cysteines but comes with the drawback of instability. As with most α-haloketone alkylating agents, ipBTD is light-sensitive. The reagent should be prepared fresh in acetonitrile in amber glass before each experiment. Adding 2 mm ipBTD in a reaction provides an ∼100-fold excess of ipBTD over cysteine. Under our reaction conditions (100 mm HEPPS, pH 8.0), a degradation rate of 0.0009 s−1 was calculated, corresponding to a half-life of 13 min (Fig. S2G). In the course of a 15-min alkylation procedure, 37% of the reagent would be remaining, still providing a high molar excess. From our time course experiment (Fig. 3), ∼90% of cysteines were labeled within 2.5 min, suggesting that under these conditions, enough of the probe remains active to complete alkylation in 15 min. 13C6-d7-pBTD was reacted with the model sulfenic acid dipeptide (N-carbobenzoxy-Cys (SOH)-Val-OCH3), and d7- and d0-ipBTD were reacted with the same dipeptide under reducing conditions (1 mm TCEP, to form the free thiol). The reaction mixtures were combined in equal parts and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 2). Extracted ion chromatograms corresponding to the d0-, d7-, and 13C6-d7-pBTD–modified dipeptide co-chromatographed, with the deuterated compounds being expectedly retarded (Fig. 2, A, B, and C, respectively). Smaller peaks with exactly the same mass (and UV spectra, not shown) eluted later and are likely diastereomers (due to the chiral center of carbon-3 of the reagent). Additionally, MS2 spectra revealed mass shifts corresponding to M+0, M+7, and M+13 for the d0-, d7-, and 13C6-d7-pBTD–modified dipeptide, respectively (Fig. 2, D, E, and F, respectively). These results validate the ability of these reagents to selectively alkylate thiols or sulfenic acids and co-elute in HPLC. The use of the ratios of these three alkylating agents provides relative quantitation of reduced and oxidized thiols. Either 20 mm IAM or 2 mm ipBTD was reacted with reduced Escherichia coli lysate for the indicated times; the proteins were digested with trypsin, and LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on the labeled peptides (Fig. 3). Even with the lower concentration of reagent (2 mm), ipBTD alkylation was ∼90% complete within 2.5 min, whereas iodoacetamide alkylation was not complete until 20 min, further demonstrating the high reactivity of ipBTD with free thiols. BSA was reduced and alkylated with ipBTD. The labeled BSA was separated via SDS-PAGE alone or with an unlabeled E. coli lysate background and excited using a UV transilluminator (commonly used for DNA agarose gels) (Fig. 4A). The emission of the labeled BSA was readily visible. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye for comparison (Fig. 4B). ipBTD-labeled E. coli lysate was also separated via SDS-PAGE and excited via UV fluorescence (Fig. 4C) and then stained with Coomassie dye (Fig. 4D). To address the possibility of amine reactivity of ipBTD, we performed another fluorescence experiment (Fig. 4, E and F). BSA was reacted with ipBTD under nonreducing conditions, and no alkylation (fluorescence) was observed (Fig. 4E). Under reducing conditions (1 mm TCEP), BSA was reacted with IAM (50 mm), the residual IAM was then quenched with DTT (25 mm), and ipBTD was added (Fig. 4E). No fluorescence was observed, suggesting that ipBTD is highly selective for reduced thiols under these conditions. Utilizing the fluorescent nature of these alkylating agents provides a facile method to ensure proper labeling and to identify proteins of interest for further analysis. Freshly isolated hepatocytes from four mice were lysed, subjected to iTORC labeling, and submitted for LC-MS/MS peptide analysis. A total of 639 sulfenylated peptides (13C6-d7-pBTD–labeled) corresponding to 1,073 spectra were identified (Table S1). A total of 2,785 peptides were identified as d7-ipBTD–labeled, corresponding to 12,612 spectra, and 1,020 peptides were identified as d0-ipBTD–labeled, corresponding to 3,764 spectra (Table S1). Following analysis of several of the resulting peptides with Skyline, two proteins were selected to highlight the utility of iTORC (Fig. 4). Elongation factor 1-α1 (Eef1a1) is known to oligomerize in a thiol-dependent fashion, with Cys-411 contributing in disulfide bond formation (presumably through sulfenic acid formation) and Cys-234 playing less of a role in this oligomerization (18Liu T. Yang Y. Wang D. Xiao Y. Du G. Wu L. Ding M. Li L. Wu C. Human eukaryotic elongation factor 1A forms oligomers through specific cysteine residues.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (Shanghai). 2015; 47 (26515794): 1011-101710.1093/abbs/gmv113PubMed Google Scholar). iTORC analysis showed a larger population of Cys-411 being oxidized, with some sulfenylation, and Cys-234 existing mostly as a free thiol (Fig. 4A), in agreement with the findings of Liu et al. (18Liu T. Yang Y. Wang D. Xiao Y. Du G. Wu L. Ding M. Li L. Wu C. Human eukaryotic elongation factor 1A forms oligomers through specific cysteine residues.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (Shanghai). 2015; 47 (26515794): 1011-101710.1093/abbs/gmv113PubMed Google Scholar). Eef1a1 plays a role in oxidative stress–induced apoptosis, and measuring the redox status of its cysteines in cells using iTORC could help to further elucidate the mechanism. Additionally, three peptides from mouse serum albumin (a protein synthesized for secretion in hepatocytes) were found to be >95% oxidized, consistent with their known oxidation state (i.e. in disulfide bonds) (Fig. 4B) (19Sigrist C.J. De Castro E. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Le Saux V. Bairoch A. Hulo N. ProRule: a new database containing functional and structural information on PROSITE profiles.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (16091411): 4060-406610.1093/bioinformatics/bti614Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In summary, halogenated benzothiazine-based alkylating agents were synthesized and utilized to measure cellular thiol status. ipBTD has high reactivity toward thiol moieties and has a considerably faster reaction rate than the most commonly used alkylating agents, IAM and NEM. pBTD-alkylated proteins can be excited with UV (360-nm) fluorescence, adding to the utility of these reagents. Concerns can be raised about the multistep labeling procedure due to possible thiol oxidation during the initial labeling of sulfenic acids and the potential for thiol–disulfide exchange during the reaction with pBTD. We have considered these issues and do not believe that they are factors, for five reasons. First, our lysis buffer, in which the sulfenic acid labeling is performed, contains 100 units/ml catalase, which should remove the vast majority of oxidizing (H2O2) species. This enzyme limits the possibility of artifactual sulfenic acid formation after lysis. Second, other labeling strategies for sulfenic acids also employ multistage labeling (e.g. the procedure reported by Seo and Carroll (12Seo Y.H. Carroll K.S. Quantification of protein sulfenic acid modifications using isotope-coded dimedone and iododimedone.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50 (21290508): 1342-134510.1002/anie.201007175Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with dimedone and iododimedone, which we have employed ourselves in the past (20Albertolle M.E. Phan T.T.N. Pozzi A. Guengerich F.P. Sulfenylation of human liver and kidney microsomal cytochromes P450 and other drug metabolizing enzymes as a response to redox alteration.Mol. Cell.

Thus, the sulfenic acid–specific reagents (either dimedone or pBTD) should be added first. Reisz et al. (22Reisz J.A. Bechtold E. King S.B. Poole L.B. Furdui C.M. Thiol-blocking electrophiles interfere with labeling and detection of protein sulfenic acids.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (24103186): 6150-616110.1111/febs.12535Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) report a series of rates and rate constants for reactions with Cys-46 of the peroxiredoxin protein AhpC, utilizing the classic reagents IAM and dimedone. Both the thiol and sulfenic acid (forms of Cys-46) reacted with IAM with very similar rate constants (0.15 and 0.10 m−1 s−1, respectively). Very similar rate constants were observed for the reaction of the protein (or a mutant) with dimedone. Thus, the proposal to mix reagents is not realistic. We are of the opinion that using faster-reacting reagents is very advantageous in competing with the rates of thiol–sulfenic acid reaction (i.e. disulfide formation) that occur during the labeling procedure. Adding selective reagents for sulfenic acids and free thiols at the same time, in principle, would be most ideal for prevention of post-lysis oxidation and thiol–disulfide interchange. To this end, a thiol-selective reagent was recently reported and is a very exciting advancement in specific reagents (23Chen X. Wu H. Park C.M. Poole T.H. Keceli G. Devarie-Baez N.O. Tsang A.W. Lowther W.T. Poole L.B. King S.B. Xian M. Furdui C.M. Discovery of heteroaromatic sulfones as a new class of biologically compatible thiol-selective reagents.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12 (28687042): 2201-220810.1021/acschembio.7b00444Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, our goal in designing our method was to compare differences in thiol oxidation using a global proteomics approach. MS quantitation is much more reliable for labeled peptides or whole proteins with isotopomeric ions because these species co-chromatograph, fragment identically, and have the same ionization efficiency and therefore can be measured easily and confidently by mass difference using high resolution MS (HRMS). Additionally, a time course experiment recommended by one of the reviewers was conducted, and we saw very little change in oxidation between 20 and 60 min, suggesting that 20 min is a sufficient preincubation time in the future (Fig. S4). Third, rates of reaction of sulfenic acids with thiols have been measured and reported. The most complete and relevant set of rate constants was done with human serum albumin containing a single cysteine sulfenic acid, which was reacted with a variety of thiols (at pH 7.4) (24Alvarez B. Carballal S. Turell L. Radi R. Formation and reactions of sulfenic acid in human serum albumin.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 473 (20513474): 117-13610.1016/S0076-6879(10)73005-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Turell L. Botti H. Carballal S. Ferrer-Sueta G. Souza J.M. Durán R. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Alvarez B. Reactivity of sulfenic acid in human serum albumin.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18078330): 358-36710.1021/bi701520yCrossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 2-Nitro-5-thiobenzoate had a rate constant of 105 m−1 s−1, and the alkyl thiols (cysteine derivatives) yielded rate constants of 2.9–55 m−1 s−1. Dimedone reacted with a sulfenic acid in albumin with a rate constant of 0.027 m−1 s−1. Thus, labeling with dimedone has a deficiency of poor competition with thiols (which will generate disulfides). The main point we emphasize here is that the rapid reaction of pBTD removes the sulfenic acid rapidly (k = 1,700 m−1 s−1) before it can react with a thiol. Moreover, the high concentration of pBTD used (2–5 mm) makes this reaction even more competitive with any thiols in the sample (e.g. with the 10-fold dilution, the GSH concentration would be ≤0.5 mm). Thus, we are of the opinion that the iTORC method is more quantitative in trapping sulfenic acids than dimedone. Admittedly, the rate of reaction of a sulfenic acid with a thiol within a peroxiredoxin or similar antioxidant enzyme is much faster due to approximation (2Portillo-Ledesma S. Randall L.M. Parsonage D. Dalla Rizza J. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Denicola A. Ferrer-Sueta G. Differential kinetics of two-cysteine peroxiredoxin disulfide formation reveal a novel model for peroxide sensing.Biochemistry. 2018; 57 (29553725): 3416-342410.1021/acs.biochem.8b00188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and such labile intermediates would not be trapped with our method. However, these faster disulfide-forming reactions will be detected by quantifying differences between the d7- and d0-ipBTD–modified cysteines. Additionally, comparisons were made between cysteines detected with iTORC and recent studies on sulfenylated proteins and reversibly oxidized cysteine sites utilizing other probes. Sulfenylated proteins (Table S1, cited by gene name) detected with 13C6-d7-modifications showed 5 and 3% overlap with the results of use of the 1H-benzo[c][1,2]thiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide probes from Gupta et al.

Considering that these two data sets both utilized the human RKO adenocarcinoma cell line and had a 26% overlap in sulfenylated protein identifications between each other, the 3–5% overlap observed with mouse hepatocytes in this study is indicative of similarity between basally oxidized proteins across cells of diverse origins and species. A comparison of proteins with basal reversible redox modifications from mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages as reported in Guo et al. (28Guo J. Gaffrey M.J. Su D. Liu T. Camp 2nd, D.G. Smith R.D. Qian W.J. Resin-assisted enrichment of thiols as a general strategy for proteomic profiling of cysteine-based reversible modifications.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 (24336471): 64-7510.1038/nprot.2013.161Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) showed a 12% overlap with proteins detected with d0-modifications (i.e. reversibly oxidized). Of those shared proteins, 38% of cysteine sites were detected to be reversibly oxidized by both methods. Overall, these results demonstrate that the modifications with iTORC are comparable with previously published data sets. Fourth, if the reaction of the sulfenic acid with ipBTD occurs, we would expect to observe a product with an added oxygen (M+16) in our labeling procedure (Scheme S2). However, we have reanalyzed our proteomic data with thiol modifications corresponding to the thioether sulfoxides of each of the three isotopic labels and detected only very low amounts of peptides with such modification (Table S2). If the d7-ipBTD reagent had reacted with any sulfenic acids, we would expect a significant amount of oxidized thiols identified (Cys plus additional mass of 260.1 Da) compared with the reduced alkylation product (Cys plus additional mass of 244.1 Da). We did see some identification with this modification (4.2%), but the level was similar"
https://openalex.org/W2922361824,"There is a growing impetus to increase marine protected areas coverage globally from 6% to 30% in 2030. Successfully establishing and maintaining marine protected areas require incorporating public preferences into their establishment and management. We investigate the role of alternate management regimes (top-down and bottom-up) on preferences for marine protected areas and the marginal rate of substitution between natural and man-made capital using a case study in the Asia-Pacific region of Okinawa, Japan. We implemented a choice experiment survey to infer which attributes of marine protected areas are most important for the respondents. We use our survey results to calculate respondents' willingness to support marine protected areas in Okinawa. This study contributes to the policy debate on management of marine protected areas with empirical data that characterizes the perception of Okinawan residents with respect to the role of local coastal communities (bottom-up) compared to central government based agencies (top-down) management. We extend the analysis and estimate the trade-offs to residents in Okinawa between natural capital (i.e. coral coverage and marine biodiversity attribute) and man-made capital (i.e. restrictions on coastal development). We find that the underlying management regime affects the local residents' valuation of the marine protected area with residents showing a higher willingness to support bottom-up management regimes. There is also substantial differences in the willingness to support different characteristics of marine protected areas by management type. Finally, we find that the marginal rate of substitution between natural capital and man-made capital varies by management type such that residents would need to be compensated relatively less in terms of man-made capital in the presence of a policy scenario that proposes an increase in natural capital under a bottom-up management regime."
https://openalex.org/W2922496093,"Perinatal and newborn complications are major risk factors for unfavorable fetal and neonatal outcomes. Gestational dating and growth monitoring can be instrumental in the identification and management of high-risk pregnancies and births. The INTERGROWTH-21st Project developed the first global standards for gestational dating and fetal and newborn growth monitoring, supplying a toolkit for clinicians. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the first known implementation study of these standards in a low resource setting.The study was performed in two 12-month phases from March 2016 to March 2018 at Jacaranda Health, a private maternity hospital in peri-urban Nairobi, Kenya. In-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a provider survey were utilized to evaluate providers' experiences during implementation. Client chart data, for pregnant women attending antenatal care and/or delivering at Jacaranda Health along with their newborns, were captured to assess uptake and effect of the standards on clinical decision-making.Facility-level support and provider buy-in proved to be critical factors driving the success of implementing the standards. However, additional support was needed to strengthen capacity to conduct and interpret ultrasounds and maintain motivation among providers. We observed a significant increase in the uptake of obstetric ultrasounds, particularly gestational dating, during the implementation of the standards. Although no significant changes were detected in the identification of high-risk pregnancies, referrals and deliveries by Cesarean section during implementation, we did observe a significant reduction in inductions for post-date. No significant barriers were reported regarding the use of the newborn standards. Over 80% of providers advocated for the standards to remain in place with some enhancements related mainly to training, advocacy and procurement.The findings are timely with increasing global adoption of the standards and the challenging and multi-faceted nature of translating new, evidence-based guidelines into routine clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2921008015,"Understanding the critical features of the human brain at multiple time scales is vital for both normal development and disease research. A recently proposed method, the vertex-wise Index of Functional Criticality (vIFC) based on fMRI, has been testified as a sensitive neuroimaging marker to characterize critical transitions of human brain dynamics during Alzheimer's disease progression. However, it remains unclear whether vIFC in healthy brains is associated with neuropsychological and neurophysiological measurements. Using the Nathan Kline Institute/Rockland lifespan cross-sectional datasets and openfMRI single participant longitudinal datasets, we found consistent spatial patterns of vIFC across the entire cortical mantle: the inferior parietal and the precuneus exhibited high vIFC. On a time scale of years, we observed that vIFC increased with age in the left ventral posterior cingulate gyrus. On a time scale of days and weeks, vIFC demonstrated the capacity to identify a link between anxiety and pulse. These results showed that vIFC can serve as a useful neuroimaging marker for detecting physiological, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental transitions. Based on the criticality theory in nonlinear dynamics, the current vIFC study sheds new light on human brain studies from a nonlinear perspective and opens potential new avenues for normal and abnormal human brain studies."
https://openalex.org/W2921411418,"Purpose Aim of present study was to determine whether the currently recommended 13-cm cranio-caudal diameter cut-off on CT for assessment of splenic involvement in lymphoma offers adequate sensitivity and specificity. Materials and Methods Patients with histologically proven lymphoma who had undergone [18F]FDG-PET/CT before therapy were included. Cranio-caudal diameters of the spleen were measured on the CT component of PET/CT, and ROC analyses with calculation of respective areas under the curve (AUC) were used to determine cut-off values of cranio-caudal measurements with their respective sensitivities and specificities, using [18F]FDG-PET as the reference standard. Results In 93 patients, we found a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 47% for the 13-cm splenic diameter cut-off. Conclusions Our results show reasonable, though far from perfect sensitivities and specificities for the currently recommend 13-cm splenic diameter cut-off."
https://openalex.org/W2922329552,"In this paper, we present a production study to explore the controversial question about /l/ velarisation. Measurements of first (F1), second (F2) and third (F3) formant frequencies and the slope of F2 were analysed to clarify the /l/ velarisation behaviour in European Portuguese (EP). The acoustic data were collected from ten EP speakers, producing trisyllabic words with paroxytone stress pattern, with the liquid consonant at the middle of the word in onset, complex onset and coda positions. Results suggested that /l/ is produced on a continuum in EP. The consistently low F2 indicates that /l/ is velarised in all syllable positions, but variation especially in F1 and F3 revealed that /l/ could be ""more velarised"" or ""less velarised"" dependent on syllable positions and vowel contexts. These findings suggest that it is important to consider different acoustic measures to better understand /l/ velarisation in EP."
https://openalex.org/W2922440454,"We investigated the conditioning roles of viral tropism and other variables on plasma HIV RNA levels after 6 months of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in an HIV-infected Italian naïve population using regression tree, random forest regression, and path analysis (PA). Patients in this multicenter observational study were treated with all antiviral drugs that are currently recommended as first-line therapies.Adult patients with chronic HIV infection were enrolled at the beginning of first-line cART (T0). The main variables were age, gender, tropism, ""lcd4_0"" and ""lcd4_6"" (log10 CD4+counts at T0 and after 6 months of cART, respectively), and ""lrna0"" (log10 HIV RNA at T0). Regression tree and random forest analyses were applied. The predictive effect on lrna6 (log10-transformed plasma HIV RNA after 6 months of cART) was also investigated via PA (x4->lcd4_0->lrna0->lrna6) with a treatment selection step included as a dependent (mediator) variable for each third drug and, as predictive covariates, age, female, x4_10, x4_5, lcd4_0, and lrna0. Tropism was assessed in plasma using the Geno2pheno algorithm with 2 false positive rate (FPR) cut-offs: 5% (x4_5) and 10% (x4_10).The study included 571 subjects (21% x4_10 and 10.7% x4_5). The only important predictor of lrna6 was lrna0, and a positive indirect effect of bearing X4 virus in plasma was suggested. A significant direct positive effect of protease inhibitors on lrna6 was found (p = 0.022), and a significant negative effect of integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) was also detected (p = 0.003 for FPR ≤ 5% and p = 0.01 for FPR < 10%). PA predicted mean residual viremias of 40 copies/mL without INSTI and 3 copies/mL with INSTI.PA indicated a possible indirect role of HIV tropism on lrna6 with both FPR < 10% and ≤ 5%. Patients treated with INSTI had a predicted residual viremia of 3 copies/mL."
