The charges generated have to be transferred to a metal oxide (typically titanium oxide), and some of these charge carriers are lost in the transfer. Mei et al. made this process more efficient by growing a more crystalline perovskite with fewer defects inside porous versions of titanium and zirconium oxide. They added a second organic cation that stuck to the pore walls and directed the growth of the perovskite crystals. The improved solar cells operated for more than 1000 hours under full sunlight.

A patterned surface consisting of dense arrays of nanoscale silicon strips, which act as antennae, can be designed to work as transparent optical devices for the manipulation of light. Lin et al. used their versatile patterning technique to create a suite of planar optical elements. By patterning a 100-nm layer of silicon into a dense arrangement of nano-antennae, they were able to fabricate gratings, lenses, and axicons—a device that can add a shape to a propagating light beam.

https://openalex.org/W1990813498,"An ordered draft sequence of the 17-gigabase hexaploid bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) genome has been produced by sequencing isolated chromosome arms. We have annotated 124,201 gene loci distributed nearly evenly across the homeologous chromosomes and subgenomes. Comparative gene analysis of wheat subgenomes and extant diploid and tetraploid wheat relatives showed that high sequence similarity and structural conservation are retained, with limited gene loss, after polyploidization. However, across the genomes there was evidence of dynamic gene gain, loss, and duplication since the divergence of the wheat lineages. A high degree of transcriptional autonomy and no global dominance was found for the subgenomes. These insights into the genome biology of a polyploid crop provide a springboard for faster gene isolation, rapid genetic marker development, and precise breeding to meet the needs of increasing food demand worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2141282191,"The allohexaploid bread wheat genome consists of three closely related subgenomes (A, B, and D), but a clear understanding of their phylogenetic history has been lacking. We used genome assemblies of bread wheat and five diploid relatives to analyze genome-wide samples of gene trees, as well as to estimate evolutionary relatedness and divergence times. We show that the A and B genomes diverged from a common ancestor ~7 million years ago and that these genomes gave rise to the D genome through homoploid hybrid speciation 1 to 2 million years later. Our findings imply that the present-day bread wheat genome is a product of multiple rounds of hybrid speciation (homoploid and polyploid) and lay the foundation for a new framework for understanding the wheat genome as a multilevel phylogenetic mosaic."

https://openalex.org/W1974454876,"How dynein makes the right moves The molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein moves a wide range of different intracellular cargoes. Dynein's activity in vivo requires another protein, dynactin, but exactly why that should be has been very unclear. Although in vitro experiments have provided some evidence that dynactin increases dynein's processivity, the resulting dynein motility has never come close to matching dynein's cargo-transporting activity in living cells. Now, McKenney et al. show that tripartite complexes of dynein, dynactin, and an adaptor molecule are highly processive in vitro, moving the sort of distances that dynein transports cargo in vivo (see the Perspective by Allan).

https://openalex.org/W2078101442,"We produced a reference sequence of the 1-gigabase chromosome 3B of hexaploid bread wheat. By sequencing 8452 bacterial artificial chromosomes in pools, we assembled a sequence of 774 megabases carrying 5326 protein-coding genes, 1938 pseudogenes, and 85% of transposable elements. The distribution of structural and functional features along the chromosome revealed partitioning correlated with meiotic recombination. Comparative analyses indicated high wheat-specific inter- and intrachromosomal gene duplication activities that are potential sources of variability for adaption. In addition to providing a better understanding of the organization, function, and evolution of a large and polyploid genome, the availability of a high-quality sequence anchored to genetic maps will accelerate the identification of genes underlying important agronomic traits."

Averaged over periods of many years, ocean circulation is regular and coherent enough to have been described as a conveyor belt. However, over shorter time scales, irregular, discrete events cause significant amounts of water movement—termed mesoscale eddies. Zhang et al. combined data from thousands of autonomous observational devices called ARGO floats with satellite data. The mesoscale eddies moved around as much ocean water as wind or deepwater currents. Science , this issue p. 322"

https://openalex.org/W2028145262,"Allohexaploid bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) provides approximately 20% of calories consumed by humans. Lack of genome sequence for the three homeologous and highly similar bread wheat genomes (A, B, and D) has impeded expression analysis of the grain transcriptome. We used previously unknown genome information to analyze the cell type–specific expression of homeologous genes in the developing wheat grain and identified distinct co-expression clusters reflecting the spatiotemporal progression during endosperm development. We observed no global but cell type– and stage-dependent genome dominance, organization of the wheat genome into transcriptionally active chromosomal regions, and asymmetric expression in gene families related to baking quality. Our findings give insight into the transcriptional dynamics and genome interplay among individual grain cell types in a polyploid cereal genome."
https://openalex.org/W2094389582,"Superconductivity and superfluidity of fermionic and bosonic systems are remarkable many-body quantum phenomena. In liquid helium and dilute gases, Bose and Fermi superfluidity has been observed separately, but producing a mixture in which both the fermionic and the bosonic components are superfluid is challenging. Here we report on the observation of such a mixture with dilute gases of two Lithium isotopes, 6Li and 7Li. We probe the collective dynamics of this system by exciting center-of-mass oscillations that exhibit extremely low damping below a certain critical velocity. Using high precision spectroscopy of these modes we observe coherent energy exchange and measure the coupling between the two superfluids. Our observations can be captured theoretically using a sum-rule approach that we interpret in terms of two coupled oscillators."

Erk et al. examined the charge migration between individual carbon and iodine atoms during dissociation of iodomethane (ICH 3 ) molecules (see the Perspective by Pratt). After initiating scission of the C-I bond with a relatively low-energy laser pulse, they introduced a higher-energy x-ray pulse to instigate ionization and charge migration. Delaying the arrival time of the x-ray pulse effectively varied the separation distance being probed as the fragments steadily drifted apart. The experimental approach should also prove useful for future studies of charge transfer dynamics in different molecular or solid-state systems. Science , this issue p. 288 ; see also p. 267"
https://openalex.org/W2038444273,"Iodine blooms as an oxidation catalyst Most catalysts for organic oxidation chemistry—whether biochemical or artificial—contain a transition metal like iron or palladium. Uyanik et al. now show that iodine can take the place of a metal in catalyzing efficient oxidative ring closures to make chromans—hexagonal rings incorporating oxygen that are perhaps best known as a constituent of the vitamin E structure (see the Perspective by Nachtsheim). The iodine is added as a salt with a chiral cation, which directs the reaction to form just one of two possible mirror-image variants of the product. Key to the success of the system was the addition of a base, which maintained the viability of an unstable, partially oxidized iodine intermediate critical to the reaction cycle. The results bode well for more general use of iodine salts as asymmetric oxidation-reduction catalysts. Science , this issue p. 291 ; see also p. 270"

An enzyme called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARSs) attaches the correct amino acid to a transfer RNA so that mRNA is accurately translated. Over evolution, additional sequences have been added to AARSs. Lo et al. found a large number of AARS variants in which the domain responsible for enzyme function was deleted. Ninety-four such variants had diverse signaling activities. Thus, AARSs are used both as enzymes and alternately as regulators of signaling pathways. Science , this issue p. 328"

https://openalex.org/W2068080577,"Drinking water distribution systems, including premise plumbing, contain a diverse microbiological community that may include opportunistic pathogens. On-site supplemental disinfection systems have been proposed as a control method for opportunistic pathogens in premise plumbing. The majority of on-site disinfection systems to date have been installed in hospitals due to the high concentration of opportunistic pathogen susceptible occupants. The installation of on-site supplemental disinfection systems in hospitals allows for evaluation of the impact of on-site disinfection systems on drinking water system microbial ecology prior to widespread application. This study evaluated the impact of supplemental monochloramine on the microbial ecology of a hospital's hot water system. Samples were taken three months and immediately prior to monochloramine treatment and monthly for the first six months of treatment, and all samples were subjected to high throughput Illumina 16S rRNA region sequencing. The microbial community composition of monochloramine treated samples was dramatically different than the baseline months. There was an immediate shift towards decreased relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria, and increased relative abundance of Firmicutes, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria. Following treatment, microbial populations grouped by sampling location rather than sampling time. Over the course of treatment the relative abundance of certain genera containing opportunistic pathogens and genera containing denitrifying bacteria increased. The results demonstrate the driving influence of supplemental disinfection on premise plumbing microbial ecology and suggest the value of further investigation into the overall effects of premise plumbing disinfection strategies on microbial ecology and not solely specific target microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2086493732,"Objectives A correct interpretation of sensitization to common allergens is critical in determining susceptibility to allergic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of sensitization to food and inhalant allergens, and their relation to the development of atopic diseases in early childhood. Methods Children aged 0 through 4 years from a birth cohort in the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese Children (PATCH) study were enrolled. Specific IgE antibody against food and inhalant allergens were measured and their association between total serum IgE levels and atopic diseases were assessed. Results A total of 182 children were regular followed up at clinics for a four-year follow-up period. The prevalence of food allergen sensitization increased markedly after 6 months of age, reaching up to 47% at 1.5 years of age and then declined significantly to 10% in parallel with a considerable increase in the prevalence of sensitization to inhalant allergens up to 25% at age 4. Food allergen sensitization appeared to be mainly associated with the elevation of serum total IgE levels before age 2. A combined sensitization to food and inhalant allergens had an additive effect on serum IgE levels after age 2, and was significantly associated with the risk of developing atopic diseases at age 4. Conclusions Sensitization to food occurs early in life, in parallel with the rising prevalence of sensitization to inhalant allergens at older age. A combined sensitization to food and inhalant allergens not only has an additive increase in serum IgE antibody production but also increases the risk of developing allergic respiratory diseases in early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W1986632843,"The focus of this study was to reconstruct a phylogenetic hypothesis for the moth subfamily Arctiinae (tiger moths, woolly bears) to investigate the evolution of larval and adult pharmacophagy of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and the pathway to PA chemical specialization in Arctiinae. Pharmacophagy, collection of chemicals for non-nutritive purposes, is well documented in many species, including the model species Utetheisa ornatrix L. A total of 86 exemplar ingroup species representing tiger moth tribes and subtribes (68 genera) and nine outgroup species were selected. Ingroup species included the most species-rich generic groups to represent the diversity of host-plant associations and pharmacophagous behaviors found throughout Arctiinae. Up to nine genetic markers were sequenced: one mitochondrial (COI barcode region), one nuclear rRNA (D2 region, 28S rRNA), and seven nuclear protein-coding gene fragments: elongation factor 1-α protein, wingless, ribosomal protein subunit S5, carbamoylphosphate synthase domain regions, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. A total of 6984 bp was obtained for most species. These data were analyzed using model-based phylogenetic methods: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). Ancestral pharmacophagous behaviors and obligate PA associations were reconstructed using the resulting Bayes topology and Reconstructing Ancestral States in Phylogenies (RASP) software. Our results corroborate earlier studies on the evolution of adult pharmacophagous behaviors, suggesting that this behavior arose multiple times and is concentrated in the phaegopterine-euchromiine-ctenuchine clade (PEC). Our results suggest that PA specialization may have arisen early in the phylogeny of the subfamily and that facultative larval pharmacophagous behaviors are the derived condition."

Recently, leptin was isolated from saliva; however, its function in the oral cavity is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the physiological role of leptin in the oral cavity by focusing on its effect on wound healing in the oral mucosa.Immunohistochemical analysis was used to examine the expression of the leptin receptor (Ob-R) in human/rabbit oral mucosa. To investigate the effect of leptin on wound healing in the oral mucosa, chemical wounds were created in rabbit oral mucosa, and leptin was topically administered to the wound. The process of wound repair was histologically observed and quantitatively analyzed by measuring the area of ulceration and the duration required for complete healing. The effect of leptin on the proliferation, differentiation and migration of human oral mucosal epithelial cells (RT7 cells) was investigated using crystal violet staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a wound healing assay, respectively.Ob-R was expressed in spinous/granular cells in the epithelial tissue and vascular endothelial cells in the subepithelial connective tissue of the oral mucosa. Topical administration of leptin significantly promoted wound healing and shortened the duration required for complete healing. Histological analysis of gingival tissue beneath the ulceration showed a denser distribution of blood vessels in the leptin-treated group. Although the proliferation and differentiation of RT7 cells were not affected by leptin, the migration of these cells was accelerated in the presence of leptin.Topically administered leptin was shown to promote wound healing in the oral mucosa by accelerating epithelial cell migration and enhancing angiogenesis around the wounded area. These results strongly suggest that topical administration of leptin may be useful as a treatment to promote wound healing in the oral mucosa."

Anthropogenic activities inside the park (past logging activities, current encroachment) and outside its limits (food and cash crops) may impact the amount and distribution of food resources for chimpanzees (frugivorous species) and their spatial distribution within the park. Spatial and temporal patterns of fruit availability were recorded over 18 months at Sebitoli (a site of intermediate chimpanzee density and higher anthropic pressure) with the aim of understanding the factors explaining chimpanzee density there, in comparison to results from two other sites, also in Kibale: Kanyawara (low chimpanzee density) and Ngogo (high density, and furthest from Sebitoli). Because of the post-logging regenerating status of the forest in Sebitoli and Kanyawara, smaller basal area (BA) of fruiting trees most widely consumed by the chimpanzees in Kanyawara and Sebitoli was expected compared to Ngogo (not logged commercially). Due to the distance between sites, spatial and temporal fruit abundance in Sebitoli was expected to be more similar to Kanyawara than to Ngogo. While species functional classes consumed by Sebitoli chimpanzees (foods eaten during periods of high or low fruit abundance) differ from the two other sites, Sebitoli is very similar to Kanyawara in terms of land-cover and consumed species. Among feeding trees, Ficus species are particularly important resources for chimpanzees at Sebitoli, where their basal area is higher than at Kanywara or Ngogo. Ficus species provided a relatively consistent supply of food for chimpanzees throughout the year, and we suggest that this could help to explain the unusually high density of chimpanzees in such a disturbed site."

We modeled the interaction between the multicargo chaperone, SrcA, and SsaN and validated this model using mutagenesis to identify the residues on both the chaperone and ATPase that mediate the interaction. Finally, we quantified the benefit of this molecular interaction on bacterial fitness in vivo using chromosomal exchange of wild-type ssaN with mutants that retain ATPase activity but no longer capture the chaperone.

It is unclear to what extent media campaigns promote cessation within these population groups. This study aims to (1) assess whether exposure to antitobacco advertising is associated with making a quit attempt within a number of population subgroups, and (2) determine whether advertisement type differentialy affects cessation behavior across subgroups. We used data from the New York Adult Tobacco Survey (NY-ATS), a cross-sectional, random-digit-dial telephone survey of adults aged 18 or older in New York State conducted quarterly from 2003 through 2011 (N = 53,706). The sample for this study consists of 9,408 current smokers from the total NY-ATS sample. Regression methods were used to examine the effect of New York State's antismoking advertising, overall and by advertisement type (graphic and/or emotional), on making a quit attempt in the past 12 months. Exposure to antismoking advertising was measured in two ways: gross rating points (a measure of potential exposure) and self-reported confirmed recall of advertisements. This study yields three important findings. First, antismoking advertising promotes quit attempts among racial/ethnic minority smokers and smokers of lower education and income. Second, advertising effectiveness is attributable in part to advertisements with strong graphic imagery or negative emotion. Third, smokers with poor mental health do not appear to benefit from exposure to antismoking advertising of any type. This study contributes to the evidence about how cessation media campaigns can be used most effectively to increase quit attempts within vulnerable subgroups. In particular, it suggests that a general campaign can promote cessation among a range of sociodemographic groups. More research is needed to understand what message strategies might work for those with poor mental health."

Initiation of neuropathic pain requires lysophosphatidic acid receptor signaling.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Recently, our group demonstrated a direct and physiologically relevant interaction of TRPV1 with LPA. By using a combination of electrophysiological and biochemical techniques, we showed that LPA 18:1 and the bromophosphonate analog of LPA (BrP-LPA), which is an antagonist of several of the LPA receptors, activate TRPV1 through a direct interaction with the proximal C-terminal region of the ion channel, a site that is also occupied by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (9.Nieto-Posadas A. Picazo-Juárez G. Llorente I. Jara-Oseguera A. Morales-Lázaro S. Escalante-Alcalde D. Islas L.D. Rosenbaum T. Lysophosphatidic acid directly activates TRPV1 through a C-terminal binding site.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 78-85Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, we were able to observe nocifensive behavior generation when we injected LPA into the paws of mice. This response was diminished in TRPV1 knock-out animals, indicating that LPA can produce acute pain through the activation of TRPV1 (9.Nieto-Posadas A. Picazo-Juárez G. Llorente I. Jara-Oseguera A. Morales-Lázaro S. Escalante-Alcalde D. Islas L.D. Rosenbaum T. Lysophosphatidic acid directly activates TRPV1 through a C-terminal binding site.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 78-85Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, we found that the neutralization of the positively charged residue Lys-710 in the C terminus of the protein rendered the mutant TRPV1-K710Q channels less sensitive to LPA, whereas when the charge was reversed (K710D), the channels were almost completely insensitive to the lipid, indicating that activation of the channel was partly dependent on an electrostatic interaction (9.Nieto-Posadas A.

Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 78-85Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Another lipid that regulates the activity of TRPV1 is PIP2 (15.Lukacs V. Thyagarajan B. Varnai P. Balla A. Balla T. Rohacs T.

The role of PIP2 has been controversial, with one research group suggesting that PIP2 is not necessary for recombinant purified TRPV1 activation in artificial liposomes (19.Cao E.

TRPV1 channels are intrinsically heat sensitive and negatively regulated by phosphoinositide lipids.Neuron. 2013; 77: 667-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown that PIP2 can inhibit TRPV1 function but under conditions where it is incorporated to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (18.Senning E.N. Collins M.D. Stratiievska A. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Gordon S.E. Regulation of TRPV1 by phosphoinositide (4,5)-bisphosphate: role of membrane asymmetry.J. Biol.

However, it is accepted that intracellular PIP2 is necessary for the activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin in biological membranes (20.Stein A.T. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Hua L. Santana L.F. Gordon S.E. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase binds to TRPV1 and mediates NGF-stimulated TRPV1 trafficking to the plasma membrane.J. Gen.

Moreover, similar to what we had previously shown for LPA (9.Nieto-Posadas A. Picazo-Juárez G. Llorente I. Jara-Oseguera A. Morales-Lázaro S. Escalante-Alcalde D. Islas L.D. Rosenbaum T. Lysophosphatidic acid directly activates TRPV1 through a C-terminal binding site.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 78-85Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar), several negatively charged lipids have been shown to positively regulate the activity of TRPV1 (16.Lukacs V. Rives J.M. Sun X. Zakharian E. Rohacs T. Promiscuous activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels by negatively charged intracellular lipids: the key role of endogenous phosphoinositides in maintaining channel activity.J.

We set out to determine the structural requirements for the activation of TRPV1 by lipids similar to LPA, some of which are naturally occurring lysophospholipids. For other channel types and lipids, it has been shown that the length of the acyl chain, the presence or absence of unsaturations, as well as the nature of the headgroup charge linked with the acyl chain can influence the effect of these molecules on ion channel function. For example, M-type potassium channels are activated by a large variety of lipid phosphates with minimum requirements for acyl chain and the presence of a phosphate headgroup (22.Telezhkin V. Reilly J.M. Thomas A.M. Tinker A. Brown D.A. Structural requirements of membrane phospholipids for M-type potassium channel activation and binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10001-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Telezhkin V. Brown D.A. Gibb A.J. Distinct subunit contributions to the activation of M-type potassium channels by PI(4,5)P2.J. Gen. Physiol. 2012; 140: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we have evaluated the impact of the LPA structural motifs, the hydrocarbon chain, the glycerol backbone, and the phosphate headgroup, on the structure-activity relationship of TRPV1 activation, and we have delineated the minimum requirements for agonist activity in this family of compounds. HEK293 cells expressing large T antigen were transfected with WT rTRPV1 or the TRPV1-K710D mutant together with pIRES-GFP (BD Biosciences) using JetPEI (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) following the suppliers' methods. Inside-out clamp recordings of TRPV1 were made using Ca2+-free symmetrical solutions consisting of 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and 1 mm EDTA. Solutions were changed with an RSC-200 rapid solution changer (BioLogic Science Instruments, Claix, France). The acyl forms of LPA 18:1, LPA 18:0, LPA 6:0, cyclic phosphatidic acid (CPA) 18:1, dioleoylglycerophosphate (DGPP) 18:1, and the ether lipid analogs of LPA alkylglycerophosphate (AGP) 18:1 and 16:0 were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL); LPA 18:2 was purchased from Echelon Biosciences, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Oleic acid and glycerol phosphate were purchased from Sigma. The fatty acid phosphates and thiophosphates (FAP) were synthesized as described in the supplemental methods (24Gududuru, V., (April 1, 2014) U. S. Patent 8, 686,177 B2,Google Scholar), and FAP-1–11 analogs were synthesized as described previously (25.Durgam G.G. Virag T. Walker M.D. Tsukahara R. Yasuda S. Liliom K. van Meeteren L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Wilke N. Siess W. Tigyi G. Miller D.D. Synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and biological evaluation of fatty alcohol phosphates as lysophosphatidic acid receptor ligands, activators of PPARγ, and inhibitors of autotaxin.J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4919-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All lipids were prepared as 5 or 10 mm stocks in DMEM, 1% fatty acid-free BSA as reported previously (9.Nieto-Posadas A. Picazo-Juárez G. Llorente I. Jara-Oseguera A. Morales-Lázaro S. Escalante-Alcalde D. Islas L.D. Rosenbaum T. Lysophosphatidic acid directly activates TRPV1 through a C-terminal binding site.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 78-85Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All stocks were frozen for a week, then sonicated during 30 min before use, and then diluted in recording solutions and resonicated in a Branson (Danbury, CT) 1510 sonicator. Evoked currents from TRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells were low-pass filtered at 2.9 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz with an EPC 10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Pfalz, Germany). Inside-out patches were held at 0 mV, and voltage was then stepped from 0 to −120 to 120 mV for 100 ms in 10-mV increments and then returned to 0 mV. All recordings were performed at room temperature (19 ± 3 °C). Currents obtained in the presence of the different lipids were normalized to the maximal current obtained with a saturating (4 μm) capsaicin concentration (I/Imax). To perform dose-response curves, a given concentration of the lipid was applied to a TRPV1-expressing membrane patch, and currents were measured and normalized to the maximal current obtained in the presence of 4 μm capsaicin. A single concentration of lipid was used to obtain the average for activation from several different membrane patches for each point in the dose-response curves, and then the data were fitted to the Hill equation, as described previously (26.Rosenbaum T. Gordon S.E. Dissecting intersubunit contacts in cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels.Neuron. 2002; 33: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Data were acquired and analyzed with PULSE software (HEKA Elektronik) and were plotted and analyzed with programs written using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc., Portland, OR). Surface proteins were obtained from HEK293 cells transiently expressing TRPV1 channels using the cell surface isolation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the overlay assay, lipids were dissolved in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 1% fatty acid-free BSA and prepared as 10 mm stocks and spotted (100 nmol/spot) onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was air-dried for 1 h at room temperature and blocked with PBS containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 1% fatty acid-free BSA for 2 h with gentle shaking. After washing twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the membrane was incubated with the surface protein solution containing 10–20 μg of total surface protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL® (Sigma), 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.5% BSA at 4 °C for 48 h with shaking. After three washes with PBS-T, the membranes were incubated with anti-TRPV1 antibody (1:500; sc-12498, P-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS-T with 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. Finally, following three more washes with PBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-goat antibody, and the binding of lipids to TRPV1 was visualized by chemiluminescence by exposing the blot for 15 min (Amersham Biosciences). For assays with LPA-coated beads, plasma membrane protein extracts were incubated with LPA beads or with control beads (Echelon Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed five times with binding buffer containing 0.5% IGEPAL® (Sigma). For competition assays, protein extracts were previously incubated with 10 μm FAP-4 lipid for 2 h. Proteins pulled down from each sample were eluted from the beads by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer to the beads and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot assays using an anti-TRPV1 (sc-12498, P-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. In every experiment, a small sample of the total membrane protein extract was loaded to the gel as a positive control for TRPV1 protein expression (lane 1 in Fig. 3C). Immunoblots were developed by ECL reagent, and densitometric analysis was done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and expressed as relative protein levels versus the amount of TRPV1 bound to LPA beads (9.Nieto-Posadas A. Picazo-Juárez G. Llorente I. Jara-Oseguera A. Morales-Lázaro S. Escalante-Alcalde D. Islas L.D. Rosenbaum T. Lysophosphatidic acid directly activates TRPV1 through a C-terminal binding site.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 78-85Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis for the overlay assays was performed also by using the ImageJ software, although these assays are not strictly quantitative. The flexible alignment models were created with the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2011.10 from Chemical Computing Group (Montreal, Canada). Active compounds were aligned with the flexible alignment module implemented in MOE using default parameters. The alignment with the lowest alignment score S and average strain energy score U were selected. The active alignment model was then fixed, and inactive compounds were separately aligned with the flexible alignment module using the same settings. The final conformation for each compound was selected on the basis of the compound's lowest energy strain and overlap of molecular features. Pharmacophore modeling was performed using the pharmacophore query editor function in MOE. Models were manually created using the lowest energy conformation of the flexibly aligned models. The pharmacophore points (one anionic group and two hydrophobic groups) were identified as those structural features of the active compounds also sharing a common volume. Monte Carlo conformational analysis of lipids was carried out using the Multiple Minimum program in the MacroModel suite of software Version 9.7 (Schrödinger Inc., Surrey, UK). Coordinates of LPA 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2 were obtained from sdf files found at the PubChem database (CID: 9547179, 5311263, and 53478601). A 10,000-step conformational search was performed on the three molecules using the OPLS-2005 force field and the water solvation model (27.Movahed P. Jönsson B.A. Birnir B. Wingstrand J.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38496-38504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conformers were selected using a 3.0 kcal/mol energy cutoff and pooled into geometrically similar families based on the root mean square difference between corresponding torsion angles in pairs of structures using XCluster. The structures of monomers of the TRPV1 channel in either the closed (PDB code 3J5P-B) or open (PDB code 3J5Q-D) state were used as templates for docking the most abundant structural conformations of 18-carbon LPAs. Residues 361–719 were used in both cases because the binding of PIP2 (17.Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Klein R.M. Hua L. Angueyra J. Gordon S.E. Localization of the PIP2 sensor of TRPV1 ion channels.J. Biol.

Olson A.J. Goodsell D.S. A semiempirical free energy force field with charge-based desolvation.J. Comput. Chem. 2007; 28: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar) with a Lamarckian genetic algorithm allowing flexibility to Lys-710 and the lipids. Figures were prepared in PyMOL with the Autodock/Vina plugin (30.Seeliger D. de Groot B.L. Ligand docking and binding site analysis with PyMOL and Autodock/Vina.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2010; 24: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Statistical comparisons were made with a one-way analysis of variance test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Group data are reported as the mean ± S.E. Our approach to a comprehensive study of the structural requirements of the lipid ligands necessary to activate TRPV1 was based on the designation of five motifs in the LPA scaffold as follows: 1) the glycerol backbone and its substitutions; 2) the bond of the hydrocarbon chain to the headgroup; 3) the position and number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain; 4) the length of the hydrocarbon chain, and 5) the nature of the negatively charged headgroup. As shown previously (9.Nieto-Posadas A. Picazo-Juárez G. Llorente I. Jara-Oseguera A. Morales-Lázaro S. Escalante-Alcalde D. Islas L.D. Rosenbaum T. Lysophosphatidic acid directly activates TRPV1 through a C-terminal binding site.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 78-85Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar), LPA 18:1 (5 μm) activated TRPV1 currents nearly as efficiently as 4 μm capsaicin (Fig. 1, A and E). To begin to determine the nature of the requirements for activation of TRPV1 by LPA, we investigated what effect the lack of a double bond or the presence of more than one double bond in the hydrocarbon chain would have on TRPV1 activation. For this purpose, we used commercially available saturated LPA 18:0 (5 μm) and LPA 18:2 (5 μm). To our surprise, although structurally similar to LPA 18:1, both LPA 18:0 and LPA 18:2 failed to activate the channel (Fig. 1, B and C, red traces, and E). Moreover, FAP-7, a synthetic analog with an 18:2 fatty alcohol chain also failed to activate TRPV1 (Fig. 1, D, red trace, and E), consistent with the result we obtained with LPA 18:2. Additionally, both LPA 18:0 and LPA 18:2 failed to activate TRPV1 even at concentrations as high as 25 μm (Table 1), the highest concentration we could use without breaking the membrane patches. These data suggested that the absence of an unsaturation or the presence of more than one unsaturation leads to a lack of activation of TRPV1 by lipids with these structural features.TABLE 1Summary of the pharmacological profile of lipids and role on TRPV1 activity Using an overlay assay, we detected an interaction of LPA 18:1, LPA 18:2, and the fatty alcohol thiophosphate FAP-7 can also interact with TRPV1 (Fig. 1, F and G). However, this interaction does not ensure changes in the function of TRPV1, supporting the idea that lipid-protein interactions that lead to activation of the channel depend tightly on the structural features of the lipid. We then tested another commercially available saturated lipid, CPA 16:0, and two naturally occurring unsaturated lipids, CPA 18:1 that is found in serum (31.Kobayashi T. Tanaka-Ishii R. Taguchi R.

https://openalex.org/W2051406887,"The Hippo signaling pathway has recently moved to center stage in cardiac research because of its key role in cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration of the embryonic and newborn heart. However, its role in the adult heart is incompletely understood. We investigate here the role of mammalian Ste20-like kinase 2 (Mst2), one of the central regulators of this pathway. Mst2(-/-) mice showed no alteration in cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, Mst2(-/-) mice exhibited a significant reduction of hypertrophy and fibrosis in response to pressure overload. Consistently, overexpression of MST2 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes significantly enhanced phenylephrine-induced cellular hypertrophy. Mechanistically, Mst2 positively modulated the prohypertrophic Raf1-ERK1/2 pathway. However, activation of the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway (Yes-associated protein) was not affected by Mst2 ablation. An initial genetic study in mitral valve prolapse patients revealed an association between a polymorphism in the human MST2 gene and adverse cardiac remodeling. These results reveal a novel role of Mst2 in stress-dependent cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in the adult mouse and likely human heart."

This study investigated the incidence of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum using routine data to help focus malaria interventions.To estimate incidence, the study modelled utilisation of the public health sector using fever treatment data from the 2012 national Malaria Indicator Survey. A probabilistic measure of attendance was applied to population density metrics to define the proportion of the population within catchment of a public health facility. Malaria data were used in a Bayesian spatio-temporal conditional-autoregressive model with ecological or environmental covariates, to examine the spatial and temporal variation of incidence.From the analysis of healthcare utilisation, over 80% of the population was within 2 hours' travel of the nearest public health facility, while 64.4% were within 30 minutes' travel. The mean incidence of P. vivax in 2009 was 5.4 (95% Crl 3.2-9.2) cases per 1000 population compared to 1.2 (95% Crl 0.4-2.9) cases per 1000 population for P. falciparum. P. vivax peaked in August while P. falciparum peaked in November. 32% of the estimated 30.5 million people lived in regions where annual incidence was at least 1 case per 1,000 population of P. vivax; 23.7% of the population lived in areas where annual P. falciparum case incidence was at least 1 per 1000.This study showed how routine data can be combined with household survey data to model malaria incidence. The incidence of both P. vivax and P. falciparum in Afghanistan remain low but the co-distribution of both parasites and the lag in their peak season provides challenges to malaria control in Afghanistan. Future improved case definition to determine levels of imported risks may be useful for the elimination ambitions in Afghanistan."
https://openalex.org/W2319208116,"Atypical PKC (aPKC) isoforms are activated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-(PO4)3 (PIP3). How PIP3 activates aPKC is unknown. Although Akt activation involves PIP3 binding to basic residues in the Akt pleckstrin homology domain, aPKCs lack this domain. Here we examined the role of basic arginine residues common to aPKC pseudosubstrate sequences. Replacement of all five (or certain) arginine residues in the pseudosubstrate sequence of PKC-ι by site-directed mutagenesis led to constitutive activation and unresponsiveness to PIP3 in vitro or insulin in vivo. However, with the addition of the exogenous arginine-containing pseudosubstrate tridecapeptide to inhibit this constitutively active PKC-ι, PIP3-activating effects were restored. A similar restoration of responsiveness to PIP3 was seen when exogenous pseudosubstrate was used to inhibit mouse liver PKC-λ/ζ maximally activated by insulin or ceramide and a truncated, constitutively active PKC-ζ mutant lacking all regulatory domain elements and containing ""activating"" glutamate residues at loop and autophosphorylation sites (Δ1-247/T410E/T560E-PKC-ζ). NMR studies suggest that PIP3 binds directly to the pseudosubstrate. The ability of PIP3 to counteract the inhibitory effects of the exogenous pseudosubstrate suggests that basic residues in the pseudosubstrate sequence are required for maintaining aPKCs in an inactive state and are targeted by PIP3 for displacement from the substrate-binding site during kinase activation."

https://openalex.org/W2106183952,"Introduction Accurate, continuous, left ventricular stroke volume (SV) measurements can convey large amounts of information about patient hemodynamic status and response to therapy. However, direct measurements are highly invasive in clinical practice, and current procedures for estimating SV require specialized devices and significant approximation. Method This study investigates the accuracy of a three element Windkessel model combined with an aortic pressure waveform to estimate SV. Aortic pressure is separated into two components capturing; 1) resistance and compliance, 2) characteristic impedance. This separation provides model-element relationships enabling SV to be estimated while requiring only one of the three element values to be known or estimated. Beat-to-beat SV estimation was performed using population-representative optimal values for each model element. This method was validated using measured SV data from porcine experiments (N = 3 female Pietrain pigs, 29–37 kg) in which both ventricular volume and aortic pressure waveforms were measured simultaneously. Results The median difference between measured SV from left ventricle (LV) output and estimated SV was 0.6 ml with a 90% range (5th–95th percentile) −12.4 ml–14.3 ml. During periods when changes in SV were induced, cross correlations in between estimated and measured SV were above R = 0.65 for all cases. Conclusion The method presented demonstrates that the magnitude and trends of SV can be accurately estimated from pressure waveforms alone, without the need for identification of complex physiological metrics where strength of correlations may vary significantly from patient to patient."

The glycans on fibrils are produced by virally encoded enzymes, organized in gene clusters. Like Mimivirus, Megavirus glycans are mainly composed of virally synthesized N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). They also contain N-acetylrhamnosamine (RhaNAc), a rare sugar; the enzymes involved in its synthesis are encoded by a gene cluster specific to Megavirus close relatives. We combined activity assays on two enzymes of the pathway with mass spectrometry and NMR studies to characterize their specificities. Mg534 is a 4,6-dehydratase 5-epimerase; its three-dimensional structure suggests that it belongs to a third subfamily of inverting dehydratases. Mg535, next in the pathway, is a bifunctional 3-epimerase 4-reductase. The sequential activity of the two enzymes leads to the formation of UDP-l-RhaNAc. This study is another example of giant viruses performing their glycan synthesis using enzymes different from their cellular counterparts, raising again the question of the origin of these pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2071356588,"Previous study indicated that the multi-resistance gene cfr was mainly found in gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Enterococcus, and was sporadically detected in Escherichia coli. Little is known about the prevalence and transmission mechanism of cfr in E. coli. In this study, the presence of cfr in E. coli isolates collected during 2010–2012 from food-producing animals in Guangdong Province of China was investigated, and the cfr-positive E. coli isolates were characterized by PFGE, plasmid profiling, and genetic environment analysis. Of the 839 E. coli isolates, 10 isolates from pig were cfr positive. All the cfr-positive isolates presented a multi-resistance phenotype and were genetically divergent as determined by PFGE. In 8 out of the 10 strains, the cfr gene was located on plasmids of ∼30 kb. Restriction digestion of the plasmids with EcoRI and sequence hybridization with a cfr-specific probe revealed that the cfr-harboring fragments ranged from 6 to 23 kb and a ∼18 kb cfr-carrying fragment was common for the plasmids that were ∼30 kb. Four different genetic environments of cfr were detected, in which cfr is flanked by two identical copies of IS26, which may loop out the intervening sequence through homologous recombination. Among the 8 plasmids of ∼30 kb, 7 plasmids shared the same genetic environment. These results demonstrate plasmid-carried cfr in E. coli and suggest that transposition and homologous recombination mediated by IS26 might have played a rule in the transfer of the cfr gene in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1979257688,"Objective Otitis media is one of the most common pediatric infections. While it is usually treated without difficulty, up to 20% of children may progress to long-term complications that include hearing loss, impaired speech and language development, academic underachievement, and irreversible disease. Hyperplasia of middle ear mucosa contributes to the sequelae of acute otitis media and is of important clinical significance. Understanding the role of growth factors in the mediation of mucosal hyperplasia could lead to the development of new therapeutic interventions for this disease and its sequelae. Methods From a whole genome gene array analysis of mRNA expression during acute otitis media, we identified growth factors with expression kinetics temporally related to hyperplasia. We then tested these factors for their ability to stimulate mucosal epithelial growth in vitro, and determined protein levels and histological distribution in vivo for active factors. Results From the gene array, we identified seven candidate growth factors with upregulation of mRNA expression kinetics related to mucosal hyperplasia. Of the seven, only HB-EGF (heparin-binding-epidermal growth factor) induced significant mucosal epithelial hyperplasia in vitro. Subsequent quantification of HB-EGF protein expression in vivo via Western blot analysis confirmed that the protein is highly expressed from 6 hours to 24 hours after bacterial inoculation, while immunohistochemistry revealed production by middle ear epithelial cells and infiltrating lymphocytes. Conclusion Our data suggest an active role for HB-EGF in the hyperplasia of the middle ear mucosal epithelium during otitis media. These results imply that therapies targeting HB-EGF could ameliorate mucosal growth during otitis media, and thereby reduce detrimental sequelae of this childhood disease."
https://openalex.org/W2136783171,"Methanol (MeOH) is considered to be a poison in humans because of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-mediated conversion of MeOH to formaldehyde (FA), which is toxic. Our recent genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain demonstrated that an increase in endogenous MeOH after ADH inhibition led to a significant increase in the plasma MeOH concentration and a modification of mRNA synthesis. These findings suggest endogenous MeOH involvement in homeostasis regulation by controlling mRNA levels. Here, we demonstrate directly that study volunteers displayed increasing concentrations of MeOH and FA in their blood plasma when consuming citrus pectin, ethanol and red wine. A microarray analysis of white blood cells (WBC) from volunteers after pectin intake showed various responses for 30 significantly differentially regulated mRNAs, most of which were somehow involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There was also a decreased synthesis of hemoglobin mRNA, HBA and HBB, the presence of which in WBC RNA was not a result of red blood cells contamination because erythrocyte-specific marker genes were not significantly expressed. A qRT-PCR analysis of volunteer WBCs after pectin and red wine intake confirmed the complicated relationship between the plasma MeOH content and the mRNA accumulation of both genes that were previously identified, namely, GAPDH and SNX27, and genes revealed in this study, including MME, SORL1, DDIT4, HBA and HBB. We hypothesized that human plasma MeOH has an impact on the WBC mRNA levels of genes involved in cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1968132653,"Introduction In the work up of primary solid liver lesions it is essential to differentiate correctly between benign and malignant tumors, such as hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) respectively. A promising new marker to detect HCC is Golgi Protein 73 (GP73). Studies comparing patients with HCC and cirrhosis with normal controls suggested that GP73 is specific for patients with HCC; however, patients with other liver tumors were not included. We therefore studied the predictive value of GP73 in differentiating between solid benign and malignant liver tumors. Materials and Methods This study included 264 patients: 88 patients with HCC, 88 with hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), and 88 with focal nodal hyperplasia (FNH). A blood sample was collected from each patient to measure GP73 levels using a quantitative ELISA assay and differences in outcome between subgroups were compared. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity and specificity of GP73 were calculated and compared to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. Results When comparing malignant and benign liver tumors the area under ROC was 0.701 and 0.912 for GP73 and AFP respectively. Test characteristics revealed a sensitivity of 60% for GP73 and 65% for AFP; in addition the specificity was 77% for GP73 and 96% for AFP. Conclusion Although the literature suggests that GP73 is a valuable serum marker in patients with HCC, the serum concentration may also be increased in patients with solid benign liver tumors. Therefore, a GP73 assay is less suitable for discriminating between primary malignant and benign tumors of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2064075580,"Angiosperms are renown for their diversity of flower colors. Often considered adaptations to pollinators, the most common underlying pigments, anthocyanins, are also involved in plants' stress response. Although the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway is well characterized across many angiosperms and is composed of a few candidate genes, the consequences of blocking this pathway and producing white flowers has not been investigated at the transcriptome scale. We take a transcriptome-wide approach to compare expression differences between purple and white petal buds in the arctic mustard, Parrya nudicaulis, to determine which genes' expression are consistently correlated with flower color. Using mRNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly, we assembled an average of 722 bp per gene (49.81% coding sequence based on the A. thaliana homolog) for 12,795 genes from the petal buds of a pair of purple and white samples. Our results correlate strongly with qRT-PCR analysis of nine candidate genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway where chalcone synthase has the greatest difference in expression between color morphs (P/W = ∼7×). Among the most consistently differentially expressed genes between purple and white samples, we found 3× more genes with higher expression in white petals than in purple petals. These include four unknown genes, two drought-response genes (CDSP32, ERD5), a cold-response gene (GR-RBP2), and a pathogen defense gene (DND1). Gene ontology analysis of the top 2% of genes with greater expression in white relative to purple petals revealed enrichment in genes associated with stress responses including cold, drought and pathogen defense. Unlike the uniform downregulation of chalcone synthase that may be directly involved in the loss of petal anthocyanins, the variable expression of several genes with greater expression in white petals suggest that the physiological and ecological consequences of having white petals may be microenvironment-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2042577930,"The retrieval-extinction paradigm, which disrupts the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans, is a non-invasive technique that can be used to prevent the return of fear in humans. In the present study, unconditioned stimulus revaluation was applied in the retrieval-extinction paradigm to investigate its promotion of conditioned fear extinction in the memory reconsolidation window after participants acquired conditioned fear. This experiment comprised three stages (acquisition, unconditioned stimulus revaluation, retrieval-extinction) and three methods for indexing fear (unconditioned stimulus expectancy, skin conductance response, conditioned stimulus pleasure rating). After the acquisition phase, we decreased the intensity of the unconditioned stimulus in one group (devaluation) and maintained constant for the other group (control). The results indicated that both groups exhibited similar levels of unconditioned stimulus expectancy, but the devaluation group had significantly smaller skin conductance responses and exhibited a growth in conditioned stimulus + pleasure. Thus, our findings indicate unconditioned stimulus revaluation effectively promoted the extinction of conditioned fear within the memory reconsolidation window."
https://openalex.org/W2065808295,"Eugenol is a plant-derived phenolic compound which has recognised therapeutical potential as an antifungal agent. However little is known of either its fungicidal activity or the mechanisms employed by fungi to tolerate eugenol toxicity. A better exploitation of eugenol as a therapeutic agent will therefore depend on addressing this knowledge gap. Eugenol initiates increases in cytosolic Ca2+ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is partly dependent on the plasma membrane calcium channel, Cch1p. However, it is unclear whether a toxic cytosolic Ca2+elevation mediates the fungicidal activity of eugenol. In the present study, no significant difference in yeast survival was observed following transient eugenol treatment in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, using yeast expressing apoaequorin to report cytosolic Ca2+ and a range of eugenol derivatives, antifungal activity did not appear to be coupled to Ca2+ influx or cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Taken together, these results suggest that eugenol toxicity is not dependent on a toxic influx of Ca2+. In contrast, careful control of extracellular Ca2+ (using EGTA or BAPTA) revealed that tolerance of yeast to eugenol depended on Ca2+ influx via Cch1p. These findings expose significant differences between the antifungal activity of eugenol and that of azoles, amiodarone and carvacrol. This study highlights the potential to use eugenol in combination with other antifungal agents that exhibit differing modes of action as antifungal agents to combat drug resistant infections."
https://openalex.org/W2170499866,"People can perceive misfortunes as caused by previous bad deeds (immanent justice reasoning) or resulting in ultimate compensation (ultimate justice reasoning). Across two studies, we investigated the relation between these types of justice reasoning and identified the processes (perceptions of deservingness) that underlie them for both others (Study 1) and the self (Study 2). Study 1 demonstrated that observers engaged in more ultimate (vs. immanent) justice reasoning for a “good” victim and greater immanent (vs. ultimate) justice reasoning for a “bad” victim. In Study 2, participants' construals of their bad breaks varied as a function of their self-worth, with greater ultimate (immanent) justice reasoning for participants with higher (lower) self-esteem. Across both studies, perceived deservingness of bad breaks or perceived deservingness of ultimate compensation mediated immanent and ultimate justice reasoning respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2076418083,"Neuroblastomas (NBs) are a clinically heterogeneous group of extra cranial pediatric tumors. Patients with high-risk, metastatic NBs have a long-term survival rate of below 40%, and are often resistant to current therapeutic modalities. Due to toxic side effects associated with radiation and chemotherapies, development of new agents is warranted to overcome resistance and effectively treat this disease in clinic. CARP-1 functional mimetics (CFMs) are an emerging class of small molecule compounds that inhibit growth of diverse cancer cell types. Here we investigated NB inhibitory potential of CFMs and the molecular mechanisms involved. CFM-1, -4, and -5 inhibited NB cell growth, in vitro, independent of their p53 and MYCN status. CFM-4 and -5 induced apoptosis in NB cells in part by activating pro-apoptotic stress-activated kinases (SAPKs) p38 and JNK, stimulating CARP-1 expression and cleavage of PARP1, while promoting loss of the oncogenes C and N-myc as well as mitotic cyclin B1. Treatments of NB cells with CFM-4 or -5 also resulted in loss of Inhibitory κB (IκB) α and β proteins. Micro-RNA profiling revealed upregulation of XIAP-targeting miR513a-3p in CFM-4-treated NB, mesothelioma, and breast cancer cells. Moreover, exposure of NB and breast cancer cells to CFM-4 or -5 resulted in diminished expression of anti-apoptotic XIAP1, cIAP1, and Survivin proteins. Expression of anti-miR513a-5p or miR513a-5p mimic, however, interfered with or enhanced, respectively, the breast cancer cell growth inhibition by CFM-4. CFMs also impacted biological properties of the NB cells by blocking their abilities to migrate, form colonies in suspension, and invade through the matrix-coated membranes. Our studies indicate anti-NB properties of CFM-4 and 5, and suggest that these CFMs and/or their future analogs have potential as anti-NB agents."
https://openalex.org/W2010707442,"Lipase maturation factor 1 (Lmf1) is a critical determinant of plasma lipid metabolism, as demonstrated by severe hypertriglyceridemia associated with its mutations in mice and human subjects. Lmf1 is a chaperone localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and required for the post-translational maturation and activation of several vascular lipases. Despite its importance in plasma lipid homeostasis, the regulation of Lmf1 remains unexplored. We report here that Lmf1 expression is induced by ER stress in various cell lines and in tunicamycin (TM)-injected mice. Using genetic deficiencies in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mouse liver, we identified the Atf6α arm of the unfolded protein response as being responsible for the up-regulation of Lmf1 in ER stress. Experiments with luciferase reporter constructs indicated that ER stress activates the Lmf1 promoter through a GC-rich DNA sequence 264 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. We demonstrated that Atf6α is sufficient to induce the Lmf1 promoter in the absence of ER stress, and this effect is mediated by the TM-responsive cis-regulatory element. Conversely, Atf6α deficiency induced by genetic ablation or a dominant-negative form of Atf6α abolished TM stimulation of the Lmf1 promoter. In conclusion, our results indicate that Lmf1 is an unfolded protein response target gene, and Atf6α signaling is sufficient and necessary for activation of the Lmf1 promoter. Importantly, the induction of Lmf1 by ER stress appears to be a general phenomenon not restricted to lipase-expressing cells, which suggests a lipase-independent cellular role for this protein in ER homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2034155914,"The Toll and IMD pathways are known to be induced upon Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum infection, respectively. It is unclear how Plasmodium or other pathogens in the blood meal and their invasion of the midgut epithelium would trigger the innate immune responses in immune cells, in particular hemocytes. Gap junctions, which can mediate both cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular communication, may participate in this signal transduction. This study examined whether innexins, gap junction proteins in insects, are involved in anti-Plasmodium responses in Anopheles gambiae. Inhibitor studies using carbenoxolone indicated that blocking innexons resulted in an increase in Plasmodium oocyst number and infection prevalence. This was accompanied by a decline in TEP1 levels in carbenoxolone-treated mosquitoes. Innexin AGAP001476 mRNA levels in midguts were induced during Plasmodium infection and a knockdown of AGAP001476, but not AGAP006241, caused an induction in oocyst number. Silencing AGAP001476 caused a concurrent increase in vitellogenin levels, a TEP1 inhibitor, in addition to a reduced level of TEP1-LRIM1-APL1C complex in hemolymph. Both vitellogenin and TEP1 are regulated by Cactus under the Toll pathway. Simultaneous knockdown of cactus and AGAP001476 failed to reverse the near refractoriness induced by the knockdown of cactus, suggesting that the AGAP001476-mediated anti-Plasmodium response is Cactus-dependent. These data demonstrate a critical role for innexin AGAP001476 in mediating innate immune responses against Plasmodium through Toll pathway in mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2020947650,"The central nucleus of amygdala plays an important role mediating fear and anxiety responses. It is known that oxytocin microinjections into the central nucleus of amygdala induce hypergrooming, an experimental model of compulsive behavior. We evaluated the behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses of conscious rats microinjected with oxytocin into the central nucleus of amygdala.Male Wistar rats were implanted with guide cannulae into the central nucleus of amygdala and microinjected with oxytocin (0.5 µg, 1 µg) or saline. After 24 h, rats had a catheter implanted into the femoral artery for pulsatile arterial pressure measurement. The pulsatile arterial pressure was recorded at baseline conditions and data used for cardiovascular variability and baroreflex sensitivity analysis. Respiratory and behavioral parameters were assessed during this data collection session.Microinjections of oxytocin (0.5 µg) into the central nucleus of amygdala produced hypergrooming behavior but did not change cardiorespiratory parameters. However, hypergrooming evoked by microinjections of oxytocin (1 µg) into the central nucleus of amygdala was accompanied by increase in arterial pressure, heart rate and ventilation and augmented the power of low and high (respiratory-related) frequency bands of the systolic arterial pressure spectrum. No changes were observed in power of the low and high frequency bands of the pulse interval spectrum. Baroreflex sensitivity was found lower after oxytocin microinjections, demonstrating that the oxytocin-induced pressor response may involve an inhibition of baroreflex pathways and a consequent facilitation of sympathetic outflow to the cardiovascular system.The microinjection of oxytocin (1 µg) into the central nucleus of amygdala not only induces hypergrooming but also changes cardiorespiratory parameters. Moreover, specific oxytocin receptor antagonism attenuated hypergrooming but did not affect pressor, tachycardic and ventilatory responses to oxytocin, suggesting the involvement of distinct neural pathways."

Various reports showed that some thermophilic B-family DNA polymerases, particularly KOD and Phusion DNA polymerases, accepted LNA-nucleoside 5′-triphosphates as substrates. In this study, we investigated the docking of LNA nucleotides in the active sites of RB69 and KOD DNA polymerases by molecular docking simulations. The study revealed that the incoming LNA-TTP is bound in the active site of the RB69 and KOD DNA polymerases in a manner similar to that seen in the case of dTTP, and with LNA structure, there is no other option than the locked C3′-endo conformation which in fact helps better orienting within the active site."

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is considered to be the prototype for these NIMPs-related diseases; however, there is no consensus on the definitions or diagnostic criteria for HP and the spectrum of related illnesses.In order to identify the possible diagnostic markers for illnesses associated with NIMPs in alveolar lining fluid, we performed a proteomic analysis using a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with exposure to NIMPs in the context of damp building-related illness (DBRI) or conditions on the borderline to acute HP, designated here as agricultural type of microbial exposure (AME). Samples from patients with HP and sarcoidosis (SARC) were included for reference. Results were compared to results of healthy subjects (CTR). Western blot was used for validation of potential marker proteins from BAL fluid and plasma. Protein expression patterns suggest a close similarity between AME and HP, while DBRI was similar to CTR. However, in DBRI the levels of the inflammation associated molecules galectin-3 and alpha-1-antitrypsin were increased. A novel finding emerging from this study was the increases of semenogelin levels in BAL fluid from patients with AME, HP and SARC. Histone 4 levels were increased in AME, HP and SARC. Elevated plasma levels of histone 2B were detected in HP and SARC, suggesting it to be a potential blood indicator for inflammatory diseases of the lungs.In this study, the proteomic changes in bronchoalveolar lavage of DBRI patients were distinct from other NIMP exposure associated lung diseases, while changes in AME overlapped those observed for HP patient samples. Some of the proteins identified in this study, semenogelin and histone 4, could function as diagnostic markers for differential diagnosis between DBRI and HP-like conditions."
