https://openalex.org/W2105182699,"Specialized oxygen-sensing cells in the nervous system generate rapid behavioural responses to oxygen. We show here that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a strong behavioural preference for 5-12% oxygen, avoiding higher and lower oxygen levels. 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a common second messenger in sensory transduction and is implicated in oxygen sensation. Avoidance of high oxygen levels by C. elegans requires the sensory cGMP-gated channel tax-2/tax-4 and a specific soluble guanylate cyclase homologue, gcy-35. The GCY-35 haem domain binds molecular oxygen, unlike the haem domains of classical nitric-oxide-regulated guanylate cyclases. GCY-35 and TAX-4 mediate oxygen sensation in four sensory neurons that control a naturally polymorphic social feeding behaviour in C. elegans. Social feeding and related behaviours occur only when oxygen exceeds C. elegans' preferred level, and require gcy-35 activity. Our results suggest that GCY-35 is regulated by molecular oxygen, and that social feeding can be a behavioural strategy for responding to hyperoxic environments."

https://openalex.org/W2011591718,"Penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is refractory to inhibition by available β-lactam antibiotics, resulting in resistance to these antibiotics. The strains of <i>S. aureus</i> that have acquired the <i>mecA</i> gene for PBP2a are designated as methicillin-resistant <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> (MRSA). The <i>mecA</i> gene was cloned and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and PBP2a was purified to homogeneity. The kinetic parameters for interactions of several β-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and a carbapenem) and PBP2a were evaluated. The enzyme manifests resistance to covalent modification by β-lactam antibiotics at the active site serine residue in two ways. First, the microscopic rate constant for acylation (<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>) is attenuated by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude over the corresponding determinations for penicillin-sensitive penicillin-binding proteins. Second, the enzyme shows elevated dissociation constants (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>) for the non-covalent pre-acylation complexes with the antibiotics, the formation of which ultimately would lead to enzyme acylation. The two factors working in concert effectively prevent enzyme acylation by the antibiotics <i>in vivo</i>, giving rise to drug resistance. Given the opportunity to form the acyl enzyme species in <i>in vitro</i> experiments, circular dichroism measurements revealed that the enzyme undergoes substantial conformational changes in the course of the process that would lead to enzyme acylation. The observed conformational changes are likely to be a hallmark for how this enzyme carries out its catalytic function in cross-linking the bacterial cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W2038623988,"Secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) comprise a family of five secreted glycoproteins that antagonize Wnt signaling. Aberrant activation and upregulation of the Wnt pathway is a key feature of many cancers. Thus, role of sFRP as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling may have important implications in tumorigenesis, and its downregulation has been correlated with human cancers. Recently, we reported Wnt signaling and dishevelled (Dvl) overexpression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MM). Here, we report significant transcriptional downregulation of the SFRP gene family in MM primary tissues and cell lines as well as several other cancer cell lines (breast, lung, glioma, and cervical) compared to normal cells. One or more SFRPs were downregulated in approximately 85% (18 of 21) of primary MM tumor specimens compared to normal pleural tissue. Eight of the nine cancer cell lines we examined showed silencing of the SFRP family. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis showed that SFRP1, SFRP4, and SFRP5 gene promoters are frequently methylated in MM primary tissue (>80%). Furthermore, transfection of the SFRP gene construct into MM cell lines lacking SFRP expression resulted in apoptosis and growth suppression. Our results suggest that methylation silencing of SFRPs may be one of the important mechanisms of aberrant Wnt signaling activation in MM."

https://openalex.org/W1999554896,"The heme oxygenase (HO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes generate the gaseous signaling molecules carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide, respectively. Constitutive NOSs localize to caveolae, and their activities are modulated by caveolin-1. Nothing is known of the localization of the inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in plasma membrane caveolae. Thus, we examined the distribution and subcellular localization of HO-1, biliverdin reductase (BVR), and NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (NPR) in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Each of these proteins localized in part to plasma membrane caveolae in endothelial cells. Inducers of HO-1 or overexpression of HO-1 increased the content of this protein in a detergent-resistant fraction containing caveolin-1. Inducible HO activity appeared in plasma membrane, cytosol, and isolated caveolae. In addition, caveolae contained endogenous BVR activity, supporting the same compartmentalization of both enzymes. Caveolin-1 physically interacted with HO-1, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation studies. HO activity dramatically increased in cells expressing caveolin-1 antisense transcripts, suggesting a negative regulatory role for caveolin-1. Conversely, caveolin-1 expression attenuated LPS-inducible HO activity. Since their initial characterization in 1969, HO enzymes have been described as endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins. We demonstrate for the first time the localization of heme degradation enzymes to plasma membrane caveolae, and present novel evidence that caveolin-1 interacts with and modulates HO activity."

In contrast to the pleiotropic stimuli that lead to its positive regulation, the known signaling mechanisms that underlie the negative regulation of NF-κB are very few. Recent studies have identified the tumor suppressor CYLD, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, as a key negative regulator for NF-κB signaling by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TRAF6, and NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator, also known as IκB kinase γ). However, how CYLD is regulated remains unknown. The present study revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-κB by TNF-α and bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) induces CYLD that in turn leads to the negative regulation of NF-κB signaling. In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-κB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-α and NTHi.

It is still unclear whether activation of NF-κB induces CYLD transcription that in turn leads to the inhibition of NF-κB especially in more delayed or persistent phase in an autoregulatory feedback manner. To determine whether CYLD is induced during inflammation, we first sought to evaluate the effects on CYLD expression of a variety of inflammation stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines and bacteria. Having demonstrated that CYLD is indeed induced by TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), an important Gram-negative bacterial pathogen for respiratory infections, we next sought to determine whether activation of NF-κB is required for CYLD induction based on the fact that all of the above CYLD inducers are also potent inducers for NF-κB. Here we showed that activation of NF-κB is indeed required for CYLD induction by TNF-α, IL-1β, and NTHi and that TRAF2 and TRAF6 are differentially involved in NF-κB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-α and NTHi. The present study thus revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-κB by TNF-α and NTHi induces CYLD that in turn leads to the inhibition of NF-κB signaling. These findings should enhance our understanding of the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB activation during inflammation. Reagents—MG-132 was purchased from Calbiochem.

Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed using an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described (11Watanabe T.

Plasmids, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—The plasmids WT-CYLD, IκBα(S32/36A), IKK2(K49A), p65, and NF-κB luciferase were described previously (7Trompouki E. Hatzivassiliou E. Tsichritzis T.

The transfected cells were treated with TNF-α, IL-1β, or NTHi for 5 h before being harvested for luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. RNA-mediated Interference—RNA-mediated interference for down-regulating CYLD expression was done using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-CYLD (pSUPER-CYLD) as described previously (8Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described (8Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against CYLD, developed in the laboratory of Dr. Mosialos, was raised against amino acids 538–953 of human CYLD. Antibodies against IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO were purchased from Cell Signaling, p65 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and β-actin was from Sigma. In Vivo Study—7–8-Week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used in this study. After the trachea was surgically exposed by middle line incision in the skin, TNF-α or NTHi was directly injected into the trachea. Lung tissues were collected and then stored at –80 °C; total RNA was isolated from the frozen tissue. For inhibition study, mice were pretreated with 1 mg/kg MG-132 interperitoneally 1 h before inoculation of TNF-α or NTHi. Three mice were used for each inoculation group. The House Ear Institute Institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all of the animal protocols used in this study. CYLD Is a General Negative Regulator for NF-κB Activation—We first sought to determine whether CYLD indeed acts as a negative regulator for NF-κB activation by a variety of stress stimuli using a siRNA approach (8Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). We first confirmed the efficiency of CYLD-specific siRNA (siRNA-CYLD) in reducing CYLD expression in HeLa cells co-transfected with WT CYLD and siRNA-CYLD or empty vector. As expected, the CYLD protein was markedly reduced by siRNA-CYLD (Fig. 1A, left). Consistent with this result, the endogenous CYLD protein was also greatly reduced (Fig. 1A, right). We then assessed the effect of siRNA-CYLD on NF-κB activation by TNF-α, IL-1β, and bacterium NTHi (10Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Watanabe T. Jono H. Han J. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3563-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, CYLD knockdown by siRNA-CYLD greatly enhanced NF-κB activation. To determine whether CYLD knockdown also enhances NF-κB-dependent transcription of several key inflammatory mediators, we next assessed the effect of siRNA-CYLD on TNF-α- and NTHi-induced up-regulation of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 using Q-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, CYLD knock-down greatly enhanced induction of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 by TNF-α and NTHi (upper and lower panels), respectively. To further confirm whether CYLD knockdown also enhances NF-κB activation in primary epithelial cells, we then examined the effect of siRNA-CYLD on NF-κB activation in primary NHBE cells. As evidenced in Fig. 1D, NF-κB activation was markedly enhanced by siRNA-CYLD in NHBE cells. Similarly, activation of NF-κB induced by other known NF-κB inducers phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and peptidoglycan was also enhanced by siRNA-CYLD (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that CYLD is indeed a negative regulator for NF-κB activation induced by a variety of known NF-κB stimuli. CYLD Is Induced by a Variety of NF-κB Stimuli in Vitro and in Vivo—Because a variety of genes involved in inflammatory response undergo changes in expression pattern after initiation of inflammation (1Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar, 2Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev.

Med. 2002; 8: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and the endogenous expression of CYLD is relatively low in epithelial cells, we hypothesized that CYLD is induced by a variety of inflammation stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines and bacteria. We thus tested our hypothesis by assessing the effects on CYLD expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and NTHi that are known as highly potent NF-κB inducers. As shown in Fig. 2A, TNF-α, IL-1β, and NTHi strongly induced CYLD expression at the mRNA level in HeLa (left) and NHBE cells (right) by Q-PCR analysis. Consistent with this result, induction of CYLD by TNF-α and NTHi was also observed at the protein level (Fig. 2B). Similarly, CYLD induction by peptidoglycan, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae was also observed (data not shown), suggesting that induction of CYLD may be generalizable for a variety of NF-κB inducers. To further confirm whether CYLD is also induced in vivo, we next determined the effects of TNF-α and NTHi on CYLD expression in the lungs of the mice. As shown in Fig. 2C, both TNF-α and NTHi induced CYLD expression in a dose-dependent manner, respectively. The induction of CYLD became evident at 3 h, greatly up-regulated at 6 h, and returned to base-line level by 4 days after inoculation of either TNF-α or NTHi (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that CYLD is induced by a variety of NF-κB stimuli including TNF-α and bacterium NTHi in vitro and in vivo. NF-κB Is Essential for Induction of CYLD by TNF-α and NTHi—On the basis of evidence that NF-κB controls expression of many genes involved in inflammatory response (1Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R.

We first assessed the effects of blocking NF-κB signaling on CYLD induction by TNF-α and NTHi using various approaches. As shown in Fig. 3A, CYLD induction by either TNF-α and NTHi was greatly inhibited by blocking IKK2-IκBα signaling using MG-132 (left) and expressing a transdominant mutant of IκBα or a dominant-negative mutant of IKK2 (right) in HeLa cells (10Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Watanabe T. Jono H. Han J. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3563-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of IKK2-IκBα signaling in CYLD induction. To confirm the requirement of IKK complex in CYLD induction, we next investigated CYLD induction in MEFs derived from WT and IKK1–/– and IKK2–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 3B, both TNF-α and NTHi induced CYLD expression in WT but not in IKK1–/–, IKK2–/–, and double knockout IKK1/2–/– MEFs (left) (12Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F.

Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Likewise, TNF-α and NTHi induced CYLD expression in WT but not in NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) or IKKγ-deficient cells (right) (16Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), thereby confirming the requirement of IKK complex signaling in CYLD induction. To determine whether NF-κB is required for CYLD induction, we then assessed the effects of TNF-α and NTHi on CYLD expression in WT and p65–/– MEFs (15Yang F. Tang E. Guan K. Wang C.Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5630-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows that both TNF-α and NTHi induced CYLD expression in WT but not in p65–/– MEFs. When p65–/– MEFs were reconstituted with WT p65 expression plasmid, CYLD induction became evident in reconstituted p65–/– MEFs in response to both TNF-α and NTHi, indicating NF-κB is required for CYLD induction by TNF-α and NTHi. To further determine whether direct activation of NF-κB induces CYLD, we transfected HeLa cells with WT p65 expression plasmid. Interestingly, overexpression of WT p65 induced CYLD expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). Thus, it is clear that activation of NF-κB is indeed required for inducing CYLD expression. Similar to HeLa cells, induction of CYLD by TNF-α and NTHi was also inhibited by perturbing IκBα signaling using MG-132 in primary NHBE cells (Fig. 3E). Moreover, CYLD induction was also abolished by MG-132 in the lung of BALB/c mice, thus confirming the involvement of NF-κB signaling in CYLD induction in vivo (Fig. 3F). Taken together, our data suggest that IKK1/2/NEMO-IκBα-dependent activation of NF-κB is essential for CYLD induction by TNF-α and NTHi in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing evidence for an inducible autoregulatory feedback loop. TRAF2 and TRAF6 Are Differentially Involved in NF-κB-dependent Induction of CYLD by TNF-α and NTHi—Having demonstrated the requirement of the IKK1/2/NEMO-IκBα-NF-κB signaling pathway in CYLD induction in an inducible autoregulatory feedback manner, still unknown are the upstream signaling components that mediate CYLD induction by TNF-α and NTHi CYLD. In review of the known signaling components mediating NF-κB activation upstream of NEMO, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6 have been shown to act as important adaptor molecules involved in mediating TNF-α and bacteria-induced signaling leading to NF-κB activation, respectively (17Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 18Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar). Recently, interesting studies indicate that CYLD negatively regulates NF-κB activation by deubiquitinating TRAF2 and TRAF6 (7Trompouki E. Hatzivassiliou E. Tsichritzis T. Farmer H. Ashworth A. Mosialos G. Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 8Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R.

Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether TRAF2 and TRAF6 are also involved in mediating CYLD induction. As shown in Fig. 4A, overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2 abrogated the induction of CYLD by TNF-α but not by NTHi. In contrast, transfecting the cells with a dominant-negative mutant TRAF6 inhibited the induction of CYLD by NTHi but not by TNF-α. These data suggest that TRAF2 and TRAF6 are differentially involved in CYLD induction by TNF-α and NTHi. To confirm whether inhibition of NF-κB activity by CYLD occurs through perturbing TRAF2-and TRAF6-mediated signaling, we assessed the effect of siRNA-CYLD on NF-κB activation induced by expressing WT TRAF2 and TRAF6. As expected, activation of NF-κB by expressing WT TRAF2 and TRAF6 was enhanced by CYLD knockdown (Fig. 4B). In contrast, activation of NF-κB by expressing WT p65 was unaffected by siRNA-CYLD. Thus, these data indicate that the inhibition of NF-κB by CYLD indeed occurs through perturbing TRAF2- and TRAF6-mediated signaling. In summary, our findings revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback loop through which activation of NF-κB by cytokine TNF-α and bacterium NTHi induces CYLD, which in turn leads to the inhibition of NF-κB signaling (Fig. 5). In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-κB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-α and NTHi. Moreover, the inhibition of NF-κB by CYLD occurs through perturbing TRAF2- and TRAF6-mediated signaling. Previous studies identified NF-κB-dependent transcriptional induction of its own inhibitor IκBα as an important mechanism to ensure the transient nature of NF-κB induction. It remains unclear whether the autoregulatory feedback control of NF-κB activation also occurs at the level upstream of IκBα. The present studies thus identified an autoregulatory feedback mechanism that negatively controls the more upstream signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation. In contrast to the role that NF-κB-dependent induction of IκBα plays in controlling the transient nature of NF-κB induction, the NF-κB-dependent induction of CYLD may play a more important role in controlling the delayed activation of NF-κB induction. Thus, the involvement of the NF-κB-dependent induction of both IκBα and CYLD may be essential for ensuring the tight control of NF-κB activation in the transient and the delayed or persistent phases (19Schmidt C.

It should also be noted that genomic sequence analysis revealed NF-κB sites within the putative CYLD promoter region, thereby providing further supportive information for the requirement of NF-κB in CYLD induction. Future studies will focus on cloning and identifying the regulatory region of CYLD gene that contains the functional κB site(s). In addition, the involvement of other signaling pathways in CYLD induction should also be explored as our data did not preclude the involvement of other signaling components. We thank I. Verma, R.

Although the HS chains were structurally indistinguishable, intriguingly the CS chains were structurally and functionally distinct, probably reflecting the differential regulation of sulfotransferases involved in the synthesis of HS and CS. The CS chains of the two syndecans comprised nonsulfated, 4-O-, 6-O-, and 4,6-O-disulfated N-acetylgalactosamine-containing disaccharide units and were significantly different, with a higher degree of sulfation for syndecan-4. Functional analysis using a BIAcore system showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) specifically bound only to the HS chains of both syndecans, whereas midkine (MK) and pleiotrophin (PTN) bound not only to the HS but also to the CS chains. Stronger binding of MK and PTN to the CS chains of syndecan-4 than those of syndecan-1 was revealed, supporting the structural and functional differences. Intriguingly, removal of the CS chains decreased the association and dissociation rate constants of MK, PTN, and bFGF for both syndecans, suggesting the simultaneous binding of these growth factors to both types of chains, producing a ternary complex that transfers the growth factors to the corresponding cell surface receptors more efficiently compared with the HS chains alone. The involvement of the core protein was also shown in the binding of MK and PTN to syndecan-1, suggesting the possibility of cooperation with the HS and/or CS chains in the binding of these growth factors and their delivery to the cell surface receptors.

The repeating disaccharide unit in the HS and CS backbones is GlcUA/IdceA-GlcNAc and GlcUA-GalNAc, respectively, onto which are superimposed specific modification patterns, most notably the addition of sulfate groups by a variety of sulfotransferases (1Kusche-Gullberg M.

Unlike syndecan-1, however, syndecan-4 has a distinctive role in the generation and maintenance of focal adhesion complexes (31Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13561-13569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrated that syndecan-1 and -4 synthesized simultaneously by normal mouse mammary gland epithelial cells bore HS chains that were structurally indistinguishable, even though they exhibited spatially different distributions. The expression of both CS and HS chains on the same PG is intriguing but has not been investigated rigorously so far. In this study, we addressed whether the CS chains present in syndecan-1 and -4 are structurally similar, like their HS counterparts, and what functions the CS chains of these hybrid PGs play.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) from Proteus vulgaris, chondroitinase AC-II (EC 4.2.2.5) from Arthrobacter aurescens, heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) and heparitinase (EC 4.2.2.8) from Flavobacterium heparinum and unsaturated disaccharides derived from CS and HS were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). 2-Aminobenzamide was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Recombinant human (rh)-midkine (MK) expressed in Escherichia coli was purchased from Peprotech EC LTD (London, UK). rh-Pleiotrophin (PTN) expressed in E. coli was from RELIA TechGmbH (Braunschweig, Germany) and rh-FGF2 (bFGF) expressed in E. coli was from Genzyme Techne (Minneapolis). Cell surface syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains were prepared from NMuMG cells, as described previously (34Zako M. Dong J. Goldberger O. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Deakin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13561-13569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the same preparations of syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains as those used in the previous study for a structural analysis of HS were used for the present study. A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein of the syndecan-1 ectodomain expressed in a bacterial system and the GST protein were kindly provided by Dr. Alan Rapraeger (University of Wisconsin-Madison). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available.Disaccharide Composition Analysis of HS and CS Chains from Syndecan-4 Ectodomain—Enzymatic treatments for analysis of the disaccharide composition of GAG chains were carried out as follows. For HS, the purified syndecan-4 ectodomains (7 ng of core protein) were treated with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase (0.5 mIU each) in a total volume of 20 μl of 20 mm acetate-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm Ca(OAc)2 at 37 °C for 1 h (35Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For CS, the purified syndecan-4 ectodomains (48 ng of core protein) were treated with chondroitinase ABC (5 mIU) in a total volume of 20 μl of 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.06 m sodium acetate at 37 °C for 30 min (36Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disaccharides released by the above digestions were labeled fluorescently with 2-aminobenzamide at their reducing termini and analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described previously (37Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Biotinylation of Syndecan-1 and -4 Ectodomains—Biotinylation of the primary amines in the core protein of syndecan-1 (3 μg) and syndecan-4 (0.6 μg as core protein) was carried out using EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, as described previously (38Umehara Y. Yamada S. Nishimura S. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the preparation of biotinylated syndecan-1 or -4 ectodomains with HS chains (HS/syndecan-1 or -4), one-third of the biotinylated syndecan-1 or -4 ecodomains was treated with a protease-free preparation of CSase ABC (2 mIU) as described above. For the preparation of biotinylated syndecan-1 or -4 ectodomains with CS chains (CS/syndecan-1 or -4), one-third of the biotinylated syndecan-1 or -4 ecodomains was treated with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase (1 mIU each) as above. Biotinylated syndecan-1 core protein was generated by digesting intact syndecan-1 with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase followed by digestion with a protease-free preparation of chondroitinase ABC.Growth Factor Binding Assays Using a BIAcore System—Real time analysis of the interactions of growth factors and biotinylated syndecan-1/-4 ectodomains was performed with a BIAcore J biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA was used to immobilize the biotinylated samples. Comparable amounts of sample were used for immobilization. The injection of biotinylated samples onto the sensor's surface was controlled to obtain a response of 250–540 resonance units (RU), corresponding to 0.3–0.6 ng of the immobilized protein. The conditions for kinetic analysis were the same as those reported previously (39Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except that the association took 180 s and dissociation 120 s, the flow rate being 30 μl/min. The kinetic parameters, viz. the association rate constant (ka), the dissociation rate constant (kd), and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), were calculated with BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore) using a 1:1 binding model with mass transfer. For most of the analyses, the Kd values were calculated with the “fit kinetics simultaneous ka/kd program,” where the ka and kd values were determined simultaneously for the calculation of the Kd value. When this program failed to give a fit because of the unusual pattern of the sensorgram, the Kd values were calculated with the “fit kinetics separate ka/kd program” with 1:1 Langmuir association/dissociation, where the ka and kd values were determined separately for the calculation of Kd.Inhibition of Binding of MK and PTN to Syndecan-1-immobilized Sensor Chip with Intact Syndecan-1, HS/Syndecan-1, CS/Syndecan-1, Syndecan-1 Core Protein, or GST-Syndecan-1 Ectodomain—HS/syndecan-1, CS/syndecan-1, and syndecan core protein were generated from intact syndecan-1 as described above, except that the preparations were exchanged with phosphate-buffered saline using a filter having a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da (Microcon YM-10, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). For inhibition studies, MK or PTN was mixed with intact syndecan-1, HS/syndecan-1, CS/syndecan-1, syndecan-1 core protein, or bacterially expressed recombinant GST-syndecan-1 ectodomain and then applied to the syndecan-1-immobilized sensor chip, and the interaction was studied using a BIAcore as described previously.RESULTSAnalysis of the Disaccharide Compositions of HS and CS Chains from the Syndecan-4 Ectodomain—The purified syndecan-4 ectodomain was digested exhaustively with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase or chondroitinase ABC, separately, and the released disaccharides were labeled fluorescently with 2-aminobenzamide and analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. The identity of each peak was confirmed by comparing elution positions with standard 2-aminobenzamide disaccharides. The results are summarized in Table I. The HS chains gave rise to ΔDiHS-0S (ΔHexUAα1–4GlcNAc) and ΔDiHS-NS (ΔHexUAα1–4GlcN(2-N-sulfate)) as major disaccharides, accounting for 49 and 24%, respectively, of all disaccharide units, where ΔHexUA represents 4-deoxy-l-threohex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid. ΔDiHS-diS2 (ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(2-N-sulfate)) was the major disulfated disaccharide unit, accounting for 11% of the total, whereas ΔDiHS-6S (ΔHexUAα1–4GlcNAc(6-O-sulfate)), ΔDiHS-diS1 (ΔHexUAα1–4GlcN(2-N, 6-O-disulfate)), and ΔDiHS-triS (ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(2-N, 6-O-disulfate)) were minor disaccharide units. The HS disaccharide composition of syndecan-1 ectodomains from NMuMG cells, obtained from our previous study (40Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is also listed in Table I for comparison, and the results indicate that the HS disaccharide compositions of the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains from NMuMG cells are very similar, if not identical. These results are consistent with those obtained by Zako et al. (34Zako M. Dong J. Goldberger O. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Deakin J.A. J. Biol.

It should be noted, however, that our study showed that as much as 58 and 49% of the HS disaccharide units were not sulfated in syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains of NMuMG cells, revealing undersulfation of the HS chains consistent with the degree of sulfation represented by the sulfate: disaccharide molar ratio of 0.58 and 0.77, respectively.Table IDisaccharide composition of HS-GAG chains from syndecan-1 and syndecan-4HS disaccharide compositionSulfate:disaccharideΔDiHS-0SΔDiHS-6SΔDiHS-NSΔDiHS-diS1ΔDiHS-diS2ΔDiHS-triSmol %molar ratioSyndecan-1aHS disaccharide composition of syndecan-1 from a previous study (39).586232830.58Syndecan-44962451150.77a HS disaccharide composition of syndecan-1 from a previous study (39Bao X.

The disaccharide composition of the CS chains from syndecan-1 (40Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

The disaccharide analysis of the CS chains from syndecan-4 and -1 demonstrates a clear difference in composition. A notable difference was observed in the proportions of ΔDi-0S and ΔDi-6S; ΔDi-0S content was 5-fold lower, whereas ΔDi-6S content was 3-fold higher, in syndecan-4 compared with syndecan-1. No obvious difference was observed in the proportion of the major component ΔDi-4S or oversulfated ΔDi-diSE between the two syndecans. The degree of sulfation (1.03) exhibited by the CS chains of syndecan-4 was higher than that (0.78) of the CS chains of syndecan-1 (Table II). Hence, it was concluded that the CS chains on syndecan-1 and -4 from NMuMG cells are structurally different, unlike the HS chains. From 21 pmol of core protein of syndecan-4, ∼5 nmol of HS and 0.5 nmol of CS disaccharides were obtained, giving an HS:CS disccharide ratio of 91:9.Table IIDisaccharide composition of CS-GAG chains from syndecan-1 and syndecan-4CS disaccharide compositionSulfate:disaccharideΔDi-0SΔDi-6SΔDi-4SΔDi-diSDaΔDi-diSD, ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate).ΔDi-diSEΔDi-triSbΔDi-triS, ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate).mol %molar ratioSyndecan-1cCS disaccharide composition of syndecan-1 from a previous study (39).29559NDdND, not detected.7ND0.78Syndecan-461768ND9ND1.03a ΔDi-diSD, ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate).b ΔDi-triS, ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate).c CS disaccharide composition of syndecan-1 from a previous study (39Bao X.

Open table in a new tab Syndecan-1 and -4 Ectodomains Bound MK, PTN, and bFGF with Comparable Affinities—It was then investigated whether the difference in the structure of the CS chains has any influence on the function of the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains (denoted as intact syndecan-1 and -4, respectively). We examined the molecular interaction of syndecan-1 and -4 with three different growth factors, viz. MK and PTN from the MK/PTN family and bFGF from the FGF family. Our previous experiments using MK, PTN, and bFGF with squid cartilage CS-E and heparin indicated that MK and PTN showed comparable or higher affinity for CS-E than for heparin, whereas bFGF had higher affinity for heparin than CS-E (41Deepa S.S.

Hence, syndecans with both CS and HS chains would be ideal for studying interactions.The kinetic parameters for the binding of MK, PTN, and bFGF to the intact syndecan-1 and -4 were analyzed using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Biotinylated syndecan-1 and -4 were immobilized separately on streptavidin-coated sensor chips, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” varying concentrations of individual growth factors were injected onto the sensor's surface, and the interactions were analyzed. Fig. 1, A, B, and C, represents an overlay of the sensorgrams for the binding of MK, PTN, and bFGF to an intact syndecan-1 immobilized chip; and Fig. 2, A, B, and C, represents their binding to an intact syndecan-4-immobilized chip.Fig. 2Sensorgrams for the binding of MK, PTN, and bFGF to syndecan-4. Various concentrations of MK (A, D, and G), PTN (B, E, and H), and bFGF (C, F, and I) were injected over sensor chips immobilized with the syndecan-4 ectodomain (A–C), syndecan-4 ectodomain with HS chains (D–F), and syndecan-4 ectodomain with CS chains (G–I). The long arrows indicate the beginning of the association phase initiated by the injection of varying concentrations of the growth factors, and short arrows indicate the beginning of the dissociation phase initiated with the running buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The kinetic parameters ka, kd, and Kd for the binding of MK, PTN, and bFGF to syndecan-1 and -4 are presented in Tables III and IV. All three growth factors displayed Kd values in the low nm range, suggesting high affinity and a physiological significance of the interactions. The Kd values observed for the interactions of these growth factors were as follows: 29 and 20 nm (MK); 27 and 16 nm (PTN), and 3.4 and 5.0 nm, respectively (bFGF). Thus, MK, PTN, and bFGF bound to intact syndecan-1 and -4 with comparable affinities. For intact syndecan-1, bFGF exhibited the strongest affinity among the growth factors tested, as indicated by a ∼9-fold lower Kd value than that obtained for the binding with MK or PTN. Likewise, bFGF exhibited the strongest affinity for intact syndecan-4 among the growth factors; the binding affinity of MK or PTN for intact syndecan-4 was ∼4- and 3-fold lower than that exhibited by bFGF. Thus, the three growth factors exhibited significantly different binding affinities for syndecan-1 and -4, most likely reflecting structural differences in the GAG chains. Because, however, syndecan-1 and -4 possess both HS and CS chains, it was not clear at this point whether the difference in binding to syndecan-1 and -4 was the result of HS only or a combination of HS and CS.Table IIIKinetic parameters for the interaction of MK, PTN, and bFGF with immobilized syndecan-1Growth factors and ectodomainskakdKdm-1 s-1s-1nmMKSyndecan-1 with HS and CS(1.05 ± 0.05) × 105(2.99 ± 0.15) × 10-328.9 ± 5.6Syndecan-1 with HS(6.85 ± 0.28) × 104(1.71 ± 0.51) × 10-325.9 ± 15.5Syndecan-1 with CSaThe ka, kd, and Kd values were determined using the fit kinetics separate ka/kd program because the fit kinetics simultaneous ka/kd program failed to give a fit.(1.32 ± 0.08) × 104(4.82 ± 0.51) × 10-3367 ± 67PTNSyndecan-1 with HS and CS(1.45 ± 0.84) × 106(4.60 ± 2.30) × 10-226.5 ± 18.8Syndecan-1 with HS(7.58 ± 0.17) × 105(8.94 ± 3.08) × 10-311.9 ± 5.7Syndecan-1 with CSaThe ka, kd, and Kd values were determined using the fit kinetics separate ka/kd program because the fit kinetics simultaneous ka/kd program failed to give a fit.(6.64 ± 0.12) × 103(3.46 ± 0.91) × 10-25210 ± 760bFGFSyndecan-1 with HS and CS(3.09 ± 0.16) × 107(1.04 ± 0.09) × 10-13.4 ± 1.0Syndecan-1 with HS(1.59 ± 0.20) × 107(4.40 ± 0.60) × 10-22.5 ± 6.7Syndecan-1 with CSaThe ka, kd, and Kd values were determined using the fit kinetics separate ka/kd program because the fit kinetics simultaneous ka/kd program failed to give a fit.NDbND, the values could not be determined because of insignificant binding.NDNDa The ka, kd, and Kd values were determined using the fit kinetics separate ka/kd program because the fit kinetics simultaneous ka/kd program failed to give a fit.b ND, the values could not be determined because of insignificant binding.

https://openalex.org/W1989529289,"Mitotic catastrophe is an important mechanism for the induction of cell death in cancer cells by antineoplastic agents that damage DNA. This process is facilitated by defects in the G1 and G2 checkpoints of the cell cycle that are apparent in most cancer cells and which allow the cells to enter mitosis with DNA damage. We have now characterized the dynamics of mitotic catastrophe induced by DNA-damaging agents in p53-deficient cancer cells. Cells that entered mitosis with DNA damage transiently arrested at metaphase for more than 10 h without segregation of chromosomes and subsequently died directly from metaphase. In those metaphase arrested precatastrophic cells, anaphase-promoting complex appeared to be inactivated and BubR1 was persistently localized at kinetochores, suggesting that spindle checkpoint is activated after the DNA damage. Furthermore, suppression of spindle checkpoint function by BubR1 or Mad2 RNA interference in the DNA damaged cells led to escape from catastrophic death and to subsequent abnormal mitosis. Dysfunction of the spindle checkpoint in p53-deficient cancer cells is thus likely a critical factor in resistance to DNA-damaging therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2019019380,"Membrane domains (“rafts”) have received great attention as potential platforms for proteins in signaling and trafficking. Because rafts are believed to form by cooperative lipid interactions but are not directly accessible in vivo, artificial phase-separating lipid bilayers are useful model systems. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) offer large free-standing bilayers, but suitable methods for incorporating proteins are still scarce. Here we report the reconstitution of two water-insoluble SNARE proteins into GUVs without fusogenic additives. Following reconstitution, protein functionality was assayed by confocal imaging and fluorescence auto- and cross-correlation spectroscopy. Incorporation into GUVs containing phase-separating lipids revealed that, in the absence of other cellular factors, both proteins exhibit an intrinsic preference for the liquid-disordered phase. Although the picture from detergent resistance assays on whole cells is ambiguous, reconstitutions of components of the exocytic machinery into GUVs by this new approach should yield insight into the dynamics of protein complex associations with hypothesized liquid-ordered phase microdomains, the correspondence between detergent-resistant membranes and liquid-ordered phase, and the mechanism of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.

In 1988, Simons and van Meer (1Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) proposed a link between protein and lipid sorting in intracellular trafficking. They hypothesized that proteins destined for the apical membrane associate with glycosphingolipid-rich microdomains (termed “rafts”) in the trans-Golgi membrane held together by hydrogen bonding among the head groups. Microdomain formation is believed to be associated with a resistance against mild detergents (usually Triton X-100), providing a convenient read-out for whether a protein is in rafts. In polarized cells, rafts are sorted at the trans-Golgi-network into separate transport vesicles destined for the apical membrane, which explains the distinct protein and lipid compositions of apical and basolateral membranes. Examining Triton X-100 solubility of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein during transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, Brown and Rose (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar) observed co-sorting of glycosphingolipids with apical but not basolateral proteins (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). Subsequently, liposomes were found to be insoluble in Triton X-100 if they contained lipids forming a liquid-ordered (lo) 1The abbreviations used are: lo, liquid-ordered; ld, liquid-disordered; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; GUV, giant unilamellar vesicle; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; Syx, syntaxin; Syb, synaptobrevin; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein. phase, i.e. cholesterol in combination with sphingomyelin and saturated (3Schroeder R.

These observations led to a view emphasizing cholesterol and ordered chain packing as the forces that hold the rafts together (4Simons K. Ikonen E.

Therefore, susceptibility to cholesterol depletion was introduced as an additional experimental tool to determine raft association. Despite routine use of the Triton X-100 solubility assay, doubts persist as to whether detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) correspond to lo domains in intact membranes (7Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Detergent application alters phase behavior (8Heerklotz H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2693-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and DRM composition depends on the detergent used (9Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of isolated DRMs shows structures with a diameter of 0.1-1 μm (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar), which is larger than the estimated raft size in intact membranes (10Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar), suggesting detergent-induced artifacts. Furthermore, cholesterol-dependent microdomains appear to be more heterogeneous than originally envisioned. For example, the apically sorted microvilli-localized protein, prominin, does not associate with classical DRMs prepared with Triton X-100 but associates with DRMs prepared with Lubrol and does so in a cholesterol-dependent manner (11Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It is unclear how these microdomains relate to lo and liquid-disordered (ld) phases, i.e. whether cholesterol-dependent clustering automatically implies an lo phase. Recently, evidence has been provided that SNARE proteins enrich in cholesterol-dependent microdomains in the plasma membrane (12Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 13Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins are vital components of intracellular fusion processes within the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. Their role as minimum machinery for membrane fusion was established by protein reconstitution into artificial liposomes, which were observed to undergo spontaneous fusion (14Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). The best studied are the SNAREs syntaxin 1, synaptobrevin 2, and SNAP-25 that are required for exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons. The single-span transmembrane proteins, syntaxin 1 and synaptobrevin 2 (also referred to as VAMP2), are located on the plasma membrane and on the membrane of synaptic vesicles, respectively. The third partner, SNAP-25, is anchored to the plasma membrane by palmitoyl residues. SNAREs are characterized by a homologous stretch of 60-70 amino acids arranged in heptad repeats, which is referred to as the SNARE motif and is usually located directly adjacent to the membrane anchor domain. During membrane fusion, the SNARE motifs spontaneously assemble into a tight α-helical bundle. According to the current view, the assembly of the SNARE motifs pulls the membranes closely together and initiates bilayer fusion (15Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 16Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 17Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane, syntaxin 1 forms microscopically visible clusters whose integrity is dependent on cholesterol (12Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, syntaxin 1 can be cross-linked to a photore-active cholesterol derivative, suggesting the association with cholesterol-dependent microdomains. Cholesterol removal profoundly inhibits exocytosis, suggesting that clustering is essential for SNARE function (12Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 18Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nishiwaki C. Kikuta T. Kumakura K. Nakamichi Y. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol.

However, the syntaxin clusters do not co-localize with typical raft markers like glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins and syntaxin does not co-fractionate with DRMs (for review see Ref. 12Lang T.

The factors contributing to lateral membrane heterogeneities in vivo thus appear to be complex and experimentally difficult to characterize. In this light, we decided to single out the lipid phase aspect of rafts and determine the intrinsic protein affinity for the liquid-disordered or liquid-ordered phase in an artificial system. We have used GUV model membranes to investigate whether SNAREs partition into the lo phase under the conditions of controlled composition and in the absence of detergent. Syntaxin and synaptobrevin were reconstituted into the “canonical raft mixture” of 1:1:1 C18-sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (20Samsonov A.V. Mihalyov I. Cohen F.S.

A comparison with a classical lo phase marker, GM1-bound cholera toxin, allowed the clear assignment to the ld phase for both syntaxin 1A and synaptobrevin 2. Preparation of Recombinant SNARE Proteins—Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as previously described. Syntaxin 1A was expressed as a construct lacking the regulatory Habc domain and including a C-terminal cysteine for labeling (Syx H3, amino acids 183-289C (22Schuette C.G. Hatsuzawa K. Margittai M.

Reconstitution of SNARE Proteins into Small Liposomes—Lipids obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (GM1 from Calbiochem) were mixed in chloroform:methanol (2:1). Lipid mixture I consisted of brain phosphatidylcholine, brain phosphatidylethanolamine, brain phosphatidylserine, bovine liver phosphatidylinositol, and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 5:2: 1:1:1. Lipid mixture II (domain-exhibiting membranes) contained dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, C18-sphingomyelin, cholesterol at a ratio of 1:1:1 and 0.1% ganglioside GM1. Lipids were dried and resuspended at a detergent to lipid ratio of 8:1 (mixture I) or 17:1 (mixture II) in buffer HB100 (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10% sodium cholate (Sigma). For lipid mixture II, heating in a waterbath was required until the mixture ceased to be turbid. Labeled SNARE proteins in HB100 containing 1.5% cholate were added to the detergent/lipid micelles to a final protein:lipid ratio of 1:300 or 1:60 (1.5 μmol of total lipid). Proteoliposomes were formed by detergent removal on a Sephadex G-50 S column (volume ratio sample: column ≤1:30), divided into five aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Their diameter was ∼25-35 nm (22Schuette C.G. Hatsuzawa K. Margittai M. Stein A. Riedel D. Kuster P. Konig M. Seidel C. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Using the same protocol but omitting the proteins, the vesicles were made from DLPC plus 0.0075% fluorescent marker (diIC18, Molecular Probes). Production of GUVs from Small Proteoliposomes—A (proteo-)liposome aliquot was thawed, diluted in reconstitution buffer, pelleted by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g, 90 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in 10 μl of HB100. This concentrated liposome suspension was deposited as little droplets on an electrically conductive but optically transparent ITO coverslip (indium-tin-oxide-coated coverslip custom-made by GeSiM) to be used for GUV formation by electroswelling (26Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1986; 81: 303-311Crossref Google Scholar, 27Kahya N. Scherfeld D. Bacia K. Poolman B. Schwille P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28109-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Residual water was evaporated in a vacuum at 4 °C overnight. The ITO coverslip with the proteolipidic layer was assembled together with a second ITO coverslip into a flow-chamber of homemade design (based on Warner Instrument Model RC 21), the chamber was filled with a 300 mm of sucrose solution, and a 1.2-V 10-Hz alternating electric field was applied to this capacitor-like configuration for 1-3 h. For lipid mixture II, GUVs were produced above the phase transition temperature (heating block or oven at ≥65 °C). GUVs were then allowed to cool down to room temperature, and the chamber was flushed with iso-osmolar phosphate-buffered saline buffer (Invitrogen). Soluble SNARE proteins were injected in phosphate-buffered saline at up to 16 μm (SNAP-25), 1.6 μm (Syx-Cy5), or 0.6 μm (Syb-Cy5). For counterstaining, cholera toxin B subunit (Calbiochem) was labeled with monoreactive Cy5 NHS-ester (Amersham Biosciences) by standard methods and added to the chamber at 5 μg/ml (cholera toxin B subunit-Cy5) in phosphate-buffered saline. Microscopy and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—Microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) were performed on a commercial ConfoCor 2 combination system (Carl Zeiss) (28Bacia K. Schwille P. Methods. 2003; 29: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In confocal fluorescence imaging, spectral cross-talk was checked by performing separate scans with only single-laser excitations. FCS of diIC18 used the configuration as described by Kahya et al. (27Kahya N. Scherfeld D. Bacia K. Poolman B. Schwille P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28109-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Auto- and cross-correlation measurements (29Schwille P. Meyer-Almes F.J. Rigler R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1878-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of Alexa-488 and Cy5-labeled proteins used essentially the configuration described by Bacia et al. (30Bacia K. Majoul I.V. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1184-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Calibration of the detection volumes yielded ωo = 0.17 ± 0.01 μm for 543 nm and ωo = 0.15 ± 0.01 μm for a 488-nm excitation. Laser powers were ≤13 (488 nm) and 2 microwatts (543 nm). For these intensities and mobilities, photobleaching did not artifactually reduce diffusion times. Correlation curves G(τ) were fitted appropriately by the FCS model equation for two-dimensional free Brownian diffusion (28Bacia K. Schwille P. Methods. 2003; 29: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) shown in Equation 1, G(τ)=1Neff·1−F+Fexp(−τ/τtrip)1−F·1(1+τ/τdiff)+c(Eq. 1) where Neff denotes the number of fluorescent molecules in the detection volume, the second factor represents (triplet) blinking seen in the auto-correlation curves (F, triplet fraction; τtrip, triplet time), the third factor represents the diffusion term, and c is a constant accounting for slow fluctuations. The diffusion time (τdiff) is related to the diffusion coefficient D by D = ωo2/4τdiff, where ωo is the 1/e2 lateral radius of the detection volume. The means ± S.D. of τdiff were calculated from measurements on multiple GUVs. Errors may also be estimated from visual inspection of the single measurements displayed in Supplemental Fig. S4. Production of SNARE-containing GUVs—Normally, GUVs are prepared from a lipid solution in organic solvent that is thoroughly dried on an electrode. In search for a procedure that avoids exposure of the proteins to denaturing organic solvents, we found that vacuum drying of a concentrated, aqueous liposome suspension at 4 °C on ITO-coated coverslips yields a lipid film that allows GUV formation by electroswelling. To examine whether there are any differences between GUVs prepared by both methods, we measured the lateral diffusion of the lipid analogue diIC18 by FCS. No differences were detected (Supplemental Fig. S1). The liposome-based method was then applied to produce GUVs from small proteoliposomes prepared by detergent removal (Fig. 1A). To test for protein aggregation, we visualized the reconstituted proteins by confocal microscopy and measured their mobilities by FCS. Fluorescence from the Alexa-488 labeled proteins is confined to the membrane and is fairly uniform (Fig. 1, B and C). The proteo-GUV yield is high (Supplemental Fig. S3). FCS reveals complete diffusibility and indistinguishable diffusion coefficients for both single-span membrane proteins (synaptobrevin: DSyb = (2.7 ± 0.5) × 10-8 cm2/s; syntaxin: DSyx = (2.5 ± 0.5) × 10-8cm2/s, Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. S4). A high mobility was also observed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (Supplemental Fig. S2). No singular large fluctuations are seen in the FCS count-rate traces, and correlation curves fit well to a two-dimensional, free Brownian diffusion model (data not shown, comparable with Fig. 3, C and D). Although these observations cannot rule out dimerization, for example (due to the weak dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the particle radius reflected in the Saffman-Delbruck equation (31Saffman P.G. Delbruck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3111-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar)), they show that proteins become incorporated without any large-scale aggregation that would be expected if they were denatured during the reconstitution procedure.Fig. 3Syntaxin and synaptobrevin prefer the liquid-disordered phase.Scale bars = 10 μm. The green channel images show synaptobrevin (A) and syntaxin (B) in GUVs produced from dioleoylphosphatidylcholine:C18-sphingomyelin: cholesterol (1:1:1) plus 0.1% GM1. Either protein shows a strong selective enrichment in one phase. Because part of the GUV preparation had to be carried out at elevated temperature, functional preservation of the proteins was evaluated again by the binding of the soluble SNARE counterparts (as in Fig. 2, A and B). Binding is specific, because fluorescence from the soluble SNAREs is only seen in membrane regions where incorporated SNAREs are enriched. C and D show normalized and averaged FCS curves (see Supplemental Fig. S4 for single experiment curves). Fitted and measured curves have the same colors. The diffusion of the incorporated SNAREs in their domains of enrichment is shown in green, and the diffusion of the lipid analogue diO in ld and lo phase is in blue and black, respectively. For both SNAREs, protein diffusion is only slightly slower (due to particle size) than diffusion of diO in the ld phase but much faster than diffusion of diO in the lo phase. SNARE protein diffusion does not significantly change after the binding of soluble SNAREs (orange curves in C and E). Panels E and F show staining of synaptobrevin- and syntaxin-GUVs with Cy5-labeled cholera toxin B (ctxB) subunit, which is an lo phase marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further test functional preservation, we assayed the binding of soluble SNARE motifs to the membrane-anchored proteins. Soluble red-labeled syntaxin and unlabeled SNAP-25 were added to GUVs containing green-labeled synaptobrevin. Analogously, soluble red-labeled synaptobrevin and SNAP-25 were added to green syntaxin-GUVs. In both experiments, colocalized fluorescence suggested binding (Fig. 2, A and B). Because at light optical image resolution unspecific binding to lipids cannot be excluded, specificity was investigated by dual-color cross-correlation spectroscopy. The positive cross-correlation amplitudes in Fig. 2, A and B, indicate specific co-diffusion of soluble and membrane-anchored SNARE proteins. Imaging alone can demonstrate specificity of binding here if the ternary nature of the complex is exploited (Fig. 2C). However, fluorescence cross-correlation is more versatile and can also assay specificity of binding in binary interactions. Reconstitution of SNARE Proteins into Phase-separating GUVs—GUVs composed of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine:C18-sphingomyelin:cholesterol (1:1:1) are known to exhibit macroscopic phase separation (32Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Domains can be visualized by marker enrichment. Fluorescent cholera toxin B subunit bound to the ganglioside GM1 (added at 0.1% to the lipid mixture) marks the lo phase (21Dietrich C. Volovyk Z.N. Levi M. Thompson N.L. Jacobson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10642-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), whereas the lipid analogue diO (or the structurally similar diI) become enriched in the ld phase. Despite its enrichment in the ld phase, FCS can assess diO mobility in both phases. diO diffusion is observed to be ∼10-fold slower in the lo compared with the ld phase (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, FCS offers a direct way of distinguishing lipid phases, which is independent of defining the lo phase based on cholera toxin enrichment (27Kahya N. Scherfeld D. Bacia K. Poolman B. Schwille P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28109-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). GUVs containing fluorescently labeled SNARE proteins were produced from liposomes of this lipid composition. Synaptobrevin and syntaxin display a clear preference for one phase, rendering only some regions of the GUV membranes as strongly labeled (Fig. 3, A and B, green channel). To identify the phases preferred by synaptobrevin and syntaxin, diffusional mobilities of both proteins in the strongly labeled phase were measured (Fig. 3, C and D, blue curves). They are identical within error and close to the diffusion of diO in the ld phase (light gray curve). In contrast, diO diffusion in the lo phase is ∼7-fold slower (dark gray curve). Furthermore, cholera toxin B subunit (red), an established marker of rafts in cells and of lo phase in model systems, exhibits a phase preference opposite to synaptobrevin (Fig. 3E) and syntaxin (Fig. 3F). We conclude that both synaptobrevin and syntaxin prefer the ld phase. The binding of the soluble SNAREs does not significantly influence diffusion (orange curves in Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that it does not alter phase behavior. We have used protein-containing GUVs prepared by a new mild method to determine the phase preference of unperturbed SNAREs in laterally segregating artificial membranes. Our data show that, in contrast to GM1-bound cholera toxin, both synaptobrevin 2 and syntaxin 1 partition in the ld phase while being largely excluded from the lo phase. We conclude that, although partitioning into lo phase suffices to explain raft association of cholera toxin, cholesterol-dependent clustering of SNAREs in vivo is not explained by an intrinsic phase preference for the lo phase. Furthermore, the proteins do not form large homo-oligomeric clusters as demonstrated by their diffusion coefficients, thus excluding homophilic interactions as an alternative explanation for SNARE clustering seen on a microscopically visible scale in native membranes. The phase preferences of syntaxin and synaptobrevin (and even the definability of liquid-disordered and ordered phases) in a complex native biological membrane still remain an open question. However, the model system should allow the stepwise addition of biological complexity and an assessment of artificial perturbations. For instance, the effect of defined heterophilic protein interactions and detergent treatment on phase preference can be studied. The fact that syntaxin is located mostly in the ld domains agrees with a previous study in which syntaxin distribution was studied by atomic force microscopy in supported bilayers (33Saslowsky D.E. Lawrence J.C. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this preparation, syntaxin was not freely diffusible because it bound tightly to the mica support. This appears to be a general problem of supported membranes as reconstituted transmembrane proteins easily become immobilized or denatured by the solid support, limiting their usefulness for investigations requiring free diffusibility of proteins. Using a polymer cushion increases the distance to the support and avoids denaturation, but the polymer layer itself precludes free single-component Brownian diffusion of the protein (34Wagner M.L. Tamm L.K. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1400-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Our data show that reconstitution of membrane proteins into GUVs with defined lo state domains allows direct testing of the phase preference of a protein. However, the key problem is to integrate membrane proteins into GUVs while preserving their structural and functional integrity. Organic solvents generally lead to protein denaturation (35Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar), and the addition of the protein with detergent in the hydration step disrupts giant vesicle formation. Because membrane proteins can be readily reconstituted by detergent removal into SUVs, we sought to generate proteo-GUVs from a preparation of SUVs while avoiding protein denaturation. Our new procedure allows efficient formation of GUVs in good quality and with high protein concentration while preserving free single-component diffusion and functionality of the SNARE proteins. Although damage of sensitive proteins due to vacuum drying cannot be excluded, ongoing work indicates that a number of other membrane proteins can be functionally reconstituted as well. 2N. Kahya and P. Schwille, unpublished results. Alternatively, proteo-GUVs can be generated by fusing protein-containing SUVs with preformed protein-free GUVs in aqueous media using a viral fusion peptide that is covalently linked to phospholipids in the proteoliposomes (36Kahya N. Pecheur E.I. de Boeij W.P. Wiersma D.A. Hoekstra D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1464-1474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although this method is even milder than the one reported here, the presence of the fusion peptide makes such preparations unsuitable for functional studies of proteins involved in membrane fusion. Furthermore, it needs to be clarified whether the inclusion of the fusion peptide and a fusion-promoting cationic amphiphile affect the phase behavior of the system. The use of advanced FCS on proteins reconstituted in GUVs opens up interesting avenues for further investigations. Cross-correlation spectroscopy has the advantage that it assesses diffusion (by auto-correlation) and binding (by cross-correlation) at the same time and for the same particles, thereby offering improved species discrimination compared with bulk experiments. GUVs are well suited to FCS and should also prove useful for related ultrasensitive optical techniques. We envision that conformational changes, oligomerization, and complex formation of membrane receptor proteins could be studied in GUVs using the latest FCS and FRET technologies. GUVs have recently become a popular tool for studying the phase behavior of lipid systems (27Kahya N. Scherfeld D. Bacia K. Poolman B. Schwille P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28109-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 32Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys.

The incorporation of proteins now adds a new dimension of complexity to these model membranes and may lead to new insights into membrane microorganization that are difficult to obtain through other approaches.

Here we show the construction and use of a cDNA microarray platform enriched in intronic transcripts to assess their biological relevance in pathological conditions. To validate the approach, prostate cancer was used as a model, and 27 patient tumor samples with Gleason scores ranging from 5 to 10 were analyzed. We find that a considerably higher fraction (6.6%, [23/346]) of intronic transcripts are significantly correlated (P< or =0.001) to the degree of prostate tumor differentiation (Gleason score) when compared to transcripts from unannotated genomic regions (1%, [6/539]) or from exons of known genes (2%, [27/1369]). Among the top twelve transcripts most correlated to tumor differentiation, six are antisense intronic messages as shown by orientation-specific RT-PCR or Northern blot analysis with strand-specific riboprobe. Orientation-specific real-time RT-PCR with six tumor samples, confirmed the correlation (P=0.024) between the low/high degrees of tumor differentiation and antisense intronic RASSF1 transcript levels. The need to use intron arrays to reveal the transcriptome profile of antisense intronic RNA in cancer has clearly emerged."
https://openalex.org/W1964614840,"Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VCNA) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of cholera by removing sialic acid from higher order gangliosides to unmask GM1, the receptor for cholera toxin. We previously showed that the structure of VCNA is composed of a central β-propeller catalytic domain flanked by two lectin-like domains; however the nature of the carbohydrates recognized by these lectin domains has remained unknown. We present here structures of the enzyme in complex with two substrates, α-2,3-sialyllactose and α-2,6-sialyllactose. Both substrate complexes reveal the α-anomer of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) bound to the N-terminal lectin domain, thereby revealing the role of this domain. The large number of interactions suggest a relatively high binding affinity for sialic acid, which was confirmed by calorimetry, which gave a Kd ∼ 30 μm. Saturation transfer difference NMR using a non-hydrolyzable substrate, Neu5,9Ac2-2-S-(α-2,6)-GlcNAcβ1Me, was also used to map the ligand interactions at the VCNA lectin binding site. It is well known that VCNA can hydrolyze both α-2,3- and α-2,6-linked sialic acid substrates. In this study using α-2,3-sialyllactose co-crystallized with VCNA it was revealed that the inhibitor 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en) was bound at the catalytic site. This observation supports the notion that VCNA can produce its own inhibitor and has been further confirmed by 1H NMR analysis. The discovery of the sialic acid binding site in the N-lectin-like domain suggests that this might help target VCNA to sialic acid-rich environments, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.

Cholera is an acute bacterial infection of the intestine caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. All toxigenic strains of V. cholerae have a neuraminidase (sialidase) encoded within a pathogenicity island in their genomes (1Jermyn W.S. Boyd E.F. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 3681-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A specific role of the enzyme in pathogenesis is the removal of sialic acid from higher order gangliosides to reveal GM1, the receptor for cholera toxin (2Galen J.E. Ketley J.M. Fasano A. Richardson S.H. Wasserman S.S. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 406-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nanH gene, encoding the neuraminidase, is part of the nan-nag gene cluster that encode a series of enzymes that are potentially involved in the utilization of sialic acid released by the neuraminidase (1Jermyn W.S. Boyd E.F. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 3681-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The enzyme may therefore also play a nutritional role to the bacterium by providing sialic acid as an alternative energy and carbon source (3Schneider D.R. Parker C.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1982; 145: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Structural studies on bacterial, viral, and parasite-derived neuraminidases (4Crennell S.J. Garman E.F. Laver W.G. Vimr E.R.

Nature. 1983; 303: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) have shown that there is a family of small enzymes (∼40 kDa) that consist of only the catalytic β-propeller domain, and a family of larger enzymes that possess, in addition, one or more carbohydrate-binding domains. A recent study on the mode of action of bacterial neuraminidases has shown that those enzymes that possess additional domains are able to hydrolyze polyvalent substrates with far greater catalytic efficiency than their monovalent counterparts (11Thobhani S. Ember B. Siriwardena A. Boons G.-J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7154-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We previously reported the crystal structure of the 83-kDa V. cholerae neuraminidase (VCNA), 1The abbreviations used are: VCNA, V. cholerae neuraminidase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; STD, saturation transfer difference; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Ac2en, 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: VCNA, V. cholerae neuraminidase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; STD, saturation transfer difference; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Ac2en, 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid. a three-domain protein with a canonical six-bladed β-propeller neuraminidase domain flanked by two lectin domains (12Crennell S. Garman E. Laver G. Vimr E. Taylor G. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). One lectin domain is at the N terminus, and the other is inserted between the second and third “blades” of the β-propeller. The lectin domains share the same structure despite sharing only a 23% sequence identity. A comparison with other lectin structures provides no clue as to the ligand(s) recognized by these domains, but we speculated that the lectin domains may help this secreted enzyme to bind to cells through carbohydrate interactions. This would explain the observation that VCNA remains attached to cell membranes treated with VCNA (13Sedlacek H.H. Seiler F.R. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1974; 55: 254-257Google Scholar) and a report that VCNA had two binding sites with different affinities (14Luben G. Sedlacek H.H. Seiler F.R. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1976; 59: 30-37Google Scholar). Here we report the x-ray structures of two complexes of VCNA with the substrates α-2,3-sialyllactose to 1.9 Å and α-2,6-sialyllactose to 1.6 Å. These studies reveal that the N-terminal lectin domain binds the α-anomer of Neu5Ac (α-Neu5Ac). The number of direct and water-mediated interactions between sialic acid and the lectin domain, when compared with other sialic acid recognizing proteins, suggest a high binding affinity for VCNA. Using a non-hydrolyzable thiosialoside, Neu5,9Ac2-2-S-(α-2,6)-GlcNAcβ1Me (see Fig. 2), the affinity was measured as a Kd ∼ 30 μm by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). To explore the details of ligand recognition at the N-terminal lectin domain, we used saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy to map the ligand epitopes with the same thiosialoside used in the ITC experiment. In the α-2,3-sialyllactose complex, we found the neuraminidase inhibitor Neu5Ac2en is bound at the catalytic site suggesting that VCNA can synthesize its own inhibitor, as reported for the influenza virus neuraminidase (15Burmeister W.P. Henrissat B. Bosso C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W. Structure (Lond.). 1993; 1: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the Trypanosoma rangeli (16Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Nguyen T.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We also confirmed this for VCNA by 1H NMR. Protein Expression—Escherichia coli HB101 transformed with the expression vector pCVD364 that produces VCNA was a gift from Prof. E. Vimr, University of Illinois, Urbana. The enzyme, retained in the periplasm, was purified as described previously using the osmotic shock fluid method (17Vimr E.R. Lawrisuk L. Galen J. Kaper J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the limited yield from the osmotic shock method, another vector, pET30 b(+), which expressed the enzyme in the cytoplasm and gave a higher yield, was developed and used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cDNA of the entire nanH gene lacking its signal sequence was amplified by the PCR using pCVD364 as template. The forward primer was CGTCCATATGGCACTTTTTGACTATAACGCAACGGG, incorporating an NdeI site (underlined), and the reverse primer was CCGGCTCGAGTTAGTTTTGCGATAAGGTCAGCTTCTG, incorporating an XhoI site (underlined) after the stop codon of nanH gene. These primers generated a 2274-bp fragment encoding the protein without signal sequence. Amplification of the gene was carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 0.1 μm each primer, a 50-ng template, 100 μm dNTPs, and 3 units of Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase (Promega) in 1× Pfu DNA polymerase buffer, which was supplied with the enzyme. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30s for 1 cycle followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. A final extension time of 72 °C for 7 min was then applied. The resulting gene fragment was cleaned and double-digested with NdeI and XhoI before ligation to the expression vector pET30b(+), which was predigested with the same enzymes. The ligation mix was then used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. Positive clones were identified from LB agar plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin by colony PCR using the original PCR primers, and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to transforming the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression was performed by inoculating single colonies into LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Cultures were grown first at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5–0.6 at 600 nm before subjecting cells to a heat shock of 42 °C for 20 min. The temperature of the cultures was then lowered to 25 °C for 10 min before the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to initiate protein expression. Cultures were then left shaking at 25 °C overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation (8000 × g, 4 °C), and pellets were frozen at -80 °C until required. Protein Purification—The enzyme used in the NMR experiment and in the co-crystals of α-2,6-sialyllactose was obtained using the second vector. The purification protocol of the enzyme was the same for the two expressions. The enzyme was recovered from the shock fluid (or cell lysis) by precipitation with 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The pellet was dissolved in the minimum volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, the undissolved material was removed by centrifugation, and the clear sample was dialyzed exhaustively against the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The sample was then loaded onto a POROS HQ20 anion exchange column. The protein was eluted from the column using a buffer system containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 250 mm NaCl. Fractions were checked for neuraminidase activity using 4-methylum-belliferyl as substrate and were passed over a size exclusion chromatography Superdex 200 Hi-Load 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl after dialysis against the same buffer. Crystallization—Co-crystals with the ligands were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion in a few days at 18 °C and obtained by adding 2 μl of 6.0 mg/ml VCNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.025% NaN3 to 1 μl of a 15 mm solution of α-2,3-sialyllactose or α-2,6-sialyllactose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 μl of the precipitant solution containing 10% polyethylene glycol 3350, 40 mm NaCl, and a 10 mm mixture of disaccharides, sucrose, maltose, and lactose. We discovered that the use of the sugar mixture improved the quality of the crystals while trying to investigate the sugar that might bind to the enzyme. The reservoir solution contained 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 150 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—Data were collected on beamline ID14–2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. All data were collected under cryogenic conditions using 20% glycerol in the crystallization buffer as a cryoprotector. Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL package (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38446) Google Scholar) and converted into structural factor amplitudes with TRUNCATE (19P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) was used to solve the structures of the complexes using the structure of the native room temperature VCNA as the search model. Rigid body refinement of all three domains was carried out in the CNS program suite (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuzewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) against the measured reflections in the resolution shell 8–4 Å. Subsequently, several rounds of positional and temperature-factor refinement using the whole resolution range were carried out interleaved with model building with the program O (22Jones A.T. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The ligands were located in difference maps (Fig. 3). Four Ca+2 ions were located in both structures (Fig. 1). Water oxygen atoms were located using Water-Pick module in CNS, 943 and 686 water molecules were added to the α-2,3-sialyllactose and α-2,6-sialyllactose complex structures, respectively. Atomic coordinates for the α-2,3-sialyllactose and α-2,6-sialyllactose complexes have been deposited with the codes 1w0o and 1w0p. 1H NMR to Monitor the Hydrolysis of α-2,3-Sialyllactose—The hydrolysis of 10 mm α-2,3-sialyllactose in the presence of 4.0 mg/ml VCNA in 0.6 ml of 50 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5, uncorrected) containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy over time on a 600-MHz Brüker Avance spectrometer at 298K. Spectra were acquired with 128 scans and 32K of data points over a spectral width of 7200 Hz with a relaxation delay of 2 s. The optimum pH for activity of VCNA was reported to be between 5.5 and 6.0 (23Ada G.L. French E.L. Lind P.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 24: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A series of spectra were acquired (13 in total) after the addition of the VCNA to the α-2,3-sialyllactose solution. Three initial spectra were acquired at 0.5-h intervals, and thereafter spectra were acquired each hour. Spectra of 10 mm α-2,3-sialyllactose and 10 mm Neu5Ac2en in the same buffer (50 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2) were acquired as control spectra. STD NMR Spectroscopy—A sample containing 27 μm VCNA and 300 μm of the thiosialoside in 0.6 ml of 50 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5, uncorrected) containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 and a reference sample containing 300 μm of thiosialoside (180 nmol) in only 0.6 ml of the aforementioned buffer were prepared. Confirmation of assignment of the thiosialoside resonances was achieved using two-dimensional COSY spectra. For the STD NMR experiment of the thiosialoside in complex with VCNA, the protein was saturated at a frequency of 4315 Hz in the aromatic/amide region of the spectrum (δ = 7.2 ppm) and off-resonance at 20,000 Hz with a cascade of 40 selective Gaussian shaped pulses of 50-ms duration with a 100-μsec delay between each pulse resulting in a total saturation time of 2 s. Spectra with total saturation times of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 s were also acquired. All NMR spectra were recorded at 298K with 2K scans and a relaxation delay of 1 s. Water suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE sequence (24Chong A.K.J. Pegg M.S. Taylor N.R. Vonitzstein M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and a 10-ms spin lock pulse was used to suppress the protein signals. The longitudinal relaxation time T1 of the protons of thiosialoside resonances in the presence of VCNA were measured using the inversion recovery method. For these spectra, which were performed in duplicate, a relaxation delay of 50 s over 16 K of data points with a 12-ppm spectral width were used. STD effects were calculated according to the equation ASTD = (I0 - Isat)/I0 = ISTD/I0 by comparing the intensity of the signals in the STD NMR spectrum (ISTD) with signal intensities of a reference spectrum. For quantitative purposes the STD and reference spectra were acquired employing a spin lock field that was applied for 10 ms. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—VCNA was produced using the new expression system as described earlier. An 11 mg/ml solution of VCNA was prepared in the ITC buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and NaN3. A sample of the thiosialoside was prepared in the ITC buffer. Titration experiments were performed using the VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). The isothermal binding curve was obtained by titrating a 0.6 mm ligand solution into a 27 μm VCNA solution. The heat released or absorbed was obtained by integrating the heat burst peaks of the power-time curve. Heats of dilution were determined by titrating 0.6 mm ligand into the ITC buffer, and the observed heats of binding were corrected for heats of dilution prior to data analysis. Data were integrated and processed with the ORIGIN 5.0 analysis software (Microcal). The Sialyllactose Complexes—Apart from the positional displacement at the loops, Thr32-Ser39, Asn59-Pro64, Glu136-Arg141, and Trp606-Leu612, which required rebuilding during the refinement, the overall structures of the free (room temperature, 2.4-Å resolution) and ligand-bound (frozen) enzymes are almost identical. Superimposing the free and the α-2,3-sialyllactose (Fig. 2) complex structures gives a root mean square distance of 0.86 Å for 747 Cα atoms, with the individual domains having root mean square distances of 0.63, 0.48, and 0.52 Å for the N-terminal lectin domain, the catalytic domain, and the C-terminal lectin domain, respectively. The α-2,3-sialyllactose and α-2,6-sialyllactose complexes are very similar and superimpose with a root mean square distance of 0.33 Å for 753 Cα atoms. Sialic Acid Binding Site—The electron density maps of both complexes clearly show the α-Neu5Ac bound in the concave surface of the N-terminal lectin domain (Fig. 3). The binding pocket is located on the same side of the enzyme with respect to the catalytic site ∼50 Å away (Fig. 1). The carboxylate group of α-Neu5Ac points in to the binding site, and the anomeric oxygen points out to solvent. All substituents of the sugar ring, except the anomeric oxygen and O-9 of the glycerol side chain, contribute to the interaction with the lectin domain (Table II, Fig. 3). There was no evidence in the electron density for any part of the lactose moiety, suggesting that either it is disordered or more likely that the sialyllactose had been hydrolyzed during the co-crystallization. Minor changes occur upon α-Neu5Ac binding, in comparison to the free enzyme. The side chain of Arg74 moves such that its Cγ and Cδ pack against the side chain of Gln76, the side chain of Gln188 rotates to allow its Nϵ2 atom to interact with O-4, the Ψ angles of Gly196 and Asn199 change by ∼50° to allow interaction with the N-5 of the N-acetyl group and O-8 of the glycerol side chain, respectively.Table IIInteractions of VCNA with Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac2en W indicates an interaction mediated via a water molecule.Hydrogen bondingHydrophobic interactionsNeu5Ac atomVCNA atomDistanceNeu5Ac atomVCNA atomDistanceÅÅO-1AArg74-Nη12.83C-11Tyr111-Cζ3.73O-1ASer198-N2.99C-11Leu120-Cδ24.18O-1BSer198-Oγ2.91C-11Thr109-Cϵ4.39O-4Gln188-Nϵ23.18O-4W↔Gln76-Oϵ12.71O-4W↔Gln76-Nϵ2 and Tyr111-Oη2.80N-5Gly196-O2.77O-7W↔Arg118-Nη22.66O-8Asn199-Nδ23.17O-10Arg118-Nη12.82Neu5Ac2en atomVCNA atomDistanceNeu5Ac2en atomVCNA atomDistanceÅÅO-1AArg224-Nη12.86C-1Tyr740-Oη2.90O-1AArg224-Nη22.92C-2Tyr740-Oη2.76O-1AArg712-Nη12.86C-2Ile225-Cδ5.29O-1BArg712-Nη22.89C-3Ile225-Cδ4.09O-1BArg635-Nη13.27C-9Phe638-Cζ4.29O-1BArg635-Nη23.16C-9Leu580-Cδ14.87O-4Arg245-Nη22.87C-9Asn637-Cβ4.45O-4Asp250-Oδ13.18C-11Trp311-Cζ24.69O-7Asn318-Oδ12.69C-11Pro251-Cγ3.88O-8Asp637-Oδ22.71C-11Asn317-Cβ4.15O-10Asn318-Nδ23.36O-10Asn318-Oδ13.30 Open table in a new tab STD NMR Experiments to Investigate the Binding of Neu5,9Ac2-2-S-(α-2,6)-GlcNAcβ1Me to VCNA Lectin-like Domain—Fig. 4 shows the aliphatic region between δ = 1.5 and 5.0 ppm of the (a) 1H NMR and (b) STD NMR spectra of the thiosialoside in complex with VCNA. Although a range of saturation times between 0.25 and 2.0 s were investigated, only the 2-s saturation time for the STD experiment is shown. Signals between δ = 3.5 and 3.8 ppm attributable to the Neu5Ac carbohydrate ring portion of the thiosialoside are observed in the STD spectrum; however no significant signal intensity because of the aglycon moiety is seen. Additionally, signals due to the acetate methyl protons attached to C-5 and the H-3eq and H-3ax signals of Neu5,9Ac2 portion of the ligand are seen in this spectrum. Taken together these observations suggest that the Neu5,9Ac portion of the thiosialoside binds to the VCNA N-lectin like domain but the aglycon moiety is not significantly in contact with the enzyme in this region. Very little residual signal intensity is observed for the acetate methyl protons attached at C-9 of Neu5Ac suggesting that this position has very little interaction with the N-lectin like domain. In contrast, the N-acetyl methyl protons attached to the C-5 position of Neu5Ac have the strongest interaction with the VCNA, as reflected by the intensity of this signal in the STD spectrum. A quantitative comparison of the STD intensities for the methyl groups of the thiosialoside, that all have similar T1 values making comparison of their binding epitope valid (25Yan J. Kline A.D. Mo H. Shapiro M.J. Zartler E.R. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 163: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), reveals that when the C-5 acetate methyl intensity (Neu5Ac) is normalized to 100% then the corresponding values for the C-9 acetate, the methyl protons of the GlcNAc acetate, and the β1Me aglycon were of the order of 10%. Affinity of the Sialic Acid Binding Site by ITC—ITC using the thiosialoside gave the following values averaged from two repeat experiments, stoichiometry (n) of 0.94 ± 0.08, ΔG = -6.3 ± 0.0 kcal/mol, ΔH = -14.3 ± 1.5 kcal/mol, TΔS = -7.9 kcal/mol, and Ka = 2.68 ± 0.22 × 104m-1 giving a Kd = 37 μm. Presence of the Inhibitor Neu5Ac2en in the α-2,3-Sialyllactose Complex—The difference electron density map for the α-2,3-sialyllactose complex clearly showed the inhibitor Neu5Ac2en bound in the active site (Fig. 5). The 1.9-Å resolution structure reported here gives refined details of the interactions at the active site and shows the importance of water molecules in mediating the binding. Fig. 5 and Table II detail the interactions. As seen in other neuraminidases, an arginine triad interacts with the carboxylate group of Neu5Ac2en, and the hydroxyl of Tyr740 is close to C-2 of Neu5Ac2en. Such a tyrosine, together with a neighboring glutamic acid (Glu619 in VCNA), has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of neuraminidases (15Burmeister W.P. Henrissat B. Bosso C. Cusack S.

Ile225, part of the RIP motif conserved across all non-viral neuraminidases, forms a hydrophobic interaction with C-2 of the ligand. As well as direct hydrogen-bonds between the ligand and the enzyme, there are several water-mediated interactions in the active site of the α-2,3-sialyllactose complex involving O-4, N-5, O-8, O-9, and O-10 of Neu5Ac2en. The acetamidomethyl group sits in a pocket lined on one side by the side chains of Trp311, Gln317, and Pro251 and on the other side by the side chains of Asp292 and Asn545. The α-2,6-sialyllactose complex did not show Neu5Ac2en in the catalytic site but did show a glycerol, sourced form the cryoprotectant, sitting in a similar position to the glycerol side chain of Neu5Ac2en in the α-2,3-sialyllactose complex. 1H NMR Evidence That Neu5Ac2en Is Generated during the Hydrolysis Reaction—Fig. 6 shows the time-course reaction of the hydrolysis of α-2,3-sialyllactose catalyzed by VCNA as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. By monitoring signals in the aliphatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum from 1.2 to 2.8 ppm, it is easy to follow the hydrolysis reaction of the substrate α-2,3-sialyllactose and the formation of the products of the hydrolysis reaction, α-Neu5Ac and β-Neu5Ac, because the H-3 equatorial and axial proton signals of each of the Neu5Ac species are easily discriminated in this region of the spectrum. The first spectrum shown in Fig. 6a at t = 0.5 h shows characteristic signals for the H-3 protons of α-Neu5Ac at H-3eq = 2.63 ppm, H-3ax = 1.53 ppm and for β-Neu5Ac at H-3eq = 2.14 ppm, H-3ax = 1.71 ppm. As the reaction proceeds the intensity of the H-3 signals for the α-Neu5Ac decrease in intensity until at 3.5 h, they disappear completely; however there is a concomitant increase in signals attributable to the H-3 protons of β-Neu5Ac. This result is in accordance with previously published data consistent with the α-anomer of Neu5Ac being released as the first product of the hydrolysis reaction, which then mutarotates to β-Neu5Ac to give a final anomeric ratio of Neu5Ac α:β 2:98%. Fig. 6b also shows spectra between 5.5 and 5.7 ppm during the time-course reaction. Interestingly, a signal appears at 5.59 ppm in this region of the spectrum at times between 0.5 and 9 h.

SERT plays a prominent role in the regulation of serotoninergic neurotransmission and is a molecular target for multiple antidepressants as well as substances of abuse. Here we show that SERT associates with lipid rafts in both heterologous expression systems and rat brain and that the inclusion of the transporter into lipid microdomains is critical for serotonin uptake activity. SERT is present in a subpopulation of lipid rafts, which is soluble in Triton X-100 but insoluble in other non-ionic detergents such as Brij 58. Disaggregation of lipid rafts upon depletion of cellular cholesterol results in a decrease of serotonin transport capacity (Vmax), due to the reduction of turnover number of serotonin transport. Our data suggest that the association of SERT with lipid rafts may represent a mechanism for regulating the transporter activity and, consequently, serotoninergic signaling in the central nervous system, through the modulation of the cholesterol content in the cell membrane. Furthermore, SERT-containing rafts are detected in both intracellular and cell surface fractions, suggesting that raft association may be important for trafficking and targeting of SERT.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2618-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The SNARE protein syntaxin 1A (Syn 1A) is one of the few proteins known to modulate SERT function via protein-protein interaction by regulating the number of SERT molecules on the plasma membrane (13Quick M.W. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Haase J. Killian A.M. Magnani F. Williams C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 722-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To carry out clearance of extracellular 5HT, SERT must be inserted into the plasma membrane in an active form. This may require targeting the transporter to specific plasma membrane regions, but not others. The study of how asymmetry is generated and maintained in polarized cells has changed old concepts of cell membranes. According to the Singer-Nicholson fluid mosaic model the lipid bilayer is a neutral two-dimensional solvent for membrane proteins (15Singer S.J. Nicholson G.L. Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (6138) Google Scholar). However, in model lipid bilayers, lipids can exist in different phases: as gel, liquid-ordered (lo), and liquid-disordered states (as in the Singer-Nicholson model). In the lo state, saturated hydrocarbonic chains of phospholipids are tightly packed with cholesterol, thus conferring a limited horizontal mobility in the membrane. This model has been confirmed at least partially in cell membranes: the exoplasmic leaflet contains lipid microdomains, which are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol and are segregated from glycerolipids. Such lipid microdomains, also known as “rafts,” resist solubilization at 4 °C in non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-100 (16Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 17Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The segregation of proteins into lipid microdomains is lost after depletion of cholesterol or sphingolipids. Lipid rafts appear to be involved in several cellular functions, from membrane trafficking to cell signaling (18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8154) Google Scholar). Membrane cholesterol was shown to be required for the stabilization of the structure of SERT. It has been observed that cholesterol depletion reversibly reduces ligand binding to SERT expressed in Sf9 insect cells (19.Baker, C. R. (1997) Studies on Heterologous Overexpression of the Serotonin Transporter. Ph.D. thesis, Trinity College Dublin, IrelandGoogle Scholar) and in HEK cells (20Scanlon S.M. Williams D.C. Schloss P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10507-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In both cases the function could be partially rescued by replacement of cholesterol, but not by other sterols, such as pregnenolone, 5-cholestene, and ergosterol. In the present study we show that SERT associates with lipid rafts and that, following the disaggregation of these lipid microdomains by cholesterol depletion, SERT, although retained on the cell surface, is no longer able to efficiently transport 5HT. We propose the existence of a novel mechanism of SERT regulation, based on lipid-protein interaction within plasma membrane lipid rafts. Plasmids—Rat SERT cDNA obtained from Patrick Schloss (21Mayser W. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used as a template to generate a PCR fragment containing the complete coding sequence but lacking the stop codon. The sequences of the primers used were 5′-CCGCTCGAGCAGGATGGAGACCACACC-3′ and 5′-TTGGTACCACAGCATTCATGCGGAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and KpnI and cloned the SalI-KpnI-digested vector pFLAG-CMV-5b (Sigma) resulting in plasmid pSERT-FLAG. The complete insert of the plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing. The pTLR4-FLAG plasmid was obtained from Marta Muzio (DRO-Oncology, Pharmacology Department, Pharmacia Corp., Nerviano, Italy). Reagents—An antiserum against the N-terminal domain of SERT was raised using the core protein of the hepatitis B virus as an epitope carrier (22Ulrich R. Nassal M. Meisel H. Kruger D.H. Adv. Virus Res. 1998; 50: 141-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A carrier vector was created from the hepatitis B core protein clone ΔCW (23Wynne S.A. Leslie A.G. Butler P.J. Crowther R.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), by introducing a BamHI site into the DNA at codon 79 (in the immunodominant loop region of the protein), and an HpaI site ten codons later. The DNA coding sequence for an N-terminal rat SERT peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 5-24 was inserted between these sites. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml lysozyme. Following lysis, 2 ml of 0.2 mg/ml DNase in 0.1 m MgCl2 was added, and the extract centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 50%, and the precipitated protein was pelleted (15,000 rpm, 10 min). The protein pellet was resuspended in running buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and passed down a CL4B gel filtration column. Fractions containing protein were reprecipitated with 50% (NH4)2SO4 and resuspended in running buffer overnight. The protein was then layered onto 20-40% sucrose gradients, with 70% sucrose cushions, and centrifuged in a SW28-Ti rotor at 28,000 rpm for 16 h. Fractions from the leading peak were pooled, dialyzed against running buffer, and concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml. The antiserum against the purified protein was raised in rabbit by Murex Biotech (Dartford, UK). The monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories; the monoclonal anti-flotillin 1 antibody and the anti-Munc 18-1 antibody were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories; the anti-syntaxin 1A antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Unless otherwise indicated, chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—T-REx-SERT cells expressing rSERT FLAG-tagged plasmid were grown as described previously (24Tate C.G. Haase J. Baker C. Boorsma M. Magnani F. Vallis Y. Williams D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SERT expression was induced by adding 1 μg/ml tetracycline 24 h before the assay. HEK-293 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing fetal calf serum (10% v/v), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% (v/v) CO2 on 10-cm tissue culture plates. RN46A-B14 cells were obtained from Dr. Scott Whittemore (Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY) and grown in DMEM/F-12 (50:50) medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), 250 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% (v/v) CO2. Cholesterol Depletion—Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with the appropriate amount of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβC, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cell monolayer was washed three times with buffer and immediately processed for the indicated assay as described. An MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was carried out using the procedure described by Carmichael et al. (25Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid Analysis—Cholesterol content of cells was measured enzymatically using the Infinity Cholesterol Reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For phospholipids analysis, lipids were extracted using the Folch method (26Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the lower lipid-containing phase was separated from the upper phase and used to analyze the total phosphorus using the Bartlett assay (27Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Markwell assay (28Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 72: 296-303Crossref Scopus (724) Google Scholar). [3H]5HT Uptake Assay—T-REx-SERT and HEK cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated (0.1 mg/ml) 24-well plates 3 days before experiments. If transient transfection was required, cells were transfected using GeneJuice transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen) 1 day after plating and grown for an additional 48 h. 5HT uptake assays were carried out as described previously (24Tate C.G. Haase J. Baker C. Boorsma M. Magnani F. Vallis Y. Williams D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RN46A-B14 cells were seeded onto uncoated 12-well plates 4 days before experiments, and the assay was carried out as above. For the ion replacement experiments, Na+ ions were replaced with choline, and Cl- ions were replaced with acetate. Immunofluorescence—Patching experiments were carried out as described by Harder and Simons (1999). Briefly, cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips (treated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine) in 6-well plates. Cells in DMEM medium were incubated with 5 μg/ml CTxB at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with anti-CTxB (1:500) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then placed on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.5, for 10 min at room temperature. The fixative was quenched by incubating cells with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. Fixed cells were incubated with blocking solution (0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5% (v/v) donkey serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (mouse, 1:1000, Sigma) diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate- and anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated antibodies (donkey, Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were mounted in 2 μg/μl p-phenylenediamine in 1:1 (v/v) glycerol:PBS. Samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Sucrose Flotation Gradients—At confluence, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. If required, the cells were incubated with 3 μg/ml CTxB for 10 min at room temperature. The cell monolayer was washed three times with PBS, and cells were lysed with 1 ml of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Complete™ Protease Inhibitor mixture) containing the indicated concentration of non-ionic detergent, for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were homogenized with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (Thomas Scientific), transferred into a minifuge tube, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 830 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge (5417R). Supernatants were transferred into a fresh minifuge tube. The pellets (P1) were resuspended in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and stored at -20 °C. 500 μl of cell supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose in TNE buffer, transferred into a ultracentrifuge tube, then carefully overlaid with 1 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose in TNE buffer and finally with 0.5 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose in TNE buffer. The tube was placed in a cooled AH650 swinging-bucket rotor, and centrifugation was carried out in a Discovery100-Sorvall ultracentrifuge at 4 °C, for 17 h at 134,400 × g. Eight fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient. The remaining pellet (P2) was resuspended following centrifugation in 500 μl of solubilization buffer and stored at -20 °C. Cell Surface Biotinylation of Subcellular Fractions—Cholesterol was depleted from cells as described. Control cells and cells treated with MβC were washed three times with ice-cold PBS++ (PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated in ice-cold 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin/PBS++ (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold quench buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS++) and incubated in quench buffer for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The cell monolayer was rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS++ and then lysed in 1% Brij 58 as described above. Aliquots of lysates containing equal amounts of protein were centrifuged for 1 h at 101,300 × g in a Discovery100-Sorvall ultracentrifuge at 4 °C. The pellet (“rafts”) was resuspended in the same lysis buffer used to lyse the cells, and the supernatant was placed in a fresh tube (“soluble” material). An aliquot of total, soluble, and rafts samples was incubated overnight at 4 °C with equilibrated NeutrAvidin beads (60 μg of protein/50 μl of beads; Pierce), with end-over-end mixing. The supernatant (unbound fraction in, corresponding to cytoplasmic proteins) was saved in a fresh tube. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer. Bound proteins (out, corresponding to cell surface proteins) were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-sample buffer. Blots were acquired and analyzed using UVP BioImaging Systems and LabWorks software. Cholesterol-dependent Association of SERT with Lipid Rafts Is Important for 5HT Uptake Activity—We used the cyclic oligosaccharide methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβC) to analyze the effect of cholesterol depletion on SERT function. T-REx-SERT cells were treated with various amounts of MβC and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell viability was not significantly affected by MβC in the 1.25-20 mg/ml range (Fig. 1A), and 50% or more of cholesterol was sequestered by 10-20 mg/ml MβC (Fig. 1B). In T-REx-SERT cells [3H]5HT uptake was reduced to less than 50% upon incubation with 10-20 mg/ml MβC (Fig. 1C). Saturation kinetic analysis of [3H]5HT transport in these cells to obtain Vmax and Km values proved difficult, due to the high level of SERT expression in these cells, which results in a marked increase of Km values (24Tate C.G. Haase J. Baker C. Boorsma M. Magnani F. Vallis Y. Williams D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed these experiments in HEK cells, which were transiently transfected with SERT. In accordance with previous results obtained under similar conditions (20Scanlon S.M. Williams D.C. Schloss P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10507-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), cholesterol depletion by MβC in these cells resulted in a decrease of Vmax values in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1D: control, Vmax 8.4 ± 0.2 pmol/min/106 cells; 10 mg/ml MβC, Vmax 4.0 ± 0.6 pmol/min/106 cells; 20 mg/ml MβC, Vmax 3.0 ± 0.6 pmol/min/106 cells). At the same time the affinity of [3H]5HT uptake decreased slightly (control, Km 446 ± 73 nm; 10 mg/ml MβC, Km 819 ± 452 nm; 20 mg/ml MβC, Km 938 ± 717 nm). 5HT uptake through rat SERT depends on the presence of Na+ and Cl- (29Kanner B.I. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 237-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether cholesterol depletion affected serotonin transport even at low sodium concentration, 5HT uptake was measured in the presence of either 150 or 10 mm Na+. At 150 mm sodium treatment with MβC reduced the transport of serotonin, whereas at 10 mm sodium 5HT uptake was not significantly affected by the reduction of cholesterol (Fig. 1E). As shown in Fig. 1F, 5HT transport rate was reduced in cholesterol-depleted cells both at high (150 mm) and low Cl- (10 mm) compared with the controls. Cholesterol is a major component of lipid rafts. A feature of these microdomains is their resistance to extraction by nonionic detergents at 4 °C, such as Triton X-100 (16Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8154) Google Scholar). This property has been widely used to isolate rafts: due to the high lipid content, detergent-resistant complexes manifest high buoyancy upon centrifugation in a density gradient, and thus float in the upper layers of the density gradient. To examine whether the apparent importance of cholesterol for 5HT uptake activity reflects the association of SERT with lipid microdomains, we examined the solubilization profile of the transporter in non-ionic detergents. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in the appropriate detergent, homogenized, and subjected to centrifugation at 830 × g for 10 min to clear the lysates from nuclei and unbroken cells. Cell lysates were placed at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (5% to 30% to 40%) and centrifuged at 134,400 × g for 17 h at 4 °C. Fully solubilized proteins remained in the bottom layers, while insoluble proteins associated with lipid microdomains floated in the upper layers at the 5-30% interface. SERT was fully solubilized by 1% Triton X-100, whereas about 40% of SERT was insoluble in 1% Brij 58 and therefore recovered in the upper layers of the sucrose density gradient (Fig. 2A, top panel). The distribution of SERT along the sucrose gradient did not depend on the amount of transporter expressed by T-REx-SERT. Similar flotation profiles where obtained when SERT expression was induced with either 10 ng/ml tetracycline (enough to achieve half-maximal 5HT uptake (24Tate C.G. Haase J. Baker C. Boorsma M. Magnani F. Vallis Y. Williams D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) or with 1 μg/ml tetracycline/5 mm sodium butyrate, which enhances SERT expression levels ∼5-fold (data not shown). A similar flotation profile for the transporter was obtained when pSERT-FLAG was transiently transfected into HEK cells (data not shown). In contrast, another membrane protein, the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 transiently expressed in HEK cells, was fully solubilized by both detergents (Fig. 2A, bottom panel), indicating that SERT insolubility in Brij 58 is neither due to an incomplete solubilization of bulk membrane nor due to overexpression of a membrane protein per se. Similar flotation profiles for the serotonin transporter were obtained when Triton X-100 and Brij 58 were used in a range 0.5-3% w/v (data not shown), suggesting that variation of the detergent/protein mass ratio does not affect SERT solubility. The lipid microdomains marker flotillin-1 (30Lamb M.E. Zhang C. Shea T. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14340-14347Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was recovered in the upper fractions, whereas the transferrin receptor, TfR, a non-lipid rafts marker (31Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), was recovered at the bottom of the density gradient (Fig. 2B, middle and bottom panels). If SERT insolubility in Brij 58 reflects its association with lipid rafts, the question arises whether cholesterol is needed to maintain the structure of these high buoyancy complexes. MβC selectively depletes cholesterol from membranes, therefore disrupting lipid microdomains whose integrity depends on cholesterol. For this purpose, T-REx-SERT cells were incubated with 10 mg/ml MβC for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently lysed in 1% w/v Brij 58 at 4 °C. Flotation profiles for SERT on density gradient centrifugation revealed that cholesterol depletion by MβC caused SERT to shift to the lower buoyant density fractions (Fig. 2B, top panel). Notably, flotillin-1 was still recovered in the upper fractions of the density gradient, suggesting that it may localize in a different subset of lipid microdomains, less sensitive to cholesterol levels. When cholesterol was sequestered from cells by a combination of 0.5% w/v Brij 58 and 0.2% w/v saponin, which is known to form insoluble complexes with cholesterol, SERT was effectively solubilized and no longer recovered in high buoyancy fractions of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 2C). Other tools to disaggregate lipid microdomains were investigated. However, similarly to what was previously reported by Schuck and coworkers (32Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), the metabolic inhibitors sphingomyelinase or fumonisin B1 did not reduce the association of rafts markers with lipid microdomains in intact T-Rex-SERT cells (not shown). Differential Solubilization of SERT in Various Detergents—The lipid and protein composition of lipid rafts has recently been shown to differ when different detergents are used (32Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 33Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For this reason, we compared the solubilization of SERT in four non-ionic detergents having both different structure and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values (Table I): Triton X-100, Tween 80, Brij 58, and Tween 20. Critical micellar concentration (CMC) values should be taken into account when assessing the efficacy of different detergent in solubilizing a given protein. Thus, we compared the four detergents at concentrations corresponding to 10-, 100-, or 300-fold of their respective CMC. However, similar solubilization profiles were obtained for the three conditions. The subunit B of Cholera toxin binds to the ganglioside GM1 that localizes in lipid microdomains and is therefore widely used as a rafts marker (31Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). SERT was fully solubilized in Triton X-100, whereas GM1 was still recovered in the upper fractions. Similarly, SERT was fully solubilized in Nonidet P-40, a non-ionic detergent of similar structure to Triton X-100 (not shown). However, SERT was partially insoluble in Brij 58 (∼40%), in Tween 80, and in Tween 20 (Fig. 3A, left panel). The vast majority of actin was retrieved at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 3A, right panel), supporting the conclusion that the insolubility of SERT is due to the association with low buoyancy lipid rafts and not with the cytoskeleton. The enrichment of GM1 in lipid microdomains varied as well as the distribution of SERT along the density gradient depending on the detergent used. Most (>50%) of CTxB was recovered in the upper fractions of the gradient when cells were lysed in Brij 58 (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Notably, when cells were lysed in Tween 80 and Tween 20, a consistent amount of SERT and CTxB immunoreactivity was recovered in the pellet (P1) resulting from partial cell lysis, even at detergent concentrations corresponding to 300-fold CMC (Fig. 3A).Table IHLB and CMC for some non-ionic detergents (59Helenius A.

https://openalex.org/W2127766269,"Hepatoblastoma is one of the most common malignant liver tumors in young children. Recent evidences have suggested that the abnormalities in Wnt signaling pathway, as seen in frequent mutation of the beta-catenin gene, may play a role in the genesis of hepatoblastoma. However, the precise mechanism to cause the tumor has been elusive. To identify novel hepatoblastoma-related genes for unveiling the molecular mechanism of the tumorigenesis, a large-scale cloning of cDNAs and differential screening of their expression between hepatoblastomas and the corresponding normal livers were performed. We constructed four full-length-enriched cDNA libraries using an oligo-capping method from the primary tissues which included two hepatoblastomas with high levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a hepatoblastoma without production of AFP, and a normal liver tissue corresponded to the tumor. Among the 10,431 cDNAs randomly picked up and successfully sequenced, 847 (8.1%) were the genes with unknown function. Of interest, the expression profile among the two subsets of hepatoblastoma and a normal liver was extremely different. A semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that 86 out of 1188 genes tested were differentially expressed between hepatoblastomas and the corresponding normal livers, but that only 11 of those were expressed at high levels in the tumors. Notably, PLK1 oncogene was expressed at very high levels in hepatoblastomas as compared to the normal infant's livers. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis for the PLK1 mRNA levels in 74 primary hepatoblastomas and 29 corresponding nontumorous livers indicated that the patients with hepatoblastoma with high expression of PLK1 represented significantly poorer outcome than those with its low expression (5-year survival rate: 55.9 vs 87.0%, respectively, p=0.042), suggesting that the level of PLK1 expression is a novel marker to predict the prognosis of hepatoblastoma. Thus, the differentially expressed genes we have identified may become a useful tool to develop new diagnostic as well as therapeutic strategies of hepatoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2119864607,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a major transactivator of heat shock proteins in response to heat shock, and it is also involved in oogenesis, spermatogenesis, and placental development. However, we do not know the molecular mechanisms controlling developmental processes. In this study, we found that HSF1-null mice exhibited a significant decrease in the T cell-dependent B cell response. When mice were immunized intraperitoneally with sheep red blood cells, the sheep red blood cell-specific IgG production, especially IgG2a production, in HSF1-null mice was about 50% lower than that in wild-type mice at 6 days after the immunization, whereas IgM production was normal. The number of bromodeoxyuridine-incorporated spleen cells in immunized HSF1-null mice was one-third that in immunized wild-type mice, indicating reduced proliferation of the spleen cells. We analyzed levels of cytokines and chemokines in spleen cells and in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ and found that expression levels of interleukin-6 and CCL5 were significantly lower in HSF1-null cells than those in wild-type cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the IL-6 gene is a direct target gene of HSF1. These results revealed a novel molecular link between HSF1 and a gene related to immune response and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2031116438,"The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR) has been invoked in different signaling pathways. In cells pre-exposed to the PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine or in PKR-null cells, the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) following dsRNA stimulation is attenuated. We found that the p38 MAPK activator MKK6, but not its close relatives MKK3 or MKK4, exhibited an increased affinity for PKR following the exposure of cells to poly(rI:rC), a dsRNA analog. In vitro kinase assays revealed that MKK6 was efficiently phosphorylated by PKR, and this could be inhibited by 2-aminopurine. Expression of kinase-inactive PKR (K296R) in cells inhibited the poly(IC)-induced phosphorylation of MKK3/6 detected by phosphospecific antiserum but did not affect the poly(IC)-induced gel migration retardation of MKK3. This suggests that poly(IC)-mediated in vivo activation of MKK6, but not MKK3, is through PKR. Consistent with this observation, PKR was capable of activating MKK6 as assessed in a coupled kinase assay containing the components of the p38 MAPK pathway. Our results indicate that the interaction of MKK6 and PKR provides a mechanism for regulating p38 MAPK activation in response to dsRNA stimulation. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR) has been invoked in different signaling pathways. In cells pre-exposed to the PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine or in PKR-null cells, the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) following dsRNA stimulation is attenuated.

DsRNA-dependent interferon synthesis as well as NF-κB activation may require the binding of dsRNA with cellular membrane component(s) that includes Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) (1Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar). However, other dsRNA sensor cellular components have also been implicated in the activation of cellular pathways triggered by dsRNA (2Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A.

This enzyme is activated in response to dsRNA of viral or synthetic origin, most notably the synthetic polyribonucleotide duplex, poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC), and also by cytokines and cellular stress signals (5Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, PKR functions as one of the mediators of antiviral and antiproliferative activities of interferons (6Chong K.L. Feng L.

Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). On binding dsRNA, PKR dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation at multiple sites (5Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Taylor D.R. Lee S.B. Romano P.R.

The direct antiviral activity of PKR is a consequence of the phosphorylation and activation of its major substrate eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and impeding virus multiplication (6Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 10Meurs E.F. Watanabe Y. Kadereit S.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13451-13457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to playing a role in protein synthesis inhibition, PKR also functions in other biological processes including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and cell growth, independent of the phosphorylation of eIF2α (5Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these mechanisms mediated by PKR in response to dsRNA might be attributed either to protein-protein interaction or to the phosphorylation of substrates other than eIF2α. Accordingly, PKR has been shown to interact constitutively or in a stimulus-dependent manner with a number of proteins, which may serve as PKR substrates, thus regulating protein translation and transcriptional activity (3Kumar A.

A role for PKR in transcriptional activity in the inflammatory response was suggested by the observation that PKR-null primary fibroblasts and mice had defects in the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and downstream proinflammatory gene expression in response to different stimuli (29Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of distinct p38 MAPK isoforms can be selectively regulated by a group of MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), which include MKK3, MKK6, and SEK1/MKK4 (30Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

More recently, a novel mechanism for p38 MAPK activation independent of a classical MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAP kinase cascade has been demonstrated (34Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a strong body of evidence supports the notion that MKK6 functions as the major and direct activator of p38 MAPK isoforms (30Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

The activation of MKK6 is regulated on Ser and Thr residues within subdomain VIII by MAPKKKs (38Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S.

It has been reported that p38 MAPK can be activated by dsRNA and viruses through distinct but unknown mechanisms (29Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R.

The TLR3-mediated activation of MAPKs in response to dsRNA stimulation is normal in cells lacking the TLR adaptor MYD88 (1Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar). Also, we have shown previously that PKR contributes to p38 MAPK pathway activation (29Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we investigated the intermediate components linking PKR to p38 activation. PKR was found to specifically interact with and activate MKK6 in a dsRNA-dependent manner, thus facilitating the activation of p38 MAPK pathway. Cell Culture and Transfections—HT1080 and 293T cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium. THP-1 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. Bone marrow macrophages were isolated from isogenic wild-type or PKR-/- mice (C57/BL6 pure background) (2Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M.

RAW264.7 cells expressing either PKRK296R (RAW-PKRK296R cells) or an empty vector (RAW-neo/bla cells) were generated in two rounds of transfections. In the first round, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with the plasmid pRcCMV-PKRK296R and selected both for the resistance to G418 and for the expression of human PKR-K296R by reverse transcriptase-PCR. As increased levels of the human PKR-K296R were not detected by immunoblotting with anti-PKR polyclonal antibody, a positive clone identified by reverse transcriptase-PCR in the first round was transfected with ptV5K296R plasmid, and the selection of blasticidin-resistant clones expressing PKR-K296R was further assessed through immunoblotting by using anti-V5 antibody. The selected clones were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 and 1 μg/ml blasticidin. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Near confluent 293T or HT1080 cells growing in 10-cm plates were split 1:15 the day before transfection by the calcium phosphate method (48Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using 5 μg of each plasmid. Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid constructs pcDNA3.1 MKK3 and FLAG-tagged MKK4 were kindly provided by Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). Construct pCEFL-GSTMKK6 was a gift of Dr. Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Catalytically inactive mutant human PKR (pRcCMV-PKRK296R) has been described (3Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). For subcloning of either MKK6 into pET15b vector, a 1006-bp cDNA segment was amplified from the pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK6 or pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK6(glu). Gel-purified PCR product was ligated into PCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After obtaining positive colonies, a sequence-verified plasmid was grown, double-digested with BamHI and NdeI, purified, and finally subcloned into pET15b. Plasmid ptV5K296R has been described previously (29Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents and Antibodies—poly(rI):poly(rC), 2-aminopurine (2-AP), and LPS were obtained from Sigma. Blasticidin-S hydrochloride and Geneticin® (G418-sulfate) were purchased from Invitrogen. Phospho site-specific anti-phospho eIF2α (Ser-51), MKK3/6 (Ser-189/-207), and p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-MKK6 was purchased from Stressgen. Anti-MEK3 and anti-MEK4/SEK1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin and anti-FLAG-M2 were purchased from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against human PKR (designated BC1, which is raised against the dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR) was generated previously in our laboratory (4Zamanian-Daryoush M. Mogensen T.H. DiDonato J.A. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The anti-human PKR monoclonal antibody (clone 71/10) was described previously (49Laurent A.G. Krust B. Galabru J. Svab J. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4341-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Ara Hovanessian. Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Before lysis, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline. After treatments and/or transfections, cell extracts were prepared by extraction with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were quantified by Bradford assays. Thirty micrograms of cell lysates were fractionated onto 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred simultaneously to two PVDF filters (0.45 μm), and probed with the antibodies as indicated in the figures. Back filters were used to assess total protein loading. Briefly, before blocking in TBS-T 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, the membranes were washed in TBS-T for 5 min at room temperature. After three washes/5 min each in TBS-T, phosphospecific antibodies were diluted in TBS-T 5% bovine serum albumin followed by 12-16 h of incubation at 4 °C under rotation. Other antibodies were diluted into TBS-T 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After being washed as above, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Proteins were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Assays—Cell extracts were prepared as described above. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 500 μg of cell extracts obtained from experiments. For PKR pull-down assays, 2 μl from 1:10 prediluted monoclonal antibody 71/10 were used. Complexes were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and antibody-antigen complexes were captured by protein G-Sepharose overnight incubation. Beads were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer before immunobloting procedures. Recombinant Protein Preparation and Purification—Recombinant human PKR was prepared as His-tagged PKR fusion protein (23Carpick B.W. Graziano V. Schneider D. Maitra R.K. Lee X. Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9510-9516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with human PKR-containing pET15b. Cells were grown in Luria broth culture at 37 °C to an A600 0.6-1.0, treated with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for an additional 3 h, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), sonicated, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Purified histidine-tagged PKR was obtained through passing supernatant over a Ni2+ metal affinity column (His-Bind, Novagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. B56α, eIF2α, and MKK6 were also expressed as six histidine-tagged proteins and purified by affinity chromatography using His-Bind metal-chelating resin according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Novagen). GST-ATF2-(1-109) was purified as described (50Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitates from cell extracts or purified recombinant proteins were used for the in vitro kinase reactions in kinase reaction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6 mCi/mmol). Whenever indicated, poly(IC) was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 25 min. The phosphorylation of proteins was examined after fractionation in SDS-PAGE by autoradiogram analysis. To examine the ability of PKR to activate MKK6, a coupled kinase assay was carried out by incubating 0.2 μg of His-MKK6 with PKR immunocomplex at 30 °C for 15 min in kinase reaction buffer containing 100 μm ATP followed by an incubation at 30 °C for 7 min with 0.2 μg of GST-p38 MAPK (Stratagene). Subsequently, the activated complex was incubated with 2 μg of GST-ATF2 and 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6 mCi/mmol) for an additional 7 min at 30 °C. Reactions were fractionated onto 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. After transfer, the gel was Coomassie Blue-stained to assess GST-ATF2 loading. The phosphorylation of ATF2 was analyzed by autoradiogram analysis. Subsequently, the membrane was immunoprobed with polyclonal anti-PKR, anti-MKK6, and anti-p38 antibodies to assess loading control. A PKR-dependent Pathway Mediates the Effect of Double-stranded RNA on p38 MAPK Activation—The contribution of PKR to p38 MAPK activation elicited by dsRNA was examined in bone marrow macrophages derived from PKR-null mice. Comparative immunoblotting analyses of cell extracts reveal that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by pIC at later time points is attenuated in cells lacking PKR (Fig. 1A). The nucleoside analog 2-AP is known to inhibit the activity and PKR-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α (51Hu Y. Conway T.W. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 323-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the kinase activity of PKR is required specifically for dsRNA-induced p38 MAPK activation in vivo, we treated human promonocytic cell line THP-1 (in which LPS activates p38 MAPK) with pIC or LPS in the presence or absence of 2-AP. The activation of both p38 MAPK and eIF2α phosphorylation was severely compromised by 2-AP co-treatment (Fig. 2, left panel). Interestingly, in the presence of 2-AP, eIF2α phosphorylation returns to basal levels, whereas p38 MAPK does not. This inhibition was specific to dsRNA stimulation because at the same concentration, 2-AP did not inhibit p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to an LPS/TLR4-triggered signal (Fig. 2, right panel). Taken together, these results suggest that pIC triggers both a primary signaling event mediated by TLR-3 that may be PKR-independent and a secondary signal mediated after uptake into the cells that is dependent on PKR. In accord with this, 2-AP completely blocked the dsRNA-triggered phosphorylation of eIF2α but not p38 MAPK.Fig. 2Inhibition of dsRNA-activated p38 MAPK by 2-aminopurine. Anti-phospho-eIF2α (p-eIF2α) and phospho-p38 (p-p38) MAPK Western blot analysis in cell extracts of human promonocytic cells left untreated or treated with pIC (left panel) or 10 μg/ml LPS (right panel) in the presence or absence of 2-AP is shown. After treatment, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Thirty micrograms of cell lysates were fractionated in 10% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoprobed as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MKK6 Physically Interacts with PKR in Response to dsRNA Stimulation—It has been reported that the activation of MAPKs by dsRNA does not depend on TLR adaptor proteins MYD88 and/or TIR-containing adapter protein (1Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar, 52Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown previously that proinflammatory stimuli, including pIC, can activate the p38 MAPK pathway via a PKR-dependent signal in mouse embryo fibroblasts (29Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reasoned that upstream activators of p38 MAPK could be potential targets for PKR following pIC stimulation. To test this, HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with constructs encoding MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 and then treated with pIC. The phosphorylation of eIF2α was induced by pIC treatment and remained largely unaffected by expressing these constructs (not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation assays from these cell extracts (Fig. 3A) showed that MKK6, but not MKK3 or MKK4, had an increased affinity for PKR following dsRNA stimulation. Although JNK activator MKK4 could not be efficiently pulled-down from cell extracts, the result showed that MKK3, the most structural and functional p38 MAPK activator related to MKK6 (33Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not interact with PKR. Thus, pIC induces a specific interaction between PKR and MKK6. The poly(IC)-dependent interaction of PKR and MKK6 also occurred in 293T cells (Fig. 3B). The signal- and time-dependent interaction of PKR and MKK6 was further confirmed by performing the immunoprecipitation of endogenous PKR from pIC-treated 293T cells (Fig. 3C). Although a weak constitutive interaction of PKR and MKK6 was noted in this experiment, an increasing amount of overexpressed MKK6 became associated with endogenous PKR with increasing time of exposure of cells to pIC, peaking at 60 min after pIC treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that MKK6 is recruited to PKR to form a complex in response to dsRNA stimulation. MKK6 Is a Substrate for PKR—The above physical interaction studies suggested that MKK6 phosphorylation might be modulated by PKR. To address this possibility, we determined whether recombinant MKK6 could be efficiently phosphorylated by recombinant PKR in vitro. In the absence of pIC, PKR exhibited constitutive autocatalytic activity, and MKK6, as well as the PKR substrates, eIF2α and B56α, were phosphorylated (Fig. 4A). However, in the presence of pIC, there was an increase in PKR autophosphorylation, which was accompanied by the robust phosphorylation of MKK6, eIF2α, and B56α. To det"

IL-13 in particular is both necessary and sufficient for experimental models of asthma. The transcription factor NFAT plays a central role in cytokine transcriptional regulation in both cell types. Here, we analyze the molecular basis of IL13 gene transcription in Th2 and mast cells. We show that NFAT1 is the major NFAT protein involved in regulating IL13 transcription in mast cells. Although NFAT2 is correctly expressed and regulated in mast cells, it does not contribute to IL13 gene transcription as shown by analysis of cells lacking NFAT2 and cells expressing a constitutively active version of NFAT2. The difference between NFAT1 and NFAT2 appears to be due to a preferential synergistic interaction of NFAT1 with GATA proteins at the IL13 promoter. We suggest that mast cells lack a co-activator protein that stabilizes the binding of NFAT2 to the IL13 promoter by interacting either with NFAT2 itself or with a DNA-bound complex of NFAT2 and GATA proteins.

Th2 cells and mast cells are both central players in the pathophysiology of asthma (1Wills-Karp M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Th2 cells are characterized by the ability to produce a specific panel of cytokines, IL-4, 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; HA, hemagglutinin; ES, embryonal stem; BMMC, bone marrow-derived mast cells; ESMC, ES cell-derived mast cells; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CsA, cyclosporin A; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CA, constitutively active.1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; HA, hemagglutinin; ES, embryonal stem; BMMC, bone marrow-derived mast cells; ESMC, ES cell-derived mast cells; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CsA, cyclosporin A; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CA, constitutively active. IL-5, and IL-13. These cytokines are also produced by mast cells (2Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Solymar D.C. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), even though mast cells and Th2 cells derive from two different compartments of the immune system (myeloid and lymphoid respectively). Expression of Th2-type cytokines is strongly associated with asthma; this is demonstrated by the fact that human asthma has been linked to a region of chromosome 5q containing the IL4, IL5, and IL13 genes (4Marsh D.G. Neely J.D. Breazeale D.R. Ghosh B. Freidhoff L.R. Ehrlich-Kautzky E. Schou C. Krishnaswamy G. Beaty T.H. Science. 1994; 264: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Although IL-4 and IL-5 have been implicated in asthma, IL-13 is now thought to be especially critical. In animal models of allergic asthma, blockade of IL-13 markedly inhibited allergen-induced airway hyperresponsivness, mucus production, and eosinophilia. Furthermore, IL-13 delivery to the airways was able to cause all of these effects. IL-13 is thus both necessary and sufficient for experimental models of asthma (5Grunig G. Warnock M. Wakil A.E.

Science. 1998; 282: 2258-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar).In Th2 cells, production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 is controlled by cooperation between two families of transcription factors, the GATA and NFAT families (3Solymar D.C. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Zheng W. Flavell R.A.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). The calcium-regulated transcription factor NFAT consists of four family members, three of which (NFAT1 (p, c2), NFAT2 (c, c1), NFAT4 (x, c3)) are expressed in both cell types (3Solymar D.C. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the genes encoding individual NFAT family members suggests that there are cell type- and gene-specific differences in their ability to regulate gene transcription in activated cells (11Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 12Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The GATA family of transcription factors is also essential for IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by Th2 cells, as shown by increased and decreased expression of these cytokines in transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type GATA3 (7Zheng W. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar) and a dominant-negative version of GATA3 (8Zhang D.H. Yang L. Cohn L. Parkyn L. Homer R. Ray P. Ray A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) respectively. In addition to playing a role in Th2 cytokine expression, GATA3 is important for T cell lineage development and for embryonic brain development (13Pai S.Y. Truitt M.L. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Immunity. 2003; 19: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Pandolfi P.P. Roth M.E. Karis A. Leonard M.W. Dzierzak E. Grosveld F.G. Engel J.D. Lindenbaum M.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, GATA3 is not expressed by mast cells, leading to the possibility that other GATA family members regulate IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 cytokine expression by mast cells. GATA1 expression is restricted to hematopoietic lineage cells and plays an important role in erythroid lineage development (2Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. Immunol.

Disruption of murine GATA2 results in embryonic lethality characterized by a major loss of blood cells and reduction in hematopoietic precursors. In the mast cell lineage, GATA2 appears to be essential for mast cell differentiation, since GATA2–/–yolk sack progenitors generate only macrophages, while GATA1 appears to regulate the mature phenotype of tissue mast cells (22Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 23Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).Despite the fact that targeted gene disruption of individual NFAT members leads to disparate phenotypes, specific comparison of constitutively active versions of NFAT1 and NFAT2 in Th2 cells suggests that these two family members have equivalent roles in expression of IL4 and possibly other cytokine genes (25Porter C.M. Clipstone N.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4936-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Monticelli S. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2971-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus the intrinsic ability of NFAT transcription factors to activate gene expression could be similar for certain target genes, and in these cases the different phenotypes of the gene-disrupted mice could be due to differences in the expression pattern of the different NFAT proteins. However, other target genes could show real differences in their ability to be activated by different NFAT members, for instance because co-activator proteins discriminated between the individual members. The existence of combinatorial synergy between NFAT and GATA proteins would increase this possibility, because co-activators that bridged these proteins would need to interact effectively with both protein partners in cells.In this study, we analyze the molecular basis of IL13 gene transcription in mast cells. We show that NFAT1 plays a predominant role in this process, whereas NFAT2 makes only a minor contribution, despite the fact that it is expressed and properly regulated in mast cells. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays performed in mast cells, NFAT1 but not NFAT2, binds the IL13 promoter, and only NFAT1 effectively synergizes with GATA transcription factors to activate transcription from the IL13 promoter. However, both NFAT1 and NFAT2 can physically interact with GATA proteins in co-immunoprecipitation assays. We discuss the possibility that cell type-specific co-activators might stabilize specific NFAT-GATA combinations bound to DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged NFAT1 and NFAT2, and retroviral expression plasmids encoding constitutively active (CA)-NFAT1 and CA-NFAT2, have been described (26Monticelli S.

Briefly, ES cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on fibroblast-feeder cells in the presence of 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Invitrogen). Prior to differentiation, ES cells were passaged two times on gelatinized plates, and medium was changed to Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium.

Embryoid bodies were then disrupted in trypsin, and single cell suspensions were cultured in mast cell media (RPMI with 50% WEHI-3 conditioned supernatant, and c-Kit ligand (20 ng/ml)). For both BMMC and ESMC, differentiation was assessed by metachromatic staining of cytoplasmic basophilic granules with toluidine blue and by surface staining of membrane FcϵRI and c-Kit (3Solymar D.C.

The total DNA amount was adjusted to 10–20 μg in each transfection. Cells were transfected at room temperature by electroporation in serum-free medium with pulses of 270 V, 960 microfarads (Jurkat) and 450 V, 500 microfarads (CFTL15). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 2 μm ionomycin and 20 nm PMA. Eight hours after stimulation, cells were harvested, and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and Renilla activity using an automated luminometer (Berthold) and a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manifacturer's instructions. Luciferase data were normalized for renilla readings (without TK) and in some experiments for the total protein content in the lysate.RESULTSNFAT1 Participates in IL13 Gene Transcription in Mast Cells while NFAT2 Does Not—We examined the features of IL13 gene transcription by wild-type, NFAT1- and NFAT2-deficient mast cells. Mast cells lacking NFAT1 were obtained by culturing bone marrow cells from NFAT1-deficient mice in the presence of IL-3 as described previously (3Solymar D.C. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This method could not be used to obtain NFAT2-deficient BMMC because NFAT2–/–mice display very early embryonic lethality (39Ranger A.M. Grusby M.J. Hodge M.R. Gravallese E.M. de la Brousse F.C.

Instead we obtained ESMC by culturing wild-type and NFAT2–/–ES cells with IL-3 and c-Kit ligand. We first showed that BMMC and ESMC expressed similar levels of NFAT1 and NFAT2 and that their levels of NFAT2 were elevated compared with Th2 cells (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed that BMMC and ESMC show very similar levels and kinetics of cytokine gene transcription in response to PMA/ionomycin stimulation or IgE cross-linking of the FcϵRI receptor (data not shown). As demonstrated previously (3Solymar D.C. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), NFAT1–/–BMMC are strongly impaired in their ability to transcribe the IL13 gene: indeed, the low levels of IL13 transcripts produced by NFAT1–/–BMMC were comparable with those produced by wild-type BMMC in the presence of CsA (Fig. 1B). In contrast, NFAT2–/–ESMC produced completely normal levels of IL13 transcripts with kinetics identical to those of wild-type ESMC (Figs. 1, C–E).This result suggested that there was a fundamental difference in the ability of NFAT1 and NFAT2 to regulate IL13 gene expression in mast cells. Loss of NFAT1 was associated with a striking drop in IL13 mRNA induction, while loss of NFAT2 had no discernible effect (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to Th2 cells where both NFAT1 and NFAT2 contribute to expression of several cytokine genes (26Monticelli S. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2971-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 41Peng S.L. Gerth A.J. Ranger A.M. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 2001; 14: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).To evaluate independently whether NFAT1 and NFAT2 differed in their ability to support IL13 gene transcription, we introduced CA versions of NFAT1 and NFAT2 into bone marrow-derived mast cells. CA-NFAT1 and CA-NFAT2 bear multiple Ser > Ala substitutions in phosphorylated serine residues of the regulatory domain (26Monticelli S. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2971-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P.B. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We showed previously that these proteins are equivalent in their ability to support transcription of the endogenous IL4 gene in Th2 cells (26Monticelli S. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2971-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 2, only CA-NFAT1 was capable of supporting IL13 expression in mast cells.Fig. 2CA-NFAT1, but not CA-NFAT2, induces IL-13 expression in BMMC. Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femur and tibias of a BALB/c mouse. After 1 day in culture, cells were retrovirally transduced with GFP-RV, HA-tagged CA-NFAT1-RV or HA-tagged CA-NFAT2-RV. Two independent experiments are shown, in which infection efficiency with the three different retroviruses ranged between 7.5 and 39%. After 1–2 weeks in culture, GFP+ cells were sorted and kept in culture for a subsequent 2 weeks in 50% WEHI-3 conditioned medium to allow mast cell differentiation. Note that in Experiment 1, expression of CA-NFAT1 is much higher than that of CA-NFAT2. In Experiment 2, CA-NFAT1 expression is lower than that of NFAT2 but expression levels are more closely approximated. A, GFP expression of the sorted populations after 4 weeks in culture. B, Western blot of 4-week-infected BMMC, using anti-HA, anti-NFAT1, or anti-NFAT2 antibodies. C, 4-week-infected BMMC were either left unstimulated or were induced with ionomycin for 24 h after 30-min pretreatment with CsA. IL-13 protein levels in culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Freshly isolated bone marrow cells were infected, in two independent experiments, with internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-GFP retroviruses encoding CA-NFAT1 and CA-NFAT2. The cells were then cultured with IL-3 and SCF to promote mast cell differentiation and sorted a week later for GFP-positive cells expressing the CA-NFAT proteins. After 1 month of culture under differentiating conditions, the cells showed the morphological features of mast cells (data not shown). Immunoblotting with an antibody to the HA epitope tag showed that expression levels of the CA-NFAT proteins paralleled the levels of GFP expression by FACS (Fig. 2, A and B). Experiment 1 shows high CA-NFAT1 but low CA-NFAT2 expression, while Experiment 2 shows low CA-NFAT1 and moderate CA-NFAT2 expression (Fig. 2A and top panel of Fig. 2B). However, in no case were the constitutively active proteins overexpressed relative to endogenous NFAT; immunoblotting with specific anti-NFAT1 and anti-NFAT2 antibodies (anti-67.1 and 7A6, respectively) showed no increase in band intensity at the expected positions of the CA-NFAT proteins (asterisks), indicating that the CA-NFATs constituted only a very minor fraction of total NFAT (Fig. 2B, bottom panels).To evaluate cytokine production driven by the CA-NFATs, the infected populations were stimulated in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor CsA. This strategy permits selective assessment of the transcriptional function of the CA-NFATs without interference from endogenous NFATs. Cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with ionomycin and CsA for 24 h, and culture supernatants were tested for IL-13 levels by ELISA (Fig. 2C). Under these conditions, cells expressing the high level of CA-NFAT1 produced IL-13 even under resting conditions (Fig. 2C, Experiment 1); stimulation with ionomycin and CsA resulted in increased IL-13 production, presumably because IL-13 expression is potentiated by parallel activation of other (calcineurin-independent) calcium signaling pathways. Note that for these experiments, we stimulated cells with ionomycin alone rather than with PMA/ionomycin; although this results in an overall lower level of IL-13 expression, it eliminates a substantial background of PMA-stimulated, NFAT-independent IL-13 expression (see Fig. 1B) that obscures the effect of the CA-NFATs. In Experiment 2, a low level of CA-NFAT1 was able to up-regulate IL-13 production in ionomycin/CsA-stimulated mast cells, while a higher level of CA-NFAT2 was not (Fig. 2C, Experiment 2). Consistent with the very low expression of introduced CA-NFAT1 relative to endogenous NFAT1 (Fig. 2B), the amount of IL-13 produced by CA-NFAT1 expressing cells is quite low in both experiments. Nevertheless, the level of IL-13 expression correlated very well with the level of CA-NFAT1 expression (compare Fig. 2B, top panel with Fig. 2C). Taken together, these experiments reinforce the hypothesis that NFAT1 can activate IL-13 production in mast cells but NFAT2 cannot.NFAT2 Is Correctly Regulated in Mast Cells—One potential reason for the apparent inability of NFAT2 to activate IL13 expression in mast cells could be that mast cells do not properly regulate NFAT2. To test this possibility, we examined the behavior of NFAT2 in wild-type mast cells by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3). Stimulated mast cells showed normal dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT2 (Fig. 3, A and B), as well as normal induction of the short inducible isoform of NFAT2 as previously observed in Th2 cells (Fig. 3C (42Zhou B.

https://openalex.org/W2041358307,"C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of signaling pathways that are induced in response to extracellular stimuli. JNK is primarily a stress-response pathway and can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors coupled to membrane receptors or through non-receptor pathways by stimuli such as heat shock, UV irradiation, protein synthesis inhibitors, and conditions that elevate the levels of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). The molecular initiators of MAPKs by non-receptor stimuli have not been described. Ischemia followed by reperfusion or hypoxia with reoxygenation represents a condition of high oxidative stress where JNK activation is associated with elevated ROI. We show here that the activation of JNK by this condition is initiated in the mitochondria and requires coupled electron transport, ROI generation, and calcium flux. These signals cause the selective, sequential activation of the calcium-dependent, proline-rich kinase Pyk2 and the small GTP binding factors Rac-1 and Cdc42. Interruption of these interactions with inactivated dominant negative mutant proteins, blocking calcium flux, or inhibiting electron transport through mitochondrial complexes II, III, or IV prevents JNK activation and results in a proapoptotic phenotype that is characteristic of JNK inhibition in this model of ischemia-reperfusion. The signaling pathway is unique for the reoxygenation stimulus and provides a framework for other non-receptor-mediated pathways of MAPK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2007995664,"The GPR4 subfamily consists of four G protein-coupled receptors that share significant sequence homology. In addition to GPR4, this subfamily includes OGR1, TDAG8 and G2A. G2A has previously been shown to be a potent transforming oncogene for murine 3T3 cells. Here we show that GPR4 also malignantly transforms NIH3T3 cells and that TDAG8 malignantly transforms the normal mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG. Overexpression of GPR4 or TDAG8 in HEK293 cells led to transcriptional activation from SRE- and CRE-driven promoters, independent of exogenously added ligand. TDAG8 and GPR4 are also overexpressed in a range of human cancer tissues. Our results suggest that GPR4 and TDAG8 overexpression in human tumors plays a role in driving or maintaining tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2167499479,"Metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) activates the transcription of metallothionein genes and other target genes in response to heavy metal load and other stresses such as hypoxia and oxidative stress. It also has an essential function during embryogenesis: targeted disruption of Mtf1 in the mouse results in lethal liver degeneration on day 14 of gestation. Here we studied Mtf1 knockout mice at embryonic and adult stages, the latter by means of conditional knockout. Hepatocytes from Mtf1 null mutant and wild-type embryos were taken into culture on day 12.5 of gestation. Both initially appeared normal, but mutant cells were lost within a few days. Furthermore, Mtf1 null hepatocytes were poorly, if at all, rescued by cocultivation with wild-type rat embryo hepatocytes, indicating a cell-autonomous defect. When the Mtf1 gene was excised by Cre recombinase after birth in liver and bone marrow and to a lesser extent in other organs, mice were viable under non-stress conditions but highly susceptible to cadmium toxicity, in support of a role of MTF-1 in coping with heavy metal stress. An additional MTF-1 function was revealed upon analysis of the hematopoietic system in conditional knockout mice where leukocytes, especially lymphocytes, were found to be severely underrepresented. Together, these findings point to a critical role of MTF-1 in embryonic liver formation, heavy metal toxicity, and hematopoiesis."

This work identifies Ubc9 and PIAS1 as binding partners of Rta in a yeast two-hybrid screen. These bindings are verified by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy. The interactions appear to cause Rta sumoylation, because not only can Rta be sumoylated in vitro but also sumoylated Rta can be detected in P3HR1 cells following lytic induction and in 293T cells after transfecting plasmids that express Rta and SUMO-1. Moreover, PIAS1 stimulates conjugation of SUMO-1 to Rta, thus acting as an E3 ligase. Furthermore, transfecting plasmids that express Ubc9, PIAS1, and SUMO-1 increases the capacity of Rta to transactivate the promoter that includes an Rta response element, indicating that the modification by SUMO-1 increases the transactivation activity of Rta. This study reveals that Rta is sumoylated at the Lys-19, Lys-213, and Lys-517 residues and that SUMO-1 conjugation at the Lys-19 residue is crucial for enhancing the transactivation activity of Rta.

These SUMO molecules conjugate to their target proteins through an isopeptide bond formed between the C-terminal glycine residue of SUMO and a lysine residue in the substrate, frequently found at a conserved ψKXE motif; where ψ represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue, including Leu, Ile, Val, or Phe (8Rodriguez M.S.

As is generally known, in a SUMO conjugation reaction, SUMO hydrolase first removes the four C-terminal amino acids of SUMO, exposing a glycine residue to facilitate SUMO conjugation. The SUMO molecule is then adenylated and covalently linked to a SUMO-activating E1 enzyme (10Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Subsequently, SUMO is transferred to the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme, Ubc9, which catalyzes the transfer of SUMO to its target proteins (12Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T.

Three proteins, including PIAS, RanBP2, and Pc2, are currently known to participate in the process of sumoylation (16Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol.

Sumoylation may influence protein functions in many ways. An important function of SUMO is to stabilize its target proteins by acting as an antagonist to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). For instance, SUMO modification blocks ubiquitination and destruction of IκB by the SCF(β-TrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), thus stabilizing the ability of IκB to inhibit NF-κB. SUMO modification is also known to influence protein localization. For example, SUMO-1 modification not only targets promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) to discrete subnuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies (22Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) but also is necessary for RanGAP1 binding to a nuclear pore complex (23Lee G.W. Melchior F. Matunis M.J. Mahajan R. Tian Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6503-6507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which contains Ubc9 and RanBP2. Furthermore, both Ubc9 and RanBP2 are crucial for sumoylation, because Pichler et al. (17Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (24Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) demonstrated that proteins are sumoylated on the cytoplasm side of nuclear membrane by Ubc9, and the sumoylated proteins are then transported into the nucleus by RanBP2 after sumoylation (17Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Additionally, SUMO modification of Sp100 and Daxx targets these transcription factors into the PML nuclear bodies (25Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 27Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As is generally known, the interphase nucleus is organized into distinct domains, including nuclear matrix and the chromatin structures of the chromosomes. PML nuclear bodies are essential domains of nuclear matrix (28Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly accounting for why the activity of Sp100 and Daxx is activated after sumoylation. SUMO modification also regulates the DNA-binding activities of the heat shock transcription factors HSF1 and HSF2 (29Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol.

On the other hand, sumoylation may actually inhibit transactivation activity of some transcription factors (31Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 32Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). For example, SUMO modification inactivates the functions of Sp3 and changes its subnuclear localization (33Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I. Gill G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 34Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Moreover, sumoylation influences the functions of many viral proteins. For instance, SUMO conjugation of papillomavirus E1 increases its ability to enhance viral DNA replication (35Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); SUMO-1 modification also increases the transactivation activity of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE2 (36Ahn J.H.

Although CMV IE1/IE72 is modified by SUMO-1, exactly how such modification affects the functions of IE1/IE72 remains unknown (37Spengler M.L. Kurapatwinski K. Black A.R. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is normally maintained under latent conditions in B lymphocytes. However, EBV must enter a lytic phase to proliferate. During the immediate-early stage of the lytic cycle, the virus expresses two immediate-early proteins, i.e. Rta and Zta, to activate the viral early genes and the lytic cascade (38Chang L.K. Liu S.T.

Virol. 2001; 75: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Zta is modified by SUMO-1. Such modification may compete with PML for limited amounts of SUMO-1 in the nucleus, thus preventing the formation of PML nuclear bodies and resulting in a dispersion of PML nuclear bodies in the nucleus (43Adamson A.L. Kenney S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, the EBNA-3C protein of EBV is sumoylated, which appears to be crucial for activating the BNLF1 promoter by EBNA-3C (44Lin J. Johannsen E. Robertson E. Kieff E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 45Rosendorff A. Illanes D. David G. Lin J. Kieff E. Johannsen E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This investigation demonstrates that Rta is sumoylated by SUMO-1 and, in doing so, enhances the transactivation activity of Rta. Cell Lines and EBV Lytic Induction—P3HR1, Jurkat, and EBV-negative Akata cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To activate the EBV lytic cycle, P3HR1 cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and sodium butyrate or trichostatin A (TSA) according to a method described elsewhere (38Chang L.K.

Plasmids—Plasmid pCMV-R contains BRLF1 transcribed from the CMV immediate-early promoter (39Chang P.J. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5128-5136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCMV-3 is identical to pCMV-R except without BRLF1. Plasmids pcDNA-Ubc9 and pGEX-Ubc9, which express HA-tagged Ubc9 and GST-Ubc9, respectively, were provided by Van G. Wilson (35Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCR-SUMO-1, which encodes FLAG-tagged SUMO-1, was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified SUMO-1 DNA fragment into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pGEX-4T1, which expresses GST, was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid pET-SUMO-1, which expresses His-tagged SUMO-1 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), was constructed by inserting a SUMO-1 DNA fragment into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). Plasmids pCMV-PIAS1 and pGEX-PIAS1 were provided by Stefan Müller (48Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA (5′-CCCAAGCTTCGGCTGACATGAATTCCTGGTCTTTTATCATGTCCCTCTATCATGGCGCAGACCCCGGGGGA), which contains an Rta response element (RRE) from the BMLF1 promoter and a TATA sequence, was synthesized and inserted into the HindIII and SmaI sites, upstream of a firefly luciferase gene (luc), in pGL2-Basic (Promega) to generate pRRE. To construct a plasmid (pET-Rta) expressing Rta in E. coli BL21(DE3), BRLF1 was amplified by PCR, using primers GST-5R (5′-CCGGAATTCCGGAGGCCTAAAAAGGATGGC) and GST-3R. The fragment was then inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites in pET-32a(+) (Novagen). Plasmid pGEX-SUMO-1 (23Lee G.W. Melchior F. Matunis M.J. Mahajan R. Tian Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6503-6507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), obtained from Frauke Melchior, encodes a GST-SUMO-1 fusion protein that lacks the four C-terminal amino acids of SUMO-1. A DNA fragment encoding Ubc9 was amplified by PCR, using U1 (5′-CGGGATCCACATGTCGGGGATCGCCCTCAGC) and U2 (5′-ACGCGTCGACTTATGAGGGCGCAAACTTCTTGGC) as primers and a human testis cDNA library as template. The fragment was digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the BamHI-SalI sites in pACT2 to generate pACT-Ubc9. Plasmid pACT-PIAS1 was isolated from a human testis cDNA library constructed in pACT2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A plasmid that expresses full-length Rta tagged with an HA sequence at the N terminus (HA-Rta) was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified BRLF1 fragment into pcDNA3-HA at the EcoRI and SalI sites. Plasmids that expressed deleted HA-Rta were constructed in the same way. These Rta deletion mutants include RN122, RN190, and RN347, as well as RC351, which lacked the regions from amino acids 123 to 605, 191 to 605, and 348 to 605, and 1 to 254, respectively. Meanwhile, mutant R255/415 included the region between amino acids 255 and 415 of Rta. Lysine residues at amino acid positions 19, 213, and 517 on HA-Rta were mutagenized following a PCR mutagenesis method of Ho (49Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To construct a bait plasmid for yeast two-hybrid screening, BRLF1 was amplified by PCR, using R1 (5′-CATGCCATGGCGATGAGGCCTAAAAAGGATGGC) and R2 (5′-CATGCCATGGCTAAAATAAGCTGGTGTCAAAA) as primers and pCMV-R as template. The fragment was digested with NcoI and inserted into the NcoI site of pAS2-1 (Clontech). The orientation of the insert was subsequently verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was then digested with BamHI to remove the 3′ region of BRLF1 to generate pR476, which encodes the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused with the N-terminal 476 amino acids of Rta. A human testis cDNA library constructed in pACT2 (Clontech) was screened by cotransforming the bait (pR476) and the library plasmids into yeast strain, YRG-2 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Positive clones were selected based on their ability to grow on Trp, Leu, and His dropout media supplemented with 3-aminotriazole and their blue colony color in β-galactosidase filter assay. These phenotypes were further confirmed in yeast strain Y190. β-Galactosidase activity was determined in Z buffer (150 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4) containing 4 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Reactions were performed at 30 °C and stopped by adding 250 mm sodium carbonate. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring absorbance at 420 nm with a spectrophotometer (Model U2000, Hitachi, Japan). Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—To purify GST-Ubc9, 1 liter of E. coli BL21(DE3) (pGEX-Ubc9) was cultured to mid-log phase in 1 liter of LB medium. isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested 4 h after the treatment, suspended in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm leupeptin), and homogenized by sonication for 1 min. Cell lysate was then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a column containing 1 ml of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with ten column volumes of buffer A. GST-Ubc9 was finally eluted from the column by adding buffer A containing 20 mm glutathione. The eluted GST-Ubc9 was dialyzed for 16 h against a dialysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Dialyzed GST-Ubc9 was concentrated to 8 mg/ml with Centricon-100 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at -80 °C until use. GST, GST-PIAS1, and GST-SUMO-1 were purified by the same method. His-tagged SUMO-1 and His-tagged Rta expressed by E. coli BL21(DE3)(pET-SUMO-1) and E. coli BL21(DE3)(pET-Rta), respectively, were purified by a similar method, except that the protein was purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, eluted with 200 mm imidazole, and concentrated to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. GST-pull-down Assay—GST, GST-Ubc9, GST-SUMO-1, or GSTPIAS1, at a concentration of 40 ng/ml in 500 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, was added to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The mixture was incubated under shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with NETN buffer and added to the lysate (300 μl) prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3)(pET-Rta), P3HR1 cells, or 293T cells transfected with a plasmid that expresses Rta or its deletion derivatives. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. The beads were subsequently washed with NETN buffer. An equal volume of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the mixture, and proteins were extracted from the beads by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were finally separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel were electrotransferred to a Hybond C membrane (Amersham Biosciences) at 90 V for 1 h and probed with the appropriate antibodies. SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used to visualize the proteins on the membrane. Immunoprecipitation—P3HR1 cells (1 × 107) transfected with pCMV-R, pcDNA-Ubc9, pCMV-PIAS1, or pCR-SUMO-1 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The lysate was prepared by adding 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) to the cells. Then the lysate was centrifuged with a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was added with anti-Rta (1:500 dilution) (Argene, Varilhes, France) or anti-HA (1:500 dilution) (Roche Applied Science) antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein-A/G-agarose beads (30 μl) (Oncogene, Boston, MA) were added to the lysate, and the mixture was incubated under shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were finally collected by centrifugation and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Proteins binding to the beads were eluted by adding 20 μl of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, Rta was immunoprecipitated from the lysate prepared from 6 × 107 P3HR1 cells transfected with 120 μg of pCMV-R. Immunoprecipitation was performed in four tubes. After immunoprecipitation, proteins were pooled and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To detect sumoylated Rta after transfection, cells (1 × 107) were lysed according to a method described elsewhere (51Hofmann H. Floss S. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2510-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To examine Rta sumoylation in cell lysate after lytic induction, 1 × 107 of P3HR1 cells were treated with 100 nm TSA for 24 h before immunoprecipitation. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Rta—An 88-kDa protein immunoprecipitated by anti-Rta antibody was excised from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis by Accelerating Biodigital Era Inc. (Taipei, Taiwan). In Vitro SUMO Conjugation—Bacterially expressed Rta, SUMO-1 lacking the four C-terminal amino acids, GST-PIAS1, and SUMO-activating E1 enzyme (LAE Biotechnology Co., Taipei, Taiwan) were used to examine Rta sumoylation in vitro. Each SUMO conjugation reaction (16 μl) contained 1 μg of purified Rta, 500 ng each of GST-Ubc9 and SUMO-1, 15 ng of SUMO-activating E1 enzyme, and 4 μl of a buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ATP, 4 mm DTT, and 800 μm NEM. Meanwhile, one-tenth of the amount of E1 and E2 was used to study the enhancement of Rta sumoylation by PIAS1. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, 16 μl of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the reaction mixtures, which were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins in the mixtures were immediately separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rta was then detected by immunoblotting with anti-Rta antibody. Transient Transfection Assay—Plasmids were purified from E. coli by CsCl-gradient centrifugation (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids (10 μg) were transfected into EBV-negative Akata and Jurkat cells by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser electroporator (39Chang P.J. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5128-5136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A luciferase assay was performed, using a luminometer (model LB593, Berthod, Bad Wildbad, Germany), according to a method described elsewhere (39Chang P.J. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5128-5136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each transfection experiment was performed three times, and each sample in the experiment was prepared in duplicate. Immunofluorescence Analysis—P3HR1 cells were treated with 30 ng/ml TPA and 3 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h to induce the expression of Rta. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, plated on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with anti-Rta monoclonal antibody, goat anti-Ubc9 polyclonal antibody, goat anti-PIAS1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), or rabbit anti-SUMO-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and then treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG polyclonal antibody (KPL, Inc.), or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (KPL Inc.). Finally, cells were washed with PBS, mounted in CITIFLOUR (Agar Inc., Essex, England), and examined with a Model LSM510 Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Identification of Ubc9 and PIAS1 as Rta-binding Proteins—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed in strain YRG2, with a bait plasmid, pR476, which expresses a protein (RN476) that contains the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused with the N-terminal 476 amino acids of Rta. RN476 lacks an intact transactivation domain, preventing it from activating the reporter genes and changing the phenotypes of yeast strain YRG2. Strain YRG2(pR476) was subsequently transformed with a human testes cDNA library constructed in pACT2 to screen the proteins that interact with Rta. This study screened ∼6 × 105 transformants and identified 24 plasmids that encode seven cellular proteins. Sequencing analysis revealed that, among the 24 clones, cDNA that encodes Ubc9 and PIAS1 was isolated seven times and twice, respectively. β-Galactosidase assay revealed that yeast strain Y190(pR476) transformed with a yeast two-hybrid cloning vector, pACT2, produced 25 units of β-galactosidase activity. However, this value increased to 1190 or 810 units when the strain was transformed with pACT-Ubc9 or pACT-PIAS1, respectively, indicating that RN476 interacts with Ubc9, and PIAS1. Binding of Rta to Ubc9, PIAS1, and SUMO-1 in Vitro—GST fusion pull-down assays were performed with bacterially expressed GST-Ubc9 and GST-PIAS1, respectively, to investigate whether Rta interacts with Ubc9 and PIAS1 in a context other than in yeast. Furthermore, because interaction between Rta and Ubc9 or PIAS1 in yeasts implies that Rta is conjugated by SUMO-1, this study also investigated whether Rta interacted with SUMO-1. GST or GST-Ubc9 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was added to the lysate prepared from P3HR1 cells transfected with pCMV-R (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). After extensive washing, proteins bound to the beads were precipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rta antibody. Results indicated that Rta in the lysate (Fig. 1, lane 1) was retained by GST-Ubc9-glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1, lane 3) but was not retained by GST-glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1, lane 2). A similar study also revealed that His-tagged Rta expressed by E. coli (Fig. 1, lane 8) was retained by GST-Ubc9-(Fig. 1, lane 10) but not by GST-glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1, lane 9), confirming the interaction between Rta and Ubc9. Meanwhile, using GST-PIAS1 and GST-SUMO-1 also produced similar results; i.e. Rta in P3HR1 lysate or in E. coli lysate was retained by GST-PIAS1-(Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 11) and GST-SUMO-1-glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 12) but not retained by GST-glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1, lanes 4, 6, and 9), indicating that Rta interacts with PIAS1 and SUMO-1. Determination of the Domains in Rta That Interact with Ubc9 and PIAS1—Plasmids that express deleted Rta (Fig. 2A) were transfected into 293T cells. GST-Ubc9- or GST-PIAS1-glutatione-Sepharose"
https://openalex.org/W2126277558,"The cytotoxic death ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a tumor-specific agent under development as a novel anticancer therapeutic agent. However, some reports have demonstrated toxicity of certain TRAIL preparations toward human hepatocytes and keratinocytes through a caspase-dependent mechanism that involves activation of the extrinsic death pathway and Type II signaling through the mitochondria. We have isolated and purified both His-tagged protein and three versions of native recombinant human TRAIL protein from Escherichia coli. We found that 5 mm dithiothreitol in the purification process enhanced oligomerization of TRAIL and resulted in the formation of hyper-oligomerized TRAILs, including hexamers and nonomers with an extremely high potency in apoptosis induction. Although death-inducing signaling complex formation was much more efficient in cells treated with hyper-oligomerized TRAILs, this did not convert TRAIL-sensitive Type II HCT116 colon tumor cells to a Type I death pattern as judged by their continued sensitivity to a caspase 9 inhibitor. Moreover, TRAIL-resistant Type II Bax-null colon carcinoma cells were not converted to a TRAIL-sensitive Type I state by hyper-oligomerized TRAIL. Primary human esophageal epithelial 2 cells were found to be sensitive to all TRAIL preparations used, including trimer TRAIL. TRAIL-induced death in esophageal epithelial 2 cells was prevented by caspase 9 inhibition for up to 4 h after TRAIL exposure.

Both DR4 and DR5 are pro-apoptotic receptors, which contain a cytoplasmic death domain and mediate apoptosis on binding to TRAIL. By contrast, TRID and TRUNDD do not contain a cytoplasmic death domain and block the function of TRAIL by competing with TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 for binding of TRAIL (8Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A.

The apoptotic process can be induced by two different pathways (9Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway, also called the mitochondrial pathway, is induced by intracellular signals such as oncogene activation, DNA-damaging agents, and growth factor deprivation. Mitochondrial release of cyto-chrome c into the cytosol in response to death signals allows assembly of a multiprotein caspase activating complex called the apoptosome (10Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X.

Even in tumor cell lines that show resistance to TRAIL, combined treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs or ionizing radiation has revealed induction of tumor cell death (18Griffith T.S. Fialkov J.M.

However, some reports have demonstrated a toxicity of certain TRAIL preparations against primary human hepatocytes through a caspase-dependent mechanism that involves activation of the extrinsic death pathway (25Jo M. Kim T.H. Seol D.W. Esplen J.E. Dorko K. Billiar T.R. Strom S.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 26Nagata S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 502-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further studies suggested that this toxicity could be avoided by use of native TRAIL but not tagged TRAIL (27Lawrence D. Shahrokh Z. Marsters S. Achilles K. Shih D. Mounho B. Hillan K. Totpal K. DeForge L. Schow P. Hooley J. Sherwood S. Pai R. Leung S. Khan L. Gliniak B. Bussiere J. Smith C.A. Strom S.S. Kelley S. Fox J.A. Thomas D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated His-tagged and native TRAIL using several biochemical purification methods. In the case of native TRAIL produced in the presence of dithiothreitol, we observed and purified hyper-oligomerized forms that were found to be highly potent in death induction assays. We investigated the toxicity of the various recombinant TRAIL preparations toward normal human esophageal epithelial cells and found evidence of significant toxicity. We further developed a strategy for using caspase 9 blockade to inhibit toxicity and now report that administration of a caspase 9 inhibitor is effective for a period of up to 4 h following TRAIL exposure. Our studies have implications for the use of TRAIL as an anticancer agent during its utilization in clinical trials. Expression Plasmids for Tagged and Untagged Soluble Human TRAIL—The extracellular portion (aa 95∼281) of the human TRAIL cDNA was amplified and cloned into pQE80L (Qiagen) after digestion with BamHI and HindIII to generate the His6-tagged TRAIL expression plasmid (pQE-hTR). The primer sequences used were 5′-AAGGCGGATCCACCTCTGAGGAAACCATTTC-3′ (hTR-S) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTAGCCAACTAAAAAGGCCCCGA-3′ (hTR-AS). To make a non-tagged native human TRAIL expression plasmid, the His6 tag and amino acids 95∼113 were removed from pQE-hTR by a two-step PCR-mediated ligation. The first PCR step was performed to amplify the vector and TRAIL sequences using primers for the vector sequence 5′-CGTATCACGAGGCCCTTTCGTC-3′ (Head-S) and 5′-TTTCTCTCACCATAGTTAATTTCTCCTCTTTAA (Head-AS)-3′ and for TRAIL aa 114∼281, 5′-GAAATTAACTATGGTGAGAGAAAGAGGTCCTCA-3′ (TR114) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTAGCCAACTAAAAAGGCCCCGA-3′ (hTR-AS), respectively. Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was used to prevent 3′-nucleotide addition. The amplified products from the first step were mixed and reamplified with primers Head-S and hTR-AS. The amplified product was cloned into pQE80L after digestion with EcoRI and HindIII to generate pQE-nTR. Purification of Soluble Recombinant Human TRAIL—Recombinant TRAILs were expressed in DH10B bacteria as the expression host. The overnight seed culture was diluted 100-fold into 1.0 liter of LB broth and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added to induce recombinant protein expression, and bacterial cells were incubated overnight at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 5 mm dithiothreitol). Recombinant TRAILs were isolated from the soluble fraction using Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) after washing with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Isolated proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The purity of the recombinant TRAIL proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue gel staining. Separation of Oligomerized Forms of Soluble Recombinant Human TRAIL—The recombinant human TRAIL purified from the Ni-NTA-agarose column application was subjected to gel filtration chromatography to isolate oligomerized forms of TRAIL. The HiLoad 60/120 Superdex 200 prep grade column was used in the AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Lines and Culture—Human primary esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2) were described previously (28Andl C.D. Mizushima T. Nakagawa H. Oyama K. Harada H. Chruma K. Herlyn M. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1824-1830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). EPC2 cells were cultured in keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen) containing bovine pituitary extract (40 μg/ml) and epidermal growth factor (1 ng/ml). Human foreskin fibroblasts were described previously (29Meier F. Nesbit M. Hsu M.Y. Martin B. Van Belle P. Elder D.E. Schaumburg-Lever G. Garbe C. Walz T.M. Donatien P. Crombleholme T.M. Herlyn M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The recombinant human soluble DR5 was produced using the Pichia pastoris system as we described previously (30Song K. Chen Y. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The purified soluble DR5 contains 1-2 ng of lipopolysaccharide/mg of protein as determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. This is comparable with human serum albumin purchased from Sigma, which contains 1-4 ng of lipopolysaccharide/mg of protein. Assessment of TRAIL-mediated Apoptosis—For detecting apoptosis mediated by TRAIL, the active caspase 3 assay was performed using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) as described previously (31Kim K. Takimoto R. Dicker D.T. Chen Y. Gazitt Y. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 241-247PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into a 6-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were treated with TRAIL. After treatment, the cells were harvested, fixed, and incubated with 0.125 μg/μl rabbit anti-active caspase 3 antibody (clone C92-605, Pharmingen) for 20 min. After washing, the cells were probed with 0.125 μg/μl phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (CALTAG Laboratories) for 20 min. The intensity of phycoerythrin was analyzed by flow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter Epics Elite analyzer. For the analysis of the sub-G1 fraction, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and RNase A for 30 min at room temperature, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. DISC Immunoprecipitation—H460 cells (4 × 107) were harvested and suspended in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 100 ng/ml trimer or hexamer TRAIL. After incubation with TRAIL preparations for 5, 10, or 20 min, cells were collected and lysed in 1 ml of DISC immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates (400 μl) were incubated overnight with 5 μl of rabbit anti-FADD antibody (Cell Signaling) at 4 °C. Complexes were precipitated by protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) and suspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer after three washes with DISC immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Generation of Recombinant TRAILs and Their Toxicity against Human Cancer Cell Lines—hTR, which has an N-terminal histidine tag, was purified from the DH10B Escherichia coli strain after overnight incubation in 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for protein induction. We used three different expression and purification schemes for the generation of native TRAILs (Table I). All TRAILs were purified using an Ni-NTA-agarose column application, and TRAIL protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1A). Although the native TRAIL preparations (nTRs) did not contain a His6 tag in their sequence, they still bound to the Ni-NTA-agarose column, but the interaction was relatively weak, allowing separation from the beads at 40 mm imidazole, whereas the His-tagged hTR required 250 mm imidazole to be released (data not shown).Table IConditions for generation of recombinant TRAILsTagAmino acids residuesGrowth mediumPurification bufferhTRHis695-281, 23 kDaLBPhosphate buffer with 10 mm BMEaBME, β-mercaptoethanol.nTR1—114-281, 19 kDaLBPhosphate buffer with 10 mm BMEaBME, β-mercaptoethanol.nTR2—114-281, 19 kDaLBPhosphate buffer with 5 mm DTTbDTT, dithiothreitol.nTR3—114-281, 19 kDaLB with 100 μm ZnSO4Phosphate buffer with 5 mm DTTbDTT, dithiothreitol.a BME, β-mercaptoethanol.b DTT, dithiothreitol. Open table in a new tab The death-inducing activity of each TRAIL was tested in H460, a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, which is sensitive to TRAIL. All the purified recombinant TRAIL proteins could induce apoptosis in H460 cells (Fig. 1B). The hTR and nTR1 proteins induced less than 15% cell death at 10 ng/ml. The hTR protein induced more than 40% cell death at 100 ng/ml, whereas nTR1 was only slightly less toxic than hTR, resulting in 30% cell death at 100 ng/ml. Incubation of TRAIL proteins in the presence of soluble DR5 protein resulted in a blockade of apoptosis, thereby confirming the specificity of hTR and nTR1 for the TRAIL-mediated death receptor pathway. We also used a decoy receptor-expressing SW480 human colorectal carcinoma cell line to further confirm the specificity of hTR and nTR1 for TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1, C and D). We introduced a cytosolic death domain-deleted mouse KILLER/DR5 gene, which was fused with GFP into the SW480 cells (SWMK), and found that this artificial decoy receptor could protect from cell death induced by hTR or nTR1. The death-inducing activity of hTR was comparable with that of commercially available preparations (32Kim K. Fisher M.J. Xu S.Q. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar, 33Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37879-37886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the death-inducing activity of nTR2 and nTR3 appeared to be higher than that observed with nTR1, although all three were expressed from the same expression plasmid and host. Death induction following exposure to nTR2 and nTR3 resulted in a cell death rate greater than 40%, even at 10 ng/ml TRAILs, and death occurred rapidly by 1 h after treatment with higher doses of TRAIL. This hyperactivity of nTR2 and nTR3 was mediated specifically by the cell surface TRAIL death receptors because soluble DR5 protein almost completely blocked their cytotoxicity. These results suggested that nTR2 and nTR3 were somehow different from hTR and nTR1, although they were composed of a homogeneous TRAIL component. These results prompted us to examine the multimeric state of the TRAIL molecules. Hyper-oligomerization Correlates with High Cytotoxicity of nTR2 and nTR3—Gel filtration chromatography revealed that, depending on the method of purification, TRAIL molecules were heterogeneous in their oligomeric state (Fig. 2). In the case of hTR, one peak corresponding to the trimer was observed, whereas nTR1 appeared to be a mixture of monomer, dimer, and trimer molecules. The existence of an N-terminal His tag appeared to facilitate the trimerization of TRAIL molecules. Surprisingly, nTR2 and nTR3, which were purified in a 5 mm DTT-containing buffer, appeared to consist of timer, hexamer, and a small amount of nonomer. Each peak corresponding to a trimer, hexamer, or nonomer was composed of TRAIL molecules as verified by reducing SDS-PAGE. There was no apparent difference in the molecular composition of nTR2 versus nTR3, which suggested that the addition of zinc ions in the culture medium did not influence the oligomerization state of TRAIL molecules. However, there was a highly significant difference in the molecular conformation in nTR1 versus nTR2, although the same procedure was used in the overexpression and purification of the TRAIL molecules, except that the reducing agent was changed from 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol to 5 mm DTT. The use of DTT during purification greatly enhanced the oligomerization of native TRAIL molecules, which resulted in the formation of hexamers and nonomers. DTT also led to the disappearance of monomers and dimers observed with nTR1. We next investigated the apoptosis-inducing capacity of various TRAIL preparations and found that hexamers and nonomers were the highly cytotoxic component of nTR2 and nTR3. Hexamer and nonomer TRAIL proteins could kill the majority of H460 cells within 1 h of treatment at 100 ng/ml, and no cells survived after 4 h of treatment. In contrast, trimer TRAIL exposure resulted in more modest cell killing under the same conditions. Cell death induced by hyper-oligomerized TRAIL proteins was blocked by the soluble DR5 protein (Fig. 3A). We also checked the cleavage of caspases following TRAIL exposure. Trimer TRAIL treatment resulted in cleavage of procaspases 8, 9, and 3, but significant amounts of pro-caspases remained after 4 h of treatment. In the case of hexamer TRAIL, we observed cleavage of most of the cellular caspases 8 and 3 within 1 h, accompanied by complete disappearance of the pro-form of caspases 8 and 3 within 2 h. Significant amounts of pro-caspase 9 remained at 1 h but disappeared by 2 h on treatment with hexamer TRAIL. The extent of cleavage of the caspases was proportional to the potency of the TRAILs (Fig. 3B). Hyper-oligomerized TRAIL Induced More Efficient DISC Formation—Because hexamer TRAIL induced apoptosis more efficiently than trimer TRAIL, we wondered whether DISC formation was more efficient following binding of hexamer versus trimer TRAIL. We performed DISC immunoprecipitation using anti-FADD antibody to examine the recruitment and cleavage of DISC components following exposure of H460 cells to either trimer or hexamer TRAIL. Using 100 ng/ml trimer or hexamer TRAIL, we observed a time-dependent increase in the recruitment and cleavage of caspase 8 and c-FLIP to the DISC (Fig. 3C). We also observed increased recruitment of DR4 to the DISC. This increase was much greater in hexamer TRAIL-treated cells showing a significantly greater amount of recruitment and cleavage even at a 5-min exposure, which was comparable with the amount observed following 20 min of exposure to the trimer TRAIL. We also investigated whether the more efficient DISC formation and death induction by hexamer TRAIL might influence whether cell death occurred by a Type I versus a Type II mechanism. To determine whether cell death became less sensitive to inhibition by the caspase 9 inhibitor LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone (34Ozoren N. Kim K. Burns T.F. Dicker D.T. Moscioni A.D. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6259-6265PubMed Google Scholar), we treated either H460 (Type I) or HCT116 (Type II) cells with trimer or hexamer TRAIL and examined cell death induction at 6 h (Fig. 4A). H460 cells showed marginal death protection by the caspase 9 inhibitor (C9I) treatment, whereas complete death protection was conferred by the caspase 8 inhibitor (C8I), consistent with a Type I cell death protection pattern. There was no difference in the degree of observed death protection by the caspase inhibitors whether trimer or hexamer TRAIL was used to treat the H460 cells. In HCT116 cells, the C9I completely blocked cell death induced by either trimer or hexamer TRAIL. Despite more efficient formation of DISC by hexamer TRAIL, this did not alleviate the need to amplify the death signal through mitochondrial activation of caspase 9 as occurs in the Type II cell death pattern. We further confirmed these observations by examining the sub-G1 fraction and colony viability (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively) of Bax-null HCT116 cells, which are TRAIL-resistant because the Bax deficiency prevents their death by a Type II mechanism (33Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37879-37886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15095-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Bax-null cells remained resistant regardless of the oligomeric state of TRAIL used. Native TRAIL, Including Trimer TRAIL, Induced Death of Human Primary Esophageal Epithelial Cells—TRAIL is believed to selectively induce cell death of tumor cells but not most normal cells. We tested our TRAIL preparations for potential cytotoxic effects toward normal human cell lines. Human foreskin fibroblasts appeared completely refractory to TRAIL-induced death regardless of the method of TRAIL preparation (Fig. 5A). In contrast, EPC2 cells displayed significant sensitivity to the various TRAIL preparations (Fig. 5B). We recently demonstrated that these cells are sensitive to His-tagged recombinant TRAIL (36Kim K. Nakagawa H. Fei P. Rustgi A.K. El-Deiry W.S. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We treated the EPC2 cells with 50 ng/ml of each TRAIL preparation and, using the active caspase 3 fluorescence-activated cell sorter assay, found that EPC2 were sensitive to all four TRAIL preparations (Fig. 5B); however, the hyper-oligomerized TRAIL preparations were clearly more toxic toward the EPC2 cells. There have been some reports that His-tagged or leucine zipper TRAIL preparations induced cell death in human primary keratinocytes or hepatocytes (25Jo M. Kim T.H. Seol D.W. Esplen J.E. Dorko K.

Dermatol. 2002; 11: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). There was also a report that optimally trimerized soluble TRAIL did not induce apoptosis in human hepatocytes (27Lawrence D. Shahrokh Z. Marsters S. Achilles K. Shih D. Mounho B. Hillan K. Totpal K. DeForge L. Schow P. Hooley J. Sherwood S. Pai R. Leung S. Khan L. Gliniak B. Bussiere J. Smith C.A. Strom S.S. Kelley S. Fox J.A. Thomas D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). When we compared the dose dependence of cell death induced by trimer TRAIL in EPC2 and H460 cells, EPC2 cells showed a sensitivity to TRAIL similar to that of the H460 lung cancer cells (Fig. 5C), although our trimer TRAIL has optimally trimerized conformation according to our gel filtration results (Fig. 2). TRAIL-induced Cell Death in Human Primary Esophageal Epithelial Cells Was Prevented by Treatment with a Caspase 9 Inhibitor Even after Initiation of Apoptosis—We previously reported that human primary hepatocytes were sensitive to His-tagged TRAIL treatment, but this death was prevented by co-treatment with the C9I (34Ozoren N. Kim K. Burns T.F. Dicker D.T. Moscioni A.D. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6259-6265PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that the C9I could not prevent apoptosis induced by TRAIL in H460 and SW480 cell lines because these tumor cell lines were killed by a Type I mechanism that was not sensitive to blockade of caspase 9 activated by the mitochondrial signaling pathway. In the present study, we evaluated the death-protective effect of C9I especially after the death signal had been initiated by TRAIL. First, we added the C9I or the soluble DR5 protein at 0-, 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-h time points during a 6-h culture of EPC2 cells exposed to 100 ng/ml trimer TRAIL at time 0 (Fig. 6A). At the zero time point, when each of the death blockers, C9I or soluble DR5, was added with trimer TRAIL, the death was prevented completely. At the 1-h time point, in the case when the death blockers were added at 1 h after trimer TRAIL, the C9I prevented the death completely, whereas the soluble DR5 only pr"

https://openalex.org/W2076085262,"The human AF4 (ALL-1 fused gene on chromosome 4) gene (4q11) is recurrently involved in reciprocal translocations to the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene (11q23), correlated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants and early childhood. The t(4;11) translocation is one of the most frequent MLL translocations known today. In general, MLL translocations are the result of an illegitimate recombination process leading to reciprocal fusions of unrelated translocation partner (TP) genes with the MLL gene. Owing to the constant presence of the derivative (11) product, it was hypothesised that only MLL.TP fusion genes are responsible for the leukemogenic process. This concept has been successfully tested for some known MLL fusions, while other MLL fusions failed. Here, we demonstrate growth-transforming potential of AF4 wild-type and the AF4.MLL fusion protein. The underlying oncogenic mechanism involves the two E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 and SIAH2, the N-terminal portion of AF4 and the protection of the AF4.MLL fusion protein against proteosomal degradation."

Here we describe the purification and characterization of human Claspin. The protein has a ring-like structure and binds with high affinity to branched DNA molecules.

Claspin is an essential protein for the ATR-dependent activation of the DNA replication checkpoint response in Xenopus and human cells.

These findings suggest that Claspin may be a component of the replication ensemble and plays a role in the replication checkpoint by directly associating with replication forks and with the various branched DNA structures likely to form at stalled replication forks because of DNA damage. The replication and DNA damage checkpoints ensure genome integrity by coordinating cell division with replication and arresting the cell cycle in the presence of stalled replication forks. Several components of the checkpoints have been identified and classified into four main groups: DNA damage sensors, mediators, signal transducers, and effectors. DNA damage sensors recognize DNA lesions or DNA structures formed upon genotoxic stress and relay the signal to downstream signal transducers. So far, genetic and biochemical analyses have implicated two groups of proteins in sensing DNA damage or replication intermediates: 1) the phoshoinositide kinase-like kinase family members ATM 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; RPA, replication protein A; RT, reverse transcriptase; EM, electron microscopy; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; 9-1-1, Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance proteins. and ATR and 2) the clamp loader/DNA clamp family members Rad17-RFC/9-1-1 complex (1Abraham R.T.

Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Claspin has been placed in the mediator class of checkpoint proteins because it was originally shown in Xenopus egg extracts to be required for ATR to phosphorylate the downstream signal transducer, Chk1, upon activation of the replication checkpoint (4Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The yeast proteins scRad9/spCrb2 and sp/scMrc1 are the prototypical members of the mediator class of checkpoint proteins (5Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 6Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat.

Another example of a mediator in humans is BRCA1, which has been shown to be required for optimal Chk1 phosphorylation after ionizing radiation (8Yarden R.I. Pardo-Reoyo S. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Brody L.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Currently, mediator proteins are thought to promote protein-protein interactions between checkpoint sensors and signal transducers, leading to phosphorylation and activation of transducer kinases. However, it is becoming apparent that this narrow definition of mediators does not explain their functions fully. In particular, the possibility of mediators having a more active role in damage sensing has not been addressed. Such a role in damage sensing may lead to the redefinition of the checkpoint proteins initially classified as mediators, as exemplified by recent findings on Claspin. In Xenopus, ATR phosphorylates and activates Chk1 in the presence of poly(dA)70-poly(dT)70, which activates the DNA replication checkpoint. Phosphorylation of Chk1 depends on its association with a 215-kDa protein, Claspin (4Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Activation of the replication checkpoint induces Claspin phosphorylation, which is essential for Claspin-Chk1 association and subsequent activation of Chk1 (4Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Subsequent work showed that similar to Xclaspin, human Claspin is also required for phosphorylation of Chk1, it interacts with Chk1, and the association between these two proteins depends on the phosphorylation of Claspin (10Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition to Chk1, Claspin also interacts with other checkpoint proteins, ATR and Rad9 (10Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As ATR is the primary phoshoinositide kinase-like kinase family kinase that phosphorylates Chk1, it was proposed that Claspin may work as an adaptor molecule that brings the damage sensors, ATR and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex, and the signal transducer Chk1 in close proximity for checkpoint activation. In line with these findings, it was recently reported that DNA damage induces the formation of a complex between Claspin and BRCA1, another regulator of ATR-dependent Chk1 activation (11Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A detailed study on Xclaspin suggests a more complex role in cell cycle regulation and replication checkpoint activation (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro system consisting of Xenopus egg extracts supplemented with demembranated sperm chromatin, it was found that Claspin is recruited to chromatin in a manner dependent on the replication initiation proteins, MCM2–7 and Cdc45, but independent of proteins known to be essential for checkpoint signaling such as RPA, ATR, or Rad17-RFC and the 9-1-1 complex. Therefore, it was proposed that Claspin, ATR, and Rad17-RFC/9-1-1 act independently, but in concert, to recognize three distinct features of the replication fork and activate the replication checkpoint. According to this model, Claspin recognizes some component of the replication fork that is associated with unwinding DNA, ATR binds RPA-covered single-stranded DNA, and Rad17-RFC loads the 9-1-1 ring onto a primer/template to provide a triple-tiered mechanism of recognizing replication forks and initiating the replication checkpoint response (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, it was reported that even though Claspin associates with replicating sperm chromatin in Xenopus extracts, Xclaspin exhibited no intrinsic DNA binding activity (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, suggested that the association of Claspin with chromatin during replication was mediated by protein-protein interactions, possibly with Xcdc45. The recent finding that Claspin binds to BRCA1 (11Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a protein with high affinity for branched DNA structures (13Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that BRCA1 may be the protein responsible for recruiting Claspin to replication forks and related replication intermediates. To test this emerging model for the mode of action of Claspin that is largely based on in vitro experiments with Xenopus egg extracts and in vivo assays with human cells, we purified the human Claspin and investigated its biochemical properties. Here we report our findings on the interaction of Claspin with DNA. We find that Claspin binds to double-stranded DNA directly, but with low affinity, and to branched DNA structures, which are likely to be found at replication forks, with high affinity and specificity. Analysis by electron microscopy reveals that Claspin is a ring-shaped protein that appears to circle DNA specifically at single-stranded branch points. Collectively, these data suggest that Claspin is a direct primary sensor of replicating DNA and of DNA structures that may form at stalled replication forks, and therefore it is a frontline replication and damage sensor in the mammalian checkpoint response. Cloning of Claspin into Expression Vectors—We isolated human Claspin cDNA by RT-PCR. Whole cellular RNA was isolated from HEK-293T cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Attempts to amplify the entire open reading frame of Claspin (4.1 kb) by RT-PCR were unsuccessful. Therefore, the 5′- and 3′-halves of the cDNA were amplified separately and inserted into the pCRBlunt II Topo vector sequentially to obtain a plasmid containing full-length cDNA of Claspin. The primers used for amplifying Claspin by RT-PCR were based on a Claspin GenBank™ sequence with the accession number NM_022111. The sequences of the primers used for the 5′ and 3′ termini of human Claspin were 5′-GGATCCGCCGCCACCATGACAGGCGAGGTGGGT-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACTCGAGGCTCTCCAAATATTTG-3′, respectively. The entire Claspin cDNA was inserted into pcDNA4 to obtain the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4-Claspin-FLAG. This plasmid was used as a template to amplify Claspin cDNA and insert it into the pFastBacFlag vector to obtain a baculovirus vector that expresses a full-length Claspin. The baculovirus constructs CL149, CL340, and CL851, expressing the N-terminal regions of the corresponding amino acids, and CLΔ851 lacking the N-terminal 851 amino acids, were generated by standard methods including subcloning of restriction enzyme fragments and amplifying the desired sequences by appropriate PCR primers followed by insertion into a pFastBacFlag vector. All of the plasmids containing Claspin and Claspin fragments were sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced into the gene during in vitro manipulation. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—We exclusively used Claspin and Claspin fragments made in the baculovirus/insect cell system for our studies. Baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Monolayer High Five cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the appropriate baculovirus and then harvested after 48 h. The cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 20× packed volumes of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 32,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed once with 10 volumes of lysis buffer, once with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, and once with elution buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) and then eluted with two volumes of elution buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. A typical yield was about 2 μg of Claspin from 107 cells. Concentrations of Claspin and its fragments were determined by Bradford assay. The proteins were stored at –80 °C. DNA Substrates—The sequences of oligonucleotides used in preparation of various substrates for gel mobility shift assays have been described elsewhere (14Özsoy A.Z. Ragonese H.M. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1554-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These oligomers were annealed in appropriate combinations to obtain the DNA forms shown in Figs. 3 and 4. To prepare each substrate, oligonucleotide 1 was labeled on the 5′ terminus using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN). The labeled oligomer was purified on a Probe Quant G-50 Micro column (Amersham Biosciences) and annealed with appropriate non-radioactive complementary oligomers at 1 to 4 molar ratios. The mixture, which contained the radiolabeled oligomer at 25 nm and the complementary oligomer at 100 nm concentrations, in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was heated at 95 °C for 20 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The substrates were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (50 mm Tris borate, pH 7.9, 1.2 mm EDTA). Gel slices containing the substrates were excised and incubated in 0.3 m sodium acetate and 10 mm EDTA at 25 °C overnight. The liquid phase was then separated from the gel pieces, and the DNA was precipitated with 70% ethanol and dissolved in a buffer with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA. Specific activities of substrates were determined, and concentrations were based on specific activities.Fig. 4Claspin-DNA binding isotherms with various DNA forms.A–F, the indicated DNAs at 0.25 nm were incubated with increasing concentrations of Claspin (5.3–232 nm) and analyzed by gel mobility shift assays. Representative gels are shown for each of the DNAs (single-stranded DNA (A), double-stranded DNA (B), Y structure (C), 3′-flap (D), replication fork (E), and Holliday junction (F)). G, binding isotherms were obtained from two gel mobility shift assays, including the ones shown in A–F. The error bars are the standard error values for two experiments. HJ, Holliday junction; RF, replication fork; DS, double-stranded DNA; SS, single-stranded DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Full-length Claspin or its fragments at the indicated concentrations were incubated with 0.25 nm DNA substrates for 25 min at 30 °C in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 11 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Glycerol was added to 6.1%, and the DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE. Electrophoresis was performed at 120 V for 210–240 min at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences), and the data was analyzed by ImageQuant software (version 5.0, Amersham Biosciences). Bound DNA fraction was determined by subtracting the free DNA from the total DNA in the lane. Percentage of bound DNA was calculated and plotted against Claspin concentration to generate binding isotherms for Claspin binding to various substrates. For the antibody supershift assay, full-length Claspin or UvrA (bacterial DNA-binding protein used as a control) was preincubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, F-3165) for 20 min on ice before adding it to DNA and performing a gel mobility shift assay. Electron Microscopy—Linear double-stranded DNA templates containing either an internal single-stranded or double-stranded tail (Fig. 5, A and B) were generated to mimic a replication fork junction using the plasmid pGLGAP12, which contains a site for the nicking endonuclease, N.BbvCIA, on the sense strand immediately followed by a 400-bp G-less cassette in which the complementary strand contains no guanines (15Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Plasmids were nicked with N.BbvCIA followed by strand displacement with Klenow exo– fragment in reactions lacking dCTP to produce the single-stranded tail. Double-stranded tails were generated by annealing primers to the single-stranded tail near the junction site followed by synthesis using Klenow exo– fragment. The linear replication fork templates (100 ng) were incubated with Claspin (200 ng) in a 20-μl binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 25 °C. In the control reaction, the single-stranded tail template was incubated with 500 ng of Escherichia coli SSB protein under the same conditions. The samples were fixed by the addition of glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.6% for 10 min at 25 °C and chromatographed on 1-ml Bio-Gel A50m columns to remove unbound proteins. Fractions containing DNA-protein complexes were prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (16Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The samples were examined on a Phillips CM12 instrument, and images were scanned using Nikon-4500 film. Length measurements were made using Digital Micrograph software. Purification of Claspin—We cloned the human Claspin gene by RT-PCR and inserted it into both mammalian and insect expression vectors and purified the protein from both sources by affinity chromatography. Claspin purified from transiently transfected human cells was of low yield and moderate purity. In contrast, High Five insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing the Claspin gene expressed the protein at high levels and were used as our main source of Claspin. Early on in our study on Claspin, we found that it is a DNA-binding protein and therefore made baculovirus constructs expressing various regions of the protein with the aim of identifying the DNA binding domain. Fig. 1A is a schematic representation of fragments that were inserted into baculovirus, and Fig. 1B shows the Claspin domains encoded by these fragments separated on an SDS-PAGE. Human Claspin is 1339 amino acids in length with a calculated molecular mass of 151 kDa. However, as noted for the Xclaspin, the human Claspin migrates anomalously on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Both Xenopus and human Claspins are acidic proteins with pI 4.5, and it was suggested that this anomalous migration might be the consequence of this low pI (4Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The same is true for all of the Claspin fragments we expressed; all have pIs in the range of 4.4 to 5.7 and migrate on SDS-PAGE considerably slower than expected from their calculated molecular weights (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–5). Binding of Claspin to DNA—Because it has been reported that Xclaspin associates with chromatin in Xenopus extracts, we wished to determine whether Claspin directly binds to DNA without a protein intermediary. We tested DNA binding by gel mobility shift assays using a 30-bp duplex. Claspin forms a DNA-protein complex that is supershifted by anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 2A). We concluded that Claspin is a DNA-binding protein. To identify the DNA binding domain, we tested the Claspin fragments shown in Fig. 1 in the gel mobility shift assay. The results are shown in Fig. 2B. Based on the data in Fig. 2B (lanes 1–8), the main DNA binding domain is identified as the region spanning amino acids 149 to 340. However, the C-terminal CLΔ851 fragment also exhibited some weak DNA binding activity (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Indeed, with high concentrations of this fragment a substantial amount of the DNA exhibits slower migration, albeit without forming a distinct DNA-protein band (Fig. 2B, lanes 11–15). This behavior is commonly observed with DNA-protein complexes with rapid dissociation rates. Thus, it appears that Claspin has a primary DNA binding domain in the N-terminal region and a secondary DNA binding site in the C-terminal region. Binding of Claspin to Branched DNA—In Xenopus extracts, it was found that Claspin requires Xcdc45 to bind to chromatin. Cdc45 is necessary for ATP-dependent unwinding of DNA at replication origins (17Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Hence, it was hypothesized that Claspin may associate with a special structure formed at replication origins as a consequence of DNA unwinding. The specific DNA structures formed at unwound origins that can activate the checkpoint are not known. However, it was previously shown that hydroxyurea treatment, which leads to replication block, increases the number of hemi-replicated DNAs and also single-strandedness of the replicons (18Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to test the following branched DNA structures for binding as a potential model system for studying Claspin-replicating DNA interactions: “Y structure,” “3′-flap,” “replication fork,” and “Holliday junction” (Fig. 3, top panel). Claspin binds to all of these structures with higher affinity than double-stranded DNA (Fig. 3). To assess the relative affinity of Claspin to various DNA forms, we generated binding isotherms with gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 4, A–G), and Kd values were determined as the concentration at which 50% of the DNA is bound by Claspin (Table I). We find that Claspin binds to all branched DNAs with 10–20-fold higher affinity than double-stranded DNA, and with even much higher affinity than single-stranded DNA (Fig. 4G, Table I). These findings suggest that when the replication origin is unwound, Claspin binds directly to the branched DNA at the origin without the intermediacy of another protein. Furthermore, this high affinity is not because of the single-stranded DNA per se, which are associated with replicating DNA.Table IAffinities of Claspin for different DNA structuresDNA structuresKdaEstimated from the concentration required for 50% binding.nmSingle-stranded DNAbExtrapolated from the binding curves to the amount required for 50% binding.>1000Double-stranded DNAbExtrapolated from the binding curves to the amount required for 50% binding.>500Replication fork853′-Flap80Y structure65Holliday junction37a Estimated from the concentration required for 50% binding.b Extrapolated from the binding curves to the amount required for 50% binding. Open table in a new tab Structure of Claspin-DNA Complexes—Our data combined with previous data on Xclaspin (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggest that Claspin may specifically bind to the regions of replication forks not covered by other replication and checkpoint proteins (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and may even travel with the replication fork as a replication sensor protein even though it is not essential for replication (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Hence, we prepared a 3.2-kb linear double-stranded DNA template containing a 400-nucleotide single-stranded tail or a circular double strand template containing a 400-bp double-stranded tail as model substrates for structures associated with leading and lagging strand synthesis (Fig. 5, A and B). We incubated these substrates with Claspin, and then the samples were prepared for electron microscopy (EM) as described elsewhere (16Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To verify the position of the single-stranded tail, DNA templates (Fig. 5A) containing a single-stranded tail at an asymmetric location with respect to the termini of the linear duplex were first treated with E. coli single strand DNA-binding protein (SSB). The results show that 95% of the molecules (n = 30) contained a single-stranded tail that had at least 3–5 SSB particles bound (19Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), indicating a tail length of ∼400 nucleotides (Fig. 6A). Additionally, the shorter double-stranded arm was measured and found to be 18.6 ± 1% of the total DNA length, which matches the expected position of a single-stranded tail. When Claspin was incubated with these templates and the products examined by EM, 15 ± 2.3% (n = 66) of the replication fork templates were found to be bound by Claspin (Fig. 6, B and C). Claspin appears slightly oblong, and had a size consistent with a protein particle of ∼150–200 kDa mass, based on previous visualization of other proteins by these EM methods (20Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The location of the protein was determined by measuring the short arm and found to be 19.9 ± 0.5% of the full duplex length, which closely corresponds with the position of the single-stranded tail as determined by SSB binding, indicating that Claspin binds at the junction of the single-stranded tail with the double-stranded linear DNA. Unlike SSB, where multiple protein molecules were seen along the tail, only one particle of Claspin was seen per DNA molecule. This suggests that Claspin binding is most likely at the junction as a monomer and not along the single-stranded tail. Frequently (Fig. 6, B and C, insets), Claspin exhibits a ring-like structure that may be circling the DNA. Preliminary examination of the protein alone using negative staining provided additional images of ring-like particles and will be described later. The junction-specific binding was confirmed by performing binding experiments with a template containing a double-stranded tail. Circular templates containing an internal double-stranded tail (Fig. 5B), which could be considered a model for replication forks undergoing leading and lagging strand synthesis, were mixed with Claspin, examined by EM, and scored for protein binding at the junction of the doublestranded tail with the circle, along the tail, or on the double-stranded circle. The results show that 38% (n = 156) of the double-stranded templates were bound by Claspin. Of the bound molecules, 53% were bound at the junction (Fig. 6, D–F), 21% were bound along the tail, and 26% were bound somewhere on the circle other than the junction point. The overall fraction of molecules bound to the junction point was lower with this template than with the single-stranded tail template, which is consistent with the in vivo data suggesting that Claspin may prefer single-stranded fork structures that are not covered by other proteins such as RPA (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the double-stranded tail templates, there is a 25-nucleotide gap at the base of the junction. However, this may not provide a sufficient single-stranded region for efficient Claspin recognition. Regardless of the details of the requirement for high specificity binding, clearly Claspin binds to branched DNA structures preferentially. Collectively, these data indicate that Claspin is a checkpoint sensor that binds directly and with high affinity to unwound DNA at replication origins and replication forks. In this paper we describe the purification and characterization of human Claspin. Our main findings are that Claspin appears to be a ring-shaped protein with high affinity for branched DNA structures and low affinity to single- or double-stranded DNAs. The low affinity of Claspin to single- and double-stranded DNAs relative to branched DNA structures may explain why a previous study concluded that Claspin had no intrinsic DNA binding activity (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In light of our finding of high affinity for branched DNAs and of the report demonstrating that Claspin associates with replicating chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we conclude that Claspin is not a mediator but actually is a sensor in the replication checkpoint. Currently, a key question in the field of DNA damage and replication checkpoint response is to determine the mechanisms by which the DNA damage or replication intermediates are detected. Genetic and biochemical analyses, including the data in this paper, have implicated three groups of proteins in sensing DNA damage or replication intermediates: 1) the phoshoinositide kinase-like kinase family members ATM and ATR, 2) the clamp loader/DNA clamp family members Rad17-RFC/9-1-1 complex, and 3) Claspin (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 2Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 3Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Claspin was first thought to function as a mediator or an adaptor in the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway (4Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 10Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to the two known mediators in yeast, scRad9 and Mrc1 proteins (6Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 7Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, recent work clearly demonstrated that Claspin is one of the first checkpoint proteins to associate with replicating chromatin (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and hence has the potential to function as a replication fork sensor. In the checkpoint response, the nature of DNA structures recognized by checkpoint sensors is of particular interest. It has been suggested that the ATR-ATRIP heterodimer binds to RPA-covered single-stranded DNA (21Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was reported that Rad17-RFC loads the 9-1-1 complex onto RPA-covered template/primer-like structures (22Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 23Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 231-243Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been found that association of Claspin with replicating sperm chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts was independent of RPA, but dependent on the Cdc45 pre-RC protein, which raised the possibility that Claspin may be recruited to replicating DNA through its interaction with Cdc45 (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These findings would suggest that checkpoint sensors do not actually recognize specific DNA lesions or structures but instead recognize specific nucleoprotein complexes that form at such sites. However, there are other findings that are not consistent with either these data or the specific model alluded to above. First, ATR, with and without ATRIP, binds with moderate affinity to single- and double-stranded DNA and with a somewhat higher affinity to a UV lesion in DNA (24Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Makhov A.M. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6673-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Under the reaction conditions used in those studies, RPA had only a minor effect on binding of ATR and the ATR-ATRIP complex to DNA. Second, it has been reported that Rad17-RFC can load the 9-1-1 complex onto template/primer structures in the absence of RPA (26Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and that the loading of the yeast equivalent of the 9-1-1 complex by the yeast Rad17-RFC counterpart onto a model primer/template is not stimulated, but actually inhibited, by RPA (27Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Finally, in this study we show that Claspin binds with high affinity and specificity to unwound DNA-like structures in the absence of Cdc45 or any other protein. These apparently contradictory results may be reconciled by assuming that Cdc45 and RPA act as facilitators and stabilizers of the checkpoint protein-DNA complexes rather than recruiters of checkpoint proteins. In fact, RPA is known to function as a facilitator and stabilizer in transcription and DNA repair by either facilitating protein-protein interactions or removing secondary structures to stabilize specific complexes (28Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). In the light of our results, the requirement for Cdc45 for Claspin binding is most likely because of its indispensable role in the firing of replication origins and formation of a replication fork rather than its recruitment of Claspin by a protein-protein interaction. With these assumptions, we propose a revised version of the three-tiered checkpoint activation model (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Cdc45 and other pre-RC proteins unwind DNA at replication origins. This unwound DNA attracts Claspin, Polα, and RPA. Primer synthesis by Polα creates a substrate for Rad17-RFC, and the naked DNA in the replication bubble becomes a binding site for ATR-ATRIP. Thus, the three sensors (Claspin, ATR, and Rad17-RFC) are recruited to a replication fork independent of one another, and the 9-1-1 complex is loaded onto DNA by the Rad17-RFC complex. This complex (as well as the ATR-ATRIP complex) at the replication fork may be stabilized by RPA. Eventually, the interactions between the three sensors, and possibly phosphorylation of Rad17 (29Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and Claspin by ATR (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), promote interactions with mediators such as BRCA1 and signal transducers such as Chk1, resulting in basal replication checkpoint response. Replication block by hydroxyurea or DNA damage increases the number of partially replicated replicons and the level of single strandedness in these replicons (18Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and causes more extensive binding of checkpoint sensors (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and amplification of the checkpoint signal. An unexpected finding of our study was the ring-shaped structure of Claspin. Two ring-like structures are known to be associated with the replication fork: the MCM helicase that unwinds the helix in front of a replication fork and PCNA that functions as a polymerase clamp. Our data indicate that Claspin is the third ring-like molecule associated with the replication fork. In some of the electron micrographs, the DNA seems to be threading through the hole in the Claspin ring. However, further biochemical work is required to formally prove that DNA threads through Claspin. It should be noted that in the case of MCM and PCNA, ATP hydrolysis by MCM2–7 and RFC, respectively, is required for opening the corresponding rings and clamping them onto DNA. Similarly, the checkpoint-dedicated PCNA ortholog, the 9-1-1 complex, is clamped onto DNA by the checkpoint counterpart of the RFC complex, Rad17-RFC in an ATP-dependent manner (23Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 231-243Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Claspin is not an ATPase, and it does not depend on another protein to slide onto DNA. It is possible that Claspin binds to DNA ends non-specifically and slides along DNA by diffusion, and when it encounters branched DNA, binds at the site with high affinity. Preliminary analyses of EM data as well as velocity sedimentation analysis suggest that Claspin is a monomeric protein (data not shown). However, further work is required to determine the quaternary structure of Claspin on and off DNA. In conclusion, our data, in combination with recent data on Claspin association with replicating chromatin in Xenopus (12Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and its apparent requirement for cell viability in human cells (10Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggest that Claspin is loaded at the replication origin onto unwound DNA and travels with the replication fork as a part of the replication monitoring machinery for maintaining the checkpoint response. When replication is blocked, the accumulation of replication/damage sensors, ATR-ATRIP, Rad17-RFC complex, Claspin, and RPA at the blockage site initiate a checkpoint signaling cascade that arrests cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1996460785,"We previously performed gene expression profiling in a multistep squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) progression model, and identified growth-regulated oncogene-1 (Gro-1/KC) as a factor that contributes to enhanced angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis. In the present study, we explored molecular pathways coactivated with Gro-1/KC, and identified a transcript that encodes c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF). Northern, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses confirm that expression of c-Met mRNA and protein is increased with SCC progression. In vitro, HGF preferentially promoted scattering in the metastatic LY-1 and LY-2 lines, and enhanced angiogenesis factors Gro-1/KC and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by all tumor cell lines. In vivo, tumor growth and lung metastasis were promoted by transfection and overexpression of HGF cDNA in metastatic LY-1 cells. Our data indicate that metastatic SCC cells that overexpress c-Met exhibit angiogenesis factor expression and enhanced scattering in response to HGF in vitro, and tumorigenesis and metastasis in response to HGF in the tumor microenvironment in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1997432382,"We have isolated, from a rat brain cDNA library, a clone corresponding to a 2779-bp cDNA encoding a novel splice form of the glutamate receptor interacting protein-1 (GRIP1). We call this 696-amino acid splice form GRIP1c 4-7 to differentiate it from longer splice forms of GRIP1a/b containing seven PDZ domains. The four PDZ domains of GRIP1c 4-7 are identical to PDZ domains 4-7 of GRIP1a/b. GRIP1c 4-7 also contains 35 amino acids at the N terminus and 12 amino acids at the C terminus that are different from GRIP1a/b. In transfected HEK293 cells, a majority of GRIP1c 4-7 was associated with the plasma membrane. GRIP1c 4-7 interacted with GluR2/3 subunits of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor. In low density hippocampal cultures, GRIP1c 4-7 clusters colocalized with GABAergic (where GABA is γ-aminobutyric acid) and glutamatergic synapses, although a higher percentage of GRIP1c 4-7 clusters colocalized with γ-aminobutyric acid, type A, receptor (GABAAR) clusters than with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor clusters. Transfection of hippocampal neurons with hemagglutinin-tagged GRIP1c 4-7 showed that it could target to the postsynaptic complex of GABAergic synapses colocalizing with GABAAR clusters. GRIP1c 4-7-specific antibodies, which did not recognize previously described splice forms of GRIP1, recognized a 75-kDa protein that is enriched in a postsynaptic density fraction isolated from rat brain. EM immunocytochemistry experiments showed that in intact brain GRIP1c 4-7 concentrates at postsynaptic complexes of both type I glutamatergic and type II GABAergic synapses although it is also presynaptically localized. These results indicate that GRIP1c 4-7 plays a role not only in glutamatergic synapses but also in GABAergic synapses.

GRIP1 also binds to the microtubule-based motor protein kinesin 5 through the region located between PDZ domains 6 and 7, thus being involved in vesicular trafficking of AMPA receptors along dendritic microtubules (12Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), targeting AMPA receptors to synapses (2Dong H. Zhang P. Song I.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDZ6 of both GRIP1 and GRIP2 interacts with the C termini of EphB2/EphA7 receptors and EphrinB1 ligands, recruiting cytoplasmic GRIPs to membrane lipid rafts (4Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H.

PDZ6 of both GRIP1 and GRIP2 also interacts with members of the liprin-α family, and disruption of this interaction prevents AMPA receptor surface expression and clustering (14Wyszynski M. Kim E.

AMPA receptors and GRIP1 as well as other components of glutamatergic synapses are present in lipid rafts (15Hering H. Lin C.C. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GRIP-/- mouse mutants have shown that GRIP1 is important for embryonic development (16Bladt F. Tafuri A. Gelkop S. Langille L. Pawson T.

Two splice forms of GRIP1 (GRIP1a and GRIP1b) differ in a short N-terminal peptide sequence such that GRIP1b can be palmitoylated, whereas GRIP1a cannot (18Yamazaki M. Fukaya M. Abe M. Ikeno K. Kakizaki T. Watanabe M. Sakimura K. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 304: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated forms have been described for ABP/GRIP2 (19DeSouza S. Fu J. States B.A. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of GRIP1/2 allows the anchoring of GRIP1/2 to the membrane and accumulation of AMPA receptors to the synaptic membrane (19DeSouza S. Fu J. States B.A. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the identification and characterization of GRIP1c 4-7, a novel splice form of GRIP1 that lacks PDZ domains 1-3 of GRIP1a/b but contains PDZ domains 4-7 of GRIP1a/b. GRIP1c 4-7 is not just a short form of GRIP1a/b. GRIP1c 4-7 also contains specific 35-amino acid N-terminal and 12-amino acid C-terminal peptide sequences that differ from GRIP1a/b. GRIP1c 4-7 readily distributes to the plasma membrane and concentrates not only in glutamatergic synapses but also in GABAergic synapses both in cultured neurons and in the intact brain. Thus, some forms of GRIP1 might play a more significant role in GABAergic synapses than previously recognized. All the animal protocols have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and follow the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Antibodies—All the anti-GABAAR, anti-GRIP1c 4-7 antibodies were raised in our laboratory. Rabbit and guinea pig antibodies specific for GRIP1c 4-7 were raised to amino acids 12-26 (KPHNFHHASHPPLRK) of rat GRIP1c 4-7. This sequence is not present in GRIP1a/b (Fig. 1). For anti-GRIP1c 4-7 antibody production, this peptide was covalently linked, via a C-terminal cysteine, to diphtheria toxoid (Mimotopes, San Diego, CA). A guinea pig antibody specific for GRIP1a/b was raised to the C-terminal amino acids 1100-1112 of rat GRIP1a/b (GGNLETREPTNTL). This amino acid sequence is not present in GRIP1c 4-7 (Fig. 1). For anti-GRIP1a/b antibody production, this peptide sequence was coupled via an N-terminal cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. A guinea pig and/or New Zealand rabbit were injected subcutaneously with a 1:1 emulsion of either diphtheria toxoid- or keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant (for the first immunization) and with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (for all subsequent immunizations) once per month. The antibody titer in the sera was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sera were collected after 4 months of immunizations and were affinity-purified on immobilized peptide. The anti-GRIP1c 4-7 antibodies showed specificity for GRIP1c 4-7 but not for GRIP1a/b as shown by immunofluorescence of transfected HEK293 cells and immunoblots of brain membranes (see “Results”). Likewise, the anti-GRIP1a/b antibodies showed specificity for GRIP1a/b but not for GRIP1c 4-7 as shown by immunofluorescence of HEK293 cells (not shown) and immunoblots of brain membranes (see “Results”). The guinea pig anti-rat α1 subunit antibody was raised to amino acids 1-15, and the rabbit anti-rat γ2 subunit antibody was raised to amino acids 1-15 (20Miralles C.P. Li M. Mehta A.K. Khan Z.U.

The mouse monoclonal anti-PSD-95, the rabbit anti-GluR1 antibody, and the rabbit anti-HA antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and the anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody was from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Rabbit anti-GluR2/3 was a gift from Dr. Robert Wenthold (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); mouse monoclonal anti-SV2 was a gift from Dr. Kathleen M. Buckley (Harvard Medical School); sheep anti-GAD was a gift from Dr. I. Kopin (National Institutes of Health); and guinea pig anti-GABA was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rabbit and guinea pig anti-vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vGlut-1) were from Synaptic Systems (Goettingen, Germany) and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-GRIP1 antibody, to a region of GRIP1 that includes part of the linker region between PDZ domains 6 and 7 and all of PDZ domain 7, was from Transduction Laboratories. Fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Colloidal gold-labeled (10 nm) goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was from ICN (Irvine, CA). All other colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Yeast Two-hybrid—All vectors and yeast strains for bait analysis and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening were from Dr. Roger Brent (University of California, San Francisco) or Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the C-terminal 50 amino acids of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR3 including its natural stop codon, and the PCR product was directionally cloned into the polylinker of pEG202. We confirmed that the bait fusion protein could be expressed in yeast by immunoblotting the cell lysate of yeast transformants with mouse anti-LexA monoclonal antibody (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD). We also tested that this fusion protein did not activate the lacZ reporter by itself. For this purpose, Saccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 was transformed with pSH18-34 and pEG202 (containing the bait insert), and the lacZ reporter activity was tested by replica-plating the transformants on the appropriate X-gal-containing media. For the positive control, the yeast was transformed with pSH18-34 and pSH17-4, the latter of which contains the LexA DNA binding domain fused to the B42 transcriptional activator domain. For a negative control, the yeast was transformed with pSH18-34 and pRHFM1 or with pSH18-34 and pEG202, the empty bait vector. We also confirmed that the bait did not activate the genomic LEU2 reporter gene, because the transformants containing the bait did not grow in the absence of leucine. For library screening, the yeast strain EGY48, previously transformed with pEG202 (containing the bait) and pSH18-34, was transformed with pJG4-5 containing the oligo(dT)-primed rat brain cDNA library (Origene Technologies). An aliquot of the pooled transformants was then diluted 1:10 in liquid YNB medium containing galactose (to activate the GAL1 promoter) and allowed to incubate for 4 h at 30 °C to induce cDNA library expression. Only clones with an activated leucine reporter grew on the medium lacking leucine. After allowing 4-6 days of growth, the fastest growing colonies were replica-plated onto solid YNB galactose growth medium containing X-gal. Plasmids from yeast clones showing lacZ reporter activity (presumably expressing bait interactors) were rescued by mechanical disruption and detergent lysis. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and was used to transform the trp-E. coli KC8 strain. Growth medium lacking tryptophan was used to select KC8 cells containing pJG4-5. Plasmid preparations from KC8 transformants were subjected to restriction analysis with EcoRI and XhoI, the enzymes used for directional cloning of the cDNA library into pJG4-5. The coding and noncoding strands of the cDNA clones were independently sequenced by using the BigDye Terminator DNA sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and read using the ABI377 Prism DNA sequencer, model 377XL (Applied Biosystems). Isolation and Sequencing of the 5′-UTR of GRIP1c 4-7 cDNA—By using the adaptor-ligated Marathon-ready rat brain cDNA library (Clontech) as template in a PCR, we completed the full cDNA sequence of the GRIP1c 4-7 clone that was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening. For this purpose, we used an antisense, gene-specific primer that corresponds to part of the GRIP1c 4-7 5′-UTR (5′-TTCTCTAGAGGCAAGGGGTGGTGACT-3′) and a sense primer corresponding to the 5′ end adaptor of the cDNA library. For PCR amplification, the Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (Clontech) was used under the following thermocycling conditions: 94 °C for 30 s followed by 20 cycles, each consisting of 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 2 min. After obtaining a PCR product of about 500 bp, the specificity of the reaction was confirmed by using nested primers to the 5′ adaptor sequence and the GRIP1c 4-7 5′-UTR (5′-TATAAGACCCTCACGGAGGACCGACGAT-3′). The 500-bp PCR product obtained from the initial 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was used as the template. The nested 5′-RACE product was then cloned, by the T/A cloning method, into pT-Adv plasmid (Clontech) for DNA sequencing. We have submitted the rat GRIP1c 4-7 cDNA full-length sequence to the GenBank™ (accession number AY437398). Preparation of Tissue Fractions—For crude synaptosomal fraction, forebrains (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) from two 6-8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in 10 ml of solution A (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. The homogenate was diluted to 20 ml with solution A and centrifuged for 10 min at 1400 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved. The pellet was suspended in 20 ml of solution A and centrifuged as above. The two supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 13,800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in 16 ml of solution B (0.32 m sucrose and 1 mm NaHCO3) and homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C. This crude synaptosomal fraction, containing membranes and cytosol, was stored in aliquots at -70 °C. Synaptosomes were prepared from homogenates by the method of Carlin et al. (28Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). A fraction enriched in postsynaptic densities (PSDs) was prepared by treating synaptosomes with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet containing PSDs was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (29Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific antibodies as described elsewhere (30De Blas A.L. Cherwinski H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Homogenates from various tissues (3-month-old male rats) or from forebrain from rats of different ages were prepared as above except that the non-neural tissue was first ground with a PowerGen 125 (Fisher) and then homogenized in a glass/Teflon homogenizer as with brain in buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenates were used directly for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitation from sodium deoxycholate extracts of rat cortical/hippocampal membranes was done according to the method of Luo et al. (31Luo J. Wang Y. Yasuda R.P. Dunah A.W. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, a rat brain cortical/hippocampal crude and unlysed synaptosomal fraction, containing 5 mg/ml total protein in solution B (see above), was centrifuged at 13,800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in a volume of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) equal to that of the original suspension. One-tenth volume of ice-cold sodium deoxycholate buffer (10% sodium deoxycholate in 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) was added, and the sample was incubated at 36 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of one-tenth volume of Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100 and 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). The sample was dialyzed against solution C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C overnight. Detergent-insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with an anti-GRIP1c 4-7 antibody. 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, suspended in 450 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, were incubated with 50 μl of guinea pig anti-GRIP1c 4-7 antiserum, or the preimmune serum, overnight at 4 °C with rotation. A volume of the extract, containing 200 μg of protein, was added to the antibody-coated beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads, washed with solution C, were incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 85 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-GluR2/3 antibody. The immunoblotting procedure has been described elsewhere (30De Blas A.L. Cherwinski H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Low Density Hippocampal Cultures and Transfection—Hippocampal cultures were prepared by the method of Banker and Goslin (32Goslin K. Assmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (21Christie S.B. Miralles C.P. De Blas A.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 684-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated neurons from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampi were plated at a density of 3,000-8,000 cells per 18-mm diameter circular coverslip and maintained in glial cell conditioned culture medium for up to 21 days. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA3.1(+) containing GRIP1c 4-7 (with the hemagglutinin (HA) tag at its N terminus) at 9 days in culture using the Calphos transfection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultured for 7 additional days and processed for immunofluorescence as described below. HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. HEK293 cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated 18-mm coverslips and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA, all in pcDNA3.1(+), encoding GRIP1c 4-7, GRIP1a, or GRIP1a 4-7 or combinations of GRIP1c 4-7 and AMPA receptor subunits using the LipofectAMINE 2000 method following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence as described below. Immunofluorescence of Hippocampal Cultures and HEK293 Cells—Double or triple label immunofluorescence detection of various antigens with specific antibodies raised in various species was done as described elsewhere (21Christie S.B.

Hippocampal neurons or transfected HEK293 cells were fixed by immersion of coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 12 min at RT followed by permeabilization with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cultures were incubated with a mixture of the primary antibodies (defined in the legends for Figs. 3 and 5, 6, 7), diluted in 0.25% Triton X-100 PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips then were washed and incubated for 1 h at RT with a mixture of species-specific secondary antibodies all raised in donkey and conjugated to either Texas Red, FITC, and/or AMCA fluorophores (1:200 dilution in 0.25% Triton X-100 PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Optimal primary antibody dilutions were determined by dilution series. In HEK293 cells, the cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI, and cell surface localization was determined with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. The coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted using Prolong anti-fade mounting solution (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR). Specificity of the immunolabeling by the anti-GRIP1c 4-7 antibody was demonstrated by blocking the binding of the primary antibody with 20 μg/ml of the antigenic peptide. Moreover, no immunolabeling was obtained when the primary antibody was omitted. Images were collected using a ×60 pan-fluor objective on a Nikon Eclipse T300 microscope with a Sensys KAF 1401E CCD camera, driven by IPLab 3.0 (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA) acquisition software. Image files were then processed and merged for color colocalization figures using Adobe Photoshop 4.01.Fig. 5GRIP1c 4-7 colocalizes with GABAARs and AMPA receptor clusters in mature cultures of hippocampal neurons.

COG complex mutants exhibit a dramatic reduction in Golgi-specific glycosylation and other defects. Here we show that a strain carrying a COG3 temperature-sensitive allele, cog3-202, clearly exhibited the glycosylation defect while exhibiting nearly normal secretion kinetics. Two Golgi mannosyltransferases, Och1p and Mnn1p, were mislocalized in cog3-202 cells. In cog3-202 cells Och1-HA was found in lighter density membranes than in wild type cells. In sed5ts and sft1ts strains, Och1p rapidly accumulated in vesicle-like structures consistent with the delivery of Och1p back to the cis-Golgi on retrograde vesicles via a Sed5p/Sft1p-containing SNARE complex. In contrast to cog3-202 cells, the membranes in sed5ts cells that contained Och1p were denser than in wild type. Together these results indicate that Och1p does not accumulate in retrograde vesicles in the cog3-202 mutant and are consistent with the COG complex playing a role in sorting of Och1p into retrograde vesicles. In wild type cells Och1p has been shown previously to cycle between the cis-Golgi and minimally as far as the late Golgi. We find that Och1p does not cycle via endosomes during its normal itinerary suggesting that Och1p engages in intra-Golgi cycling only. However, Och1p does use a post-Golgi pathway for degradation because a portion of Och1p was degraded in the vacuole. Most surprisingly, Och1p can use either the carboxypeptidase Y or AP-3 pathways to reach the vacuole for degradation.

The trafficking of lipid and protein cargo between membrane-enclosed compartments involves the formation of vesicular carriers that subsequently fuse with an appropriate compartment (1Mellman I. Warren G. Cell. 2000; 100: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The specificity of vesicle fusion is regulated on multiple levels. An initial contact between the vesicle and target membrane appears to be mediated by “tethering factors” that consist either of long coiled-coiled proteins or large, multisubunit complexes (2Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 3Whyte J.R.C. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent fusion reaction, mediated by interaction between SNARE proteins on the vesicle and target membranes, adds additional specificity to the process (4McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 5Parlati F. McNew J.A. Fukuda R. Miller R. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because each organelle of the secretory pathway contains resident proteins necessary for compartment function, resident proteins must be sorted from secretory cargo during vesicular transport. For example, resident glycosyltransferases of the Golgi apparatus are maintained in an asymmetric steady-state distribution within Golgi cisternae despite a high rate of secretory protein trafficking through these compartments (6Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Both yeast and mammalian Golgi glycosyltransferases are typically type II integral membrane proteins with a short cytosolic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a relatively large luminal domain. Two main models have been proposed to account for localization of Golgi glycosyltransferases. The kin recognition model posits that oligomerization of glycosyltransferases within Golgi cisternae prevents their forward transport by preventing entry into anterograde vesicles (7Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Hoe M.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, in recent years new evidence strongly supports the idea that Golgi cisternae themselves represent anterograde trafficking structures and that most, if not all, vesicles that bud off of Golgi cisternae mediate retrograde transport (9Bonfanti L. Mironov A.A.J. Martinex-Menarguez J.A. Martella O. Fusella A. Baldassarre M. Buccione R. Geuze H.J. Mironov A.A. Luini A.

Thus the role of oligomerization in Golgi localization remains obscure. Golgi membrane bilayers are thinner than that of the plasma membrane, and a relatively short transmembrane domain is an important determinant for localization of the medial and trans- Golgi residents (13Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that glycosyltransferases localize to Golgi compartments because the transmembrane domain exhibits the best “fit” with the bilayer thickness of Golgi membranes (14Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Indeed, glycosyltransferases have been mislocalized to the plasma membrane as a result of modest increases in their transmembrane domain length. In addition, a role for cytosolic domain sorting determinants has also been noted in several cases (15Milland J. Taylor S.G. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F.C. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Lussier M. Sdicu A. Ketela T. Bussey H. J.

Golgi localization appears to be a dynamic process with some Golgi glycosyltransferases cycling between their principal site of residence and distal compartments. Dynamic localization is exemplified by yeast Och1p, an α1,6-mannosyltransferase localized to the cis-Golgi (18Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol.

As part of its normal itinerary, Och1p is transported at least as far as the late Golgi (trans- Golgi network) with a half-time of ∼5 min and is then actively recycled back to the cis-Golgi (21Harris S.L. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, certain other early Golgi membrane proteins maintain their localization by constantly cycling between the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; PVC, prevacuolar/endosomal compartment; HA, hemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; PVC, prevacuolar/endosomal compartment; HA, hemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors.

Although much is known regarding the trafficking patterns and sorting signals of resident late Golgi membrane proteins (25Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wilsbach K. Payne G.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 426-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Gu F. Crump C.M. Thomas G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1067-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the distal compartments that Golgi glycosyltransferases visit or how they are retrieved from these compartments for transport back to their site of function. Glycosyltransferases have been found in Golgi-derived COPI-coated vesicles thought to be mediating intra-Golgi retrograde transport (10Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Prekeris R. Oorschot V. Scheller R. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Klumperman J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155 (and references therein): 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) suggesting that the retrieval compartment may be a late Golgi cisternae. However, it is also possible that these cargoes may be cycled back from a more distal compartment and use intra-Golgi retrograde traffic in the final stage of their journey. A Golgi-associated tethering complex necessary for Golgi trafficking and morphology has been characterized in both yeast and mammalian cells (3Whyte J.R.C. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This complex, originally called the Sec34-Sec35 complex and now referred to as the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, contains eight subunits. Yeast COG2/SEC35 and COG3/SEC34/GRD20 exhibit genetic interactions with genes involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking, are pleiotropically required for efficient secretion, and encode proteins that are required for optimal transport for in vitro ER-to-Golgi transport assays (28VanRheenen S.M.

However, yeast strains carrying mutations in COG complex subunits exhibit a number of other phenotypes including a loss of retention of the late Golgi resident protein Kex2p, missorting of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), failure to recycle the late secretory v-SNARE Snc1p, and a striking decrease in Golgi-specific glycosylation (32Wuestehube L.J. Duden R. Eun A. Hamamoto S. Korn P. Ram R. Schekman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 393-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol.

These results suggest that the COG complex is involved in both intra-Golgi retrograde transport and transport from the endosomal system back to the Golgi. This idea is further supported by the observation that the COG complex associates with the Golgi vesicle coat complex COPI and with SNAREs involved in intra-Golgi recycling (31Suvorova E.S. Duden R. Lupashin V.V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is possible that a defect in retrograde transport of anterograde trafficking machinery in cog mutants could explain the ER-to-Golgi defects. Taken together it appears that the COG complex is either directly involved in both ER-to-Golgi transport and retrograde transport to the Golgi or, alternatively, that the primary role is in retrograde trafficking with an indirect role in ER-to-Golgi transport. In this study we have investigated the trafficking pathways and degradation of the glycosyltransferase Och1p. We show that Och1p is mislocalized in a cog3 mutant consistent with the observed glycosylation defects in cog mutants. Our results suggest that in wild type cells Och1p is retrieved from the late Golgi back to the early Golgi via vesicular transport and does not reach more distal compartments such as endosomes or the plasma membrane.

Mouse antibodies against Dpm1p and Vph1p were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Rabbit antibodies were raised against the product of the VPS10 gene. Plasmid pAAC209 (37Cooper A.A. Stevens T.H.

The fusion protein was purified by using an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and antibodies were raised against this protein in New Zealand White rabbits.

Plasmids pSN335 and pSN336 were generated by inserting the 2.7-kbp XhoI-SacII fragments from pSB1-25 (cog3-201 allele in pRS316) and pSB1-212 (cog3-202 allele in pRS316), respectively, into the XhoI/SacII site of pRS313 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSB29 was created by inserting the 4.3-kbp EcoRI fragment from pRB58 (YEp24 containing the SUC2 gene) into the EcoRI site of pRS314. pSN390 was constructed by inserting the 2.6-kbp SalI-SpeI fragment from pOH (21Harris S.L. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) into the SalI/SpeI sites of pRS314. pPB18 was constructed by inserting the 2.6-kbp SalI-HindIII fragment from pOH into the SalI/HindIII sites of pRS315.Table IYeast strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain/plasmidDescriptionOrigin or Ref.StrainSEY6210MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ939SNY36-9AMATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 pho8Δ::ADE271SHY35MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 pho8Δ::ADE272SBY4-10AMATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 pho8Δ::ADE2 cog3-Δ133SNY96-9DMATa leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 pho8Δ::ADE2 ups1Δ::LEU2 end3-ts73AHY40MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 pho8Δ::ADE2 ups5Δ::HIS354TVY614MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 pep4Δ::LEU2 prb1Δ::HISG prc1Δ::HIS3T.

All other yeast strains were derived from SEY6210 or from the meiotic progeny of a diploid formed from mating SEY6210 and SEY6211 (39Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) derivatives. Replacement of the RCY1 gene in strain SHY35 with the His3MX6 cassette was achieved by using a PCR-based method (40Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) resulting in strain SNY140. The same method was used to replace the APM3 gene in strain SNY17 with His3MX6 resulting in strain SNY106. A centromeric plasmid carrying the pep12-49 temperature-sensitive allele, pRS414-pep12-49, was obtained from B. Horazdovsky (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The 1.2-kbp ClaI-SmaI fragment from this plasmid was inserted into pRS306 digested with KpnI, blunted with Klenow polymerase, and then cut with ClaI. The resulting plasmid, pSH24, was digested with KpnI and was transformed into SNY36-9A. Ura+ transformants were grown nonselectively and then propagated in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for Uraloop-outs. These were screened for temperature-sensitive CPY secretion phenotype giving rise to strain SNY156. To generate an apm3Δ pep12-49 double mutant, strains SNY106 and SNY156 were mated, and the resulting diploid was sporulated and dissected giving rise to strain PBY36-1B. Pulse-Chase Immunoprecipitation—The procedure for immunoprecipitation of Och1-HA from [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled cells was performed as described previously (41Nothwehr S.F. Roberts C.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Likewise, the immunoprecipitation of invertase from the cell-associated and media fractions was performed as described previously (33Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled proteins were quantified from gels using a PhosphorImager system (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). The half-time of Och1-HA turnover was determined by first calculating the percentage of protein remaining at a given time point relative to that present at the 0-min time point (defined as 100%). Linear regression analysis was then carried out on plots of the log of the percentage protein remaining as a function of time. Subcellular Fractionation—The fractionation of organelles by differential centrifugation was carried out by incubating 10 A600 units of cells, grown to log phase in selective minimal media, in 2 ml of 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaN3 for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were pelleted and spheroplasted in a 2-ml solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.4 m sorbitol, 10 mm NaN3, and 25 μg/ml oxalyticase at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were pelleted, washed once with 1.2 m sorbitol, and osmotically lysed in 1 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 200 mm mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Unlysed cells were pelleted at 500 × g, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,300 × g for 12 min resulting in pellet (P12) and supernatant (S12) fractions. The S12 fraction was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min to generate P150 and S150 fractions. The S150 fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and pellets were washed with acetone. The S150 trichloroacetic acid pellets as well as the P12 and P150 membrane pellets were resuspended in 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and equivalent percentages were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with the indicated primary antibodies followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent detection using the Lumi-Phos substrate (Pierce). The blots were imaged using a Fuji LAS-1000 CCD camera and ImageReader LAS-1000 1.2 software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Images were further adjusted and formatted using Adobe Photoshop 7. To fractionate organelles on sucrose density gradients, 450 A600 units of cells were spheroplasted and washed using conditions described above and scaled up accordingly. The spheroplasts were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (200 mm sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing freshly added protease inhibitors and were Dounce-homogenized. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to generate S1 and P1 fractions. 2.0 ml of the supernatant (S1) fraction was then layered on top of a sucrose step gradient made in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA. The % sucrose and volume of each step were as follows from bottom to top: 1 ml 60%, 1 ml 45%, 1.5 ml 41.1%, 2 ml 36%, 2 ml 30.9%, 1.5 ml 27%, and 1 ml 22%. The gradients were centrifuged at 118,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C. 15 fractions of 0.8 ml each were removed from the top and were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above, and the captured images were quantified using the Fuji ImageGauge 3.3 software. Fluorescence Microscopy—The procedures for preparation of fixed spheroplasted yeast cells and attachment to microscope slides were described previously (42Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 before use. Simultaneous detection of Och1-HA and c-myc-Snc1p was achieved by incubating with each of the following reagents followed by extensive washing: (a) rabbit anti-HA and mouse anti-c-Myc, (b) biotinconjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H + L), (c) Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) and Texas Red-streptavidin. Sole detection of Och1-HA, MnnI-HA, and A-ALP was carried out by using the following incubations: (a) rabbit primary antibody against HA or ALP, (b) biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), and (c) FITC-streptavidin. Yeast cells were photographed by using an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Lake Success, NY) equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 digital camera (Hamamatsu Corp., Bridgewater, NJ). Images were initially captured using Openlab 3.1.7 software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA) and were processed into figures using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Invertase Is Secreted in an Underglycosylated Form in a cog3 Allele That Exhibits Little or No Block in Secretion—Previously, two classes of temperature-sensitive COG3/GRD20 alleles were isolated as exemplified by cog3-201 and cog3-202 (previously called grd20-1 and grd20-2, respectively) (33Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At the nonpermissive temperature the cog3-201 allele caused a growth defect, a delay in invertase secretion presumably because of ER-to-Golgi trafficking defects, glycosylation defects, and mislocalization of the late Golgi resident protein Kex2p to the vacuole. Similarly, cog3-202 strains exhibited Kex2p localization defects; however, this class of mutants exhibited near normal growth at the nonpermissive temperature. In this study, we wished to focus on the role of COG3 in trafficking events distal to the ER-to-Golgi trafficking step. We hypothesized that the cog3-202 allele may be nearly normal for ER-to-Golgi trafficking while exhibiting the other defects and thus would be a useful tool for this analysis. We therefore analyzed the rate of invertase secretion and glycosylation in wild type, cog3-201, and cog3-202 cells at the nonpermissive temperature by immunoprecipitating invertase from internal and external (secreted) fractions after a 10-min pulse and 0- and 30-min chase (Fig. 1). As observed previously, the cog3-201 mutant exhibited both severe glycosylation defects and a pronounced delay in secretion. The cog3-202 mutant also exhibited a severe glycosylation defect, but invertase in this strain was secreted at near wild type levels at the two time points. These results are consistent with the near normal rates of trafficking of CPY and Kex2p through the early secretory pathway in cog3-202 mutants (33Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both cog3 alleles appear to exhibit a defect in elaboration of the core-glycosylated form of invertase that is dependent on Golgi-localized mannosyltransferases (43Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although glycosylation defects in cog3 mutants have been noted previously (31Suvorova E.S. Duden R. Lupashin V.V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the data in Fig. 1 rules out that a block in ER-to-Golgi transport causes the glycosylation defect in cog3-202 cells and suggests instead that a defect in the Golgi glycosylation machinery is the root cause. Multiple Golgi Membrane Proteins Are Mislocalized in cog3-202 Mutant Cells—The dramatic glycosylation defects and relatively normal anterograde transport through the secretory pathway in cog3-202 cells suggested that Cog3p is required to maintain the activity of one or more glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus. We therefore analyzed the localization in wild type and cog3-202 cells of two enzymes involved in Golgi glycosylation, α1,6-mannosyltransferase (Och1p) and α1,3-mannosyltransferase (Mnn1p). Both proteins were tagged with the HA epitope to facilitate detection. Och1-HA has been shown to exhibit localization and cycling patterns that are indistinguishable from wild type Och1p (21Harris S.L. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Likewise, MnnI-HA exhibits localization similar to that of wild type Mnn1p (16Lussier M. Sdicu A. Ketela T. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Localization of Och1-HA and MnnI-HA by immunofluorescence microscopy in wild type cells revealed cytoplasmic, punctate staining patterns (Fig. 2) as observed previously for Och1-HA and MnnI-HA (16Lussier M. Sdicu A. Ketela T. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 44Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000;"

The wbpA gene that encodes this enzyme was cloned into pET-28a, overexpressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein, and purified by nickel chelation chromatography. Capillary electrophoresis was used to examine substrate conversion by WbpA, and the data revealed that WbpA is a UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 6-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.136), which uses NAD+ as a coenzyme. The enzyme reaction product was purified by HPLC and analyzed using NMR spectroscopy. Our results showed unequivocally that the product of the WbpA reaction is UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminuronic acid. WbpA requires either NH4+ or K+ for activity and the accompanying anions exert secondary effects on activity consistent with their ranking in the Hofmeister series. Kinetic analysis showed positive cooperativity with respect to UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine binding with a K0.5 of 94 μm, a kcat of 86 min–1, and a Hill coefficient of 1.8. In addition, WbpA has a K0.5 for NAD+ of 220 μm, a kcat of 86 min–1, and a Hill coefficient of 1.1. The oligomerization state of WbpA was analyzed by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation, with all three techniques indicating that WbpA exists as a trimer in solution. However, tertiary structure predictions suggested a tetramer, which was supported by data from transmission electron microscopy. The electron micrograph of negatively stained WbpA samples revealed structures with 4-fold symmetry.

The B-band O antigen is an important virulence factor for evasion of host defenses and confers resistance to phagocytosis and serum-mediated killing (1Hancock R.E. Mutharia L.M. Chan L. Darveau R.P.

The B-band O antigen of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (serotype O5) contains a trisaccharide repeating unit composed of 2-acetamido-3-acetamidino-2,3-dideoxy-β-d-mannuronic acid, 2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-β-d-mannuronic acid, and N-acetyl-α-d-fucosamine (8Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar). These three sugar residues are postulated to be synthesized from the common precursor UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (UDP-d-GlcNAc) (9Burrows L.L. Charter D.F. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the initial steps in the biosynthesis of the fucosamine moiety have previously been described (10Creuzenet C. Schur M.J.

N-Acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid residues are present in both the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) of Escherichia coli and the polysaccharide capsule of Staphylococcus aureus, and the biosynthesis of the nucleotide-activated precursor to these molecules, UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid (UDP-d-ManNAcA), is synthesized from UDP-d-GlcNAc via a two-step pathway. In the first step, WecB (E. coli) or Cap5P (S. aureus) catalyze a C-2 epimerization to form UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (UDP-d-ManNAc), and in the second step, WecC (E. coli) or Cap5O (S. aureus) catalyze a C-6 dehydrogenation to form UDP-d-ManNAcA (12Meier-Dieter U. Starman R. Barr K. Mayer H. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13490-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kiser K.B. Bhasin N. Deng L. Lee J.C. J.

WbpA and WbpI of P. aeruginosa are essential for B-band O-antigen biosynthesis, since wbpA and wbpI knockout mutants are devoid of B-band polysaccharide and produce rough LPS (15Burrows L.L. Pigeon K.E. Lam J.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 135-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously proposed that biosynthesis of the mannosaminuronic acid-derived residues of P. aeruginosa would follow a similar pathway to UDP-d-ManNAcA biosynthesis based on ∼50% amino acid similarity between WecB and WbpI, and between WecC and WbpA (9Burrows L.L. Charter D.F. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Burrows L.L. Pigeon K.E. Lam J.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 135-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current investigation of the activity of WbpA was prompted by the inability of wbpI and wbpA to complement wecB and wecC knockout mutants (15Burrows L.L. Pigeon K.E. Lam J.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 135-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, di-N-acetylated sugars have also been found to be constituents of LPS in other bacterial pathogens, including Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertusis, causative agents of whooping cough, and Bordetella bronchiseptica, which causes upper respiratory tract infections in animals (16Preston A. Allen A.G. Cadisch J. Thomas R. Stevens K. Churcher C.M. Badcock K.L. Parkhill J. Barrell B. Maskell D.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that WbpA (PA3159, Pseudomonas genome data base www.pseudomonas.com) is a 50.3 kDa protein that catalyzes a C-6 dehydrogenation reaction, but its activity differs from that of Cap5O and WecC in that it uses UDP-d-GlcNAc as a substrate instead of UDP-d-ManNAc. Furthermore, we propose that this represents the first step in a common pathway for the biosynthesis of di-N-acetylated hexosaminuronic acid sugar nucleotides. Materials—UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (UDP-d-GalNAc), UDP-d-glucose, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, kanamycin, and gel filtration molecular weight standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Ribonuclease A, carbonic anhydrase II, and β-lactoglobulin A standards were obtained from Beckman Coulter, Inc. (Fullerton, CA). HiTrap chelating HP columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Baie d'Urfè, PQ), and Econo-Pac High Q columns were from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, ON, Canada). The pET-28a plasmid and E. coli BL21(DE3) expression strain were from Novagen (Madison, WI).

Cloning and Overexpression of His6-WbpA—wbpA was cloned into the pET-28a expression vector with a N-terminal histidine tag. wbpA was amplified from genomic DNA (P. aeruginosa strain PAO1) by PCR using the following primers: forward primer 5′-GTTGGCATATGATAGATGTTAACAC-3′, which incorporates an NdeI restriction digestion site; reverse primer 5′-GGGACTCGAGATCAAGCCTTG ATG-3′, which incorporates a XhoI restriction digestion site. The PCR reaction consisted of 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μm of each primer, 2.5 mm of each dNTP, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1× buffer. A 5-min denaturation was carried out before the addition of 2.5 units of Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science), followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C and 1 min at 72 °C. A final elongation step of 7 min at 72 °C was performed. Both the PCR product and the pET-28a vector were digested with NdeI and XhoI, purified using UltraClean™ 15 (Mo Bio Laboratories, Solana Beach, CA), and ligated overnight at 15 °C using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The construct obtained, pCQW14, was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing, and subsequently transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3), using kanamycin (50 μgml–1) for selection. For the expression of His6-WbpA, 250 ml of LB broth containing kanamycin was inoculated with 6 ml of an overnight culture, and grown at 37 °C. When OD600 nm reached 0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and expression was allowed to proceed for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and pellets were stored at –20 °C. Purification of WbpA—The pellet from 250 ml of induced culture was resuspended in 25 ml of binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm sodium chloride). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication on ice, and cell debris and membrane fractions were removed by ultracentrifugation at 175,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Purification using the HiTrap chelating HP column was performed as recommended by the manufacturer, with nickel as the chelating ion, and binding buffer containing 200 mm imidazole as the eluent. Following purification, the concentration of sodium chloride and imidazole in purified WbpA was reduced to 100 and 5 mm, respectively, using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfè, PQ) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The purity of WbpA was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and purified WbpA was stored at –20 °C after the addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 25%. Determination of pI by Capillary Electrophoresis Isoelectric Focusing (CE-IEF)—CE-IEF analyses were performed using a P/ACE MDQ Glycoprotein System with UV detection (280 nm) and the cIEF 3–10 Kit (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The anode and cathode electrolyte solutions (91 mm phosphoric acid and 20 mm sodium hydroxide, respectively) were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer, and the capillary was a 27-cm eCAP™ neutral capillary with a detector at 17 cm. Each run included 13.2 μg of sample and ribonuclease A (pI 9.45), carbonic anhydrase II (pI 5.9), and β-lactoglobulin A (pI 5.1) as standards, and was performed according to the standard separation conditions, except that an additional desalting step of 5.4 kV for 2 min was added prior to focusing. Analysis of electropherograms was done using the Beckman 32 Karat™ Software, and experimental pI values were determined in each case from a curve of the three standards. Determination of pH and Temperature Optima—All reactions contained 1 mm UDP-d-GlcNAc and 2.5 mm NAD+. For determination of the pH optimum, reactions contained 2 μg of enzyme and 100 mm ammonium sulfate in a reaction volume of 200 μl and were performed in 100 mm MES buffer at pH 5, 5.5, 6, and 6.5; and in 100 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer at pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, and 10. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and the progress of the reactions was monitored at A340 in a BMG FLUOstar Optima spectrophotometer (BMG LabTechnologies, Durham, NC). Subsequently, the concentration of NADH produced was determined with the use of a standard curve prepared by measuring A340 at various concentrations of NADH. For the temperature study, reactions contained 0.35 μg of enzyme, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm ammonium sulfate in a reaction volume of 35 μl and were incubated at 0, 15, 20, 30, 37, 42, 55, or 65 °C. Percent substrate conversion for the temperature study was determined by CE. Analysis of Cofactor Requirements of WbpA—All reactions contained 2 μg of enzyme in a reaction volume of 200 μl, 1 mm UDP-d-GlcNAc, 2.5 mm NAD+, and 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Salt dependence series reactions contained 100 mm of each of the salts listed in Table II, and salt concentration series reactions contained varying concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and the concentration of NADH produced was determined spectrophotometrically in the same manner as the pH study described above.Table IIEffect of cations and anions of the various salts on the initial rate (pmol/min) of WbpA reactions using UDP-d-GlcNAc and NAD+ as substratesInitial rate← Kosmotropic (stabilizing)Chaotropic (destabilizing) →F-PO43−SO42−CH3COO-Cl-Br-I-SCN-pmol/min(CH3)4N+NDaND, not determined.ND0NDND0NDND(CH3)2NH2+0000000ND↑NH4+1910 ± 902650 ± 702400 ± 1002230 ± 902140 ± 301940 ± 3041.9 ± 10.60StabilizingK+365 ± 501070 ± 40434 ± 82274 ± 28153 ± 9113 ± 300↑Na+00000000a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Determination of Kinetic Parameters—All reactions contained 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 1.7 μg of enzyme in a final volume of 170 μl. For determination of kinetic parameters for UDP-d-GlcNAc, reactions contained 3 mm NAD+ and concentrations of UDP-d-GlcNAc that varied from 0.025 to 1.5 mm. For determination of kinetic parameters for NAD+, reactions contained 1.5 mm UDP-d-Glc-NAc and concentrations of NAD+ that varied from 0.05 to 3 mm. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and the progress of the reactions was followed by measuring at A340 in a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA). Subsequently, the concentration of NADH produced was determined from A340 measurements and ϵ340 = 6,220 m–1 cm–1. The data were fitted to the Hill equation (Equation 1), and kinetic parameters were determined by linear regression from Lineweaver-Burk plots (1/v0versus 1/[S]h). The Hill coefficient, h, was determined from Hill plots (log[v0/(Vmax – v0)] versus log([S])). The results are the average of three experiments. ν0=Vmax[S]h(K0.5)h+[S]h(Eq. 1) Analysis of the Reaction Products by Capillary Electrophoresis—CE analyses were performed using a P/ACE MDQ Glycoprotein System (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) with UV detection. The running buffer was 25 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.5, and the capillary was bare silica 75 μm × 50 cm with a detector at 40 cm. The capillary was conditioned before each run by washing with 0.2 m sodium hydroxide for 2 min, water for 2 min, and running buffer for 2 min. Samples were introduced by pressure injection for 8 s, and the separation was performed at 22 kV and monitored by measuring UV absorbance at 254 nm. Peak integration was done using the Beckman 32 Karat™ Software. Purification of the WbpA Reaction Product—A preparative scale enzymatic reaction containing 35 μmol of UDP-d-GlcNAc, 77 μmol NAD+, and 2.5 mg of purified WbpA was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate and 50 mm bis-Tris-propane (pH 10). Protein was subsequently removed from the completed reaction by ultrafiltration through a Centriplus YM-3 cartridge (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The WbpA reaction product was purified by anion-exchange FPLC, using an Econo-Pac High Q anion exchange column and a linear gradient of 0–500 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). Fractions containing the WbpA reaction product were pooled, and the triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer was removed by addition of AG 50W-X4 resin (Bio-Rad) until the pH reached 4.5, followed by filtration to remove the resin. After adjusting the pH to 7.0 by addition of triethylamine, the pooled fractions were then lyophilized and analyzed by NMR. NMR Analysis of the WbpA Reaction Product—All spectra were acquired using a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Z-gradient 3 mm triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P) probe. The lyophilized sugar nucleotide sample was dissolved in 140 μl of D2O. The experiments were performed at 25 °C with suppression of the HOD (deuterated water) signal at 4.78 ppm. The methyl resonance of acetone was used as an internal reference at δH 2.225 ppm and δC 31.07 ppm. External 85% phosphoric acid was used for the 31P chemical shift reference (0 ppm). Standard sequences from Varian, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and 31P HMQC and selective 1D-TOCSY experiments were used for assignments (19Koplin R. Brisson J.R. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4121-4128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

NMR Spectroscopy of Glycoconjugates. Wiley-VCH, Weinhem2002: 59-93Crossref Google Scholar). Size-Exclusion HPLC Analysis—The molecular weight of WbpA in aqueous solution was determined with the use of a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfè, PQ) with a solvent of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mm sodium chloride. The column was calibrated with carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa) as standards. A calibration curve was plotted as the log (MW) versus [–log(Kav)]1/2, giving correlation values between 0.96 and 0.99. After calibration and equilibration of the column with solvent, 100 μl of WbpA (1.1 mg ml–1) was injected. For each of the standards and WbpA samples, the average distribution coefficient, Kav, was calculated from the elution volume, Ve, where Kav = (Ve – V0)/(Vt – V0). V0 is the column void volume, and Vt is the column total bed volume. The molecular mass of WbpA was subsequently determined from the calibration curve. Dynamic Light Scattering—The hydrodynamic radius of WbpA was measured by dynamic light scattering in a DynaPro instrument with Dynamics software (Protein Solutions, Lakewood, NJ). WbpA was measured at a concentration of 73 μg ml–1 at room temperature in buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 25% glycerol (v/v). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of WbpA—TEM experiments were performed as described previously (22Lam J.S. Lam M.Y. MacDonald L.A. Hancock R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3531-3538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The copper grids were floated on a drop of 10 μg ml–1 WbpA, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 without pre-wetting the grid, and then floated on 1.0% (w/v) uranyl acetate (pH 4.5; Fisher Scientific Ltd.) for 20 s. Samples were then examined with a Phillips EM 400 transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Structural Prediction for WbpA—Three-dimensional structure models for WbpA were generated using both the 3D-PSSM fold recognition server (23Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) (sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm) and the SWISS-MODEL comparative protein-modeling server (swissmodel.expasy.org/). Structural models were superimposed with known crystal structures using the program ProSup (24Lackner P. Koppensteiner W.A. Sippl M.J. Domingues F.S. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (lore.came.sbg.ac.at:8080/CAME/CAME_EXTERN/PROSUP/). All models and protein structures were visualized using RasMol (25Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar) (www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/). Amino acid alignments were performed using the program ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of WbpA—WbpA was expressed to high levels using the pET expression system and E. coli BL21(DE3) expression host cells, and ∼80% of expressed WbpA was soluble (Fig. 1). Typically, 7.7 mg of highly purified WbpA (>98% pure, as estimated from the SDS-PAGE gel) could be obtained from 250 ml of culture. The apparent molecular mass of WbpA (50.4 kDa) as determined from SDS-PAGE correlates well with the predicted molecular mass of 50.3 kDa. CE-IEF analysis of WbpA performed without the desalting step showed several species with pI values ranging from 5.18 to 7.71 (Fig. 2B). When the desalting step was added, WbpA appeared as one species with an apparent pI of 5.5 (Fig. 2A), which is slightly lower than the predicted pI of 5.8.Fig. 2CE-IEF analysis of WbpA. Experimental pI values were determined in each case from a curve of three standards: ribonuclease A (pI 9.45), carbonic anhydrase II (pI 5.9), and β-lactoglobulin A (pI 5.1).

The product peak at 11 min was identified to be NADH by comparison to an NADH standard, while the product peak at 13 min was subsequently identified as UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminuronic acid (UDP-d-GlcNAcA) by NMR analysis (see below). Further analysis showed that 2 mol of NAD+ were consumed for every mole of UDP-d-GlcNAc catalyzed, and 2 mol of NADH were produced for every mole of UDP-d-GlcNAcA produced. Reactions carried out at pH 7.5 revealed 84% conversion of UDP-d-GlcNAc while reactions carried out at pH 8.5 revealed ≥ 98% conversion. Reactions carried out at pH 7.5 with UDP-d-glucose, UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, or UDP-d-galactose as substrates failed to show any conversion, demonstrating the preference for UDP-d-GlcNAc as its substrate. Identification of Reaction Product by NMR—The 1H spectrum is presented in Fig. 4A. Proton assignments were made using COSY and TOCSY experiments. From the one-dimensional selective TOCSY experiment on the anomeric sugar resonance and the proton spectrum, accurate proton coupling constants could be obtained (Fig. 4B). A J1,2 value of 3.2 Hz and large J2,3, J3,4, and J4,5 values of 10.5, 9.1, and 10.1 Hz, respectively, indicated an α-glucopyranose configuration. From the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 4D) the protonated carbons were assigned. From the HMBC spectrum, the quaternary carbon at C-6 and the NAc-C=O resonances were assigned. The 1H and 13C chemical shifts are given in Table I. The 31P HMQC spectrum (Fig. 4C) indicated the correlations to the pyrophosphate group with 31P chemical shifts at –10.5 (Pα) and –12.1 ppm (P). From the 1H spectrum JPβ, H1 was found to be 7.6 Hz, and JPβ, H2 was 2.8 Hz. The H,13C chemical shifts for the UDP moiety were similar to those previously reported (19Koplin R. Brisson J.R. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4121-4128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results provided the evidence that the structure of the WbpA enzyme-substrate reaction product is UDP-d-GlcNAcA.Table INMR data for UDP-d-GlcNAcAUnit1H and 13C chemical shiftsH-1H-2H-3H-4H-5H-6NAc-CH3NAc-C=OC-1C-2C-3C-4C-5C-6ppmGlcNAcA5.5264.0253.8193.5884.1692.08095.054.571.573.074.0177.122.8175.7Ribose5.9884.3704.3704.2804.2284.169aCH2 group.89.174.870.784.266.0Uracyl5.9707.960103.6142.5a CH2 group. Open table in a new tab Determination of Physical Parameters by CE—WbpA is able to catalyze the conversion of UDP-d-GlcNAc over a wide pH range, with an optimum pH between 8.0 and 9.0 (data not shown). WbpA is active at temperatures ranging from near 0 to 65 °C, with maximum activity between 33 and 37 °C (data not shown). The activity of WbpA can be maintained by storage in 25% glycerol at –20 °C for more than 3 months. Analysis of Cofactor Requirements of WbpA—WbpA is able to catalyze the conversion of UDP-d-GlcNAc in the presence of ammonium and potassium salts, but no significant conversion is observed in the presence of tetramethylammonium, dimethylammonium, or sodium salts (Table II). The initial rate values are highest when the accompanying anion is kosmotropic, and lowest when the accompanying anion is chaotropic, with a strong correlation between initial rate and the placement of the anion within the Hofmeister series (27Collins K.D. Washabaugh M.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 323-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The concentration of ammonium sulfate has a different effect on initial rate than on overall substrate conversion. An increase in ammonium sulfate concentration correlates with an increase in the initial rate (Fig. 5). Similarly, overall substrate conversion (as measured at 250 min) increases as ammonium sulfate concentration increases, up to a level of 50 mm. Above this level, however, as the concentration of ammonium sulfate increases, the overall substrate conversion decreases. Determination of Kinetic Parameters of WbpA—While the data from experiments with UDP-d-GlcNAc as the variable substrate and NAD+ as the fixed substrate fit reasonably well to the Michaelis-Menten model when analyzed by non-linear curve fitting, Eadie-Scatchard plots of the same data showed a convex curve indicative of positive cooperativity (data not shown). As a result, the data were fitted to the Hill equation (Fig. 6A), and the steady-state kinetic parameters are listed in Table III. Subsequently, Hill plots of the UDP-d-GlcNAc rate data revealed a Hill coefficient of 1.8 (Fig. 6B). Kinetic analysis of experiments with NAD+ as the variable substrate (and UDP-d-GlcNAc fixed) showed near-Michaelis-Menten behavior, with a Hill coefficient of 1.1. In all cases, kinetic parameters were determined by linear regression (R2 ≥ 0.99) from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The data were also analyzed from Eadie-Scatchard and Hanes plots with similar results.Table IIIKinetic parameters for WbpA determined spectrophotometricallyK0.5haHill coefficients determined from Hill plots (log[v0/(Vmax - v0)] versus log([S])).

The attractant and repellent signals are sensed by growth cones at the tips of axons and cause the axons to undergo extension in a directional manner. Several lines of evidence suggest that members of Rho family GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, direct the axonal extension by reorganizing the growth cone actin cytoskeleton (3Narumiya S. Ishizaki T.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2055-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The one or more downstream signaling pathways that couple ERK to neurite outgrowth, however, have not yet been clarified. A candidate for signaling downstream of ERK would be the lipid-metabolizing enzyme, phospholipase D2 (PLD2). PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine to produce the pleiotropic signaling lipid messenger phosphatidic acid (PA). The mammalian PLD family consists of two related gene products, PLD1 and PLD2 (17Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J.

PLD1 is directly regulated by classic protein kinase C and members of the ADP-ribosylation factor and Rho family small GTPases in conjunction with polyphosphoinositides, PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (17Hammond S.M.

This PLD isozyme appears to play substantial roles in a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways, membrane vesicle trafficking, and exocytosis (19Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M.

Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast to PLD1, little is known regarding the physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms of PLD2, which is constitutively active in the presence of polyphosphoinositides and is fundamentally insensitive to PLD1 activators in vitro (18Colley W. Sung T. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A. Frohman M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). We previously reported that PLD2, but not PLD1, translocates to actin-based membrane ruffles produced by epidermal growth factor stimulation of HeLa cells (23Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), indicating that PLD2, possibly through its product PA, is involved in membrane dynamics. Actin-based membrane dynamics in the growth cone is also a critical event for neurite outgrowth in response to chemoattractants (24Dickson B.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings led us to speculate that PLD2 is involved in the mechanisms of neurite remodeling. This hypothesis is supported by the report that PLD2 mRNA levels increase strikingly in dentate granule cells in the pre-natal hippocampus and the granule cell layer in cerebellum at early post-natal life (25Colley W.C. Altshuller Y.M. Sue-Ling C.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Branch K.D. Tsirka S.E. Bollag R.J. Bollag W.B. Frohman M.A. Biochem.

Developmental Neurobiology. 3rd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, Parmentier et al. (28Parmentier J.H. Muthalif M.M. Saeed A.E. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15704-15711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have reported that PLD2 activation through norepinephrine stimulation of rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells is dependent upon ERK activation. These reports prompted us to investigate whether PLD2 serves as a signal-transducing enzyme downstream of ERK in neurite outgrowth. Since PC12 cells have been well established as a model system in which ERK plays a crucial role in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 30Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar), we established PC12 cell clones that inducibly express wild type (WT) and lipase-deficient (LD) mutants of PLD1 and PLD2. Here we show that PLD2, but not PLD1, is involved in NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. PLD2 activity is up-regulated by ERK upon stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF, and we show that this is functionally critical. These results provide evidence that PLD2 is a novel signaling molecule in the pathway that mediates signaling from ERK to neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Plasmids and Antibodies—cDNAs for WT-PLD1 and -PLD2 and their LD mutants were constructed as described previously (32Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pTRE vector (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) to establish PC12 cell clones in which these proteins can be inducibly expressed. To transiently express WT-PLD2 in PC12 cells, the cDNA for WT-PLD2 was subcloned into pCGN (pCGN-WT-PLD2) (32Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for a constitutively active form of MAP kinase-ERK kinase (MEK-CA), pSRα-HA-MEK-CA, was a generous gift of Dr. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Japan). The expression plasmid for an green fluorescent protein (GFP), pEGFP-N3, was purchased from Clontech Laboratories. A rabbit polyclonal anti-PLD D4 antibody that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 was raised against the bacterial recombinant peptide corresponding to amino acids 714-1074 of PLD1 and then affinity-purified. A rat monoclonal anti-mouse PLD2 411A antibody that specifically recognizes mouse PLD2 was generated by a rat medial iliac lymph node method (33Kishiro Y. Kagawa M. Naito I. Sado Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In brief, WKY/NCrj rats were immunized with 0.2 mg of a bacterial recombinant peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-533 of mouse PLD2. After 3 weeks, the lymph node-derived lymphocytes were fused with SP2/O myeromas. The hybridoma clones that produce the anti-mouse PLD2 antibody were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. The following antibodies and probes were purchased from commercial sources: anti-ERK2 D-2 and -phosphorylated ERK E-4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); rat anti-HA 3F10 antibody (Roche Applied Science, Tokyo, Japan); anti-GFP antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan); horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL); HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA); and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Establishment of PC12 Clonal Cell Lines and Cell Culture—pTRE plasmids (40 μg each) encoding WT- and LD-PLD isozymes were cotransfected with 2 μg of pTK-Hyg (Clontech) into the PC12 Tet-Off cell line (Clontech) by electroporation. Selection was performed in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 100 μg/ml G418, 200 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 2 μg/ml doxycycline. Colonies were recovered and cultured in medium A consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 100 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 3 days. The expression levels of PLDs in the membrane fraction (20 μg of protein) were analyzed by Western blotting. Transfectant clones exhibiting a substantial tetracycline response were selected and maintained in medium A in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline. To assess neurite outgrowth, PC12 clonal cells were cultured on Type I collagen-coated coverslips for 2 days in medium A, followed by further culture for 1 day in medium B consisting of DMEM supplemented with 1% horse serum, 100 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B in the presence or absence of doxycycline, unless otherwise mentioned. In most experiments in which PLD activity was assayed, the PC12 clonal cells were cultured for 3 days in medium A with or without doxycycline on Type I collagen-coated dishes (IWAKI, Chiba, Japan). Transient Expression of MEK-CA and PLD2—In the experiment for inhibition of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by transiently expressed LD-PLD2, PC12 parental cells were transfected with pEGFP-N3 or pCGN-LD-PLD2 using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), followed by 1 day of culture in medium A. To investigate the effects of WT- and LD-PLD2 on MEK-CA-induced neurite outgrowth, MEK-CA was transiently expressed in PC12 clonal cell lines. WT- and LD-PLD2 were inducibly expressed in these PC12 cells by culturing them in the absence of doxycycline for 2 days. Non-induced controls were cultured in the presence of doxycycline. These PC12 clones were transfected with pSRα-HA-MEK-CA using LipofectAMINE Plus. Cells were further incubated for 1 day in the absence or presence of doxycycline and alcohols in medium B, and neurite outgrowth was then assessed. In the MEKCA-dependent PLD2 activation experiments (Fig. 7), parental PC12 cells were transfected with pCGN-WT-PLD2 and/or pSRα-HA-MEK-CA using LipofectAMINE Plus followed by 1 day of culture in medium A. Assay for PLD Activity—PLD activity was assessed by measuring accumulation of the unambiguous PLD activity marker [32P]phosphatidylethanol ([32P]PEt), which is generated in the presence of ethanol. PC12 clonal cells cultured for 3 days in medium A with or without doxycycline, or parental cells transiently expressing WT-PLD2 and/or MEK-CA, were labeled with 25 μCi/ml [32P]Pi at 37 °C for 1.5 h in Pi-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After being washed, the labeled cells were incubated without or with 50 ng/ml NGF (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) in the presence of 1% ethanol at 37 °C for 30 min. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43093) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:35:6 by volume). The [32P]PEt produced was analyzed by a BAS2000 Bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) and expressed as a percentage of total [32P]phospholipids. The data are represented as the mean ± difference of duplicate determinations representative of at least three independent experiments with similar results. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as previously reported with minor modification (35Watanabe H. Yamazaki M. Miyazaki H. Arikawa C. Itoh K. Sasaki T. Maehama T. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution, and then with HRP-conjugated second antibodies in blocking solution containing 0.2% SDS and 2% Nonidet P-40. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with an ECL immunoblotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—After being treated as described in the figure legends, PC12 cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as previously reported (23Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice for 30 min. After permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% Tween 20, cells were blocked with 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS, incubated with primary antibodies in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (1:200 dilution) or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution). F-actin was stained with rhodamine phalloidin (1:1000 dilution). Cells were imaged using an Axiovert S100 Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). Intracellular localization of overexpressed WT-PLD2 in PC12 cells was determined using a confocal scanner unit CSU21 (Yokogawa Electric Co., Tokyo, Japan) added to the fluorescence microscope. Assay of Neurite Outgrowth—One hundred cells in randomly chosen fields on each coverslip were manually scored by several investigators in a blinded manner. Neurite length was described as the distance between the cell periphery and the tip of neurite, and total length of multiple neurites per cell was calculated. Unless otherwise mentioned, results were represented as the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments, and statistical significance was evaluated using double-tailed Student's t test. Involvement of PLD2 in NGF-induced Neurite Outgrowth of PC12 Cells—To begin examining the potential involvement of PLD in NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth, we established PC12 clonal cell lines that inducibly express WT- and LD-PLD1 and -PLD2. We obtained two clonal cell lines that inducibly express WT-PLD2 to different levels (Fig. 1A). Upon PLD2 induction, clone 8, which exhibited the higher level of inducible WT-PLD2 expression, flattened and extended a limited number of short neurites despite the absence of NGF stimulation, whereas clone 11, which expressed less WT-PLD2, remained spherical with protrusions slightly longer than those observed in non-induced cells (Fig. 1B). These protrusions did not extend into neurites, even if the culture period was prolonged further (data not shown). NGF stimulation for 1 day in the absence of PLD2 induction similarly resulted in formation of relatively short neurites (Fig. 1C, top row). Upon PLD2 induction, however, NGF stimulation for 1 day elicited formation of extremely elongated neurites (Fig. 1C, bottom row). Neurites continued to extend in length in control cells treated with NGF over a 6-day period (Fig. 1D). At each time point examined, the neurites in PLD2-induced cells were longer than those in control cells. In contrast to the exaggeration of neurite length, neither neurite number per cell nor neurite branching were affected by WTPLD2 induction (data not shown). Basal activity of PLD increased in a WT-PLD2 expression level-dependent fashion and NGF stimulation further increased the activity (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that NGF receptor signaling is coupled to PLD2 activation. These findings suggested that PLD2 enzymatic activation could be involved in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The results observed with PLD2 induction could also reflect its functioning as a scaffolding molecule or nonspecific sequestration of signaling components. To investigate whether the enhancement by PLD2 of the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth depends upon its lipase activity, the consequence of inducing an inactive PLD2 allele (LD-PLD2) was examined (Fig. 2). LD-PLD2 was inducibly expressed by 3- to 5-fold over endogenous PLD2 (Fig. 2A). Induction of LD-PLD2 expression slightly but significantly suppressed both basal and NGF-stimulated PLD activation (Fig. 2B). NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was also inhibited by induction of LD-PLD2 (Fig. 2, C and D). Suppression of the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by LDPLD2 was additionally demonstrated using transient expression to rule out long term effects of low level LD-PLD2 expression on the clonal cell line as a possible explanation (Fig. 2, E and F). Neurite number per cell and neurite branching were not affected by LD-PLD2 expression (data not shown), again suggesting that PLD2 is involved in neurite elongation but not neurite initiation. The observation that the inactive PLD2 allele did not promote exaggerated neurite extension demonstrates that the facilitation of exaggerated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by wild-type PLD2 requires its lipase activity. The observation that the inactive PLD2 allele significantly suppressed neurite growth in comparison to control cells further suggested that endogenous PLD2 participates in neurite extension. There are two PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2. To evaluate whether stimulation of the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth is specific to PLD2, we examined PC12 cell clonal cell lines that inducibly expressed WT- and LD-PLD1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast to PLD2, inducible expression of WT- and LD-PLD1 was without effect on the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and on basal and NGF-stimulated PLD activities (Fig. 3, B and C). These results, taken together with the observations described above, led us to conclude that PLD2, but not PLD1, plays a role in the NGF-triggered neurite extension. The potential involvement of endogenous PLD2 was further explored by examining the consequence of pharmacological suppression of PLD-catalyzed PA production on control and induced cells (Fig. 4). Because NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was exaggerated similarly by WT-PLD2 expression in clones 8 and 11 (Fig. 1D), only clone 11 was used in further studies. When the cells were incubated with 1-butanol, which prevents PLD-catalyzed PA production by preferentially inducing PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation (production of phosphatidylbutanol), NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in both control and PLD2-expressing cells was suppressed (Fig. 4A). In contrast, 2-butanol, which cannot be used as a substrate for PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation, instead stimulated NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4A). Alcohols can have many effects on cells, and we don't have a mechanistic explanation for how 2-butanol promotes neurite extension. Nevertheless, the 1-butanol-specific inhibition of neurite extension provides additional support for the hypothesis that signaling from PLD2 to NGF-induced neurite outgrowth is mediated by its product PA. PLD2 Mediates Signaling from ERK to Neurite Outgrowth—Activation of ERK is essential for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells (29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 30Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 31Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar), and ERK has previously been connected to PLD signaling in other contexts. However, the relationship between the ERK MAP kinase cascade and PLD2 activation remains unclear. In Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor, PLD2 activates the ERK MAP kinase pathway through the translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation (36Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, for PC12 cells and rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated by hydroxyperoxide and norepinephrine, respectively, PLD2 activation has been reported to be mediated by ERK (28Parmentier J.H. Muthalif M.M. Saeed A.E. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15704-15711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37Banno Y. Wang S. Ito Y. Izumi T. Nakashima S. Shimizu T. Nozawa Y. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2271-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to investigate whether PLD2 functions upstream or downstream of ERK in the NGF-induced neurite extension signaling pathway in PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, induction of WT- and LD-PLD2 expression did not affect NGF-induced ERK phosphorylation/activation, eliminating the possibility that PLD2 is an upstream signaling molecule for ERK in this setting. To address the possibility that PLD2 functions downstream of the ERK MAP kinase cascade, we employed the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059. As reported previously (29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar), the inhibitor completely suppresses NGF-induced ERK phosphorylation/activation (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the inhibitor blocked NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from control and PLD2-expressing cells (Fig. 6, B and C), and it suppressed NGF-stimulated PLD2 activation (Fig. 6D). The inhibition was not due to a direct effect of the inhibitor on PLD2, because it failed to suppress PLD2 activity as assessed using an in vitro system (data not shown). These results demonstrate that ERK directly or indirectly activates PLD2 and that ERK stimulation of PLD2 is required for neurite outgrowth. Finally, we employed the constitutively active MEK, MEKCA, to confirm the epistatic relationship of ERK and PLD2 using another approach. Transient co-expression of MEK-CA and WT-PLD2 into parental cells resulted in robust PLD2 activation (Fig. 7). Furthermore, neurite outgrowth stimulated by transient expression of MEK-CA was significantly enhanced by induction of WT-PLD2 expression (Fig. 8, A and B). In contrast, LD-PLD2 expression inhibited MEK-CA-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 8, A and B), as did suppression of PLD-mediated PA production by 1-butanol (Fig. 8, C and D). The inhibitory effect of 1-butanol was not attributable to direct inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade, because 1-butanol did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK under these conditions (data not shown). These results, taken together, provide unambiguous evidence that PLD2 activity is up-regulated by activation of ERK, which in turn enhances neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. PLD2 Co-localizes with F-actin in Growth Cones during Neurite Outgrowth—Because actin-based dynamic reorganization of the membrane in growth cones is one of critical events that takes place during chemoattractant-stimulated neurite outgrowth (24Dickson B.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar), we examined whether PLD2 and F-actin co-localize in the growth cone. Consistent with the report by Colley et al. (18Colley W. Sung T. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A. Frohman M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) with non-neuronal cells, inducibly expressed WT-PLD2 localized at the plasma membrane of soma in non-stimulated PC12 cells and co-localized with F-actin (Fig. 9). Interestingly, at 12 h after the initiation of NGF stimulation, PLD2 was found to be enriched at the growth cone where it again co-localized with F-actin (Fig. 9). These results suggest the possibility that the mechanism through which PLD2 signals to neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells involves actin cytoskeletal reorganization in the growth cone. The ERK MAP kinase cascade plays a crucial role in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells (29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 30Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 31Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). However, the downstream sequence of events that links ERK signaling to neurite outgrowth has remained poorly understood. In the present study, we provide unambiguous evidence that PLD2 functions as a downstream signaling molecule for ERK in this pathway, providing insight not only into the connection between ERK and neurite remodeling, but as well into the regulatory mechanisms that control PLD2 activation in physiological settings. We report here that PLD2 activation downstream of ERK is absolutely required for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Activation of PLD2 by itself, however, does not appear to suffice to maximally trigger neurite outgrowth. This conclusion is reached from the observations that overexpression of WT-PLD2 in the PC12 cell line clone 8, in which basal PLD activity was increased to a much greater extent than that observed for NGF-stimulated control cells, induced only limited neurite extension in the absence of NGF (Fig. 1, B and E) but then promoted profoundly exaggerated neurite outgrowth in the presence of NGF. Accordingly, it is likely that PLD2 signaling synergizes with other pathway(s) in parallel to fully promote neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. Recently, Harada et al. (40Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) have reported that the neuron-specific cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator p35 is induced by NGF stimulation of PC12 cells in an ERK-dependent manner and that p35 induction is essential but insufficient to drive NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. This report, taken together with the result shown in Fig. 8 that the MEK-induced neurite outgrowth was dramatically enhanced by co-expression of WT-PLD2, suggest that the pathway may branch downstream from ERK to activate both PLD2 and p35 in parallel. It would be of interest to investigate whether ERK-dependent p35 induction cooperates with PLD2 to induce neurite outgrowth. Alternatively, PLD2 may coordinate with other regulators known to be involved in controlling neurite outgrowth, such as protein kinase Cϵ (41Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lazarovici P. Petrovics G.

The mechanisms that control PLD2 activation in vivo are poorly understood in comparison to those that control PLD1 (17Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y.

Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that PLD2 activity is regulated by ERK in PC12 cells (Fig. 6). This conclusion is in agreement with reports by Parmentier et al. (28Parmentier J.H. Muthalif M.M. Saeed A.E. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15704-15711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Banno et al. (37Banno Y. Wang S. Ito Y. Izumi T. Nakashima S. Shimizu T. Nozawa Y. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2271-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) on norepinephrine-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells and hydroxyperoxide-stimulated PC12 cells, respectively. In contrast, Rizzo et al. (36Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) elegantly demonstrated in insulin-stimulated Rat-1 fibroblasts that PLD2 activates ERK MAP kinase, which is opposite to what we found for our NGF-stimulated PC12 cells (Fig. 5). This paradox suggests that the relationship between PLD2 and ERK MAP kinase signaling may depend upon the cell types and/or agonists under investigation. Is the activation of PLD2 by ERK direct or indirect? Because purified recombinant PLD2 cannot be activated and phosphorylated in vitro by immunologically precipitated ERK2 (which had been overexpressed in HeLa cells and activated by hydroxyperoxide stimulation, data not shown), it is likely that PLD2 activation by ERK is indirect. PLD2 activation may involve other signaling inputs as well, because the inhibition of the NGF-stimulated PLD2 activity by the PD MEK inhibitor was not complete (Fig. 6D). A key question raised by our findings concerns the molecular mechanisms through which PA produced by PLD2 regulates neurite outgrowth. In non-neuronal cells, PA regulates molecule(s) involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and membrane trafficking (45Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 46Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), both of which are essential events for neurite outgrowth. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton plays crucial roles in axonal outgrowth and guidance of primary cultured neurons (24Dickson B.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 42Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, actin filaments have been shown to accumulate in the growth cones at the tips of neurites during neuronal development (24Dickson B.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 47Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These findings lead us to speculate that PA enhances neurite outgrowth through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. This idea is supported by the observation that overexpressed WT-PLD2 in PC12 cells became enriched at the growth cone and colocalized there with F-actin (Fig. 9). In addition, overexpression of WT-PLD2 stimulated filopodia formation in the neurites themselves. 2H. Watanabe and Y. Kanaho, unpublished observation.

Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely, however, that PI4P 5-kinase is the key target signaling molecule of PA in the signaling pathway that regulates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, because PI(4,5)P2 levels of non-induced control cells and WT-PLD2-induced cells were indistinguishable and did not significantly change with NGF stimulation (data not shown). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that PI4P 5-kinase functions as a downstream effector for Rho/ROCK in lysophosphatidic acid-induced neurite retraction of N1E-115 cells (10Yamazaki M.

These data suggest that PA may regulate reorganization of actin cytoskeleton to extend neurites through one or more mechanisms independent of PI4P 5-kinase and of Rho/ROCK. Alternatively, PA may play a role in supplying membrane components to neurites by facilitating membrane trafficking, as has been demonstrated in non-neuronal cells where PA stimulates budding from the Golgi apparatus by recruiting the cytosolic COP protein β-COP (39Ktistakis N.T.

Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). These membrane glycoproteins, which mediate rapid chemical synaptic transmission, form either homo- or heteropentamers made up of homologous subunits that show significant similarities in amino acid sequence, transmembrane topology, and overall secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure, implying a common evolutionary origin (2Le Novere N. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.-P. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 3Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). AChRs, which are classified into muscle and neuronal types, are the best characterized members of the LGIC superfamily. Muscle-type AChRs, found at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction and in fish electric organ, have a fixed stoichiometry ((α1)2β1γδ in Torpedo and embryonic mammalian AChR or (α1)2β1ϵδ in adult mammalian AChR), mediate neuromuscular transmission, and are implicated in the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis. Neuronal AChRs, widely distributed in the pre-, post-, and peri-synaptic nerve terminals of the central and peripheral nervous system (4Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 5Clementi F. Fornasari D. Gotti C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), exist either as heteropentamers containing two or three α-subunits (α2–6) plus 2 or 3 β-subunits (β2–4) or as homopentamers (α7–9), with α7 being the only human subunit known to form a homopentamer (5Clementi F. Fornasari D. Gotti C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Neuronal AChRs play key roles in various neuron-neuron interactions and are therefore involved in many functions (reviewed in Ref. 5Clementi F. Fornasari D. Gotti C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) such as ganglionic transmission, modulation of the release of various neurotransmitters (γ-aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate, dopamine, and noradrenaline) (6Wonnacott S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), attention, learning, memory consolidation, arousal, sensory perception, the control of locomotor activity, pain perception, and body temperature regulation (7Gotti C. Fornasari D. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 53: 199-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). They are, thus, implicated in a number of serious neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, autism, and forms of epilepsy as well as nicotine addiction (8Lindstrom J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Because of this, neuronal AChRs have attracted much recent attention. The thorough understanding of AChR function and its manipulation for therapeutic approaches requires the elucidation of its structure at high resolution. Currently available structural information on AChRs has been mainly derived from elegant cryo-electron microscopy studies on two-dimensional crystals of Torpedo AChR, which can be purified in large amounts. Such studies on membrane-bound Torpedo AChRs have recently provided the 4.6- and 4-Å resolution structures, respectively, of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the AChR (9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol.

However, no x-ray structure of any AChR or any other LGIC has yet been obtained, although very small, non-diffracting three-dimensional crystals of Torpedo AChR have been reported (12Hertling-Jaweed S. Bandini G. Muller-Fahrnow A. Dommes V. Hucho F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Paas Y. Cartaud J. Recouvreur M. Grailhe R. Dufresne V. Pebay-Peyroula E.

Attempts by several investigators to obtain diffraction quality three-dimensional crystals of this large membrane protein have met with little success. The use of hydrophilic AChR polypeptide fragments, rather than full-length subunits, seems to be a more realistic approach to the expression of and structural studies on the AChR. The ECDs of AChR subunits, corresponding to the N-terminal ∼210 amino acids of the subunits (14Le Novere N. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2329-2345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), are involved in ligand binding and are therefore of high importance. The ECD of α-subunits bears the major loops contributing to the binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists (15Arias H.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 25: 133-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas loops from adjacent subunits also contribute to ligand binding (reviewed in Ref. 16Sine S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A functional α7·5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor chimera consisting of the α7 AChR ECD fused to 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (17Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) displayed typical α7 AChR pharmacology, showing the following: (a) that the N-terminal ECD and a complementary C-terminal domain can fold autonomously; and (b) that the α7-ECD contains all of the structural elements contributing to the neurotransmitter binding site. High-resolution structural analysis has been performed on the molluscan glial cell AChBP (18Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), a structural and functional homologue of the ECD of LGIC subunits. The AChBP forms a stable homopentamer and has 24% sequence similarity with human α7-ECD and less similarity with ECDs from all the subunits of other nicotinic receptors (20–24%) or other LGICs (15–18%). However, the high-resolution structure of a LGIC ECD is not yet available. The ECD of the α7 subunit, which is known to form homopentamers (19Drisdel R. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 133-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.-M. Hernandez M.-C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), seems to offer the most promising approach to the problem because it could provide a model of the whole (pentameric) ECD of an AChR.

In this study we expressed the human α7-ECD as a glycosylated form in the yeast P. pastoris (25Cereghino J.L. Cregg J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 45-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cregg J.M. Cereghino J.L. Shi J. Higgins D.R. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 16: 23-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), which has previously been used successfully in our laboratory to produce a glycosylated, soluble, and ligand- and antibody-binding human α1 ECD (27Psaridi-Linardaki L. Mamalaki A. Remoundos M. Tzartos S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26980-26986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The recombinant α7-ECD was found to be mainly in the form of microaggregates. By replacing the normally unpaired Cys-116 with serine and exchanging the hydrophobic Cys128–Cys142 loop with the corresponding hydrophilic Cys-loop of the AChBP, we obtained a protein, α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop), which was produced in quantities of ∼0.5 mg per liter of culture, was water-soluble, and existed as an oligomer with a size corresponding approximately to that of a pentamer. Both the glycosylated and the in vitro deglycosylated forms bound the specific ligand 125I-α-Bgt equally well and with high affinity, whereas binding was inhibited by unlabeled α-Bgt, d-tubocurarine, and nicotine. These results suggest that the double mutated protein, which seems to have a near native conformation and can be produced in satisfactory amounts, is a suitable material for high-resolution structural studies. pPICZαA-α7-ECD—cDNA coding for the N-terminal ECD of the human nicotinic AChR α7 subunit (amino acid residues 1–208) was enzymatically amplified by PCR from a full-length α7 cDNA clone (kindly provided by Dr. J. Lindstrom) (Fig.1A). The upstream (5′-GTTTATCCCCCGGGCGAGTTCCAG-3′) and downstream (5′-GCCATAGTCTAGAGTCCTGCGGCG-3′) primers were constructed to contain SmaI and XbaI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. Using appropriate restriction endonucleases, the purified PCR product of 648 bp was subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1B, section a). pPICZαA-α7-ECD(C116S)—The 59-base 5′-AATTCTTCTGGGCATTCCCAGTACCTGCCTCCAGGCATATTCAAGAGTTCCTGCTACAT-3′ and the 57-base 5′-CGATGTAGCAGGAACTCTTGAATATGCCTGGAGGCAGGTACTGGGAATGCCCAGAAG-3′ oligonucleotides were synthesized to be complementary to each other. These oligonucleotides contain a single nucleotide change (double underlined) resulting in replacement of the Cys at position 116 of the α7-ECD with Ser. An equimolar mixture of the two oligonucleotides was annealed, and the resultant double-stranded DNA bearing the EcoRI and ClaI sites at its ends was substituted for the corresponding fragment in pPICZαA-α7-ECD. (Fig. 1B, section b). pPICZαA-α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop)—The double mutant pPICZαA-α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop), containing the C116S mutation described above and the Cys loop from the AChBP, was constructed by two-step PCR (Fig. 1B, section c). In the first PCR, the 85-base forward primer 1 (Fw1 in Fig. 1B) (5′-CATATTCAAGAGTTCCTGCGACGTCTCTGGAGTCGACACTGAGTCTGGTGCGACGTGCAAACTGAAGTTTGGGTCCTGGTCTTAC-3′) encoded the Cys-loop region from the AChBP, whereas the 28-base reverse primer (Rev in Fig. 1B) (5′-GAGTTTCTGTTCTAGAGTCCTGCGGCGC-3′ contained an XbaI restriction site (underlined). A 271-bp product was produced using pPICZαA-α7-ECD as template. In the second PCR, the 271-bp product was extended 49 bases in the 5′-direction using the 74-base forward primer 2 (Fw2 in Fig. 1B) (5′-CTAACGTGTTGGTGAATTCTTCTGGGCATTCCCAGTACCTGCCTCCAGGCATATTCAAGAGTTCCTGCGACGTC-3′) containing an EcoRI site (underlined), the C116S mutation (double underlined), and 25 bases overlapping with the 5′-end of the first PCR product and the same reverse primer as in the first PCR. The purified 320-bp second PCR product, bearing both the C116S and the Cys-loop mutations, was introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the pPICZαA-α7-ECD. All DNA manipulations were performed as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The constructs were transformed into the X33 strain of P. pastoris by electroporation, and the transformed cells were selected on YPDS (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose, and 1 m sorbitol) plates supplemented with zeocin (100 μg/ml) after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. Protein Expression in P. pastoris—In pilot experiments, single colonies of transformed cells were used to inoculated 2.5 ml of BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10–5% (w/v) biotin, and 1% (v/v) glycerol). After 16–20 h of incubation at 30 °C, the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of BMMY medium (BMGY medium in which the glycerol was replaced by 0.5% (v/v) methanol) to induce expression. Over the next 4 days, induction was maintained with the daily addition of 0.5% (v/v) methanol, and the culture supernatants were tested for expression of the recombinant proteins by dot-blot analysis using the anti-Myc mAb 9E.10 (American Type Culture Collection). The clone with the highest protein yield was selected for medium scale protein expression in 2-liter flasks. In all subsequent preparations the cells were harvested at ∼24 h of methanol induction, as very little increase in the yield for any of the three products was seen after longer induction periods. First Stage Protein Purification—The culture supernatant was concentrated 10-fold by the addition of solid NH4(SO4)2 to 60% saturation in the presence of 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaF followed by overnight precipitation at 4 °C and dissolution of the pellet in the appropriate volume of distilled H2O. The concentrated protein solution was dialyzed against 50 mm PB, pH 8, and the recombinant protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Elution was performed stepwise under native conditions with 50 mm PB, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 50, 100, 150, or 1000 mm imidazole. The eluates were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blot analysis using either the anti-Myc mAb 9E.10 or rabbit polyclonal anti-α7 antibodies. Anti-α7 antibodies were produced by Dr. Leslie Jacobson in our laboratory by immunizing rabbits with either α7 synthetic peptide 176–212 (anti-α7 peptide polyclonal antibody) or Escherichia coli-expressed α7-ECD-(1–209) (anti-bacterial α7-ECD polyclonal antibody). The 100 mm imidazole eluate was used for in vitro deglycosylation, as the α7-ECD was eluted mainly at this fraction. Gel Filtration Chromatographic Analysis and Second Stage Purification—After high speed centrifugation (1 min at 13,000 rpm) and filtration through a 2.2-μm filter (Millipore), 1-ml samples of the Ni2+-purified α7-ECDs were analyzed on an ÄKTA 90 purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) using a 24-ml Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) and isocratic elution with 10 mm PB, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 0.5 ml fractions were collected and analyzed for 125I-α-Bgt binding. The protein concentration of the gel-filtered material was determined spectrophotometrically based on the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) and the protein content in aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr) and disulfide bonds (S–S) using the following formula: molarity = (A280 × dilution)/(5550Trp + 4910Tyr + 125 S–S) (29Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). 125I-α-Bgt Binding Tests—Various amounts of Ni2+-purified or gel filter-purified protein were incubated with 50,000 cpm 125I-α-Bgt at 4 °C, either for 1.5 h (α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop)) or overnight (α7-ECD or α7-ECD(C116S)) in a final volume of 50 μl of PB-BSA (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% BSA). The samples were then diluted in 1 ml of Tris-Triton X-100 buffer and filtered immediately through two Whatman DE81 filters presoaked with Tris-Triton X-100 buffer; they were then washed twice with 1 ml of Tris-Triton X-100 buffer, and the bound radioactivity was measured on a γ-counter. Samples without recombinant ECDs were used to measure nonspecific binding. Competition Experiments and Scatchard Plots—To measure the specific binding of α-Bgt and to study the binding of other small nicotinic ligands such as nicotine, carbamylcholine, d-tubocurarine, epibatidine, acetylcholine, methyllycaconitine, or gallamine, only gel-filtered samples were used. For Scatchard plot analysis, various concentrations (40–1500 fmol) of 125I-α-Bgt (specific activity 800,000 cpm/fmol) were incubated with 50 ng of recombinant protein at 4 °C for 1.5 h or overnight as described above in a final volume of 50 μl of PB-BSA, and the bound 125I-α-Bgt was measured using Whatman DE81 filters as described above. In competition experiments, various amounts of the unlabeled ligands were preincubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 50 ng of the recombinant protein diluted in PB-BSA (final volume 40 μl), then 10 μl of 50,000 cpm 125I-α-Bgt in PB-BSA was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1.5 h or overnight as described above. Then the bound 125I-α-Bgt was measured using Whatman DE81 filters as described above. To measure inhibition of the initial rate of toxin binding, the competition experiments were run as described above except that the mixture was incubated in the presence of 125I-α-Bgt for only 10 min. Residual 125I-α-Bgt binding ability was determined as the percentage of the radioactivity bound in the presence of the unlabeled ligand compared with its absence. When measuring the inhibition by various drugs on the binding of 125I-α-Bgt to α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop), the IC50 values were determined, and the Ki was calculated using the formula, Ki = IC50/(1 – ([125I-α-Bgt]/Kd125I-α-Bgt), where [125I-α-Bgt] is the concentration of the purified 125I-α-Bgt used in competition experiments, Kd125I-α-Bgt is the dissociation constant for 125I-α-Bgt binding to α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop) estimated by Scatchard plot analysis, and IC50 is the estimated concentration for the 50% inhibition of 125I-α-Bgt binding by each ligand in competition experiments. In Vitro Deglycosylation—Approximately 100 μg of Ni2+-NTA purified α7-ECDs was deglycosylated by the addition of 500 units of N-glycosidase F (peptide:N-glycanase F; New England Biolabs) under native conditions without heating, denaturation, or the addition of any detergent. The reaction was performed in 50 mm PB, pH 7.5 (final volume 400 μl), at 4 °C (a much lower temperature than that suggested by the manufacturer) and incubated overnight (although the reaction was completed within 1–2 h). The resulting deglycosylated protein was detected on Western blots using anti-Myc mAb 9E.10. Electron Microscopic Analysis—A colloidin film bearing copper grids (400 mesh; TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd.) was coated with a thin carbon layer and glow-discharged for 2 min prior to use. Recombinant protein gel-filtered samples (1 μg/μl) were added to the carbon-coated grids and embedded in 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate as negative stain. Images were taken at 40,000× magnification using a Philips 208 electron microscope operating at 80 kV (30Tierney M.L. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression and Study of the α7-ECD—Recombinant α7-ECD was expressed as a soluble protein in the P. pastoris culture supernatant. This protein was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialyzed against 50 mm PB, pH 8.0; then α7-ECD was purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA column using the His6 tag fused to its C terminus (Fig. 1C). Approximately 60% of the recombinant protein was eluted in the 100 mm imidazole fraction, and another 30% was eluted in the 150 mm imidazole fraction as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) and Western blot using the anti-Myc mAb (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) and confirmed by 125I-α-Bgt binding experiments (data not shown). The eluted protein was not pure, with the main contaminants being two bands of ∼40 and ∼70 kDa (see Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). The protein was further identified in Western blots by the anti-α7 peptide polyclonal antibody and the anti-bacterial α7-ECD polyclonal antibody. The purified α7-ECD was able to bind 125I-α-Bgt in solution in filter assay experiments and was blocked by unlabeled α-Bgt or d-tubocurarine (data not shown). The molecular mass of the product estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1 and 2) was ∼36–37 kDa, much higher than the value of 27.3 kDa predicted from its amino acid sequence. This difference was shown to be due to glycosylation, because in vitro deglycosylation of the Ni2+-purified protein with N-glycosidase (peptide:N-glycanase) reduced the apparent molecular mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gels to approximately that expected as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A, left pair of lanes). This shift indicates that, like the native α7 AChR, the recombinant protein was produced as a glycosylated form. The deglycosylated bands also appeared to be sharper, probably due to elimination of various glycosylated forms with different molecular masses. When the glycosylated and in vitro deglycosylated forms were tested for 125I-α-Bgt binding, no significant difference was seen in their binding efficiencies (Fig. 3B, left pair of bars). The oligomeric state and size of the recombinant protein in detergent-free solution (10 mm PB, pH 7.5) were studied by gel filtration analysis on a Superose 12 column, the fractions being assayed for 125I-α-Bgt binding. The bulk of the protein was eluted close to the column void volume, indicating the presence of high molecular mass aggregates (Fig. 4A). In fact, precipitation of the protein usually occurred after 1–2 days of storage at 4 °C in imidazole-containing 50 mm PB and 0.5 m NaCl. Expression and Purification of Mutated Forms of α7-ECDs—In an effort to avoid microaggregate formation, we then constructed two mutants, i.e. the α7-ECD(C116S) in which Cys116 was replaced by serine and the α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop) in which, in addition to the C116S mutation, the hydrophobic Cys-loop was replaced by the corresponding hydrophilic Cys-loop from the snail AChBP. The mutated proteins were produced in P. pastoris and purified using Ni2+-affinity chromatography as described for α7-ECD. Again, the proteins eluted mainly in the 100 mm imidazole fraction, whereas a small percentage eluted in the 150 mm imidazole fraction (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–6). The ∼40 and ∼70 kDa contaminant bands observed after α7-ECD Ni2+-NTA purification, making up ∼50% of the protein, were also present in the metal-purified mutated protein preparations; these bands were not recognized either by the anti-Myc mAb (Fig. 2B) or by anti-α7 polyclonal sera (data not shown) and were therefore attributed to P. pastoris intrinsic proteins. The mutated α7-ECDs were further purified by gel filtration on Superose 12, giving ∼90–95% pure protein as estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 4C, inset). The purified mutated proteins were also recognized by the two anti-α7 antisera described in the section on α7-ECD (data not shown). The yield of gel filtration purified α7-ECD(C116S) was ∼0.2 mg per liter of culture compared with that of ∼0.1 mg per liter for gel-filtered α7-ECD, whereas that of α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop) was ∼0.5 ± 0.1 mg per liter of culture. These yields were reproducible in several expression studies. α7-ECD(C116S), stored at 4 °C in imidazole containing 50 mm PB and 0.5 m NaCl, precipitated after a short period of storage but to a somewhat lower extent than α7-ECD. In contrast, α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop) did not precipitate after storage for several months at 4 °C with a concentration of ∼0.3 mg/ml in the same buffer (50 mm PB, 0.5 m NaCl, and 100/150 mm imidazole). The molecular masses of the mutated proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE to be the same as that of α7-ECD, i.e. ∼36–37 kDa, indicating that the mutants were produced as glycosylated forms. Effect of in Vitro Deglycosylation of the Mutant Proteins on Molecular Mass and 125I-α-Bgt Binding—Deglycosylation of the Ni2+-purified mutated proteins α7-ECD(C116S) and α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop) resulted in a sharper double band of approximately the expected molecular mass of 27.3 kDa (Fig. 3A). As with α7-ECD, the 125I-α-Bgt binding capacities of equal concentrations of the glycosylated and in vitro deglycosylated forms did not differ significantly (Fig. 3B). Characterization of the Oligomeric State and Size of the Mutants by Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration analysis on a Superose 12 column was used to study the effect of mutations on the oligomeric state and size of the recombinant proteins. The bulk of α7-ECD(C116S) eluted later than the void volume fractions but still at an apparent molecular mass much larger than those of pentamers (∼440–300 kDa) (Fig. 4B). However, the double mutant α7-ECD(C116S,Cys-loop) eluted in fractions corresponding to molecular masses between 232 and 158 kDa (Fig. 4C), the peak fractions corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼210 kDa. This value is slightly higher than the expected molecular mass for the glycosylated ECD pentamer calculated using the apparent molecular mass of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5 × 36–37 = 180–185 kDa). This small difference may be due to the shape of t"

https://openalex.org/W1999035522,"The spermatogenic zip protein (Spz1) was originally isolated from a mouse testis library and identified as a novel member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. Here we identify Spz1 as a specific binding partner of the γ2 catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1. Male mice homozygous for a null mutation in the protein phosphatase-1cγ (PP1cγ) gene are infertile and display a distinct impairment in spermiogenesis despite the continued presence of closely related PP1c isoforms. Yeast two-hybrid screening using the PP1cγ2 splice variant has identified Spz1 as an interacting protein and possible mediator of the sterile PP1cγ mutant phenotype. Spz1 was shown to interact specifically with PP1cγ2 but did not show an interaction with PP1cα or with a truncated version of PP1cγ2 lacking 18 amino acids from the C terminus. Interaction between full-length Spz1 and PP1cγ2 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments in COS-1 cells as well as gel-shift and sedimentation assays using whole testis lysates. Immunohistochemistry on wild type testis sections reveals a stage-specific expression pattern for Spz1 during spermatogenesis that appeared grossly abnormal in the testes of PP1cγ mutant mice. Phosphatase assays using recombinant PP1c indicate that increasing concentrations of Spz1 are able to inhibit PP1cγ2 activity while having little effect on the activity of PP1cα. Furthermore, an interaction between PP1cγ2 and Spz1 was shown to prevent binding of the latter to the consensus E-box promoter sequence. We propose that the interaction between Spz1 and PP1cγ2 may be required for proper regulation of spermatogenesis and fertility in males.

Mammalian spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous tubules of the testis and may be divided into three distinct stages: the proliferative, meiotic, and spermiogenic phases. Throughout the process developing germ cells are organized into a stratified epithelium by Sertoli cells, somatic cells that span the width of the tubules and help regulate differentiation through multiple signaling pathways (1Sharpe R.M. McKinnell C. Kivlin C. Fisher J.S. Reproduction. 2003; 125: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Male mice homozygous for a null mutation in the protein phosphatase-1cγ (PP1cγ) 1The abbreviations used are: PP1c, protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) catalytic subunit; bHLH, basic-helix-loop-helix; Spz1, spermatogenic zip protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. gene have been found to display a severe impairment in spermiogenesis, the final phase of spermatogenesis in which haploid spermatids elongate and undergo characteristic structural changes before being released into the lumen as mature sperm (2Varmuza S. Juriscova A. Okano K. Hudson J. Boekelheide K. Shipp E.B. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although homozygous mutant males are completely infertile, females and heterozygous males appear normal, suggesting that the observed phenotype is not the result of a decrease in PP1c gene dosage. Histochemical analysis of PP1cγ mutant tubules reveals that the majority of germ cells present are at the round spermatid stage of development, although smaller numbers of abnormal cells at later stages are occasionally observed. Mutant tubules were also found to display higher levels of apoptosis (3Juriscova A. Lopes S. Meriano J. Oppedisano L. Caspar R.F. Varmuza S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 4: 323-330Crossref Google Scholar) and aneuploidy (4Oppedisano L. Haines G. Hrabchak C. Fimia G. Elliot R. Sassone-Corsi P. Varmuza S. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 3: 710-717Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in germ cells, indicating the possibility of a secondary defect in meiosis. Preliminary analyses suggest that the observed lack of condensing and elongating spermatids may be due to premature shedding into the lumen, a hypothesis that is supported by the presence of empty regions in the epithelium where germ cells appear to have come away from Sertoli cell contacts (5Varmuza S. Ling L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2003; 64: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Reversible protein phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues is a universal mechanism by which eukaryotic cells regulate internal processes and modulate responses to environmental and physiological stimuli. Type 1 protein phosphatases are holoenzymes composed of a single catalytic subunit (PP1c) in complex with one or more regulatory subunits. Catalytic subunits of PP1 have been identified in every eukaryotic organism studied and are highly conserved across phyla (6Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Diversity of function has been achieved largely through association with different regulatory subunits, which vary greatly in structure and serve to mediate substrate specificity and localization of the enzyme within different cell types (7Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many PP1c regulatory proteins are known to interact through a degenerate RVXF motif, although it is not required in every case (8Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In mice, four isoforms of PP1c have been identified, PP1cα, PP1cβ, PP1cγ1, and PP1cγ2, the latter two being derived through alternate splicing of a single gene (9Okano K. Heng H. Trevisanto S. Tyers M. Varmuza S. Genomics. 1997; 45: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The isoforms are >98% identical excluding their unique C termini. Given that the PP1cγ2 splice variant is the most abundant PP1cγ isoform expressed in the testis (10Shima H. Hatano Y. Chun Y.S. Sugimura T. Zhang Z. Lee E.Y. Nagao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), its absence seems the most likely cause of the sterile phenotype observed in PP1cγ mutant males. Both PP1cα and PP1cβ are expressed in mutant testes, suggesting that these closely related isoforms are unable to compensate for the loss of PP1cγ. We have hypothesized the presence of one or more regulatory subunits that interact specifically with PP1cγ2, allowing it to mediate a function required for proper spermiogenesis. To date all known binding partners of PP1cγ2, including the glutamate receptor mGluR7b (11Enz R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (12Chun Y.S. Hiroshi S. Nagasaki K. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and a mammalian homologue of yeast Sds22 (13Chun Y.S. Park J.W. Kim G.T. Shima H. Nagao M. Chung M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Reprod. 2002; 67: 1936-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), are also known to bind other PP1c isoforms or have not been characterized in terms of their specificity. Only the neurabin proteins, which regulate PP1 in dendritic spines and post-synaptic densities of brain neurons, have been shown to interact preferentially with specific catalytic isoforms (15Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Carmody L.C. Voltz J.W. Connor J.H. Li S. Donelson Smith F. Milgram S.L. Colbran R.J. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study we identify the spermatogenic transcription factor Spz1 as a specific binding partner of the PP1cγ2 splice variant. Spz1 was originally characterized as a member of the bHLHZip family of transcription factors (16Hsu S.-H. Shyu H.-W. Hsieh-Li H.-M. Li H. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a family that has been implicated in a wide variety of tissue-specific developmental processes (17Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Our studies provide the first example of a putative PP1 regulatory subunit that has the potential to interact exclusively with a single catalytic isoform. Construction of Yeast Two-hybrid Vectors—Coding sequences for mouse PP1cγ2, PP1cγ1, PP1cα, and a truncated form of PP1cγ2 lacking 18 amino acids from the C terminus were amplified by PCR from pGEM7Z vectors containing respective full-length cDNAs (18Mann M. Latham K.E. Varmuza S. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PCR was performed using the following primer sets: for PP1cγ2, 5′-GGACGGCCATGGCGGATAT-3′ (primer 1) and 5′-ATGTTAGAATTCCCAACCAGG-3′ (primer 2); for PP1cγ1, primer 1 and 5′-GTCACCGCAGAATTCAGAATGT-3′ (primer 3); for PP1cα, 5′-GACGGCGCCATGGCCGACAGC-3′ (primer 4) and 5′-ACAGGGTGGAATTCGGGGGCT-3′ (primer 5); for truncated PP1cγ2, primer 1 and 5′-CTAATGGACGAAATTCAGGCCTG-3′ (primer 6). The resulting fragments were digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated separately into pGBKT7 bait vectors (Clontech). To clone full-length Spz1, testis RNA was isolated from a 14-week-old CD-1 male mouse using Trizol (Invitrogen), and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed using the primer set 5′-CCTCAGGTCCATATGTCGGAC-3′ (primer 7) and 5′-GCTTCTGGCGAATTCTACCGAA-3′ (primer #). The Spz1 fragment was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into the multiple cloning site of pGADT7 (Clontech). All two-hybrid vectors were sequenced before use in experiments to ensure the respective cDNAs had been inserted into the correct open reading frame for expression. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Assays—pGBKT7 bait vectors containing PP1c constructs were transformed separately into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, ura3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) and maintained on synthetic dropout media lacking tryptophan (Clontech). Yeast strains expressing PP1c were proven negative for self-activation of reporter genes after replica plating on media lacking adenine and histidine. Two-hybrid screening was performed on a mouse testis library constructed in pACT2 from pooled BALB/c males aged 8-12 weeks (Clontech). The library was amplified in Escherichia coli strain BNN132 according to Elledge et al. (19Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid DNA was purified using a maxi-prep kit from Qiagen. Library plasmid DNA (500 μg) was transformed into yeast AH109 expressing the PP1cγ2 bait protein by the LiAc method as described in the Clontech manual. Transformed cells were plated on minimal selective media, and colonies were picked and replica-plated after 5-7 days of incubation at 30 °C. Activation of the lacZ reporter gene was initially assessed by means of a colony-lift assay using an X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) substrate. Relative strength of lacZ expression was later quantified using a chemiluminescent assay with Galacton-Star as described in the Clontech manual. Light emissions were measured using a Berthold luminometer with Sirius v3.1 software. Plasmid DNA from positive clones was extracted using a yeast purification kit (CPG Inc.) and electroporated as described (20Nickoloff J.A. Electroporation Protocols for Microorganisms. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 55-66Google Scholar) into previously prepared electro-competent E. coli DH5α cells (21Sharma R.C. Schimke R. Biotechniques. 1996; 20: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids recovered from E. coli were retransformed into yeast expressing PP1cγ2 to confirm the original two-hybrid interaction and also into strains expressing bait constructs for PP1cα, PP1cγ1, lamin C, and the C-terminal truncated version of PP1cγ2. Positive interactions for each of the two-hybrid baits were assessed as described previously. Antibodies—An antibody recognizing both PP1cγ1 and PP1cγ2 was generated in rabbits against the short peptide KPAEKKKPNATRPVT common to the C-terminal region of each splice variant. The peptide was synthesized commercially with a cysteine residue at the N terminus to allow coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the Imject® sulfhydryl reactive antibody production kit from Pierce. Coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. For production of antibodies, 100 μg of purified immunogen was injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits as a 400-μl emulsion with Freund's complete adjuvant (22Howard G.C. Bethell D.R. Antibody Production and Characterization. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2001Google Scholar). Booster shots were administered using incomplete adjuvant after 14 and 28 days with 100 μg of purified immunogen as before. The presence of PP1cγ antibodies in rabbit sera was confirmed after 42 days via a Western blot on mouse testis protein. The antibody was affinity-purified against a SulfoLink® column (Pierce) containing the peptide originally used as an epitope. Antibody specifically recognizing PP1cγ2 was a generous gift from the Dr. Srinivasan Vijayaraghavan (Kent State University). Antibodies to Spz1 were a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Hung Li (Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei). Goat anti-PP1cα, rat anti-GATA1, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies to rat, goat, and rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Chicken antibodies recognizing Myc and HA epitopes were from Aves Labs, whereas Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories. GST Fusion Protein Production—Coding regions for PP1cγ2 and PP1cα were amplified from pGEM7Z vectors by PCR using the forward primer 5′-GGCGGCGGATCCGCGATGGCG-3′ (primer 9) and primer 2 or 5, respectively. Resulting cDNA fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length Spz1 cDNA was also cloned into pGEX-6P-2 after release from a pcDNA3.1 vector by restriction with NheI and EcoRI. Each of the GST expression vectors was transformed separately into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene). Recombinant bacteria were grown in LB media to A600 = 0.6, and GST fusion protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by further incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, frozen at -70 °C for 5 min, and thawed in a 1:100 culture volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min, Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and bacteria were lysed by sonication for 1 min at 0 °C (Branson model 250/450 Sonifier, 80% pulse, output 4). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as in Smith and Johnson (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Assays and Western Blotting—Testis protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing whole testis samples with a Dounce homogenizer in protein extraction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) using 500 μl of buffer per 50 μg of tissue. After centrifugation at 10,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatants were dialyzed against 200 volumes of buffer for 3 h. Protein concentrations were quantified using a Bradford dye assay as per the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Varying amounts of GST-Spz1 were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Beads were washed 2 times with Tris-buffered saline before the addition of 5 mg of total testis protein and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were washed 4 times with Tris-buffered saline before the addition of sample buffer and separation by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed using nitrocellulose membrane and Novex western transfer apparatus as described in Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibodies to PP1cγ and Spz1 were used at concentrations of 1:500 and 1:250. Antibodies to PP1cα and all secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000. Bound protein complexes were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Initial binding of GST-Spz1 to glutathione-Sepharose was verified via Coomassie Blue staining after elution and electrophoresis. Co-immunoprecipitation and Co-localization Experiments—PP1cγ2 and Spz1 were expressed in a COS-1 kidney cell line derived from African green monkey using Myc- and HA-tagged pcDNA3.1 expression vectors, respectively. Cells were cultured on plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum according to standard procedures (25Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) and passaged by treatment with 0.02% EDTA and 0.25% trypsin for 5 min. For construction of expression vectors the coding sequence of PP1cγ2 was amplified by PCR from a pGEM7Z vector containing the full-length cDNA. PCR was performed using the primers 5′-GGGACGGCGCTAGCGGATATC-3′ (primer 10) and primer 2. Spz1-coding sequence was amplified by RT-PCR from total testis RNA using 5′-CCTCAGGTCCTTAAGTCGGACAC-3′ (primer 11) and primer 8. The cDNA fragments were digested with NheI and EcoRI (for PP1cγ2) or BfrI and EcoRI (for Spz1) and cloned separately into the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA3.1 vectors to produce Myc- and HA-tagged proteins. The PP1cγ2 expression construct was stably transfected into COS-1 cells by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser according to the method of Misumi et al. (26Misumi Y. Oda K. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Tashiro K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16954-16959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed cells were selected in 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 1 week. Two 60-mm culture dishes of the transformed line expressing PP1cγ2 were grown to 90% confluency and used in a transient transfection with HA-pcDNA3.1-Spz1 as described (26Misumi Y. Oda K. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Tashiro K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16954-16959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before being concentrated onto a single dish. After 3 days, cells were collected and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5%Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates was centrifuged at 10,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was split into two 500-μl samples. PP1cγ2 and Spz1 were precipitated separately using 5 μg of chicken anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 1.5 h. Antibody and bound proteins were pulled down with a 50-μl slurry of anti-chicken IgY immobilized on agarose beads (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Protein complexes were washed before the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separation on 12.5% acrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed as described above. For control experiments, immunoprecipitations were performed using 5 μg of anti-GATA1 or anti-PP1cα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) together with 10 μl of 50% protein A-agarose beads (Transduction Laboratories). For co-localization experiments PP1cγ2 cDNA was released from a pGEX-6P-2 vector through digestion with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites on pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech). Spz1 was amplified by PCR from a pACT2 clone containing the full coding sequence using the primers 5′-CCAGGAGACTGAGATCTGCTCTC-3′ (primer 12) and 5′-GGCGACGTCGACCGAAAGCTG-3′ (primer 13). The cDNA was restricted with BglII and SalI and ligated into pEGFP. Recombinant plasmids were introduced into COS-1 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Three days after transfection fluorescent proteins were visualized using a Zeiss L7M510 scanning laser confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 1000×/1.4 oil DIC lens. Image quality was adjusted using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays was performed as in Hsu et al. (16Hsu S.-H. Shyu H.-W. Hsieh-Li H.-M. Li H. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binding of GST-Spz1 was measured against the double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-AAGAAAAGAAAGGCACGTGGGAAGAAAATT-3′ containing the consensus E-box sequence (underlined). DNA binding was carried out in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCL, 1 mm, EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Briefly, 1 μg of GST-Spz1 was incubated with 5000 cpm of labeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). Treatment with GST-PP1cγ2 was as indicated in Fig. 7. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels using 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. Protein Phosphatase Assays—Recombinant PP1cα and PP1cγ2 were produced in E. coli BL21(D3) (Stratagene) from an NpT7-5 vector. cDNAs for the two PP1c isoforms were obtained through restriction digest of yeast two-hybrid baits with NcoI and SalI. Resulting cDNA fragments were cloned into the corresponding sites of NpT7-5 vectors. After the introduction of recombinant vectors into bacteria, 20-ml overnight cultures were used to spike 1 liter of LB broth containing 1 mm MnCl2, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6 at 30 °C. Bacteria were pelleted at 4000 × g and resuspended in 1/100 culture volume lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol, with 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). Cells were lysed through sonication with a Branson 250/450 Sonifier according to Ludlow (27Ludlow J.W. Protein Phosphatase Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 91-99Google Scholar), and the resulting lysates were immediately assayed for PP1 activity. For PP1 assays, phosphorylase b (Sigma) was phosphorylated using phosphorylase kinase (Sigma) and 6000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) as described in Shenolikar and Ingebritsen (28Shenolikar S. Ingebritsen T.S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 102-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unincorporated 32P was dialyzed out over a period of 2.5 days at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. GST-neurabin 1 containing amino acids 374-516 of neurabin I and GST-GM containing amino acids 1-240 of GM were generous gifts from the laboratory of Dr. Shirish Shenolikar (Duke University, Durham, NC). Bacterial lysates containing recombinant PP1cα and PP1cγ2 were diluted 1:100, and assays were performed for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol using 20 μm radiolabeled phosphorylase a (28Shenolikar S. Ingebritsen T.S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 102-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Specifically, 20 μl of diluted PP1c source was premixed with 20 μl of chimeric regulatory subunit or buffer before the addition of 20 μl of phosphorylase a to start the reaction. Reactions were restricted to a maximum of 20% release of labeled phosphate to ensure linearity. Immunohistochemistry—Testes from wild type CD-1 and PP1cγ null mice were dissected out and fixed for 24 h in 4% formalin. Tissue was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin as described in Iwamura et al. (29Iwamura M. Abrahamsson P.A. Benning C.M. Cockett A.T. di Sant'Agnese P.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 6: 783-788Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Tissue was sectioned to an 8-μm thickness onto slides, dewaxed, and rehydrated (29Iwamura M. Abrahamsson P.A. Benning C.M. Cockett A.T. di Sant'Agnese P.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 6: 783-788Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Heat antigen retrieval was performed using a microwave with the slides immersed in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, buffer. Slides were microwaved for 2 separate 8-min periods on a high setting, with a 3-min cooling period between. After microwave treatment, slides were washed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.4% Photoflo (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 10 min in PBS with 0.005% Triton X-100 and 10 min in PBS with 10% antibody dilution buffer (10% goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100). Incubation with Spz1 or PP1cγ2 antibody (1:250) was performed overnight at 4 °C after which slides were washed and blocked as before. Treatment with secondary antibodies was for 4 h at 4 °C using 1:4000 Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Secondary antibodies were removed in PBS with 0.4% Photoflo for 20 min before counterstaining with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride at 0.1 μg/ml in water for 10 min. Slides were given the 2 final 10-min washes in distilled water and mounted (34Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andrews P.D. Wickramasinghe S. Sleeman J. Prescott A. Lam Y.W. Lyon C. Swedlow J.R. Lamond A.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Sections were examined with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with rhodamine and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride filters. Images were captured using Cool Snap software and a CCD camera. Images were merged using Image Pro4.1 software. Animals—Mice were bred using standard animal husbandry. Individual males from the PP1cγ colony were genotyped using a PCR-based method previously described (2Varmuza S. Juriscova A. Okano K. Hudson J. Boekelheide K. Shipp E.B. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In our laboratory the PP1cγ mutant allele has been propagated in a CD-1 background (Charles River Laboratories). Rabbits were maintained using standard animal husbandry procedures. All procedures performed involving laboratory animals were approved by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Spz1 Interacts with PP1cγ2 in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To identify putative regulatory subunits of PP1cγ2, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the PP1cγ2 isoform as bait to screen a mouse testis expression library. Two-hybrid screening identified a clone containing a portion of the coding sequence for the spermatogenic zip protein Spz1. The entire Spz1 cDNA was subsequently amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from total mouse testis RNA and cloned into a similar two-hybrid vector to confirm an interaction with the full-length protein. To determine whether Spz1 was able to interact with multiple PP1c isoforms, the full-length two-hybrid clone was also tested for interactions with PP1cα, PP1cγ1, and a truncated version of PP1cγ2 lacking 18 amino acids from the unique C terminus (Fig. 1A). Expression of the respective PP1c fusion proteins in yeast was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown) before testing. A construct encoding a portion of the human lamin C gene was used as a negative control. Positive interactions were assessed through the ability of transformed cells to grow on minimal media, activating expression of ADE2 and HIS3 reporter genes. Expression of a lacZ reporter gene was initially assessed via colony lift assay. Using these criteria Spz1 was found to interact strongly with PP1cγ2 and not PP1cα. A two-hybrid construct expressing amino acids 148-486 of the mouse homologue of staufen was used as a positive control for PP1c interactions. Staufen is an RNA-binding protein containing an RVXF motif that was originally identified in D"

This subfamily includes both transcriptional activators such as scleraxis, Hand2, and Dermo-1 and repressors such as Twist and Hand1. Paraxis is a member of this subfamily, and it has been shown to regulate morphogenetic events during somitogenesis, including the transition of cells from mesenchyme to epithelium and maintaining anterior/posterior polarity. Mice deficient in paraxis exhibit a caudal truncation of the axial skeleton and fusion of the vertebrae. Considering the developmental importance of paraxis, it is important for future studies to understand the molecular basis of its activity. Here we demonstrate that paraxis can function as a transcriptional activator when it forms a heterodimer with E12. Paraxis is able to bind to a set of E-boxes that overlaps with the closely related scleraxis. Paraxis expression precedes that of scleraxis in the region of the somite fated to form the axial skeleton and tendons and is able to direct transcription from an E-box found in the scleraxis promoter. Further, in the absence of paraxis, Pax-1 is no longer expressed in the somites and presomitic mesoderm. These results suggest that paraxis may regulate early events during chondrogenesis by positively directing transcription of sclerotome-specific genes.

The bHLH transcription factors belong to a larger superfamily of helix-loop-helix transcription factors that contains more than 240 proteins that are expressed in eukaryotic organisms that range from yeast to humans (9Atchley W. Fitch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Members of this family possess a highly conserved functional domain containing a stretch of basic amino acids adjacent to two amphipathic α-helices separated by a loop (10Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The helices mediate dimerization with a second bHLH factor, bringing the basic domains into close proximity and forming the bipartite DNA binding domain. The bHLH dimers bind specifically to a hexanucleotide sequence (CANNTG), known as an E-box (11Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). E-boxes are found in the control regions of many lineage-specific genes. In some cases, such as the muscle-specific genes myogenin, myosin light chain, and muscle creatine kinase, the E-box is required for full transcription of the gene (12Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol.

Class A bHLH factors are known as E proteins and include the E2A gene products E12 and E47, HEB, and the Drosophila daughterless gene product (17Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y.

As somites compartmentalize, this gene is expressed transiently in the sclerotome while being maintained in the epithelial dermomyotome (27Burgess R. Cserjesi P. Ligon K.L. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1994; 168: 296-306Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 38Sosic D. Brand-Saberi B. Schmidt D. Christ B. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Transcription of paraxis overlaps with Twist and Dermo-1 in the dermomyotome and transiently with scleraxis in the sclerotome. Mouse embryos deficient in paraxis fail to undergo the normal morphological transition from mesenchyme to epithelium associated with somite formation (41Burgess R. Rawls A. Brown D. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Nature. 1996; 384: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Paraxis also is required for the maintenance of the anterior/posterior polarity of somites, which prepatterns individual vertebrae and influences the pattern of peripheral nerves (42Johnson J. Rhee J. Parsons S.M. Brown D. Olson E.N. Rawls A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is also involved in the specification and differentiation of the myogenic and chondrogenic cell lineages that are derived from the somites (41Burgess R. Rawls A. Brown D. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Nature. 1996; 384: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 43Wilson-Rawls J. Hurt C.R. Parson S.M. Rawls A. Development. 1999; 53: 357-368Google Scholar). Understanding the function of paraxis and its target genes during the regulation of these developmental processes requires determining how paraxis works at the molecular level. In this study, we demonstrate that the paraxis protein is capable of acting as a transactivator. A series of deletion and point mutations in paraxis was used to demonstrate that dimerization and DNA binding is occurring through the bHLH domain. Paraxis was able to bind a subset of E-boxes tested as a heterodimer with E12, but not as a homodimer. Paraxis induced expression of a reporter gene under control of the E-box from the scleraxis promoter that is required for transcription of this gene in vivo. Further, experiments demonstrate that paraxis must be present for normal expression of Pax-1 in the somites and presomitic mesoderm of mouse embryos.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Transfections—10T1/2 cells and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 10T1/2 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate as described in Ref. 44Wilson-Rawls J. Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2853-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar. COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE and the PLUS reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer.Plasmids and Construction of Mutants—To generate specific amino acid mutants, a “rolling circle” PCR method was employed (43Wilson-Rawls J. Hurt C.R. Parson S.M. Rawls A. Development. 1999; 53: 357-368Google Scholar). For each PCR, 10 ng of template (paraxis-RSET), 1 μl of each primer at 300 nm, and the standard buffer supplied with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Q71K/R72K mutant was created by mutating the sequence CAGCGA to AAGAAG, followed by digestion with SnaBI (New England Biolabs). The A76N mutation was created by changing the sequence from GCGGCC to GTTAAC and digestion with HpaI (New England Biolabs). F90P mutation was created by changing the original sequence TTCACC to CCGGTC and digestion with AgeI (New England Biolabs). The truncation of the N terminus (N-) was done by digestion of paraxis-RSET with NcoI and SmaI, followed by Klenow fill-in of the ends and re-ligation. Truncation of the C terminus (C-) was done by digestion of paraxis-RSET with MscI followed by re-ligation. The same mutants were subsequently subcloned into a mammalian expression system. Primers were designed with an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and a NotI site at the 3′-end of paraxis, and PCR was done using the RSET constructs as templates. The PCR products were then cloned into pCDNAI.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Coupled in vitro transcription-translation reactions were performed with 0.5 μg of each plasmid DNA and TnT reticulocyte lysates using T7 polymerase (Promega). The proteins were cotranslated in the same lysates in all cases. The efficiency of translation was determined by performing duplicate transcription/translation reactions in the presence of Tran35S-label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Probes were double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to specific E-boxes. Probes were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). For each DNA binding reaction, 2 μg of the total translation products was added to a 20-μl total volume reaction with 40,000 cpm of probe in binding buffer (40 mm KCl, 14 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 50% (v/v) glycerol) and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at room temperature, and protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on 5% 0.5× TBE polyacrylamide gels. The sense strand sequences of the oligonucleotide probes were: Da, CGTTCAACATATGCGTTGA (46Ip Y.T. Park R.E. Kosman D. Bier E. Levine M.

Translation products were labeled with Tran35S-label. The reticulocyte lysates were diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold NTT buffer (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). The diluted lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-His antibody and 25 μl of protein A/G-Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Lysates were incubated for 4 h at 4 C° with shaking, followed by centrifugation and then washed five times in 1 ml of NTT buffer. Proteins were released from the agarose beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE.Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assays—Cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected as described above. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and CAT assays done as described previously (44Wilson-Rawls J. Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2853-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4), and then lysates were made by covering cells with 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) incubated for 15 min at room temperature with rocking. The plate was then scraped and the lysates transferred to a microcentrifuge tube on ice. Lysates were vortexed for 10 s, heated to 60 °C for 10 min, and spun for 2 min at top speed at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The protein concentration in the lysates was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad), and all CAT assays were performed with an equal amount of total protein. CAT assays were done using [14C]chloramphenicol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and n-butyryl-CoA (Promega) at 37 °C for 2 h. The samples were extracted with 500 μl of ethyl acetate. The top organic phase was removed to a fresh tube and dried in a SpeedVac at room temperature. The samples were resuspended in 30 μl of ethyl acetate and spotted onto a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate and dried. The samples were separated by thin layer chromatography in chloroform:methanol (97:3) in a preequilibrated chamber. The plates were exposed to a PhosphorImage screen overnight and developed and quantified on a Storm PhosphorImager.In Situ Hybridization—The embryonic pattern of transcription was determined by whole mount in situ hybridization using antisense RNA-labeled digoxigenin-11-UTP probes as described in Ref. 43Wilson-Rawls J. Hurt C.R. Parson S.M. Rawls A. Development. 1999; 53: 357-368Google Scholar. Embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.5 embryos were probed with antisense RNA specific to Pax-1, and transcripts were visualized using anti-digoxigenin antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase; color reactions were done using BM Purple (Roche Applied Science).RESULTSE-boxes (CANNTG) are found in high abundance throughout the genome, due in large part to the low level of complexity. The central two nucleotides of the E-box and the flanking sequences influence the binding preference of individual bHLH dimer pairs (50Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 51Fisher F. Crouch D.H. Jayaraman P.-S. Clark W. Gillespie D.A.F. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ability of bHLH transcription factors to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner is determined by specific residues within the basic region of the bHLH domain. For example, in the myogenic bHLH subfamily, conserved alanine and threonine residues in the basic region confer muscle specificity (52Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 582-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 53Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H.

Additionally, residues in the junction between the basic and HLH domains can influence E-box specificity without directly binding DNA (57Ma P.C. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The bHLH domain of paraxis is highly homologous to that of members of the Twist subfamily (Fig. 1). To examine the ability of paraxis to bind E-boxes in a sequence-specific manner, EMSAs were performed using E-boxes that have been reported to be targets of other Twist subfamily members (13Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 28Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K.L. Lyons G.E.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because Twist can bind DNA as a heterodimer with E proteins, as well as a homodimer (58Castanon I. Von stetina S. Kass J. Baylies M.K. Development. 2001; 128: 3145-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ability of paraxis to bind specific E-boxes was tested both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with E12.End-labeled double-stranded E-boxes (Fig. 2A) were incubated with paraxis and/or E12 proteins generated by coupled in vitro transcription and translation reactions in programmed reticulocyte lysates. Among the E-boxes tested was the right E-box of the muscle creatine kinase gene (RMCK), this E-box is bound by E12 homodimers and E12/scleraxis heterodimers (59Brown D. Wagner D. Li X. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 4317-4329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scleraxis will also bind to an E-box (Scx) from its own promoter as a heterodimer with E12 (59Brown D. Wagner D. Li X. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 4317-4329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Perez A.V. Perrine M. Brainard N. Vogel K.G. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and rhomboid promoters are bound by E12/Twist heterodimers (58Castanon I. Von stetina S. Kass J. Baylies M.K. Development. 2001; 128: 3145-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An E-box from the promoter of the insulin gene (Ins-1) binds to an E12/Beta1 heterodimer (48Peyton M. Moss L.G. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25936-25941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2B, E12/paraxis heterodimers were able to shift the Scx and Ins-1 E-boxes well, the RMCK and the Da promoter were also shifted. E12/paraxis heterodimers were not able to bind to the E-box from the Rhomboid promoter. Paraxis homodimers demonstrated no detectable binding activity. To confirm protein expression, duplicate Tran35S-labeled in vitro transcription and translation reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Thus, paraxis, a Class B bHLH protein, binds a subset of E-boxes preferentially as a heterodimer with E12, a Class A bHLH factor.Fig. 2Binding site preferences for paraxis and E12 heterodimer complexes.A, oligonucleotide sequences containing E-boxes found in the enhancer region of myosin creatine kinase (RMCK), Ins-1, daughterless (Da), rhomboid, and scleraxis (Scx). The E-box sequence is underlined. B, EMSA using in vitro transcribed and translated paraxis and/or E12 proteins and 32P-labeled E-box oligonucleotide probes. Arrowheads mark the bands generated by the binding of the E12/paraxis heterodimer and E12 homodimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The specificity of the DNA binding activity of the E12/paraxis heterodimer detected by EMSA was examined by the addition of an unlabeled competitor probe to the EMSA reaction. Because both E12 and E12/paraxis dimers shifted the Ins-1 E-box it was used as a target for these assays. The use of a 1:1 ratio of E12 and paraxis input plasmids in the coupled transcription/translation reaction resulted in the preferential formation of the heterodimer in the presence of the Ins-1 E-box. However, a 2:1 E12/paraxis plasmid ratio in the transcription/translation reaction generated approximately equal levels of both the E12 homodimer and E12/paraxis heterodimer on this E-box (Fig. 3). Therefore, the 2:1 ratio of input plasmids was used to generate proteins for EMSA to allow for comparison of the effect of competitor on the E12/paraxis heterodimer and the E12 homodimer. As can be seen in Fig. 3, both were inhibited effectively with 20-fold molar excess unlabeled Ins-1 added to the EMSA reaction. In comparison, even 100-fold molar excess of mutated Ins-1 had no observable effect on either dimer (Fig. 3). These observations indicate that paraxis binds in a sequence-specific manner to E-boxes in a heterodimer with E12.Fig. 3Binding competition analysis of DNA binding by the E12/paraxis heterodimers.In vitro transcribed and translated E12 and paraxis proteins were used for EMSA using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing an E-box from the Ins-1 enhancer. Equivalent amounts of E12 and paraxis (1:1) protein preferentially form a heterodimer, whereas a 2-fold excess of E12 resulted in the formation of both E12/paraxis heterodimers and E12 homodimers. The addition of a 20-, 50-, or 100-fold excess of unlabeled Ins-1 probe competed with the 32P-labeled Ins-1 probe. In contrast, an unlabeled mutated form of the Ins-1 probe (mutIns-1) which disrupts the E-box was not able to compete with the labeled Ins-1 probe. The reticulocyte lysate alone did not shift the Ins-1 probe. Arrows mark"
https://openalex.org/W2049876060,"The role of the sequence surrounding M4 in ryanodine receptors (RyR) in membrane association and function was investigated. This sequence contains a basic, 19-amino acid M3/M4 loop, a hydrophobic 44–49 amino acid sequence designated M4 (or M4a/M4b), and a hydrophilic M4/M5 loop. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was inserted into RyR1 and truncated just after the basic sequence, just after M4, within the M4/M5 loop, just before M5 and just after M5. The A52 epitope was inserted into RyR2 and truncated just after M4a. Analysis of these constructs ruled out a M3/M4 transmembrane hairpin and narrowed the region of membrane association to M4a/M4b. EGFP inserted between M4a and M4b in full-length RyR2 was altered conformationally, losing fluorescence and gaining trypsin sensitivity. Although it was accessible to an antibody from the cytosolic side, tryptic fragments were membrane-bound. The expressed protein containing EGFP retained caffeine-induced Ca2+ release channel function. These results suggest that M4a/M4b either forms a transmembrane hairpin or associates in an unorthodox fashion with the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane, possibly involving the basic M3/M4 loop. The expression of a mutant RyR1, Δ4274–4535, deleted in the sequence surrounding both M3 and M4, restored robust, voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ currents and Ca2+ transients in dyspedic myotubes, demonstrating that this sequence is not required for either orthograde (DHPR activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release) or retrograde (RyR1 increase in DHPR Ca2+ channel activity) signals of excitation-contraction coupling. Maximal amplitudes of L-currents and Ca2+ transients with Δ4274–4535 were larger than with wild-type RyR1, and voltage-gated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release was more sensitive to activation by sarcolemmal voltage sensors. Thus, this region may act as a negative regulatory module that increases the energy barrier for Ca2+ release channel opening.

Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). M3 is not hydrophobic in RyR3, although it is in RyR1 and RyR2. However, the hydrophobicity of a 41-amino acid sequence (5Argos P. Rao J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol.

A hydrophobic sequence of this length is considered to be sufficient to form a TM hairpin loop by itself. Indeed, the TMHMM2.0 program (7Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol.

The sequence separating the C terminus of M3 and the beginning of the hydrophobic M4 sequence is hydrophilic and very basic (1Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G.

Compelling evidence was obtained for the existence of three hairpin loops, M5/M6, M7a/M7b, and M8/M10. A fourth region of membrane association was detected upstream of the three hairpin loops, but its topological characteristics were not investigated fully. It was shown that an EGFP tag fused to amino acid 4300, at the C terminus of predicted helix M3 in RyR1 was located in the cytosol, and the truncated protein to which it was attached was soluble in the cytosol. The results of this experiment virtually ruled out the possibility that predicted TM sequences M′, M″, M1, M2, and M3 might exist as TM helices. However, when EGFP was fused to points in the sequence between predicted TM sequence M4 and demonstrated TM sequence M5, the truncated protein was membrane-bound, and EGFP was located in the cytosol. These observations raised the question of whether the long hydrophobic M4 sequence might form a TM hairpin loop or, alternatively, whether M3, which did not appear to form a signal anchor sequence by itself, might act as a signal anchor sequence in conjunction with a stop transfer sequence formed by M4 to form a TM hairpin loop (9Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Zhang J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1709-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the possibility that a TM hairpin loop might be formed in the M4 region. We inserted EGFP or an A52 epitope into sequences on either side of M4 in RyR1 and in the middle of the M4 sequence in RyR2, where a luminal loop might separate TM sequences M4a and M4b, as they do for M7. The results show that it is the M4 sequence that associates with the membrane, but it is not clear whether association occurs through the formation of a TM hairpin or through an unorthodox association with the membrane. An RyR2 construct that contained an EGFP insertion between M4a and M4b formed an active channel, and an RyR1 construct in which the M3/M4 region was deleted retained both orthograde and retrograde Ca2+ release channel function. Materials—DNA restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, MBI Fermentas, Amersham Biosciences, and Roche Applied Science. The pEGFP vectors were from Clontech (BD Biosciences). The expression vector pcDNA 3.1(–) was from Invitrogen. The monoclonal antibody, JL-8, against green fluorescent protein was from Clontech. All other reagents were of reagent grade or the highest grade available. Vector Construction—To examine the contribution of the M4 sequence to the topology of RyR, the cDNA sequence encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was inserted in-frame into specific locations in either the full-length RYR1 or RYR2 cDNA sequences. Truncation constructs were made by removal of the sequence after EGFP in these full-length fusions (Fig. 2). The EGFP cDNA sequence was either isolated from longer constructs by restriction enzyme digestion or amplified from the same constructs by PCR using primers, some of which contained desired restriction endonuclease sites. For RYR1 fusion constructs EGFP4556 and EGFP4628, the EGFP sequence was removed from the pEGFP-C2 cassette by AgeI and SmaI and blunt-ended. The fragment was inserted into an NruI (4556) site, previously introduced (11Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31867-31872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) into a full-length RYR1 cDNA clone in pcDNA 3.1 (12Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11778-11783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), to obtain construct EGFP4556, and into an endogenous Bst1107I (4628) site in the full-length RYR1 cDNA to obtain construct EGFP4628. EGFP in EGFP4556 was located just before M5 and, in EGFP4628, just after M5, a well defined, cytosol-to-lumen TM sequence (8Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For construct EGFP4329, the EGFP fragment was removed from the pEGFP-C3 vector by Eco47III and SmaI and inserted into a blunted BstXIII site in the C10 cassette isolated from RYR1 cDNA (see Ref. 13Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar for RYR1 cassettes). For constructs EGFP4381 and EGFP4452, EGFP was amplified from pEGFP-C1 by PCR using primers 5′-GCCAGCATGCTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG (forward)/5′-CTGCAGCATGCAAGCTTGAGCTCGAGATC (reverse) for EGFP4381 and 5′-GCTACCCTTGGCACCATGGTGAGCAAGG (forward)/5′-GGTACCAAGGACTGCAGAATTCGAAGCTT (reverse) for EGFP4452 and inserted into an SphI site at position 4381 or a StyI site at nucleotide 4452 in the C10 cassette. The modified C10 cassette sequences, containing EGFP codons, were cloned back into the original C10 cassette position in full-length RYR1 cDNA. For construct EGFP4329, EGFP was fused at the end of a 22-amino acid sequence containing 10 positively charged residues (RGLSYRSLRRRVRRLRRLTARE4326), which links the C terminus of M3 to the N terminus of the hydrophobic sequence constituting the extended M4 sequence (Ala4322–Ala4370). EGFP in EGFP4381 and EGFP4452 was located between the end of M4 and the beginning of M5, at Arg4557. Since it was not possible to find a site for insertion of a tag in the very GC-rich M4 region in RYR1, we resorted to the insertion of tags into the RYR2 sequence. The 44-amino acid M4 sequence in RyR2, predicted by the TMHMM2.0 (7Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8721) Google Scholar) programs is MVTAFFSSYWSIFMTLLHFVASVFRGFFRIVCSLLLGGSLVEGA4323. The nucleotide sequence encoding VAS4301, located in the middle of this sequence, is predicted by the TMHMM2.0 to form a loop and is a good candidate juncture point between two TM sequences, M4a and M4b (Fig. 1). The codons for this sequence contain a BalI site. The EGFP sequence, amplified from pEGFP-N1 using primers 5′-CCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG (forward)/5′-CCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC (reverse), and the sequence 5′-CCAGCGAGTTTGACGACCTGCCCCTGGCCGAGCAGCGGGAAGCCTGCCGCCGGATCC, encoding the A52 epitope (amino acids EFDDLPLAEQREACR in SERCA1) (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were introduced separately into the BalI site in a vector containing an RYR2 cDNA cassette (PstI-SacI, 12351–13602). The PstI-SacI, 12351–13602 cassettes were cloned back into their original location in a longer cassette (SacII-XhoI, 11206–15360). After screening of hundreds of clones, a SacII-XhoI cassette containing EGFP and a clone containing A52 were inserted into their original locations in full-length RYR2 cDNA in pcDNA3.1 to obtain clones EGFP4300 and 1–4300-A52 (R2). Unfortunately, 1–4300-A52 (R2) carried two single nucleotide deletions causing a frameshift at the C terminus of A52, which resulted in the translation of only 21 amino acids (EFDDLPLAEQRNLPPDPQRV) after amino acid 4300. Since the first 11 amino acids retained A52 epitope specificity, the truncated protein 1–4300-A52 (R2) could be detected by probing with monoclonal antibodies A52 and monoclonal antibody C3-33 against RyR2. Thus, it was useful in determination of whether the M4a sequence might act as a signal anchor for membrane insertion. Since a HindIII site was retained at the 3′-end of EGFP and at the 3′-end of the full-length RYR1 clone, removal of the HindIII fragment from constructs EGFP4329, EGFP4381, and EGFP4452 produced 1–4329-EGFP, 1–4381-EGFP, and 1–4452-EGFP, three new RyR1 deletion mutants with a C-terminal fusion of EGFP. Expression in HEK-293 Cells and Microsome Preparation—Fusion proteins were expressed in HEK-293 cells by transfection with 20 μgof each cDNA construct/10-cm plate using the standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol (15Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). After 24–40 h, the cells were harvested and microsomes were prepared, as described earlier, but without KCl extraction (16Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 1 h. Supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The resultant pellets were suspended in 1× loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. Caffeine-induced Ca2+Release—Ca2+ fluorescence measurements of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release were carried out in a microfluorimetry system (Photon Technologies Inc.). The Fura-2/AM fluorescence changes were monitored in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, as described previously (17Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—MEF cells (a kind gift from Dr. Tak Mak, University of Toronto) or HEK-293 cells were cultured, transfected, treated with saponin before or after fixation, and examined to determine the pattern of EGFP fluorescence by confocal microscopy, as described previously (8Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical Analysis of EGFP Orientation—Transfected MEF cells seeded on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and, subsequently, permeabilized selectively or nonselectively with streptolysin-O or Triton X-100, according to methods described previously (18Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, fixed cells were washed and treated for 15 min with either 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature or 200 units/ml streptolysin-O, previously activated by a 5-min incubation on ice with 10 mm dithiothreitol in PBS. Unbound streptolysin-O was washed away, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in PBS containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Triton X-100- and streptolysin-O-treated cells were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk dissolved in PBS. They were then incubated sequentially with a primary antibody (monoclonal antibody JL-8 against EGFP) (1:1000) and a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, goat anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes) (1:1000) for 1 h each, with three 10-min washings in between. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and examined by confocal microscopy. Alkaline Extraction—Sodium carbonate, which extracts secretory proteins and peripheral membrane proteins without solubilizing membrane proteins (20Steck T.L. Yu J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), was used to determine whether the expressed fusion proteins were associated peripherally or integrally with the membrane. Protease Digestion—To determine whether EGFP, at the C terminus of truncated fusion proteins or within full-length RyR was located on the luminal or cytosolic surface, microsomal vesicles were digested by trypsin at protein/trypsin ratios between 6 and 20. The samples were incubated at 37 or 24 °C for 1 h before the addition of aprotinin and trypsin inhibitor at a concentration 10-fold (w/w) over trypsin. Insoluble membrane fractions were separated from the digest by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Supernatants were collected, and pellets were washed once with PBS and suspended in 1× loading buffer with 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE or 5–15% discontinuous gradient SDS-PAGE, according to standard protocols (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205478) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by a standard Western blotting assay. Preparation and Microinjection of Dyspedic Myotubes—Primary cultures of myotubes were prepared from newborn dyspedic mice with a disruption of the RYR1 gene, as described previously (22Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 23Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expression of wild-type RyR1 and an RyR1 deletion mutant lacking residues 4274–4535 (Δ4274–4535) was achieved by nuclear microinjection of dyspedic myotubes with cDNAs encoding CD8 (0.2 μg/μl) and the appropriate RyR1 expression plasmid (0.5 μg/μl) 4–6 days after initial plating of myoblasts (24Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Groom L.A. Dirksen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17732-17738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Myotubes expressing RyR1 were identified 2–4 days later through incubation with CD8 antibody beads (Dynabeads; Dynal ASA) prior to whole-cell patch clamp recording. Simultaneous Measurements of Macroscopic Ca2+Currents and Ca2+Transients—The whole cell patch clamp technique was used for simultaneous measurement of voltage-gated L-currents and Ca2+ transients in RyR1- and Δ4274–4535-expressing myotubes, as described previously (24Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Groom L.A. Dirksen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17732-17738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, an on-line P/–3 leak subtraction protocol was used to eliminate linear components, following determination of cell membrane capacitance (Cm). Subsequently, 30-ms test pulses were applied from a holding potential of –80 mV. A conditioning prepulse designed to inactivate T-type Ca2+ channels (1 s to –20 mV) preceded each test pulse. Peak L-current magnitudes were normalized by Cm (pA/picofarads), plotted as a function of the test pulse membrane potential, and fitted according to the equation, I=Gmax(Vm−Vrev)/(1+exp((VG1/2−Vm)/kG))(Eq. 1) where Gmax represents maximal L-channel conductance, Vm is the test potential, Vrev is the extrapolated reversal potential, VG1/2 is the potential for half-maximal activation of Gmax, and kG is a slope factor. Relative changes in intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+ transients) were measured during each test pulse. Fluo-4-dialyzed myotubes were excited at 480 nm, and fluorescence emission at 535 nm was collected using a photo-multiplier system (Photon Technology Inc.). Fluorescence traces were analogue-filtered (τ = 0.5 ms) before digitization at 10 kHz and expressed as ΔF/F ((FPeak – FBase)/FBase). Peak fluorescence at the end of each test pulse was plotted as a function of Vm and fitted according to the equation, ΔF/F=(ΔF/F)max/(1+exp((VF1/2−Vm)/kF))(Eq. 1) where (ΔF/F)max is the maximal fluorescence change, VF1/2 is the potential for half-maximal activation of (ΔF/F)max, and kF is a slope factor. For all patch clamp experiments, the extracellular solution contained 145 mm TEA-Cl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The internal solution contained 145 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm CsCl, 0.1 mm Cs2EGTA, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Mg-ATP, 0.2 mm K5-fluo-4, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Exploration of Membrane Association through the M4 Region of RyR1—As in a previous study of overall RyR1 topology (8Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we initiated analysis of the topology of the M4 region by determining the orientation of EGFP fused to the C terminus of truncated RyR1 sequences. An RyR2 clone was also truncated at the middle of the M4 sequence through the attachment of the A52 epitope to its new C terminus (Fig. 2, A and B). This RyR2 fusion protein, 1–4300-A52 (R2), could be detected by monoclonal antibody C3-33 against RyR2 and by monoclonal antibody A52. We also inserted EGFP at various positions in the full-length clone in an attempt to determine its topology within the longer clone. Analysis by confocal microscopy showed that soluble proteins such as EGFP and RyR1 truncated at amino acid 4300 (designated post-M3 in Ref. 8Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) could be washed out of HEK-293 or MEF cells if the cells were permeabilized with saponin before fixation. However, integral membrane proteins remained inside the cells and formed a pattern characteristic of the membrane in which they were situated (8Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). EGFP fluorescence for truncation protein 1–4329-EGFP and A52 immunofluorescence for 1–4300-A52 (R2), were confined to spaces outside of the nucleus, forming a uniform pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, a and c). This uniform fluorescence disappeared following saponin treatment, and only dense aggregates remained, which did not show a network pattern characteristic of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3A, b and d). These results show that the sequence ending just before M4 and containing the basic M3/M4 loop sequence was insufficient to anchor the cytosolic portion of RyR1 to the membrane and that the sequence containing the first half of M4 (M4a) is insufficient to anchor the cytosolic portion of RyR2 to the membrane. EGFP fluorescence for 1–4381-EGFP and 1–4452-EGFP showed a network pattern (Fig. 3A, e and g), which was less well defined than that for wt RyR1 (not shown). However, fluorescence remained in the intracellular membranes after saponin treatment (Fig. 3A, f and h). These results demonstrate that RyR fusion proteins, truncated just before M4b, were soluble and not membrane-associated, whereas RyR fusion proteins, truncated just after M4b, were insoluble and associated with organellar membranes that included the ER. Further analysis was carried out to determine whether these fusion proteins were associated with isolated microsomal membranes. Homogenates from HEK-293 cells were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 min and then at 186,000 × g for 1 h. The proportion of the fusion protein in the high speed pellet, representing the microsomal membrane fraction, and in the supernatant, representing the soluble fraction, was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with either EGFP antibody JL-8 or the A52 antibody. The fusion proteins 1–4329-EGFP and 1–4300-A52 (R2) were located largely in the supernatant fraction (not shown), whereas 1–4381-EGFP and 1–4452-EGFP were associated with the microsomal membrane fractions (not shown). The ability of sodium carbonate to extract proteins from isolated microsomal membranes was also examined (Fig. 3B). Following treatment with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, more than 50% of the total protein from 1–4329-EGFP and 1–4300-A52 (R2) was extracted into solution, but less than 20% of total 1–4381-EGFP protein and less than 5% of total 1–4452-EGFP protein (Fig. 3B) were extracted into solution. Fusion proteins 1–4329-EGFP, 1–4381-EGFP, and 1–4452-EGFP were tested for topological location of EGFP by measurement of its susceptibility to proteolytic digestion in microsomal fractions. Native EGFP is intrinsically resistant to digestion by proteases (25Bokman S.H. Ward W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 1372-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and expressed EGFP migrates as a trypsin-resistant 28-kDa protein (Fig. 3C). Earlier, we demonstrated that 28-kDa EGFP could be detected in the supernatant when EGFP in the fusion protein lies on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and that an increased mass is obtained in the membrane pellets when EGFP is translocated to the lumen, where it and its congruent transmembrane sequences are protected from tryptic digestion (8Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). EGFP with a mass of 28 kDa was found in the supernatant for 1–4329-EGFP and 1–4381-EGFP (Fig. 3C), but EGFP from 1–4452-EGFP, which was also found in the supernatant, had a mass of ∼32 kDa, suggesting that the adjacent sequence was insensitive to trypsin, either because it contained no trypsin-sensitive sites or because it was folded into the EGFP domain, where it was protected against trypsin. No EGFP signal was detected in the membrane pellets for any of these fusion proteins (Fig. 3C). These results show that EGFP from 1–4329-EGFP, 1–4381-EGFP, and 1–4452-EGFP is released to the supernatant by trypsin digestion and is, therefore, located in the cytosol. The data presented in Fig. 3 for 1–4329-EGFP and 1–4300-A52 (R2) indicate that neither M3, the sequence of basic amino acids immediately following M3, nor M4a can anchor the cytoplasmic domain to the membrane. In further testing, we inserted EGFP, in frame, into full-length RyR1 between M3 and M4 (EGFP4329). This construct was used to exclude the possibility that M3/M4 might form a hairpin loop, although M3 alone does not behave like a signal anchor sequence. We also inserted EGFP, in frame, into full-length RyR1 between M4 and M5 (EGFP4381, EGFP4452, and EGFP4556) to confirm that the entire M4/M5 loop is cytoplasmic and between M5 and M6 (EGFP4628) to confirm that the M5/M6 loop is located in the lumen (Fig. 2, A and B). The question of whether M4a is a signal anchor could not be confirmed in RyR1 by our standard technique of fusing EGFP at the C terminus of M4a, since we could not find a site in the GC-rich sequence of M4 that could be used to insert EGFP, followed by a stop codon. A site in RYR2 in the middle of M4 at Ala4300 was suitable for EGFP insertion. However, we could not isolate any RyR2 construct in which EGFP was followed by a stop codon. Nevertheless, we were able to isolate a clone in which EGFP was inserted, in frame, into full-length RyR2 at a site between M4a and M4b to create EGFP4300(R2), with which we hoped to discriminate between the possibility that the C terminus of M4a lies in the lumen, consistent with the formation of a TM hairpin loop by the full-length M4, or lies in the cytosol.

The rapid changes in avidity have been attributed to changes in the number of interacting molecules or valency due to molecular redistribution or clustering and to changes in the affinity of the individual receptor-ligand bonds (3Carman C.V.

A. 1996; 93: 10939-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Physiological shear can also regulate leukocyte traffic by stimulating mechanosensors on neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets (see Ref. 11Moazzam F. DeLano F.A. Zweifach B.W. Schmid-Schonbein G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5338-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar and references therein). Shear arises from bifurcating blood vessels or rapid changes in blood vessel diameters. Shear acting on leukocytes, bound to endothelial cells, produces mechanical stress on the cells or their receptors, regulating cell growth and proliferation, protein synthesis, gene expression, and blood cell recruitment (12Ingber D.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 13Lehoux S. Tedgui A. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Integrins (such as αvβ3, α5β1, α4β1, and α2β1) on endothelial cells can act as mechanosensors to changes in blood flow (13Lehoux S. Tedgui A. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 14Chien S. Li S. Shyy Y.J. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 162-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and trigger an intracellular signaling pathway involving focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. How shear specifically induces blood cell adhesiveness or recruitment through mechanosensors is unknown. Indirect evidence shows that increased integrin binding to the extracellular matrix occurs when shear acts on cells or their mechanosensors to induce intracellular signaling. For example, intracellular signaling leads to conformational changes and activation of αvβ3 on endothelial cells and α4β1 and α5β1 integrins on monocytic cells (15Ashida N. Takechi H. Kita T. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9327-9331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Shear acting on endothelial cells affects the GTPase Rho signaling pathway and in monocytic cells induces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ release that affects cell adhesion avidity. We have used an LDV-containing small molecule fluorescent probe to determine whether mechanical stress generated by shear can affect the affinity of VLA-4 by monitoring in real time the changes in VLA-4 affinity on live cells (17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We examined the contribution of intracellular signaling mechanisms to VLA-4 activation by shear. We found that VLA-4 affinity induced by shear was intermediate in affinity between the resting state and the Mn2+-activated affinity state and similar to the physiologically activated receptor state generated using “inside-out” signaling (17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We found a temporal correlation between the intracellular Ca2+ response and the higher VLA-4 affinity. We used Ca2+ ionophores (A23187 and ionomycin) and BAPTA-AM to show that VLA-4 affinity regulation in response to shear was related to intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Finally, we pretreated cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) to block Gi signaling) and observed that VLA-4 activation was inhibited in the presence of shear. Our data suggest that shear regulates cell adhesion avidity by changing VLA-4 affinity and involves an incompletely characterized inside-out signaling pathway. Materials—The VLA-4-specific 4-(N′-2-methyphenyl)ureido)-phenylacetyl-l-leucyl-l-aspartyl-l-valyl-l-alanyl-l-lysine (LDV-containing small molecule) and its FITC-labeled analog were synthesized at Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc. (Richmond, VA). Binding and dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe were described previously (17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S.

Intracellular Ca2+ was chelated using 5,5′-dimethyl-BAPTA-AM (acetoxymethyl ester) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A23187 Ca2+ ionophore was purchased from Sigma and used at 1 μm concentration. Ionomycin was purchased from Calbiochem and used at 1 μm concentration. Fura Red AM and Fluo-4 AM were purchased from Molecular Probes. FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody, 44H6, against CD49d was purchased from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Lines and Transfectant Construct—Human monoblastoid U937 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml ciprofloxacin, 2 mm l-glutamine, at 37 °Cin a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Site-directed mutants of formyl peptide receptor in the human monoblastoid line U937 constitutively expressing human VLA-4 integrin were prepared as described (19Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). High expressors were selected using the MoFlo Flow Cytometer (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO). VLA-4 expression was measured with FITC-44H6 and quantified by comparison with a standard curve generated with Quantum Simply Cellular microspheres (Flow Cytometry Standards, San Juan, Puerto Rico) stained in parallel with the same monoclonal antibody. This produces an estimate of the total monoclonal antibody-binding sites/cell. Typically, we find 40,000–60,000 VLA-4 sites/U937 cell. LDV-FITC Probe—The VLA-4 probe (20Chen C. Mobley J.L. Dwir O.

This sequence is homologous and isosteric with the QIDS peptide found in the VCAM-1-binding site (23Wang J.H. Pepinsky R.B. Stehle T. Liu J.H. Karpusas M. Browning B. Osborn L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5714-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence (Leu-Asp-Val-Pro-Ala-Ala-Lys-FITC) of the probe was based on structure-activity relationships of a potent VLA-4 binding inhibitor (compound 13 in Ref. 22Lin K. Ateeq H.S.

The specificity of the molecule for the VCAM-1/VLA-4 interaction was examined previously in cell adhesion and ligand binding assays (17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L.

The binding characterization showed that molecular dissociation rates of the LDV-FITC probe from VLA-4 on U937 were homogenous (i.e. single exponential) regardless of the cation present (18Chigaev A. Zwartz G. Graves S.W. Dwyer D.C. Tsuji H. Foutz T.D. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

Cell Preparation—U937 cells (10 × 106 cells/ml) for shear experiments were loaded with 6 μm Fura Red or 200 nm Fluo-4, for 30–60 min at 37 °C and gently mixed every 10 min. Then the cells were washed with complete RPMI and resuspended in phenol red-deficient RPMI (supplemented with 0.1% human serum albumin (Bayer Corp., Elkhart, IN) and 1.5 mm Ca2+). Cells were kept on ice after staining and washing. Typically, 5 min prior to each experiment, 4 nm LDV-FITC probe was added as a ligand to 1 × 106 cells/ml, and the sample was incubated in a 37 °C water bath. Cells were illuminated with the 488-nm argon laser from a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Emission fluorescence was detected using a 585-nm band pass filter for Fura Red (FL2) and 530-nm band pass filter for Fluo-4 (FL1). Fura Red fluorescence decreased when the indicator bound to free Ca2+. Changes in the affinity state of VLA-4 were monitored using the LDV-FITC probe. The probe was added 5 min prior to each experiment usually at 4 nm and incubated in a 37 °C water bath. Detailed analysis of real time binding and dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe was previously described in Refs. 17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P.

In several experiments (where the extracellular Ca2+ concentration varied), Hepes buffer (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% human serum albumin was used. Cell density was determined using a Z2-Coulter counter (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Intracellular Calcium Calibration—Molecular Probes calcium calibration kit 1 was used to generate a series of free calcium buffers that were used to obtain an intracellular cellular calcium calibration curve (Fig. 1). The kits contain two 50-ml solutions, one solution containing 10 mm K2EGTA and the other 10 mm CaEGTA. Both solutions contained 100 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. Intermediate free calcium concentrations between 0 and 39 μm were obtained by cross-diluting the two buffers. Before adding U937 to each of the prepared buffers, the cells were stained with the intracellular calcium indicator Fura Red. Prior to each experiment, 1 × 106 U937 cells were added to 1 ml of a specific free calcium buffer. Then the solution was incubated for 5 min in a 37 °C water bath. A base line was established during the first 2 min of sampling with a FACScan to measure the resting state of the cells. Then 10 ng/ml of a calcium ionophore (A23187) was added and mixed gently, and sampling was resumed. Measurements of intracellular calcium were obtained when the Fura Red signal equilibrated. Fig. 1 shows that changes in the mean channel fluorescence (MCF) corresponded to logarithmic changes in the intracellular calcium levels. The intracellular Ca2+ calibration curve depended on Fura Red staining efficiency, viability of U937 cells, sensitivity of cells to external activation, and flow cytometer voltage and gain settings. The Fura Red MCF values for cellular resting states between 550 and 650 correspond to intracellular calcium concentrations between 100 and 10 nm. MCF values of ∼400 after stimulation indicate an intracellular calcium concentration of ≥1000 nm. Creating Fluid Shear—Fluid shear was initially generated using a Fischer Scientific minivortexer (Fischer Scientific, Hampton, NH) set to 3200 rpm. The shear rate was estimated to be ∼200–12,000 s–1, comparing the vortexed fluid motion inside a 12 (outer diameter) × 75-mm tube with the fluid motion inside a Couette viscometer. The maximum (Smax) and minimum (Smin) wall shear rate for a given rotational velocity was approximated (24Turitto V.T. Goldsmith H.L. Loscalzo J. Creager M.A. Dzau V.J. Vascular Medicine. Little, Brown, and Company, Boston1996: 141Google Scholar) as follows, Smin=2×RO2×Ω/(RO2−RI2)(Eq. 1) Smax=2×RI2×Ω/(RO2−RI2)(Eq. 2) where RI (ranging from ∼0.535 to 0.25 cm) and RO (0.55 cm) represent radii of the inner fluid and outer fluid surfaces, and Ω is the angular speed of the inner cylinder. Before being subjected to shear, U937 cells were incubated for 5 min ina37 °C water bath. Each sample was gently mixed to resuspend cells, and a tube was attached to a flow cytometer. Data were acquired for 1–3 min to establish a base line for resting cells, and then each sample was removed from the flow cytometer to be exposed to shear for 5–30 s using a minivortexer. Samples were reattached to the flow cytometer, and data sampling was resumed. A minivortexer generates turbulent fluid flow. To reduce this variability, we used a computer-driven syringe (Alitea, Bellevue, WA) to push samples through a 50-cm-long 0.03-inch (762-μm) inner diameter fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) at flow rates of 33, 100, 200, and 400 μl/s. The capillary wall shear rates (Swall) were calculated using the following, Swall=4×Q/π×r3(Eq. 3) where Q represents the flow rate, and r is the tube radius (the corresponding wall shear rates were calculated to be 750, 2300, 4600, and 9200 s–1, respectively), which was the maximal shear rate cells would experience (24Turitto V.T. Goldsmith H.L. Loscalzo J. Creager M.A. Dzau V.J. Vascular Medicine. Little, Brown, and Company, Boston1996: 141Google Scholar). For deformable particulates, such as cells, there is a net radial hydrodynamic force moving particulates toward the flow axis (25Chien S. Usami S. Skalak R. Renkin E.M. Michel C.C. Geiger S.R. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1984: 225Google Scholar), even at a low Reynolds number. Thus, not all cells flow along a capillary wall (maximal shear rate) or capillary axis (zero shear rate). Consequently, there was a range of shear experienced by flowing cells, and the maximal shear rate does not represent the shear experienced by all cells. For a simple approximation, we have assumed an average shear rate (between the maximum and minimum shear rate experienced by cells) for the four flow rates to be 375, 1150, 2300, and 4600 s–1. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of capillary shear. Typically, a 1-ml sample containing 1 × 106 U937 cells was aspirated into a 1-ml computer-driven syringe. After the sample was loaded into a syringe, the sample was pushed into a FEP tube at one of the four flow rates to generate shear. When that cycle was completed, the sample was aspirated into the same syringe. This cycle was repeated five times. After the fifth cycle, a computer-operated solenoid valve (NResearch, Caldwell, NJ), used to separate the shear FEP line from an FEP line leading to a FACScan, was switched to allow samples to be pushed toward a FAC-Scan at 1 μl/s. Flow Cytometry and Data Analysis—Flow cytometric analysis was done on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data acquisition was performed using CellQuest (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed offline using the Windows Multiple Document Interface Flow Cytometry Interface (Scripps, La Jolla, CA). Time and fluorescence information were extracted from the data using FacsQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. Peak analysis and data fitting were done using PeakFit version 4.11 (Systat, Point Richmond, CA) and GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), respectively. A ligand dissociation analysis would not readily distinguish heterogeneity in the affinity of resting and activated receptors on a given cell as compared with heterogeneity in the distribution of receptors on activated and resting cells. However, the distribution of the amount of ligand bound would distinguish cells that had activated receptors from cells that did not. Thus, we have analyzed cell distributions before and after activation as shown in Fig. 3, regions A and B. The same principles were used for the analysis of ligand binding and Ca2+ response. For this analysis, a Gaussian curve was fitted to the mean channel fluorescence distribution obtained from region A, the resting state of cells. Region B was fitted with two Gaussian curves. One fit used the peak centroid and the full-width half maximum of Region A. The peak height was allowed to vary. This component represents resting cells. A second Gaussian curve was fitted to the remainder of the distribution in which the centroid and peak height were allowed to vary but full-width half-maximum was fixed using the fit values obtained from Region A. The second curve represented activated cells. A simultaneous two-Gaussian fit to the mean channel fluorescence distribution obtained from Region B was done. The ratio of the total events under the two histograms was taken to estimate the fraction of cells activated under shear ((resting–activated)/activated). Fluid Forces Increase the Affinity of the α4β1 Integrin in Real Time—Studies were conducted in a turbulent fluid flow environment using a Fischer Scientific minivortexer. To determine whether shear can affect the affinity of VLA-4, we used the LDV-FITC probe (17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Prior to applying shear, U937 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were equilibrated with 4 nm probe. The concentration chosen for the experiments was below the dissociation constant (Kd of ∼12 nm) for probe binding to resting VLA-4 and above the Kd for the physiologically activated receptor (Kd of ∼1–2nm) (17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transition from the low affinity to the high affinity receptor leads to an increased binding of the probe (from ∼25 to ∼75% of receptor occupancy). Fig. 4 shows the rapid and transient increase in probe binding to sheared cells. The binding of the probe was detected after data acquisition was re-established, indicating that seconds were needed to induce cell activation. The binding reached a peak at 40–60 s after vortexing and decreased to the basal level after another 40–60 s. For comparison, we show the conformational state induced by 1 mm Mn2+ (Kd ∼0.5 nm and occupancy ∼90%) in the buffer containing 1 mm Mn2+ and 1 mm Ca2+ (18Chigaev A. Zwartz G. Graves S.W. Dwyer D.C. Tsuji H. Foutz T.D. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38174-38182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that Mn2+ increased probe binding above the level detected for shear. Affinity Changes in a Controlled Fluid Force Environment— The range of shear rates was narrowed with computer-driven syringes and capillary tubes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3, A and B, shows the kinetics of intracellular Ca2+ (determined using Fluo-4) and VLA-4 probe binding in response to the different levels of shear rates. The percentage of activated cells was calculated from Regions A and B in Fig. 3, A and B, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resting state and shear histograms were normalized to the largest value in each of their distributions. Fig. 3, C and D, show how shear affected the number of activated cells. Those results are quantified in Fig. 3E, where the fraction of activated cells versus shear stress, fit to a hyperbolic equation, were comparable for both the LDV-FITC probe and intracellular Ca2+ responses. Simultaneous Observation of Integrin Activation and Intracellular Ca2+Elevation in Response to Fluid Forces—To follow VLA-4 affinity changes simultaneously with intracellular Ca2+ responses, the cells were stained with both Fura Red and the LDV-FITC probe. In several experiments, we used Fluo-4 to detect intracellular Ca2+ and VLA-4 activity in parallel. Fig. 5A shows Ca2+ and LDV-FITC binding responses after U937 cells were vortexed at 3200 rpm for 5, 15, and 30 s. The Fura Red fluorescent signal decreased as the intracellular Ca2+ concentration increased (the Fura Red axis in Fig. 5A is inverted). A transient and dose-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ was accompanied by an increase in the binding of the LDV-FITC probe. The kinetics of probe binding was similar, but the amplitude of signal was dependent on the duration of shear, reflecting differences in the number of activated cells (see “Affinity Changes in a Controlled Fluid Force Environment” and Fig. 3). Fig. 5B shows a representative fluid flow experiment using a computer-driven syringe to produce a maximum wall shear rate of 9200 s–1 (average shear rate of 4600 s–1; see “Creating Fluid Forces”). Resting cells were delivered to the flow cytometer at 1 μl/s for 1–2 min to obtain a base line. Then cells were sheared for ∼30 s and delivered to the flow cytometer at 1 μl/s. Both the LDV-FITC probe binding and the intracellular Ca2+ signal increased and returned to their resting state at similar rates. The signal decay kinetics was significantly longer after capillary shear than for vortexing (compare Figs. 5B and 3, A and B, with Figs. 5A and 4). The kinetics of intracellular Ca2+ signaling as well as binding and dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe, observed simultaneously, vary in parallel in response to vortexing or capillary fluid flow. Intracellular Ca2+and Integrin Affinity Changes—To show the effect of intracellular Ca2+ on VLA-4 affinity, we activated cells through their G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), added Ca2+ ionophores (ionomycin and A23187), and chelated intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA. It is known that VLA-4 can be activated through formyl peptide, CXCR2, CXCR4, and CCR3 receptors (17Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S.

Fig. 6 shows that the addition of 1 μm ATP results in rapid increases in the Ca2+ signal with slower LDV-FITC probe binding of amplitude similar to 30 s of vortexing. The binding of the LDV-FITC probe to the cells was limited by the rate of probe binding (kon ∼3–5 × 106m–1 s–1) and was somewhat slower than the actual VLA-4 activation rate (for comparison, see the probe binding kinetics in response to Mn2+) (Fig. 4) (17Chigaev A.

https://openalex.org/W1970554305,"The oxidative folding and reductive unfolding pathways of leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI; four disulfides) have been characterized in this work by structural and kinetic analysis of the acid-trapped folding intermediates. The oxidative folding of reduced and denatured LCI proceeds rapidly through a sequential flow of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-disulfide (scrambled) species to reach the native form. Folding intermediates of LCI comprise two predominant 3-disulfide species (designated as III-A and III-B) and a heterogeneous population of scrambled isomers that consecutively accumulate along the folding reaction. Our study reveals that forms III-A and III-B exclusively contain native disulfide bonds and correspond to stable and partially structured species that interconvert, reaching an equilibrium prior to the formation of the scrambled isomers. Given that these intermediates act as kinetic traps during the oxidative folding, their accumulation is prevented when they are destabilized, thus leading to a significant acceleration of the folding kinetics. III-A and III-B forms appear to have both native disulfides bonds and free thiols similarly protected from the solvent; major structural rearrangements through the formation of scrambled isomers are required to render native LCI. The reductive unfolding pathway of LCI undergoes an apparent all-or-none mechanism, although low amounts of intermediates III-A and III-B can be detected, suggesting differences in protection against reduction among the disulfide bonds. The characterization of III-A and III-B forms shows that the former intermediate structurally and functionally resembles native LCI, whereas the III-B form bears more resemblance to scrambled isomers. The oxidative folding and reductive unfolding pathways of leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI; four disulfides) have been characterized in this work by structural and kinetic analysis of the acid-trapped folding intermediates. The oxidative folding of reduced and denatured LCI proceeds rapidly through a sequential flow of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-disulfide (scrambled) species to reach the native form.

The new view of protein folding, which has emerged in the recent years from a combination of experimental work and theoretical approximations, postulates the folding process as a parallel flow of molecules that follow multiple folding routes to reach the native state (1Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar, 2Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As folding proceeds, some semistable conformations corresponding to local free energy minima (intermediates) may be transiently accumulated, acting as kinetic traps (3Wolynes P.G. Onuchic J.N. Thirumalai D. Science. 1995; 267: 1619-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding protein folding requires identification of the intermediate(s) that form(s) along the preferential pathways leading from the unfolded state to the native form (4Bai Y. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Science. 1995; 269: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, characterizing kinetic folding intermediates is usually a difficult issue because of their short half-life. An important part of our knowledge about the role and nature of intermediates along the folding process comes from studies of disulfide-rich proteins in which transient folding forms have been trapped and characterized (5Creighton T.E. Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Faseb J. 1996; 10: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Oxidative folding is one of the well-established methods used to analyze the folding of disulfide-containing proteins (6Creighton T.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

For these proteins, the folding pathway is characterized and defined by the heterogeneity and structures of the disulfide isomers that accumulate along the folding process. Folding intermediates can be trapped by acidification of the protein solution and separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; CD, circular dichroism; CP, carboxypeptidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; D/H, deuterium/proton; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; LCI, leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor; MALDI-TOF/MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/mass spectrometry; PCI, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor. which allows their further structural characterization. Application of the oxidative folding and acid-trapping method has allowed the elucidation of folding pathways of several 3-disulfide proteins such as hirudin (15Chatrenet B. Chang J.Y. J. Biol.

However, few models aside from ribonuclease A (RNase A) and α-lactalbumin (αLA) have been studied in detail among 4-disulfide proteins (25Scheraga H.A. Konishi Y. Ooi T. Adv. Biophys. 1984; 18: 21-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Welker E. Narayan M. Volles M.J. Scheraga H.A.

In these cases, analysis of the folding pathway represents another level of technical challenge because of the increase in the number of possible disulfide intermediates. The above-mentioned studies have not indicated any predominant folding scenario, and even among small 3-disulfide proteins the folding mechanism varies substantially. For proteins as BPTI, intermediates with native disulfide bonds and native-like structures prevail along the folding pathway (10Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 11Goldenberg D.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The non-covalent interactions that stabilize the native BPTI play a crucial role in guiding the early folding events and hence dictate the formation of a limited number of intermediates that admit the prevalence of native disulfides. In the case of hirudin and PCI, two other 3-disulfide proteins, folding proceeds through an initial nonspecific disulfide pairing (packing) that leads to the formation of a heterogeneous population of 3-disulfide scrambled isomers; this is followed by disulfide reshuffling (consolidation) of these intermediates to finally acquire the native form (15Chatrenet B. Chang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the latter proteins, noncovalent interactions do not seem to participate significantly in guiding protein folding during the early phase of nonspecific packing. Within this context, folding studies of novel protein models are required to better understand the underlying causes of such a diversity of disulfide folding pathways. Leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI) is a 66-residue cysteine-rich protein that folds in a compact domain consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a short α-helix, as reported by our group (Fig. 1) (33Reverter D. Fernandez-Catalan C. Baumgartner R. Pfander R. Huber R. Bode W. Vendrell J. Holak T.A. Aviles F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The molecule is stabilized by four disulfide bridges, which are all located within secondary structure elements (Fig. 1). LCI is a potent metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor that binds tightly to pancreatic carboxypeptidases A1, A2, B (CPA1, CPA2, CPB) and to plasma CPB, also called thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) (34Reverter D.

Assuming that leeches secrete LCI during feeding, LCI may participate in the elimination of blood clots by inhibiting TAFI, an enzyme shown to retard fibrinolysis (35Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 36Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C.M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1566-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). LCI could help to maintain the liquid state of the blood during feeding and possibly block the host defense mechanisms involving mast cell proteases (33Reverter D. Fernandez-Catalan C. Baumgartner R. Pfander R. Huber R. Bode W. Vendrell J. Holak T.A. Aviles F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The profibrinolytic effect of LCI has been demonstrated in vitro, suggesting a potential pharmacological application in thrombotic diseases. 2S. Salamanca, J. Lorenzo, A. Rovira, M. Borrell, J. Vendrell, F. X. Aviles, H. Fritz, and C. P. Sommerhoff, manuscript in preparation. We have recently described both, the unfolding pathway and thermodynamic stability (37Salamanca S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Li L. Aviles F.X. Chang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17538-17543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the oxidative folding process of this protein (38Salamanca S. Li L. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6754-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), showing that 3- and 4-disulfide intermediates act as kinetic traps along its folding pathway. In the present work, we study in depth the kinetic, thermodynamic, conformational, and functional properties of several disulfide intermediates along the pathways of oxidative folding and reductive unfolding of LCI. Materials—Recombinant LCI was obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli with an added glycine at the N terminus. The protein was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a TSK-DEAE column (Tosohaas), followed by RP-HPLC (34Reverter D. Vendrell J. Canals F. Horstmann J. Aviles F.X. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32927-32933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was more than 99% pure, as judged by HPLC analysis. The chromogenic substrates N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH and N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Arg-OH were obtained from Bachem. Bovine CPA was purchased from Sigma. Human CPA1, CPA2, and CPB were prepared following described procedures (39Reverter D. Ventura S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3535-3541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol (DTT), guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), thermolysin (P-1512), and 2-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Sigma with purities greater than 99%. Oxidative Folding of Fully Reduced LCI—Native LCI (1 mg) was reduced and denatured in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 8 m GdnHCl and 50 mm DTT, at 22 °C for 2 h. To initiate folding, the sample was passed through a PD-10 column (Sephadex-25, Amersham Biosciences), previously equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4). Reduced and denatured LCI was recovered in 1.2 ml and immediately diluted to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the same Tris-HCl buffer, both in the absence (control, –) and presence (control, +) of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Folding intermediates of LCI were trapped in a time course manner at selected times by mixing aliquots of the sample with 2% trifluoroacetic acid. Trapped folding intermediates were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Analysis of the Folding Intermediates of LCI by RP-HPLC—Analysis and isolation of folding intermediates of LCI were achieved by RP-HPLC using the following conditions. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column used was a 4.6 mm Protein C4 (Vydac). A linear 20–40% gradient of solvent B was applied over 50 min, with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Stop/Go Folding—Acid-trapped intermediates were isolated by RP-HPLC, freeze-dried, and allowed to carry on the folding by dissolving the sample (0.5 mg/ml) in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4), both in the absence and presence of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Folding intermediates were trapped with 2% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Scrambled isomers of LCI were separated from 3-disulfide intermediates by treatment with vinylpyridine and further isolation by RP-HPLC. Oxidative Folding of LCI in the Presence of Denaturants—The procedures of unfolding and refolding were as described in the oxidative folding experiments. Immediately after the desalting of unfolded LCI through a PD-10 column, selected concentrations of denaturants (0.5–5 m GdnHCl, 1–8 m urea) were added. Folding intermediates were similarly trapped by acidification and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Reductive Unfolding—Native LCI and the 3-disulfide intermediates (0.5 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) with different concentrations of DTT (0.1–100 mm). Reduction was carried out at 22 °C. To monitor the kinetics of unfolding, time course aliquots of the samples were trapped with 2% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by RP-HPLC. In addition, native LCI was dissolved in the abovementioned Tris-HCl buffer containing selected concentrations of GdnHCl or urea. Aliquots of the samples were likewise removed at different time intervals, trapped with acid, and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Disulfide Pairing Analysis of the Major Intermediates in the LCI Reductive Unfolding—The acid-trapped intermediates were purified by RP-HPLC and freeze-dried. Each sample (20 μg) was derivatized with either 50 μl of vinylpyridine (0.1 m) in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) or with 500 μl of vinylpyridine (0.25 m) in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 6.4) at 22 °C for 45 min. The vinylpyridine-derivatized samples were further purified by RP-HPLC, freeze-dried, and treated with 2 μg of thermolysin in 30 μl of N-ethylmorpholine/acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.4). Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h. Thermolytic products were then purified by RP-HPLC using a 4.6 mm Vydac C18 column (a linear gradient from 0 to 60% solvent B in 60 min) and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Disulfide-containing peptides were further reduced with 10 mm tributylphosphin and analyzed by MS to identify their peptidic composition. The N-terminal sequence of selected peptides was also analyzed by automated Edman degradation. Deuterium to Proton Exchange Followed by MS—Acid-trapped intermediates were isolated by RP-HPLC and freeze-dried. The samples (50 μg) were resuspended in deuterated glycine buffer (20 mm, pD 2.5), incubated at 90 °C for 2.5 h to exchange all labile protons and then maintained at room temperature for 1 h to promote protein refolding. The deuterated proteins were diluted 1:4 with ammonium citrate (50 mm, pH 4.0) to start the hydrogen exchange. Aliquots were taken at different time points and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) until an exchange plateau was reached. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and matrix solution (sinapic acid in 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). At each exchange time, six samples were analyzed by duplicate. The average of the mass values, corresponding to the centroid of the peaks, was calculated for each exchange time and compared with an external unlabeled control, whose mass was determined by duplicate measurements. Mass Spectrometry and Amino Acid Sequencing—The molecular masses of disulfide-containing peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF/MS on a Bruker Ultraflex spectrometer. Samples for the deuterium to proton (D/H) exchange experiments were analyzed by the same spectrometer. The amino acid sequences of selected thermolytic peptides were analyzed by automatic Edman degradation using a Beckman LF3000 Protein Sequencer. Circular Dichroism and NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving the protein to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.0). CD analyses were carried out in a Jasco J-715 spectrometer at 25 °C using a cell of 2-mm path length. Protein samples for 1H NMR experiments were prepared by dissolving the protein in H2O/D2O (9:1 ratio, v/v) with a concentration of 1 mg/ml at pH 2.0. NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX 500-MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. CP Inhibitory Activity—The inhibitory activity of selected LCI folding intermediates was assayed by measuring the inhibition of the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH by CPAs and N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Arg-OH by CPB. The assay was performed in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, with a substrate concentration of 100 μm. The inhibition constants (Ki) for the complexes of LCI intermediates with different carboxypeptidases were determined at the presteady-state as described for tightly binding inhibitors (40Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the LCI intermediates was determined from the A280 of the solution (LCI extinction coefficient: E0.1% = 2.12). Accumulation of 3-Disulfide Intermediates and Scrambled Isomers Along the Oxidative Folding Pathway of LCI—Oxidative folding of fully reduced LCI was carried out in the Tris-HCl buffer in the absence and presence of 2-mercaptoethanol as thiol catalyst. The RP-HPLC profiles of acid-trapped folding intermediates at selected time points are shown in Fig. 2. A high degree of heterogeneity of intermediates is observed at the beginning of the folding reaction, with identical RP-HPLC profiles in both refolding conditions (control – and control +). This initial stage is followed by the accumulation of two fractions (III-A and III-B) of major intermediates that act as kinetic traps. At this point (at 8 h), the RP-HPLC patterns are similar regardless of the presence of a reducing agent. The last stage of the folding process is characterized by an accumulation of a heterogeneous population of intermediates, which is more pronounced when the refolding is performed in the absence of a thiol catalyst (control –). Purified intermediates from the RP-HPLC analyses were derivatized with vinylpyridine, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS to evaluate the disulfide bond content of the folding intermediates. Folding of LCI was shown to undergo a sequential conversion through 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-disulfide intermediates to reach the native structure (data not shown). Both 3-disulfide (III-A and III-B) and a mixture of non-native 4-disulfide (scrambled) isomers co-exist as folding intermediates and major kinetic traps of LCI folding. The folding of LCI cannot reach completion in the absence of a thiol catalyst, indicated by the fact that only ∼30% of the protein was recovered in the native form after 48 h of refolding (Fig. 2). In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, the recovery of native LCI was more than 90%, confirming the role of this redox agent in promoting the disulfide reshuffling and the conversion of scrambled forms to their native conformation. Evolution of the 3-Disulfide Intermediates and Scrambled Isomers along the Oxidative Folding Pathway of LCI—Our previous study on the oxidative folding of LCI revealed the presence of at least two 3-disulfide intermediates (III-A1 and III-A2) in fraction III-A and one 3-disulfide intermediate in fraction III-B after 8 h of refolding (38Salamanca S. Li L. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6754-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Assignment of their disulfide pairings showed that isomers III-A2 and III-B contain three native disulfide bonds: Cys11-Cys34, Cys18-Cys62 and either Cys19-Cys43 or Cys22-Cys58, respectively, while isomer III-A1 contains one native and two non-native disulfide bonds: Cys11-Cys34, Cys19-Cys62, and Cys18-Cys43. In the present work, purified fractions III-A and III-B from different refolding time points were derivatized with vinylpyridine (at pH 8.4), and analyzed by RP-HPLC in order to know their composition in disulfide isomers along the folding process. The analysis showed that fraction III-B only contains one predominant 3-disulfide intermediate along the reaction, with the three native disulfide bonds previously described (data not shown). In contrast, within fraction III-A other 3-disulfide bonded forms were detected apart from the two previously characterized species (III-A1 and III-A2). This heterogeneity was not observed when the derivatization with vinylpyridine was performed at pH 6.4 with a lower protein concentration (data not shown). This fact suggests that such heterogeneity could be an artifact caused by the working pH (8.4), the high protein concentration and the conformation of the intermediates, since all these factors might affect the disulfide exchange rate. Structural analysis of the only species observed at pH 6.4 shows that it corresponds to the folding intermediate III-A2. Therefore, from now on, this species will be designated in the text as III-A. Thus, both 3-disulfide kinetic traps that populate LCI folding (III-A and III-B) correspond to species containing three native disulfide bridges. To further assess the kinetic role of the 3-disulfide intermediates and scrambled 4-disulfide isomers, we performed stop/go experiments on these species. Acid-trapped intermediates III-A and III-B were isolated and allowed to resume the folding in the absence and presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The data presented in Fig. 3 clearly show how such intermediates interconvert along the folding reaction reaching an equilibrium that is slightly biased toward the III-A intermediate and finally form the 4-disulfide scrambled isomers. At this initial stage the RP-HPLC profiles are indistinguishable regardless of the presence of the thiol catalyst, suggesting that scrambled forms are not yet formed. The equilibrium, which is reached faster beginning from the III-B form than from the III-A form, would represent a rate-limiting step for the folding of LCI. Acid-trapped 4-disulfide (scrambled) isomers were also isolated, separated from 3-disulfide intermediates by treatment with vinylpyridine (which only modifies the latter) followed by RP-HPLC, and allowed to resume the folding in the absence and presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The reshuffling of non-native 4-disulfide isomers into the native disulfide-bonding pattern takes place directly and supposes yet another rate-limiting step for the folding of LCI (Fig. 3). As expected, in the stop/go experiments of scrambled forms the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol strongly promotes rearrangements, allowing conversion of more than 90% of the scrambled forms into native LCI, while in the absence of the redox agent only ∼7% of the protein is recovered as native form at the end of the process. Oxidative Folding of LCI in the Presence of Denaturants— Oxidative folding of LCI was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl or urea in order to evaluate the influence of denaturant on the prevalence of the 3-disulfide intermediates formed during the LCI folding process (Fig. 4). The comparison of these results with the control folding experiments in Fig. 2 shows that the accumulation of 3-disulfide intermediates decreases in the presence of higher denaturant concentrations. Intermediates III-A and III-B still accumulate under low denaturing conditions (up to 2 m urea concentration), being an indication of the high stability of these species (Fig. 4A). We can also observe a higher prevalence of intermediate III-A under these folding conditions. Interestingly, the higher recovery of native LCI in the presence of 0.5–1 m GdnHCl correlates with a lower accumulation of 3-disulfide intermediates at these conditions (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the refolding process performed in the presence of 1–2 m urea does not alter native LCI recovery. The folding pathway of LCI drastically changed when the refolding experiments were carried out at high denaturing conditions (more than 2 m GdnHCl or 4 m urea). Examination of time course trapped intermediates revealed that 3-disulfide species no longer accumulate in these conditions and that the reshuffling of the accumulated heterogeneous 4-disulfide scrambled isomers becomes the rate-limiting step of the folding reaction (Fig. 5). Important differences in native LCI recovery are observed in the absence and presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. For instance, when fully reduced LCI is allowed to refold in the presence of 4 m GdnHCl and 2-mercaptoethanol, ∼35% of the protein attains the native structure after 24 h of refolding, while less than ∼2% is obtained in absence of the thiol catalyst (Fig. 5).

The 2A protein of the human parechovirus 1 (HPEV1) has been shown to lack the proteolytic activity found in many other picornaviruses, but no particular function has been identified for HPEV1 2A. To obtain information about the role of HPEV1 2A in the viral life cycle, the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. A polyclonal antibody was then raised against the protein and employed to investigate its subcellular localization in the infected cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Typically, a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern, concentrated to the perinuclear area, was observed in the infected cells. However, at late stages of infection some infected cells also exhibited diffuse nuclear staining. Viral RNA, visualized by fluorescent in situ hybridization, partly colocalized with 2A in the perinuclear region. Three experimental approaches including Northwestern blot, UV cross-linking, and gel retardation demonstrated that 2A possesses RNA binding activity. Competition experiments with various single-stranded RNA molecules addressed the specificity of 2A binding. These studies revealed that the 2A protein bound RNA corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome with highest affinity. At the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein, two regions, necessary for RNA binding, were identified by mutagenesis. In addition, we demonstrated that 2A has affinity to double-stranded RNA containing 3′UTR(+)-3′UTR(-). In conclusion, our experiments showed that HPEV1 2A binds to viral 3′UTR RNA, a feature that could be important for the function of the protein during HPEV1 replication.

HPEV1 is a member of the Parechovirus genus of the family Picornaviridae. It is a small non-enveloped RNA virus with a single-stranded genome of positive polarity, ∼7.4 kb in length. The genome encodes a large polyprotein, which is subsequently processed by virus-specific proteolytic activity to produce polypeptides involved in virus replication and virion assembly. Upstream of the open reading frame there is a long 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) that is covalently linked to a small VPg protein. Downstream there is a 3′UTR and poly(A) (1Stanway G. Hyypia T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5249-5254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyprotein processing reactions occurring in the sequences bordering the 2A polypeptide show major differences among picornaviruses. In entero- and rhinoviruses, the 2A protein is a trypsin-like cysteine protease that is responsible for the cis cleavage at its own N terminus between the VP1 capsid protein and 2A. The trans-cleavage activity of 2A processes cellular factors, including eukaryotic initiation factor-4 (p220) (2Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Toyoda H. Etchison D. Wimmer E. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7215-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment has revealed that the parechovirus 2A protein differs considerably from the corresponding proteins in other picornaviruses (15Hyypia T. Horsnell C. Maaronen M. Khan M. Kalkkinen N. Auvinen P. Kinnunen L. Stanway G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Hughes P.J. Stanway G. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In vitro translation experiments have further shown that HPEV1 2A has no autocatalytic proteolytic activity (17Schultheiss T. Emerson S.U. Purcell R.H. Gauss-Muller V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, sequence analysis of 2A has revealed that the protease domain and the Asn-Pro-Gly-Pro (NPGP) peptide motif involved in protein processing are absent from the parechovirus, hepatitis A virus, and Aichi virus 2A proteins (16Hughes P.J. Stanway G. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Palmenberg A.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently (16Hughes P.J. Stanway G. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that the 2A proteins of these three picornavirus groups are related to each other and, additionally, to a recently identified family of cellular H box/NC proteins, which are possibly involved in the control of cell proliferation. As an initial approach toward determining the function of the human parechovirus 2A, we expressed 2A in Escherichia coli, raised a polyclonal antibody reactive against the 2A protein, and studied its cellular localization relative to viral plus strand RNA in HPEV1-infected cells by conventional immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Analysis of the properties of 2A by Northwestern blot, gel retardation, and UV cross-linking revealed that the protein exhibits RNA binding activity. We also analyzed the relative selectivity of the binding of 2A to RNA and mapped the regions in the polypeptide important for RNA binding. Furthermore, we found that 2A binds RNA in a cooperative manner and has affinity to double-stranded RNA. Based on its localization in the infected cells and RNA-binding properties, we suggest that 2A is involved in HPEV1 RNA replication. Plasmid pHPEV1 (kindly provided by G. Stanway, University of Essex, Colchester, UK), a full-length genomic cDNA clone of HPEV1 capable of generating RNA transcripts (15Hyypia T. Horsnell C. Maaronen M. Khan M. Kalkkinen N. Auvinen P. Kinnunen L. Stanway G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), was used as the parental plasmid for the cloning experiments. To clone and subsequently express 2A in pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pQE-30 (Qiagen) plasmid vectors, PCR amplifications were performed using a common 3′-oligonucleotide primer (2A) and respective 5′-oligonucleotide primers shown in Table I. The PCR products were cloned into the vectors using standard molecular biology protocols (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to obtain the 2ApGEX4T-1 and 2ApQE-30 constructs. All the constructs were verified by sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides used in PCR amplificationNamePolaritySequence (5′-3′)2ApGEXSenseCACTACCCGGGAGGTCAACAACCACAGAATCGT2ApQESenseTAATAAGGATCCAGTCCATATGGTCAACAACCACAG2AAntisenseGCAGGTCGACTTATTGCTCATCGCCATCTATGGC2A(10-24)SenseTATGGCATTATAGTTGGAGACCATGTGTAC2A(10-24)AntisenseATTCTGTGGTTGTTGACCATATGGACT2A(43-56)SenseTTGACTTCAGATTGGGTTATTGAAGAAGAG2A(43-56)AntisenseGAAAATGTCATCTGAATCTAGTTGGTACAC2A(130-150)AntisenseAGAGTCGACTTAGGTTTTTATAGTTGACAT2A(108-150)AntisenseAGAGTCGACTTAGCTTAGTGTATGGGTTCC5′UTRSenseAGAATTCTTTGAAAGGGGTCTCCTAGAG5′UTRAntisenseCGAGTCGACAATGTCAATATTAACAATAAA5′UTR(70)AntisenseACCGTCGACCTCCTAGAGAAGCTCAGCAAG5′UTR(365)AntisenseTACGTCGACTCCCACATCTCACCAGACATT3′UTRSenseCGAATTCTAAGATTAATGTTTGTT3′UTRAntisenseACAGTCGACGTCATGTCCAATGTTCCA Open table in a new tab PCR amplifications were carried out using DyNazyme (Finnzymes) DNA polymerase, pHPEV1 cDNA as a template, and 5′-oligonucleotide primer (2ApQE) as a common primer. Oligonucleotides 2A(130-150) and 2A(108-150) (Table I) were used as 3′-primers to produce C-terminal deletion mutants CΔ130-150 and CΔ108-150, respectively. The PCR products were cleaved with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the pQE-30 vector. To introduce the deletions into the 2A sequence, the 2ApQE-30 construct was used as a template for specific PCR-based mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The internal oligonucleotide primers 2A(10-24) and 2A(43-56) (Table I) were used to produce deletion mutants NΔ10-24 and NΔ43-56, respectively. The PCR products were treated with DpnI (New England Biolabs) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and self-ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). All the constructs were verified by sequencing. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with 2ApGEX4T-1, and strain M15 [pREP4] was transformed with 2ApQE-30 or its derivatives and grown to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm in Luria broth. The protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were grown for 3 h at 30 °C and collected by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min). The proteins were purified under native conditions on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in the case of GST-2A or on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) in the case of His-2A according to the manufacturer's protocols. Polyclonal antiserum against 2A was produced by immunization of a rabbit with purified GST-2A. The viral 5′UTR, 3′UTR, and the 70 nucleotide fragments of the 5′UTR, 5′UTR(70) and 5′UTR(295-365) sequences, were PCR-amplified by using the pHPEV1 cDNA clone as a template. The primers used for the construction of UTR are shown in Table I. The oligonucleotide sequences incorporated either EcoRI or SalI restriction sites (Table I, underlined). The amplified sequences were cloned into pGEM3Z vector (Promega) by using standard molecular biology protocols (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resulting constructs allowed synthesis of positive and negative strand RNA transcripts under control of Sp6 or T7 RNA polymerases. Nonradioactive transcription reactions were carried out in a reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2,10mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 5 mm each NTP, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 10 μg of linearized plasmid, and 30 units of the appropriate RNA polymerase (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C. 20 units of RNase-free DNase (Promega) was added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. 33P-Labeled RNAs were synthesized in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-33P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.5 mm of unlabeled UTP. The transcripts were extracted with phenol/chloroform and filtered through a Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences) spin column. The newly synthesized RNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and their sizes were compared with those of RNA markers. In the case of radiolabeled RNA probes, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. The transcripts were quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and, in the case of the radiolabeled transcripts, also by Cerenkov counting. Plasmid pHPEV1 was used to synthesize full-length transcripts of positive or negative polarity by linearization/transcription reactions using MluI/T7 RNA polymerase or SacI/T3 RNA polymerase, respectively. Plasmid pGEM3Z was used to synthesize control transcripts by linearization/transcription reactions using EcoRI/T7 or SalI/Sp6 RNA polymerase. Human lung carcinoma (A549, ATCC) cells were grown on glass coverslips and infected with HPEV1 at ∼5 multiplicity of infection. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 0.01% glutaraldehyde, followed by permeabilization in 0.3% Triton X-100. The preparations were quenched using 0.5 m NH4Cl and, subsequently, washed three times with PBS. The coverslips (infected cells and mock-infected controls) were incubated with the primary antibody (dilution 1:150), followed by a goat anti-rabbit TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) or, for colocalization experiments, a goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted in glycerol containing 4% N-propyl gallate (Sigma) and analyzed by using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope using appropriate filters. To visualize HPEV1(+)-stranded RNA in the infected cells, an Alexa 546-labeled riboprobe representing (-)-polarity of HPEV1 RNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription reaction as described (20Egger D. Bolten R. Rahner C. Bienz K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Bolten R. Egger D. Gosert R. Schaub G. Landmann L. Bienz K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8578-8585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Krogerus C. Egger D. Samuilova O. Hyypia T. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8512-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells grown as monolayers on glass coverslips were infected and fixed with paraformaldehyde and hybridized with the probe at 42 °C overnight (22Krogerus C. Egger D. Samuilova O. Hyypia T. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8512-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or, for colocalization experiments, at 37 °C for 8 h. The coverslips were mounted in glycerol containing 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Sigma). Confocal microscopy was done with a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS4D; Leica Lasertechnik). For colocalization, pictures were recorded sequentially. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Northwestern Assay—RNA binding assay with the membrane-bound proteins was performed as described previously (23Kalinina N.O. Fedorkin O.N. Samuilova O.V. Maiss E. Korpela T. Morozov S.Yu. Atabekov J.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 μg of the protein was run in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After incubation in denaturation buffer (6 m urea, 0.01% Tween 20), the membrane was renatured at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1× Denhardt's reagent. Next, the membrane was probed with radiolabeled RNA corresponding to the full-length (+)-HPEV1 RNA. After five washes, the membrane was dried and subjected to autoradiography. UV Cross-linking/Label Transfer Assay—Radiolabeled RNA probe (25 ng) was incubated with 2A (0.75 μg) in binding buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) in a total volume of 15 μl at room temperature for 45 min. UV cross-linking was carried out as described previously (24Daros J.A. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1997; 27: 327-336Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mixtures were placed as drops on a microwell plate and irradiated on ice with UV light (254 nm, 0.8 J/cm2) using Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). Nonprotected RNA was digested for 30 min at 37 °C by addition of 10 μg of RNase A (Promega). In a control reaction, the RNase treatment was omitted. The protein-RNA complexes were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Fuji) or autoradiography. For competition binding experiments, radiolabeled pGEM3Z RNA probe (56 nm) was incubated with the 2A protein without or in the presence of the single-stranded unlabeled RNA competitors in various concentrations (as indicated in Fig. 3D). The unlabeled RNA competitors used for competitions are as follows: the fragment containing first 70 nucleotides from the 5′-terminal end of HPEV1 RNA genome, 5′UTR(70); the 70-nucleotide fragment containing the 295-365 region from the 5′UTR of HPEV1 RNA, 5′UTR(295-365); 3′UTR; poly(A) (Amersham Biosciences); 69 nucleotides from the multiple cloning region of the pGEM3Z vector, which did not contain HPEV1 sequences. The double-stranded (ds) competitors were generated by annealing of the (+) and (-) polarity strands of 5′UTR and 3′UTR RNA in hybridization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) at 90 °C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature. The concentrations of various unlabeled dsRNA competitors versus radiolabeled single-stranded (ss) RNA used in the competition binding assay are indicated in Fig. 6A. In competition binding assay radiolabeled RNA was incubated with 2A in the presence of the unlabeled complementary RNA competitor (as indicated in Fig. 6B) in 8-fold molar excess to the radiolabeled RNA. Gel Retardation Assay/Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The radiolabeled RNA transcript (0.54 nm) was incubated with 2A in 16 μl of binding buffer A for 45 min at room temperature. In control experiments the 2A-RNA complexes and free RNA were subsequently incubated in buffer SB, containing 1% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Some samples were additionally treated with 1 μg of RNase A (25Li Q. Palukaitis P. Virology. 1996; 216: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) prior to incubation in buffer SB. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8-1% agarose gels in TAE buffer. The gels were then dried and subjected to analysis using PhosphorImager or autoradiography. The experimental binding curve was statistically fit to data using Sigma Plot program (SSPS Inc.). In control experiments the radiolabeled 3′UTR RNA was incubated in the presence of 0.75 μg of BSA or ΔN25 (kindly provided by N. O. Kalinina, Moscow State University, Russia) proteins or without a protein. Expression and Purification of the Fusion 2A Protein Expressed in E. coli—As a first step toward analyzing the biochemical properties of the HPEV1 2A protein, the genomic region coding for 2A was cloned into IPTG-inducible bacterial expression vectors pGEX4T-1 and pQE-30. These vectors allowed expression of 2A as fusion proteins containing either GST or oligohistidine affinity tags at the N terminus. IPTG induction resulted in high expression levels of soluble 2A in E. coli. Chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose or Ni-NTA-agarose was used to purify GST-2A and His-2A, respectively. The proteins were purified to near-homogeneity as evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1). 2A Distribution in the Infected Cells—To determine the intracellular localization of the 2A protein during HPEV1 infection, A549 cells infected with HPEV1 and fixed with paraformaldehyde were examined by indirect immunofluorescence using the 2A antibody at different times post-infection (p.i.). In infected cells, a positive signal was first observed at 4 h p.i., whereas no significant immunofluorescence was detected in mock-infected cells. No immunostaining was detected in HPEV1-infected cells when preimmune serum, the control GST-antiserum, or the TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody alone were employed, demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies (Fig. 2A, f-h). At 4 h p.i., the 2A protein exhibited a rather diffuse cytoplasmic staining located mainly in the perinuclear area (Fig. 2A, a). At 6 h p.i., the 2A signal became more intense, and it was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In addition, there appeared a weak, diffuse nuclear staining that blurred the border between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2A, b). At late stages of infection (8 and 10 h p.i.), two distinct types of staining patterns were observed. Some cells had the same type of diffuse cytoplasmic staining seen early in infection, whereas others displayed a stronger nuclear staining and weaker cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2A, c and d). The proportion of cells displaying nuclear staining grew over time. The nuclear localization of the 2A protein at late stages of infection was confirmed by confocal microscopy (data not shown). In parallel, we employed FISH to visualize viral RNA in HPEV1-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, e, RNA could be detected as granules covering the cytoplasm and also as larger aggregates that could be found mainly in the perinuclear area. The observation that 2A was found mainly in the perinuclear area prompted us to test a possible colocalization of 2A with viral RNA. We examined the colocalization of 2A and viral RNA at 6 h p.i., at the peak of viral RNA synthesis (22Krogerus C. Egger D. Samuilova O. Hyypia T. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8512-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A549 cells were infected with HPEV1, stained with 2A specific antibody, and subsequently subjected to FISH. The specimens were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B, a and b). Merging the two confocal images of Fig. 2B, a and b) revealed that 2A partially colocalized with viral RNA (Fig. 2B, c), indicating that the 2A protein is present at the perinuclear sites of viral replication. Detection of the RNA Binding Activity of 2A and Its Specificity—It was demonstrated recently (22Krogerus C. Egger D. Samuilova O. Hyypia T. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8512-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the replication complex of HPEV1 is localized mainly in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. Following our finding that 2A is partially colocalized with viral RNA, we next studied the possible interactions between 2A and viral RNA. To rule out the possibility that the large GST tag would interfere with potential RNA binding activity of 2A, we used the His6-tagged protein in the subsequent experiments. Initial experiments were designed to determine whether the HPEV1 2A protein possesses RNA binding activity in a Northwestern blot assay. The same amount of another His6-tagged protein, ΔN25 (26Morozov S.Y. Solovyev A.G. Kalinina N.O. Fedorkin O.N. Samuilova O.V. Schiemann J. Atabekov J.G. Virology. 1999; 260: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and BSA were used as negative controls (Fig. 3A). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a membrane and renatured. The membrane was then incubated with radiolabeled RNA transcript corresponding to the full-length (+) HPEV1 RNA. Further washings removed unbound RNA, and the filter was analyzed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3B, autoradiography revealed that the 2A protein bound RNA, whereas no binding of RNA to ΔN25 or BSA was observed. To study further the RNA binding activity of 2A, we performed UV cross-linking assays. The protein-RNA complexes were cross-linked by UV light; the unbound RNA was removed by RNase A digestion, and the cross-linked complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3C, a strong radiolabeled band could be seen in the position expected for the 2A protein. A weaker band migrating at the position of 32 kDa, which probably corresponds to a cross-linked dimer of 2A, was also detected (Fig. 3C). The results in Fig. 3C also show that binding of 2A resulted in the formation of high molecular weight complexes. The upper band (>175 kDa) probably represents complexes of more than 10 monomers of 2A bound to the one RNA molecule. Formation of such large cross-linked complexes indicates that the protein molecules are bound to RNA in close association with each other. Contiguous arrangement of bound protein molecules is characteristic for a cooperative binding mode. When no RNase was added, the band disappeared into a smeared background with most of the labeled RNA on the top of the gel (Fig. 3C). No band was observed when incubation was carried out without UV irradiation (data not shown) or when the 2A protein was substituted with BSA or ΔN25 (Fig. 3C). Our next goal was to find out whether the 2A protein has any sequence specificity or preference in binding to RNA. The specificity of the 2A-RNA interaction was assessed by comparing the abilities of different unlabeled RNA substrates to compete with the radiolabeled probe for binding to 2A. Fig. 3D shows the results of an experiment in which pGEM3Z radiolabeled RNA was used to evaluate the affinity of 2A for various competing substrates. The unlabeled competitors were used in 10-, 15-, 45-, and 95-fold molar excess to the single-stranded radiolabeled RNA probe. The competitors included poly(A), the fragments of 5′-untranslated region, 5′UTR(70) and 5′UTR(295-365), 3′-untranslated terminal end of HPEV1 RNA of both positive and negative polarity, and non-parechovirus sequence derived from pGEM3Z. The RNA-protein complexes were analyzed by UV cross-linking assay (Fig. 3D, lower panel). In comparison to competition in the presence of 3′UTR RNA, 2A binding to the radiolabeled RNA probe was more effective at the same unlabeled:labeled molar ratios of the other RNA competitors. When the radioactivity associated with RNA-2A complexes was quantitated by PhosphorImaging and compared, the difference between the viral 3′UTR and other RNA competitors became apparent (Fig. 3D, upper panel). For example, addition of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled 3′UTR(+) RNA resulted in a 45 ± 5% reduction in binding of 2A to radiolabeled RNA. 3′UTR(-) RNA competitor produced almost the same effect, with an ∼43% reduction in binding. At the same molar ratio, other competitors produced only an ∼25% reduction in binding. Binding differences between the 3′UTR RNA and other RNAs were enhanced at higher concentrations of the competitors. Maximum excess of the 3′UTR RNA competitor essentially prevented complex formation with the radiolabeled RNA, whereas at the same concentration of other competitors formation of complexes between 2A and the radiolabeled RNA was still observed. These results suggest that 2A has a preference for binding to the 3′UTR HPEV1 RNA. The notion that 2A has higher affinity to the 3′UTR RNA was further supported in electrophoretic retardation experiments in nondenaturing agarose gels. These experiments allowed us to determine the dissociation constants (KD) of the 2A-3′UTR and 2A-5′UTR complexes. Increasing amount"
https://openalex.org/W2090651393,"A circadian rhythm in the accumulation of the core clock protein KaiC has been proposed to be important for proper circadian timing in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 under continuous light conditions. Cycling in the abundance of the KaiC protein is delayed to the rhythm of its mRNA by ∼8 h, consistent with the proposed function of KaiC as a negative feedback regulator of kaiBC transcription. Here, we present temporal profiles of the synthesis and degradation of KaiC protein that determine the rhythm of its accumulation. The rate of KaiC synthesis shows a robust circadian oscillation, which is delayed to the mRNA rhythm slightly and advances the rhythm of KaiC accumulation by ∼6 h. The stability of KaiC protein also shows circadian fluctuations, such that KaiC degradation is suppressed during the mid-subjective night. These results suggest that transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational processes are important for the proper circadian changes in KaiC accumulation. Moreover, the turnovers of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of KaiC show robust circadian rhythms with an anti-phase relationship to each other. Interestingly, when translation was inhibited, KaiC degradation and phosphorylation proceeded within at least 4 h in a circadian phase-dependent manner. Thus, the circadian timing seems flexible even when any perturbation in protein synthesis occurs.

Thus, the circadian timing seems flexible even when any perturbation in protein synthesis occurs. Circadian clocks drive endogenous oscillations with a period of ∼24 h in the molecular, physiological, behavioral, and ecological activities of most organisms (1Pittendrigh C.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 17-54Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms known to exhibit circadian rhythms and provide both genetic and physiological model systems for circadian biology (2Golden S.S. Ishiura M. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 327-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Iwasaki H. Kondo T.

Genet. 2003; 37: 513-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In Neurospora, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and mammals, transcription/translation-based negative feedback regulation of the clock genes has been suggested to be a key process in the generation of basic oscillations (5Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). In the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, the kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC genes have been characterized as essential clock regulators. Of these three genes, kaiC forms an operon with the kaiB gene and is expressed in a robust circadian fashion. KaiC is an ATP-binding autokinase protein (6Nishiwaki T. Iwasaki H. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) that negatively regulates its own expression (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) in a KaiA-dependent manner (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overexpression of kaiC represses not only the kaiBC promoter but also most gene promoters (9Nakahira Y. Katayama M. Miyashita H. Kutsuna S. Iwasaki H. Oyama T. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, KaiC is thought to be a promoter-nonspecific, genome-wide transcriptional modifier, possibly acting via its effect on the basic transcription machinery or on the state of chromosome compaction (9Nakahira Y. Katayama M. Miyashita H. Kutsuna S. Iwasaki H. Oyama T. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Mori T. Saveliev S.V. Xu Y.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical activities of the Kai proteins remain unclear, they show dynamic circadian patterns in their accumulation, protein complex formation, and posttranslational modification. The KaiB and KaiC proteins accumulate in a circadian fashion, peaking at circadian time (CT) 1The abbreviations used are: CT, circadian time; LL, continuous light; Chm, chloramphenicol.1The abbreviations used are: CT, circadian time; LL, continuous light; Chm, chloramphenicol. 15–18. 2CT indicates the subjective time of day in h under constant environmental conditions where CT0 corresponds to the subjective dawn.2CT indicates the subjective time of day in h under constant environmental conditions where CT0 corresponds to the subjective dawn. under continuous light conditions, which delays the rhythm of kaiBC mRNA accumulation by ∼8 h (12Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This type of time lag between mRNA and protein rhythms has also been observed for some negative regulators in eukaryotic clock systems and is thought to be important in causing feedback loops to oscillate (5Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 13Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar). KaiC forms a hexamer in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro (10Mori T. Saveliev S.V. Xu Y. Stafford W.F. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The KaiC hexamer forms larger protein complexes with KaiA, KaiB, and a sensory histidine kinase, SasA, during the subjective night (15Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). KaiC undergoes phosphorylation at Ser and Thr residues, most probably through its own autokinase activity. Phosphorylation of KaiC shows a robust circadian rhythm peaking at CT16. KaiA enhances the (auto)phosphorylation of KaiC both in vitro and in vivo (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and this effect is inhibited by KaiB, which possibly enhances the auto-dephosphorylation activity of KaiC (11Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Kitayama Y. Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kondo T.

A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The kaiA2 mutation in the KaiA protein lengthens the circadian period by ∼8 h (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and reduces KaiC phosphorylation (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The kaiC15 mutation, which was mapped to one of two KaiA-binding domains of KaiC, suppresses the effects of the kaiA2 mutation, restoring the wild-type magnitude of KaiC phosphorylation and circadian period length (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, KaiA-mediated KaiC phosphorylation seems important for circadian pacemaking. Importantly, a temporal increase in the amount of KaiC shifts the phase of the Synechococcus clock (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 12Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rhythmic accumulation of KaiC is thought to be important for circadian timing. However, no quantitative information on KaiC protein turnover that determine its accumulation rhythm has been available. Here, we present temporal profiles of KaiC protein synthesis and degradation. Our results suggest that rhythmic protein synthesis and degradation are both important for the proper circadian accumulation of KaiC protein. Bacterial Strains and Culture—NUC42 (20Nishimura H.

Kitayama, unpublished result. were used as wild-type reporter strains. NUC301 carries a PkaiBC::luxAB reporter unit with a kanamycin-resistance gene at a specific targeting site designated NS1. kaiC13 (also named CLAb) (21Kondo T. Tsinoremas N.F. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kutsuna S. Ishiura M. Science. 1994; 266: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) was used as an arrhythmic mutant strain. The PpsbAI::luxAB reporter unit of this strain was replaced with a PkaiBC::luxAB cassette (with a selectable marker gene at the specific target site, NS1) to evaluate kaiBC promoter activity. Synechococcus cells were grown in modified BG-11 medium (22Kondo T. Strayer C.A. Kulkarni R.D. Taylor W. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) under continuous light (LL) conditions (50 μmol–2 s–1 from white fluorescent lamps) at 30 °C. Methionine Uptake Analysis—Methionine uptake was analyzed as described by Chen et al. (23Chen T.H. Chen T.L. Hung L.M. Huang T.C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Synechococcus cells were grown in a continuous culture system to an optical density of 0.25 at 730 nm (A730), exposed to two cycles of alternating 12-h light/12-h dark, and then placed under LL conditions. Cells were collected at the appropriate times, resuspended in 800 μl of fresh BG-11 medium containing 1.48 MBq of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and incubated at 30 °C under LL for 30 min. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 2 min), cell pellets were washed with 1 ml of 1% casamino acid and then filtered through prewashed 0.45-μm filters (Millipore). The filters were rinsed twice with 5 ml of cold fresh medium, and the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka LSC-5100). To correct for background counts, 800 μl of cell suspension was denatured at 90 °C for 20 min, cooled on ice, and then mixed with 1.48 MBq of [35S]methionine. The cells were immediately filtered and processed as described above. KaiC Protein Synthesis Rate Analysis—Cells were collected from the continuous culture system at the appropriate times, resuspended in 600 μl of fresh BG-11 medium containing 1.11 MBq of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), and incubated at 30 °C under LL for 30 min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were washed once with 1 ml of 1% casamino acid and then twice with 1 ml of fresh BG-11 medium, immediately frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) and disrupted using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan) with zirconium beads (0.1 mm diameter; Biospec Products) at 2 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were used as total cell extracts. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described by Kageyama et al. (17Kageyama H. Kondo T. Iwasaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2388-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cell extracts (500 μl with a total protein concentration of 1 mg/ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with a 10-μl bed volume of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with purified rabbit anti-KaiC IgG. The beads were washed six times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and shaken with 20 μl of lysis buffer plus 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 μm Tris-Cl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) for 5 min. Eluted proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to immunoblotting analysis using anti-KaiC antiserum as described previously (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and autoradiography using a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). RNA blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). KaiC Stability Analysis—Cells were collected from the continuous culture system at the appropriate times and incubated with chloramphenicol (Chm; 400 μg/ml) at 30 °C under LL for 4 or 8 h. Control samples were also incubated under the same conditions without Chm. After centrifugation, cell pellets were immediately frozen and stored at –80 °C. The cells were resuspended in 500 μl of SDS sample buffer, disrupted using a Multi-Beads Shocker, and used for Western blotting analysis. Densitometric analysis of the blots was performed with NIH Image software, version 1.61. In each experiment, the linearity of the densitometric values was verified with serial dilutions of extracts. Circadian Oscillations in the Rate of KaiC Synthesis—To analyze the temporal dynamics of KaiC protein synthesis, we used a combinatorial approach with a pulse-chase labeling method with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation. Chen et al. (23Chen T.H. Chen T.L. Hung L.M. Huang T.C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrate the circadian rhythms of Synechococcus sp. RF-1 using the uptake of amino acids. Therefore, we initially examined a temporal profile of [35S]methionine uptake activity in S. elongatus. Cells carrying a bacterial luciferase reporter gene used to monitor kaiBC expression (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) were grown in a continuous culture system under standard LL conditions after a 12-h dark treatment to reset the clock. Every 6 h, the cells were removed and incubated with liquid medium containing [35S]methionine for 30 min under LL. The radioactivity of the incorporated [35S]methionine was then measured to estimate the temporal profile of methionine uptake (Fig. 1B). Methionine uptake activity remained constant throughout the circadian cycle, whereas kaiBC promoter activity showed robust circadian fluctuations (Fig. 1A) (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). For the protein synthesis assay, cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for 30 min at 2- or 4-h intervals under LL. Proteins were extracted and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-KaiC antisera. The immunoprecipitated materials were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1C (middle panel), a robust circadian oscillation in the rate of KaiC protein synthesis was demonstrated, which peaked at CT12. From the same continuous culture, we simultaneously collected other cell samples and processed them for Northern and Western blot analyses to compare kaiBC mRNA and KaiC accumulation profiles. As reported previously, the levels of kaiBC mRNA and KaiC protein show circadian rhythms peaking at ∼CT10 and ∼CT18, respectively (Figs. 1, C and D, upper and lower panels) (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 12Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H.

Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of KaiC synthesis changes in a circadian manner in parallel with the accumulation of kaiBC mRNA with a slight delay, whereas it advances to the rhythm of KaiC protein accumulation by ∼6 h. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a circadian protein synthesis profile of clock-related proteins in any organisms. Under LL, KaiC undergoes robust circadian phosphorylation, which peaks at CT16 (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). KaiC protein was detected as doublet bands on immunoblots after SDS-PAGE on 10% gels as shown in Fig. 1C. The upper band with lower mobility corresponds to the phosphorylated form of KaiC, and the lower band corresponds to the non-phosphorylated form (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our autoradiography results show that the 35S-labeled KaiC protein also appeared as doublet bands, indicating that the newly synthesized KaiC was phosphorylated rapidly within 30 min. Circadian Rhythm in the Rate of KaiC Degradation—The accumulation profile of KaiC protein is determined by the balance between its synthesis and degradation. Xu et al. (11Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) recently have estimated the half-lives of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of KaiC to be 8.8 and 2.0 h, respectively. This is based on the stability of transiently overexpressed KaiC in a kaiC-null background strain under the control of the Escherichia coli trc promoter that was controlled by pulsed administration of the inducer isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. However, that experiment did not examine the temporal profile of endogenously expressed KaiC. To estimate a temporal profile of the rate of KaiC degradation, we used a different approach and monitored the stability of KaiC in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor Chm during the course of a circadian cycle. Fig. 2A shows that total protein synthesis was inhibited by Chm at 400 and 800 μg/ml. 4We used [35S]methionine incorporation to measure the protein synthesis rate (12Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were removed from a continuous culture grown under LL after a 12-h dark treatment. They were incubated with or without Chm (400 μg/ml) for 4 h at 4-h intervals under LL, processed, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-KaiC antisera (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2, B–D, from late subjective night to early subjective day (CT20, CT24, and CT4), KaiC was reduced to ∼70% within 4 h in the presence of Chm (indicating that a half-life was ∼6 h), whereas around the mid-subjective night (CT16), KaiC was more stable (∼15% reduction, indicating an estimated half-life of ∼20 h). In our experiment, the average half-life of KaiC protein was ∼10 h. The fact that KaiC is most stable when its accumulation rhythm peaks suggests that a circadian change in the stability of KaiC contributes to the proper phasing of the rhythm of its amplitude or accumulation (see “Discussion”). We also examined the stability of KaiC in an arrhythmic mutant strain, kaiC13 (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 9Nakahira Y. Katayama M. Miyashita H. Kutsuna S. Iwasaki H. Oyama T. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This mutant encodes the amino acid substitution G460E in KaiC. The level of KaiC accumulation in this mutant was continuously low, and the phosphorylated form of KaiC was more abundant than the non-phosphorylated form throughout the circadian cycle (Fig. 3B). No difference in the rate of degradation of KaiC was found at 8 and 16 h under LL in the mutant as shown in Fig. 3, C and D, confirming that the stability of KaiC is modified in a circadian fashion in wild-type cells. Moreover, the stability of KaiC protein is lower in the kaiC13 mutant than in the wild-type strain. The lower level of KaiC accumulation in the mutant strain is due to both a reduction in the level of kaiBC expression and a decrease in the stability of KaiC. Moreover, the phosphorylated form of KaiC in the kaiC13 mutant appeared more stable than the non-phosphorylated form (Fig. 3C). Differential Turnover of Phosphorylated and Non-phosphorylated Forms of KaiC—Finally, we analyzed the temporal profiles of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of KaiC in the presence of Chm. Fig. 4A presents a schematic diagram of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated KaiC protein turnover. We analyzed the same protein samples as were used to collect the data shown in Fig. 2 by separating both forms of KaiC on 10% gels (Fig. 4B). We calculated the relative changes in phosphorylated KaiC (upper band) and non-phosphorylated KaiC (lower band) during a 4-h treatment with Chm. When the translation of KaiC was inhibited by Chm at CT4 or CT8, the level of phosphorylated KaiC increased, whereas the level of non-phosphorylated KaiC dramatically decreased because of both degradation and phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and D). These results are consistent with the observation that both total KaiC and phosphorylated KaiC increased from CT4 to CT12 in the absence of Chm, whereas non-phosphorylated KaiC decreased (Fig. 4C) (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These results also indicate that KaiC phosphorylation does not require de novo protein synthesis during the subjective day. In the presence of Chm during the late subjective night (CT20–24), the level of phosphorylated KaiC was reduced dramatically because of both degradation and dephosphorylation (Fig. 4A), whereas the level of non-phosphorylated KaiC was less affected. Thus, the turnovers of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of KaiC show robust circadian rhythms and the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms have an anti-phase relationship to each other, even in the presence of Chm. The levels of kaiBC mRNA and KaiC protein oscillate under LL, peaking at ∼CT8 and ∼CT16, respectively (Fig. 1D) (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we revealed temporal changes in the rates of synthesis and degradation of KaiC. Rhythmic KaiC synthesis peaked at CT12 with a slight delay in the rhythm of mRNA accumulation (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, the rate of KaiC protein synthesis seems primarily dependent on the level of kaiBC mRNA accumulation. Consistent with this finding, Xu et al. (11Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that transiently induced kaiBC mRNA is degraded rapidly. We found that the rate of KaiC protein degradation is modified in a circadian phase-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). KaiC was most stable at CT16 (the calculated half-life at this time point was ∼20 h), at which time its accumulation and phosphorylation levels were maximal (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). From the late subjective night to early subjective day, the stability of KaiC protein decreased (with a half-life of ∼6h) and the level of its accumulation decreased. We previously estimated the circadian profile of the absolute level of cellular KaiC (18Kitayama Y. Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kondo T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The levels of KaiC protein oscillate with an average content of ∼10,000 molecules/cell. Based on previous results, we estimated a quantitative profile of KaiC protein turnover (synthesis and degradation) per single cell (Fig. 5). The amount of KaiC protein degraded within 4 h (Fig. 5B) was calculated on the basis of the amount accumulated (Fig. 5A) and the mean value of its degradation rate at each time point (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, to address the relevance of circadian changes in KaiC synthesis and stability to the accumulation rhythm profile, we simulated KaiC accumulation profiles with constant rates of KaiC synthesis or degradation (Fig. 5C). We confirmed that the accumulation profile (Fig. 5C, black solid line), which was generated from the calculated amounts of synthesized and degraded KaiC protein shown in Fig. 5A, correlates well with the experimental data (Fig. 5C, gray solid line). If the KaiC synthesis rate is constant at the average level, the resulting KaiC accumulation rhythm is largely dampened with a slight phase delay. On the other hand, if the degradation rate is constant, the amplitude of the rhythm of KaiC accumulation is also reduced with a slight phase advance. These results suggest that oscillations in both KaiC protein synthesis and degradation are important in generating a KaiC accumulation profile with proper amplitude and phasing and thereby determine the ∼8-h delay between the mRNA and protein rhythms. When Chm was added during the subjective day (CT4–12), the level of phosphorylated KaiC increased and the level of non-phosphorylated KaiC decreased. The level of non-phosphorylated KaiC decreased greatly when Chm was added compared with the levels in the absence of Chm (Fig. 4B). This might occur, because the degradation rate of non-phosphorylated KaiC is rapid during this time or because the non-phosphorylated form of KaiC is phosphorylated by (auto)phosphorylation activity. The increase in the phosphorylated form of KaiC, regardless of the presence of Chm (Fig. 4, B and D), supports the latter possibility. During the subjective night, the rate of KaiC protein synthesis becomes lower, probably because of a reduced kaiBC mRNA pool. At ∼CT16, KaiC protein becomes relatively stable. Previous gel-filtration and co-immunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated that the KaiC hexamer forms a tight complex with KaiA, KaiB, and SasA during mid-subjective night (16Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Kageyama H. Kondo T. Iwasaki H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that such posttranslational modification or complex formation transiently changes the stability of KaiC. The increased KaiC stability would further promote the accumulation of KaiC while its synthesis rate decreased. The levels of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of KaiC are also stable in the presence of Chm from CT16 to CT20 (Fig. 4). From the late subjective night to early subjective day (CT20 to CT4), the rate of KaiC synthesis is maintained at a low level and the rate of KaiC degradation increases. Therefore, the net amount of KaiC decreases. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated KaiC is also reduced during the subjective night (regardless of the presence of Chm) because of degradation or dephosphorylation. This dramatic change seems to be attributed to the formation of a KaiC-containing complex with KaiB, which accelerates KaiC auto-dephosphorylation activity at around CT20 (11Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Kageyama H. Kondo T. Iwasaki H. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, these results indicate that, even when translation is inhibited, KaiC degradation and phosphorylation proceed within at least 4 h in a circadian phase-dependent manner, suggesting a flexibility in the circadian timing that accommodates any perturbation in protein synthesis. In Neurospora and Drosophila, the stability of the clock proteins, Period and Frequency, is modulated in a circadian fashion because of their rhythmic phosphorylation (5Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). In S. elongatus, KaiC is also rhythmically phosphorylated, most probably through autophosphorylation (Fig. 4B) (8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the effect of KaiC phosphorylation on its stability remains unclear. Using a transient KaiC overinducer in a kaiC-depleted strain, Xu et al. (11Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) suggest that the stability of phosphorylated KaiC is lower than that of non-phosphorylated KaiC. However, in this study, we demonstrated that KaiC is most stable when its phosphorylation peaks at around CT16 (Fig. 4D). Thus, there appears no simple correlation between the phosphorylation status and the stability of KaiC."

Transcriptional transactivation by aristaless-like proteins has been associated with cooperative dimerization upon binding to artificially generated DNA consensus sequences known as P3 sites, but natural target sites in genes regulated by Alx3 are unknown. We report the cloning of a cDNA encoding the rat homolog of Alx3, and we characterize the protein domains that are important for transactivation, dimerization, and binding to DNA. Two proline-rich domains located amino-terminal to the homeodomain (Pro1 and Pro2) are necessary for Alx3-dependent transactivation, whereas another one (Pro3) located in the carboxyl terminus is dispensable but contributes to enhance the magnitude of the response. We confirmed that transcriptional activity of Alx3 from a P3 site correlates with cooperative dimerization upon binding to DNA. However, Alx3 was found to bind selectively to non-P3-related TAAT-containing sites present in the promoter of the somatostatin gene in a specific manner that depends on the nuclear protein environment. Cell-specific transactivation elicited by Alx3 from these sites could not be predicted from in vitro DNA-binding experiments by using recombinant Alx3. In addition, transactivation did not depend on cooperative dimerization upon binding to cognate somatostatin DNA sites. Our data indicate that the paradigm according to which Alx3 must act homodimerically via cooperative binding to P3-like sites is insufficient to explain the mechanism of action of this homeoprotein to regulate transcription of natural target genes. Instead, Alx3 undergoes restrictive or permissive interactions with nuclear proteins that determine its binding to and transactivation from TAAT target sites selected in a cell-specific manner.

Instead, Alx3 undergoes restrictive or permissive interactions with nuclear proteins that determine its binding to and transactivation from TAAT target sites selected in a cell-specific manner. Homeodomain proteins are a large family of transcription factors that play prominent roles during embryonic development (1Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Kmita M. Duboule D. Science. 2003; 301: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by the existence of a common DNA-binding structure, known as the homeodomain, that contains three α-helices spanning 60 amino acids. Comparison of amino acid sequences of known homeodomains from different species shows that residues in the first and third helices are highly conserved. Thus, the relative degree of sequence similarity in the DNA-binding domain defines different classes of homeodomain proteins that relate to protein homologs encoded by Drosophila melanogaster genes (3Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Among the different classes of homeoproteins categorized so far, an important group with major roles in embryonic development is that of paired class proteins, characterized by the presence of a homeodomain homologous to the one encoded by the Drosophila paired gene (4Galliot B. de Vargas C. Miller D. Dev. Genes Evol. 1999; 209: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Additional conserved regions located outside the homeodomain define different subsets of paired class transcription factors. One of these subsets of paired class homeoproteins is characterized by the presence of a conserved domain located in the carboxyl-terminal region known as OAR or aristaless domain (4Galliot B. de Vargas C. Miller D. Dev. Genes Evol. 1999; 209: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Meijlink F. Beverdam A. Brouwer A. Oosterveen T.C. Ten Berge D. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 651-663PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the homeoproteins within this subset are encoded by the so-called group I aristaless-related genes. This group includes the Prx domain-containing proteins Prx1 and Prx2 (6Ten Berge D. Brouwer A. Korving J. Martin J.F. Meijlink F. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 3831-3842PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the homeoproteins Alx3 (7Rudnick A. Ling T.Y. Odagiri H. Rutter W. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 8633-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that are highly related both structurally and functionally (5Meijlink F. Beverdam A. Brouwer A. Oosterveen T.C. Ten Berge D. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 651-663PubMed Google Scholar). Aristaless-related genes exhibit overlapping patterns of expression during development in tissues that include the cranial mesenchyme derived from the neural crest, branchial arches, body wall mesoderm, and limb buds (11Beverdam A. Meijlink F. Mech. Dev. 2001; 107: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Some of the functions of the genes encoding aristaless-like transcription factors have been studied in mice carrying mutant alleles. These studies revealed that group I aristaless-related genes are required for correct skeletal development, since the presence of loss-of-function mutations leads to defects in craniofacial and limb morphogenesis. Specifically, targeted inactivation of Cart1 causes defects in the formation of cranio-facial skeleton and in the closure of the neural tube, leading to acrania and meroanencephaly (12Zhao Q. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and Alx4 mutant mice exhibit cranial bone defects, polydactyly, and body wall defects (13Qu S. Tucker S.C. Ehrlich J.S.

Alx3 mutant mice have been generated by targeted homologous recombination, but phenotypic defects in these animals have not been reported (16Beverdam A. Brouwer A. Reijnen M. Korving J. Meijlink F. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3975-3986PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that there is functional redundancy among these genes, a notion further supported by studies carried out in Alx3/Alx4 and Alx4/Cart1 double mutant mice, which show the existence of overlapping functions of these genes during embryonic development (16Beverdam A. Brouwer A. Reijnen M. Korving J. Meijlink F. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3975-3986PubMed Google Scholar, 17Qu S. Tucker S.C. Zhao Q. de Crombrugghe B. Wisdom R. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 359-369PubMed Google Scholar). Despite recent advances in our understanding of the developmental functions of transcription factors encoded by aristaless-related genes, little is known about their mechanism of action at the transcriptional level and the target genes that they regulate. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding the rat homolog of Alx3 and an initial molecular characterization of this transcription factor. We identify novel DNA sites from which Alx3 can activate transcription, and we show that a region spanning the homeodomain and adjacent residues is sufficient for protein dimerization and selective sequence-specific DNA binding, whereas full transcriptional activity requires the integrity of proline-rich domains located at either side of the homeodomain. Cell Lines—Neural RC2.E10 and RH1.C4 cells derive from cortex and hippocampus, respectively, of rat fetuses of 16 days of gestational age and were cultured at a temperature of 33 °C as described (18Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar, 19McManus M. Chen L.C. Vallejo I. Vallejo M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9004-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells, BHK-21 cells (baby hamster kidney fibroblasts) (ATCC CCL10), and rat pancreatic islet somatostatin-producing RIN-1027-B2 cells (20Philippe J. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were cultured at a temperature of 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (10 μg/ml). RIN-1027-B2 and RC2.E10 cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as described (18Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar). HeLa and BHK-21 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR with Degenerate Oligonucleotides—Total RNA (5 μg) purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation from RC2.E10 or RH1.C4 cells was primed with poly(dT)15 (100 ng) and incubated with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 30 μl to synthesize cDNA. Four μl of this cDNA preparation were used as template for PCR amplification, using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved residues QLDVLE and QVWFKN found in helices 1 and 3, respectively, of orthodenticle-like homeodomains. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are as follows: sense, 5′-ACGAATTCCA(A/G)CTIGA(C/T)GTICTIGA-3′; antisense 5′-ACGGATCC(A/G)TT(T/C)TT(G/A)AACCAIAC(T/C)TG-3′. A control sample that lacked RNA was processed in parallel. PCR conditions for amplifications were 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, after which a 5-min incubation at 72 °C followed. The expected size of the PCR products was 120 bp. The degenerate oligonucleotide amplimers used contain BamHI or EcoRI restriction enzyme sites added to their 5′-ends to allow directional cloning of the resulting PCR products in pBluescript-KS(-). After this was done, Escherichia coli JM109 were transformed, and plasmid DNA prepared from several individual bacterial colonies were sequenced by using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase kit, United States Biochemical Corp.). Sequences were compared with GenBank™ entries using the Basic Local Alignment Search Protocol (BLAST) network service on line provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Isolation of Full-length Rat Alx3 cDNA Using 5′- and 3′-RACE—To isolate the 3′-portion of the cDNA encoding rat Alx3, a 3′-RACE system (Invitrogen) was used following basically the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Total RNA was prepared from RC2.E10 or RH1.C4 cell lines as indicated above. For cDNA template synthesis, we used poly(dT)16 adapter primers designed according to the sequence provided by the manufacturer, but with the modification that the last two positions of the 3′-end were degenerate so that the oligonucleotides would anchor to the 5′-end of the poly(A) tails of the target mRNA. Following reverse transcription, PCR was carried out by using a reverse universal amplification primer (Invitrogen) and a specific sense oligonucleotide that anneals to the region encoding the rat Alx3 homeodomain. The sequence of this primer is 5′-(CAU)4GAATTCAGAAAACCCTCTACCCT-3′, incorporating a CAU tail that allows cloning of the PCR product into the plasmid pAMP-1 (Invitrogen). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, after which a 5-min incubation at 72 °C followed. The PCR products were inserted into pAMP-1 after treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase (Invitrogen) and sequenced after propagation into E. coli DH5α. To isolate the 5′-portion of the rat Alx3 cDNA, 5′-RACE using a ligation-anchored PCR-based procedure (21Troutt A.B. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Pulendran B. Nossal G.J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9823-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was carried out. To this end, reverse transcription of total RNA was performed by using a specific reverse oligonucleotide that anneals to the region encoding amino acids 314-319 located near the C terminus of Alx3 (5′-GTCGCCATCTGGAGAAGG-3′). The 3′-end of the resulting single-stranded cDNA was ligated with T4 RNA ligase to an anchor oligonucleotide phosphorylated at its 5′-end and blocked by a C3 amine group at the 3′-end (5′-pGGTACCCTCGAGGAATTCAAGCTTG-C3amine-3′). Following this, PCR amplification was carried out by using a forward primer complementary to the anchor oligonucleotide and a reverse primer that anneals to the region encoding amino acids 180-186 within the rat Alx3 homeodomain (5′-ACGGATCCAGCGCTCCCGAGCGTACACA-3′). This primer incorporates a BamHI site at its 5′-end. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 75 °C for 30 s, after which there was a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. The PCR products were inserted into pBluescript-KS(-) and sequenced after propagation into E. coli Stbl2 (Invitrogen). Northern Blot—Poly(A) RNA was purified from total RNA prepared by CsCl centrifugation, fractionated in 1% agarose formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Magnacharge, Micron Separations, Westboro MA). For the synthesis of the riboprobe, a 396-bp fragment corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the rat Alx3 cDNA was generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-GAATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAAGCGTGAGCGTTATGGGAAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGAGACGAGGCTGGGGGACTT-3′. These oligonucleotides incorporated SP6 and T7 polymerase recognition sites, respectively. The PCR product was purified, and the riboprobe was generated by using a Promega synthesis kit in the presence of [32P]CTP, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Hybridization (42 °C) and washes (65 °C) were carried out following standard protocols. Plasmids—The full-length Alx3 cDNA was assembled between the KpnI and BamHI sites of pBluescript-KS(-) by ligating restriction fragments generated from the partial cDNAs obtained as described above. A Muta-Gene phagemid kit (Bio-Rad) was used to alter the coding sequence of the Alx3 cDNA by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis so that the resulting cDNAs encode versions of Alx3 truncated at the amino or carboxyl termini. To construct cDNAs encoding Alx3 amino-terminal deletions, the codon encoding the first methionine was converted into an NcoI restriction site. NcoI restriction sites were also introduced by modifying codons encoding Leu-57 or Ser-91. A naturally occurring NcoI site corresponding to the codon encoding Met-143 was destroyed without altering the encoded residues. After generating these different templates, the plasmids were digested with NcoI and religated after removal of the insert. In this manner, cDNAs encoding the amino-terminal deletion mutants Alx3-(57), Alx3-(91), and Alx3-(143) were generated. To generate the cDNAs encoding the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants Alx3-(1-228) and Alx3-(1-279), the codons encoding Tyr-228 (TAT) or Gly-279 (GGA) were mutated into the stop codons TAG or TGA, respectively. A cDNA encoding Alx3-(143-228), which includes the Alx3 homeodomain (residues 153-212), was generated by removing an NcoI fragment encoding amino acids 1-142 and introducing a stop codon in place of the codon encoding Tyr-228. All the resulting cDNAs were excised from pBluescript-KS(-) and inserted into the expression plasmid pcDNA3. The luciferase reporter plasmids used in transient transfections were constructed by ligating three tandem copies of the oligonucleotides P3 or P5 (22Wilson D.S. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostani N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pT81Luc (23Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a minimal promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) 1The abbreviations used are: CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. reporter plasmids UEB-SMS65 (also known as SMS120), TAAT1-SMS65, and TAAT2-SMS65 have been described previously (18Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar). For bacterial expression of a fusion protein composed of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the carboxyl terminus of rat Alx3 (residues 212-343, excluding the homeodomain), the plasmid GST-Alx3ΔN140C was constructed. For this purpose, the rat Alx3 cDNA was used as a template to amplify a fragment encoding the last 140 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal region by PCR. This region does not include residues within the homeodomain. The sequence of the forward PCR primer is 5′-ACGGATCCGAGCGTTATGGGAAGATA-3′ and that of the reverse primer is 5′-CAAAAGTGAGGCCAGACC-3′. The forward primer incorporates a BamHI site at its 5′-end. The reverse primer anneals to the 3′-untranslated region of the rAlx3 cDNA, downstream from a unique HindIII restriction site. PCR conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, after which there was a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the plasmid pGEX-KG (24Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). A similar strategy was used to generate GST-Alx3, a fusion protein including full-length Alx3. In this case, the sequence of the forward PCR primer is: 5′-ACGGATCCATGGAGCCCGAGCGCTGC-3′. To construct the plasmid encoding GST-Alx3-(143-228), a 473-bp fragment was cut with NcoI from the cDNA encoding Alx3-(1-228) in pBluescript-KS(-). This fragment was cloned into the NcoI site of pGEX-KG. Alx3 Antiserum—A polyclonal antiserum that recognizes the carboxyl-terminal region of rat Alx3 (140 residues) was generated in a rabbit inoculated with the GST-Alx3ΔN140C fusion protein expressed in E. coli JM109. Specificity of the antiserum was determined by Western immunoblot, using serum preabsorbed with GST or with GST-Alx3. Western Immunoblot—Nuclear extracts (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaftner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) from cells growing in 60-mm dishes were prepared, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Alx3 immunoreactivity was detected with a rabbit polyclonal primary antiserum (1:5000 dilution), followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). DNA-Protein Binding Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were carried out with full-length or truncated versions of Alx3 generated by in vitro translation by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) or with nuclear extracts (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaftner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) of RC2.E10 cells in the presence of the protease inhibitors pepstatin A (1 mg/ml), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), aprotinin (10 mg/ml), and p-aminobenzamidine (0.1 mm). Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides with 5′-GATC overhangs were annealed and labeled by a fill-in reaction using [α-32P]dATP and Klenow enzyme. Binding reactions were carried out in the presence of 20,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe (∼6-10 fmol) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.9), 70 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are as follows (coding strand): P3, 5′-GATCCTGAGTCTAATTGAATTACTGTACA-3′; P5, 5′-GATCCTGAGTCTAATTGAGAATTACTGTA-3′; SMS-UE-B, 5′-GATCCGCGAGGCTAATGGTGCGTAA-3′; SMS-TAAT1, 5′-GATCCCTGATTGCATATTAATTCTCAGATA-3′; SMS-TAAT2, 5′-GATCCGATCTCAGTAATTAATCATGCACCA-3′; SMS-TAAT3, 5′-GATCCCAAGTCCAGTAATCTGAGTACATA-3′; GFAPT1, 5′-GATCCATAGACATAATGGTCAGGA-3′; GFAPT2, 5′-GATCCGAGAGTGTAATTTAGGCTA-3′; and GFAPT3, 5′-GATCCTTTGCCAATTAGTGTGACA-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were carried out basically as descried by Gerrish et al. (26Gerrish K. Cissell M.A. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47775-47784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cultures of RIN-1027-B2 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and the cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were isolated. Chromatin was sonicated and incubated with anti-Alx3 antiserum or control normal rabbit serum. Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were isolated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. Bound DNA was detected by PCR using oligonucleotide primers that amplify a fragment of the somatostatin gene spanning nucleotides -550 to -120. PCR conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, after which a 5-min incubation at 72 °C followed. The sequence of the oligonucleotide primers are as follows: forward, 5′-GATTGGACAAAGTGATGCTC-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGTGAGGGGAGGCGACAC-3′. PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. GST Pull-down Assays—Full-length or truncated versions of [35S]Met-labeled Alx3 were generated by in vitro translation using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and were incubated with recombinant GST-Alx3, GST-Alx3-(143-228), or its deletion mutant control GST-Alx3ΔN140C expressed in bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Incubations were carried out at 4 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. After extensive washing, the bead-bound proteins were denatured, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Isolation of Rat Alx3 cDNA—A degenerate reverse transcriptase-PCR-based screen initially aimed at identifying orthodenticle-related homeodomain genes expressed in neural cell lines yielded several homeodomain region-encoding clones whose translated sequence was identical to that of mouse, human, and hamster Alx3 (7Rudnick A.

Gene Chromosome Cancer. 2002; 33: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Clones encoding the homeodomains of Otx1 and Otx2 were also identified, but no additional Otx-related genes were detected. The full-length rat Alx3 cDNA isolated using 3′- and 5′-RACE is 1.8 kb in size. However, a number of clones generated by 3′-RACE were found to contain a shorter 3′-untranslated region followed by a poly(A) tail at nucleotide 1724, suggesting that at least two different polyadenylation sites may be used. A putative RNA destabilization signal (AUUUA) (28Savant-Bhonsale S. Cleveland D.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was identified within the 3′-untranslated region. Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of Alx3 mRNA of the expected size in the head and trunk of rat E12 embryos (Fig. 1). The cloned cDNA encodes a protein of 343 amino acids whose homeodomain is located between residues 153 and 212. The sequence of the rat Alx3 homeodomain is identical to that of the Alx3 homeodomain from human (27Wimmer K. Zhu X. Rouillard J.M. Ambros P.F. Lamb B.J. Kuick R. Eckart M. Weinhausl A. Fonatsch C. Hanash S.M. Gene Chromosome Cancer. 2002; 33: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), hamster (7Rudnick A. Ling T.Y. Odagiri H. Rutter W. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 199: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Outside the homeodomain, rat Alx3 exhibits a high degree of amino acid identity with the known Alx3 orthologs from other species (Fig. 2). These regions are characterized by a relatively high proportion of proline residues distributed into three different domains, two of them in the amino-terminal region, named Pro1 and Pro2 and spanning amino acids 3-79 (25% proline content) and 104-141 (23% proline content), respectively, and one in the carboxyl-terminal region named Pro3 and spanning amino acids 223-336 (19% proline content) (Fig. 2). Characterization of Transcriptionally Active Domains within Alx3—To test the functional activity of Alx3, we constructed reporter plasmids bearing three copies of P3- or P5-binding sites, which contain two inverted “TAAT” motifs separated by three or five nucleotides, respectively (22Wilson D.S. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostani N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It is known that aristaless-like homeodomain proteins bind preferentially to these sites as dimers (to P3) or monomers (to P5) (17Qu S. Tucker S.C. Zhao Q. de Crombrugghe B. Wisdom R. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 359-369PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tucker S.C. Wisdom R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32325-32332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Neural RC2.E10 cells were cotransfected with either 3xP3TK-Luc or 3xP5TK-Luc reporters and pcDNA-Alx3, an expression vector encoding full-length rat Alx3. We found that Alx3 increased the luciferase activity elicited by 3xP3TK-Luc by 2-3-fold but did not increase the activity elicited by 3xP5TK-Luc, which was low and close to background levels (data not shown). To avoid interferences with endogenous Alx3 expressed in RC2.E10 cells, we used BHK-21 cells, since they do not express Alx3 as shown by Western immunoblot (see Fig. 6A). Fig. 3A shows that cotransfection of the Alx3 expression vector in BHK-21 fibroblasts results in higher luciferase activity elicited from the P3-bearing reporter plasmid but not from the P5-bearing reporter plasmid.Fig. 3A, relative luciferase activities elicited in BHK-21 cells cotransfected with either P3- or P5-luciferase reporter plasmids (3xP3-Luc and 3xP5-Luc, respectively, 5 μg of each) and increasing amounts of control pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Alx3 (Alx3) as indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2053987999,"Microbacterium luteolum YK-1 has pyridoxine degradation pathway I. We have cloned the structural gene for the second step enzyme, pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase. The gene consists of 1,026-bp nucleotides and encodes 342 amino acids. The enzyme was overexpressed under cold shock conditions with a coexpression system and chaperonin GroEL/ES. The recombinant enzyme showed the same properties as the M. luteolum enzyme. The primary sequence of the enzyme was 54% identical with that of d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a probable aldo-keto reductase (AKR). Upon multiple alignment with enzymes belonging to the 14 AKR families so far reported, pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase was found to form a new AKR superfamily (AKR15) together with A. tumefaciensd-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase and Pseudomonas sp. l-fucose dehydrogenase. These enzymes belong to a distinct branch from the two main ones found in the phylogenic tree of AKR proteins. The enzymes on the new branch are characterized by their inability to reduce the corresponding lactones, which are produced from pyridoxal or sugars. Furthermore, pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase prefers NAD+ to NADP+ as a cofactor, although AKRs generally show higher affinities for the latter.

Furthermore, pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase prefers NAD+ to NADP+ as a cofactor, although AKRs generally show higher affinities for the latter. Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.107) catalyzes the oxidation of pyridoxal (pyridoxal hemiacetal) to 4-pyridoxolactone with NAD+ (Fig. 1) and is the second enzyme in degradation pathway I for pyridoxine, one of the free forms of vitamin B6, in which pyridoxine is degraded through eight enzyme-catalyzed steps to succinic semialdehyde, ammonia, and carbon dioxide (1Nelson M.J. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15115-15120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase has been purified partially and homogeneously from Pseudomonas MA-1 (2Burg R.W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2585-2589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Microbacterium luteolum (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), respectively. The enzyme only catalyzes the dehydrogenase (oxidation) reaction on pyridoxal, and no reverse reduction of 4-pyridoxolactone has been observed (2Burg R.W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2585-2589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), although due to the low purity of the enzyme preparation (2Burg R.W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2585-2589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the limited usage of the purified preparation (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), reexamination of the results is required. The reaction specificity suggests that the enzyme is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family (4Achterholt S. Priefert H. Steibuchel A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4387-4391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme protein showed no homology to the proteins in this family (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) 1The abbreviation used is: AKR, aldo-keto reductase. comprise one of the three enzyme superfamilies that encompass NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases (5Hyndman D. Bauman D.R. Heredia V.V. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which can use aldehydes as substrates. They catalyze the reduction of aldehydes, ketones, monosaccharides, ketosteroids, and prostaglandins. Although AKRs also catalyze the oxidation of hydroxysteroids and trans-dehydrodiols of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, they generally show much higher activity as to the reduction of aldehydes than the dehydrogenation (oxidation) of the corresponding alcohols (6Kavanagh K.L. Klimacek M. Nidetzky B. Wilson D.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8785-8795Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This superfamily contains more than 100 enzymes, which are divided into 14 families (AKR1–AKR14). They possess the (α/β) eight-barrel motif characteristic of triose-phosphate isomerases and contain ∼320 amino acids/monomer. The majority of known AKRs are monomeric. However, multimeric forms are found in the AKR2, AKR6, and AKR7 families. Here we have cloned the gene encoding pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase from M. luteolum YK-1, developed an overexpression system for the recombinant pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli, and examined the properties of the purified recombinant enzyme. M. luteolum pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase exhibits 54% amino acid sequence identity with the probable AKR protein d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.122) (7Wood D.W. Setubal J.C. Kaul R. Monks D.E.

Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase forms a new AKR family (AKR15) and belongs to a new branch, distinct from the two main branches, in the phylogenic tree of AKR proteins (5Hyndman D. Bauman D.R. Heredia V.V. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Cultivation—M. luteolum YK-1 (IFO 16738) isolated from soil was aerobically cultured at 30 °C in pyridoxine medium as described previously (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and used as a DNA donor and for preparation of M. luteolum pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase. E. coli JM109 (TaKaRa Bio) was used for cloning of the enzyme-coding gene or for expression of the recombinant enzyme, and E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used for overexpression of the enzyme. E. coli cells were cultured in LB medium (1% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% sodium chloride (w/v)) containing an adequate antibiotic or combination of antibiotics. Plasmids p3T (Mo Bi Tec), pET21a (Novagen), and pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) were used as the cloning and expression vectors, respectively. Plasmid pKY206 carrying groEL/ES genes (8Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. M. Ashiuchi (Kochi University) and Dr. Y. Kawata (Tottori University). This plasmid was used as a coexpression vector. Determination of Internal Amino Acid Sequence of Purified M. luteolum Pyridoxal 4-Dehydrogenase—The M. luteolum enzyme was purified as described previously (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme or the recombinant enzyme prepared as described below (74 μg) was digested at 25 °C for 26 h with V-8 protease in a reaction mixture comprising 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2 m urea. The peptides were separated on an ODS-AM (YMC, 100 × 4.6 mm, 120 Å) reverse-phase column. Amino acid sequencing of the peptides was performed with an Applied Biosystems 492 protein sequencer. Cloning of the Pyridoxal 4-Dehydrogenase Gene—Nearly half of the gene (pld1) encoding pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase, which encodes the amino-terminal part of the enzyme protein, was amplified by PCR. Chromosomal DNA of M. luteolum YK-1 prepared by the method of Saito and Miura (9Saito H. Miura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar) was used as the template. The degenerate PCR primers designed based on the amino-terminal and internal sequences of the enzyme shown in Fig. 1 were 5′-GA(A/G)AA(A/G)CG(G/T/C)GC(A/G/T/C)CT(G/T/C)GG(A/G/T/C)CG(G/T/C)AC (A/G/C)-3′ and 5′-AA(A/G/T/C)CC(A/G/T/C)CC(A/G/T/C)CC(A/G/T/C)C(G/T)(A/G/T/C)GT-3′, respectively. The PCR conditions, with TaKaRa LA Taq polymerase and GC buffer I, were essentially the same as those described previously (10Nakano M. Morita T. Yamamoto T. Sano H. Ashiuchi M. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23185-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA fragment (507 bp from the 5′-end of pld1) was determined with an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. The inverse PCR method was used for cloning the residual region of the pld1 gene. The chromosome DNA of M. luteolum was digested with EcoRI, and then EcoRI-digested fragments were self-ligated to produce circular fragments. The latter were used as templates for PCR with primers 5′-AGGCACGAGTTTCACTGGAA-3′ (complementary to the antisense strand at nucleotide 484) and 5′-GCAGTTCCCAGACCAAGCGC-3′ (complementary to the sense strand at nucleotide 77). The 3′-end of the pld1 gene was cloned by cassette ligation-mediated PCR with a TaKaRa LA PCR in vitro cloning kit. PCR was performed essentially in the same way as described previously (10Nakano M. Morita T. Yamamoto T. Sano H. Ashiuchi M. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23185-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment (about 3 kb) containing the 3′-end was amplified. Nucleotide sequencing of the DNA fragment clarified the entire sequence of the pld1 gene. The pld1 gene was amplified by PCR with the chromosomal DNA from M. luteolum as a template. Primers 5′-CATATGCATTTGAAAGCATCCGAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTGTCGAGGCGGAAAATGGTGT-3′ with a NdeI site (underlined in the former) and a BamHI site (underlined in the latter), respectively, were used. The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into p3T for TA cloning. The constructed plasmid, p3TPLD, was introduced into and extracted from E. coli JM109. After the sequence of the introduced fragment had been verified, p3TPLD was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and then the digested DNA fragment was inserted in the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET21a. The constructed plasmid, designated as pETPLD, was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). pETPLD was digested with XbaI and HindIII to obtain a DNA fragment containing the Shine-Dàlgàrno sequence in pET21a and the pld1 gene. This fragment was inserted into the XbaI/HindIII sites of pTrc99A to construct pTRPLD, which was then introduced into E. coli JM109. Expression of Pyridoxal 4-Dehydrogenase and Preparation of Crude Extracts—BL21(DE3)/pETPLD and JM109/pTRPLD cells were cotransformed with plasmid pKY206 carrying the GroEL/ES gene that encodes chaperonins, GroEL and ES, and increases the amount of the active form of the recombinant enzyme in the host cells (8Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cotransformants were grown in LB broth containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) plus tetracycline (25 μg/ml) for 48 h at 23 °C. To examine the effect of induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture when the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6–0.8. Cells were harvested and washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and then suspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Buffer A containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspension was thoroughly sonicated at 4–15 °C with a Heat Systems-Ultrasonics sonicator W-220. The precipitate containing cell debris and insoluble materials was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the soluble fraction. The precipitate was mixed with Buffer A containing 6 m urea, and then the mixture was kept on ice for 2 h and centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant containing the dissolved inclusion proteins was used as the dissolved fraction. Purification of Recombinant Pyridoxal 4-Dehydrogenase—The cotransformant cells (4.7 g), BL21(DE3)/pETPLD/pKY206, were suspended in 25 ml of Buffer A containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was sonicated on ice for 15 min with a Heat Systems-Ultrasonicator W-220. The supernatant (40 ml) obtained on centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C was used as the crude extract. The crude extract was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate obtained upon centrifugation of the 40–70% saturated solution was dissolved in 14 ml of Buffer A. This solution, after dialysis against Buffer A, was applied to a Blue A (Amicon) column (1.8 × 8.0 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A and then Buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl until the absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm become lower than 0.1. Then the enzyme was eluted with Buffer A containing 0.2 mm NAD+ as a single peak. Enzyme and Protein Assays—Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase was assayed during its purification by measuring the increase in fluorescence (excitation at 356 nm and emission at 432 nm) of 4-pyridoxolactone produced as described previously (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), for which 2–100 milliunits of the enzyme was routinely used. One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount that catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of 4-pyridoxolactone per min (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reverse reaction was assayed by the phenylhydrazine method, in which pyridoxal produced was measured as phenylhydrazone (11Kaneda Y. Ohnishi K. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), because a high concentration of 4-pyridoxolactone, which shows maximum absorbance at 356 nm, interfered with measurement of the decrease in the absorption of NADH. The reaction was performed in a reaction mixture (0.4 ml) consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 mm 4-pyridoxolactone, 10 mm NADH, and 5 units of enzyme at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 66 μlof9 m sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture (0.3 ml) after centrifugation was mixed with 0.6 ml of 1 m sulfuric acid and 0.1 ml of 2% (w/v) phenylhydrazine (dissolved in 5 m sulfuric acid), and then the mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 20 min. The A410 of the mixture was measured. Protein was measured by the dye-binding method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Chem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Substrate Specificity of the Recombinant Enzyme—The enzyme activity toward sugars and the Km values were determined by measuring the initial increase in A340 of NADH at 30 °C in 1.0 ml of a reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 250 mm each sugar, 1.0 mm NAD+, and the enzyme. The reactivity with aldehydes, which are typical synthetic AKR substrates, was measured in the same reaction mixture containing 1.0 mm each aldehyde instead of the sugar. The Km value for pyridoxal was measured under the same conditions with the exception that A366 was followed instead of A340. Kinetic parameters were determined as described previously (10Nakano M. Morita T. Yamamoto T. Sano H. Ashiuchi M. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23185-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Other Analytical Methods—The molecular weight of the recombinant enzyme was determined by gel filtration (Hiprep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 high resolution column) with a fast protein liquid chromatograph. A calibration curve was made based on the elution pattern of catalase (Mr 240,000), lactate dehydrogenase (Mr 140,000), alanine aminotransferase (Mr 110, 000), malate dehydrogenase (Mr 72,000), and cytochrome c (Mr 12,400). The subunit molecular weight was measured by SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with the molecular weight markers as described previously (10Nakano M. Morita T. Yamamoto T. Sano H. Ashiuchi M. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23185-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cloning of the M. luteolum Pyridoxal 4-Dehydrogenase Gene— The amino acid sequences of the amino-terminal region and three internal peptides generated on V-8 protease digestion were determined (solid underlines in Fig. 2a). Based on the amino acid sequence information, degenerate primers were designed for PCR, which corresponded to the amino acids indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 2A. The pld1 gene fragment comprising nucleotides 19–528 was amplified by PCR (thick line in Fig. 2B). Upon inverse PCR with the circularized EcoRI-digested fragments, a 550-bp fragment was amplified, which contained the 5′-end and the central part of the pld1 gene (solid line in Fig. 2B). Finally, the 3′-terminal region of the pld1 gene was amplified by cassette ligation-mediated PCR, as shown by the double line in Fig. 2B. The entire pld1 gene was amplified (Fig. 2B), and the nucleotide sequence was verified (Fig. 2A). The pld1 gene consisted of 1,026 bp nucleotides, which encoded 342 amino acid residues (Fig. 2A). The predicted molecular mass was 37,889, which was in good agreement with the molecular mass (38,000) determined previously by SDS-PAGE (3Trongpanich Y. Abe K. Kaneda Y. Morita T. Yagi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Expression of the pld1 Gene in E. coli—The expression of the pld1 gene in various E. coli transformants was examined with cells cultured in a small volume of medium (5.0 ml) under different conditions. BL21(DE3)/pETPLD and JM109/pTRPLD cells grown at 37 °C showed low pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase activity (0.25 ± 0.05 and 0.26 ± 0.02 units/mg, respectively), which was almost the same value as that for M. luteolum grown in the pyridoxine synthetic medium. The amount of the enzyme protein was so low that the protein band could not be seen in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3, lane A). Because the patterns of the protein bands on the gel were very similar for the two types of transformant cells, only the results for BL21(DE3)/pETPLD cells are shown in Fig. 3. Both types of cells showed the formation of large amounts of insoluble enzyme proteins (Fig. 3, lane B). To increase the soluble and active forms of the enzyme protein, BL21(DE3)/pETPLD cells were cultured under different conditions, such as cultivation at high (44 and 42 °C) or low (20 °C) temperature and induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Only cultivation at the low temperature was effective, the specific activity being increased to 1.28 ± 0.31 units/mg. Because it has been reported that the coexpression of E. coli chaperonin proteins increases the soluble forms of several enzymes (8Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Yagi T. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of their coexpression on pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase in the transformant cells. The specific activity of the enzyme in BL21(DE3)/pETPLD/pKY206 cells and JM109/pTRPLD/pKY206 cells, which were cultured without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 23 °C, was 11.8 ± 3.24 and 14.6 ± 1.55 (i.e. 9.2- and 8.8-fold higher than the values for BL21(DE3)/pETPLD cells and JM109/pTRPLD cells, respectively). The amount of the soluble form of the enzyme was high enough to see it in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a protein band (Fig. 3, lane C). Thus, cold stress and cooperative expression of chaperonins increased the soluble and active forms of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase in the host cells. Both types of cells could be used for purification of the enzyme. Purification and Properties of Recombinant Pyridoxal 4-Dehydrogenase—The recombinant pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity from BL21(DE3)/pETPLD/pKY206 cells by one-step column chromatography (Fig. 3, lane D, and Table I). The specific activity of the crude extract used as the starting material was lower than that observed in the transformant cells cultivated in a small volume (5 ml). For an unknown reason, the transformant cells showed lower specific activity when they were grown in a larger volume (200 ml) for preparation of the enzyme.Table IPurification of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase from cotransformant E. coli cellsFractionTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Crude extract4142,7006.5100Ammonium sulfate2512,68011.699.4Blue A2.61,67063562.3 Open table in a new tab The purified recombinant enzyme showed 1.8-fold higher specific activity than the M. luteolum enzyme. However, the optimum pH (pH 8.0), the optimum temperature (30 °C), the thermostability (75% inactivation at 45 °C for 10 min), and the molecular weights both on gel filtration (84,000 ± 4,200) and SDS-PAGE (38,000 ± 600) were the same for the recombinant and native enzymes. Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase is a dimeric protein. The amino-terminal 10-amino acid sequence and the sequences of five V8-cleaved peptides derived from the recombinant enzyme were determined (the double lines in Fig. 2A). Whereas the amino-terminal methionine was removed in the recombinant enzyme, the determined amino acid sequences coincided with those deduced from the nucleotide sequences. Activity toward Sugars and Aldehydes—Because the primary sequence of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase was similar to that of a putative d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase, the reactivity of the enzyme with sugars was examined. The enzyme showed high activity toward l-fucose, d-arabinose, and l-xylose (Table II). These substrates have hydroxyl groups at the second and third carbons in the threo configuration. The substrates showed Michaelis-Menten type kinetics. l-Fucose was the best substrate, having the highest specificity constant.Table IIComparative reactivity of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase with sugars and pyridoxalCompoundKmKcatKcat/Kmmms-1s-1 mm-1Pyridoxal13 ± 2.559.2 ± 7.34.6l-Fucose0.41 ± 0.05125 ± 2.0304.9d-Arabinose0.91 ± 0.08175 ± 1.9192.3l-Xylose3.5 ± 0.19214 ± 1.46.1NAD+0.042 ± 0.003NADP+0.58 ± 0.14 Open table in a new tab When l-fucose was used as the hydrogen donor, the optimum pH of the enzyme reaction was pH 9.5 (Fig. 4). In contrast, it was pH 8.0 when pyridoxal was used. Whereas carbonate buffers inhibited the dehydrogenation of pyridoxal, they did not inhibit that of l-fucose. The optimum temperature was 45 °C, and the enzyme was stable up to 40 °C when l-fucose was used as the substrate. Whereas no difference was observed in thermostability between the enzyme reactions with l-fucose and pyridoxal, the optimum temperature was 10 °C higher with l-fucose than with pyridoxal. The Km values for NAD+ were 0.042 ± 0.003 and 0.05 ± 0.004 mm with l-fucose and pyridoxal as the substrate, respectively. The Km value for NADP+ determined with l-fucose was 0.58 ± 0.14 mm. Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase showed no measurable activity toward benzaldehyde, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde or 4-nitrobenzaldehyde although these synthetic aldehydes are good substrates for AKRs so far studied (15Morita T. Huruta T. Ashiuchi M. Yagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). M. luteolum pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase shows the highest identity (54%) with a probable d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AAL44626, 348 residues). Mesorhizobium loti putative d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase (BAB50246, 332 residues), Sinorhizobium meliloti putative protein (AAK65425, 338 residues), S. meliloti putative l-fucose dehydrogenase (CAC41406, 339 residues), M. loti unknown protein (BAB54355, 340 residues), Bradyrhizobium japonicum putative oxidoreductase (BAC46389, 325 residues), Pseudomonas sp. l-fucose dehydrogenase (BAA06803, 329 residues), and Bacillus anthracis str. Ames oxidoreductase (AAP27231, 336 residues) show identities of 45, 44, 42, 40, 39, 38, and 37%, respectively. Since d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase is a potential member of the AKR superfamily (16Joseph M.J. Trevor M.P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 499-525PubMed Google Scholar), M. luteolum pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase could belong to the AKR superfamily. The amino acid sequence of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase was aligned with those of A. tumefaciensd-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase, Pseudomonas sp. l-fucose dehydrogenase (17Yamamoto-Otake H. Nakano E. Koyama Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 2281-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), Candida tenuis xylose reductase (AKR2B7) (18Hacker B. Habenicht A. Kiess M. Mattes R. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and rat aflatoxin dialdehyde reductase (AKR7A1) (19Ellis E.M. Judah D.J. Neal G.E. Hayes J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). C. tenuis xylose reductase and rat aflatoxin dialdehyde reductase are novel dimeric members of the AKR superfamily with defined tertiary structures. All of the residues in the active sites of AKRs are conserved in pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase, namely Asp-56, Tyr-61, Lys-86, and His-152, corresponding to Asp-40, Tyr-45, Lys-73, and His-109 in the AKR7A1 protein, respectively (Fig. 5). The amino acid residues involved in NAD(P)+ binding are also conserved, namely Gly-250, Arg-256, Gln-315, Gln-318, and Asn-319, corresponding to Gly-198, Arg-204, Glu-290, Glu-293, and Asn-294 in the AKR7A1 protein, respectively (Fig. 5). Therefore, M. luteolum pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase is a member of the AKR superfamily. The AKR superfamily, so far, comprises 14 families. A representative was selected from each family and aligned with M. luteolum pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase, A. tumefaciensd-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase, and Pseudomonas sp. l-fucose dehydrogenase. Enzymes belonging to one family exhibit less than 40% amino acid sequence identity with enzymes belonging to other families (16Joseph M.J. Trevor M.P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 499-525PubMed Google Scholar). No enzymes in the 14 families show more than 40% amino acid sequence identity with pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase. When an unrooted phylogenic tree was constructed, pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase was found to form a distinct branch together with two aldose reductases (Fig. 6A). These two aldose reductases show reactivity with aldoses with hydroxyl groups at the 2- and 3-positions with the threo configuration. From these data, we propose a new AKR family, which is composed of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase and other aldose reductases. The sequence of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase was submitted to the AKR superfamily homepage (available on the World Wide Web at www.med.upenn.edu/akr/), and the new family was designated as AKR family 15. The phylogenic tree of the AKR superfamily has two major branches; one branch is composed of AKR families 1–5, and the other is composed of AKR families 6–14 (5Hyndman D. Bauman D.R. Heredia V.V. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). The pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase family, family 15, forms a third major branch. Enzymes in family 15 are different from the others in several biochemical properties as well. They only catalyze the oxidation (dehydrogenation) reaction and have a dimeric structure, and some of them show higher affinity for NAD+ than for NADP+. Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase showed no reactivity with 4-pyridoxolactone even when the lactone concentration was 50 mm and a 100-fold higher amount of the enzyme was used. The effective irreversibility of the enzyme reaction has also been found for Pseudomonas pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase (2Burg R.W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2585-2589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). l-Fucose dehydrogenase from rabbit liver belonging to the AKR family 15 shows no catalytic activity toward l-fuconolactone (20Endo M. Hiyama N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This irreversibility is attributed to spontaneous hydrolysis of l-fuconolactone at basic pH because the enzyme shows an optimum pH of 10.0. However, this is not the case for pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase, because the enzyme shows an optimum pH of 8.0–8.5, where 4-pyridoxolactone is not easily hydrolyzed. The inability of family 15 enzymes to reduce lactones may cause controversy regarding the molecular evolution of AKRs. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism involved. AKRs generally show only affinity for NADP+ or higher affinity for NADP+ than for NAD+ when both coenzymes are used as cofactors, although a NAD-preferring xylose reductase has recently been characterized (21Lee J.-K. Koo B.-S. Kim S.-Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Codeinone reductase (AKR4B2), morphine dehydrogenase (AKR5B), pyridoxal reductase (AKR8A1), and aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (AKR9A3) can only use NADP+. Ara1p-arabinose dehydrogenase (AKR3C), shaker channel β-subunit (AKR6A1), and aldehyde reductase (AKR1A2) show 3–10-fold higher affinity for NADP+ than for NAD+, respectively. On the contrary, pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase showed 10-fold higher affinity for NAD+ than for NADP+ as the xylose reductase (21Lee J.-K. Koo B.-S. Kim S.-Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the majority of AKRs are monomeric, recent studies have shown that xylose reductase (AKR2B5) (6Kavanagh K.L. Klimacek M. Nidetzky B. Wilson D.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8785-8795Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and aflatoxin-inducible aldehyde reductase (AKR7A1) (22Kozma E. Brown E. Ellis E.M. Lapthorn A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16285-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are dimeric. M. luteolum pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase in AKR15 was shown to be dimeric. The amino acid residues necessary for dimerization of C. tenuis xylose reductase, Asp-178, Glu-205, Phe-206, Trp-313, and Pro-319, are well conserved as Asp-203, Glu-229, Phe-230, Trp-322, and Pro-328 of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase (Fig. 5). These residues in pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase are likely to be involved in dimer formation. l-Fucose was a better substrate for pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase than pyridoxal. Although several l-fucose dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.122, d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase) from animals and microorganisms have been characterized, their reactivity with pyridoxal has not been reported. l-Fucose dehydrogenase from porcine liver acts on the β-anomer of l-fucose and catalyzes hydride transfer of the C-1 hydrogen axial in the lowest energy chair conformation (23Berkowitz D.B. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2606-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Korytnyk and Singh (24Korytnyk W. Singh R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2813-2817Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have found that pyridoxal existed exclusively in the hemiacetal form at pD 1.0–11.0 by examining its proton magnetic resonance spectra. Interestingly, the conformations of pyridoxal hemiacetal and the chair form of l-fucose show several similarities between functional groups (Fig. 6B). When the conformational structures are placed one upon another at C-1 of l-fucose and C-4′ of pyridoxal hemiacetal, both of which bind the axial hydrogen to be released, the C-2 oxygen and C-3 oxygen in l-fucose and pyridoxal hemiacetal, respectively, occupy similar positions to the carbons. Furthermore, the C-3 oxygen of l-fucose is located at a similar position to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring in pyridoxal hemiacetal. Thus, it is possible that l-fucose and pyridoxal hemiacetal bind to the active site pocket of the enzyme, where some amino acid residues provide binding sites for these atoms through hydrogen bonds, and that the enzyme shows reactivity with the compounds. Indeed, the optimum pH of pyridoxal was lower than that of l-fucose, suggesting that the C-3 phenolic hydroxyl group in pyridoxal hemiacetal should be in a nondissociated form for binding to the binding site. The substrate-binding pocket of pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase from M. luteolum may be similar to those of d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenases. Comparative studies on d-threo-aldose 1-dehydrogenase from different sources will provide the clues for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the changes in the substrate specificities of AKR proteins."

Unexpectedly, TβR-V was recently found to be identical to the LRP-1/α2M receptor; this has disclosed previously unreported growth regulatory functions of LRP-1. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to expressing LRP-1, all cells examined exhibit low affinity but high density acidic pH binding sites for LRP-1 growth regulatory ligands (TGF-β1, IGFBP-3, and α2M*). These sites, like LRP-1, are sensitive to receptor-associated protein and calcium depletion but, unlike LRP-1, are also sensitive to chondroitin sulfate and heparin and capable of directly binding ligands, which do not bind to LRP-1. Annexin VI has been identified as a major membrane-associated protein capable of directly binding α2M* at acidic pH. This is evidenced by: 1) structural and Western blot analyses of the protein purified from bovine liver plasma membranes by α2M* affinity column chromatography at acidic pH, and 2) dot blot analysis of the interaction of annexin VI and 125I-α2M*. Cell surface annexin VI is involved in 125I-TGF-β1 and 125I-α2M* binding to the acidic pH binding sites and 125I-α2M* binding to LRP-1 at neutral pH as demonstrated by the sensitivity of cells to pretreatment with anti-annexin VI IgG.

Trifluoperazine and fluphenazine, which inhibit ligand binding to the acidic pH binding sites, block degradation after internalization of cell surface-bound 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M*.

Structural and functional analysis of TβR-V seems to be required for elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 induce growth inhibition in responsive cells (5Leal S.M.

Unexpectedly, we recently found that the TβR-V is identical to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1/activated α2M receptor (LRP-1/α2M receptor) as determined by structural and functional analyses of purified TβR-V (8Huang S.S.

Genetic evidence and evidence of rescue experiments has revealed that TβR-V/LRP-1 is required for cellular growth inhibition caused by IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1 (8Huang S.S. Ling T.-Y. Tseng W.-F.

Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) through homologous sequence screening. It is best known as an endocytic receptor and has been shown to bind multiple ligands with distinct structures and to mediate their plasma clearance and cellular catabolism (10Herz J. Strickland D.K.

Hepatic LRP-1 appears to be responsible for plasma clearance of α2M*. Recently, LRP-1 has been reported to mediate signaling in several cell types upon binding by α2M*; α2M* has also been shown to regulate cell growth of certain cell types (14Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A.

The cytoplasmic domain of LRP-1 has also been shown to modulate the MEKK/JNK/c-Jun signaling cascade (18Lutz C. Nimpf J. Jenny M. Boecklinger K. Enzinger C. Utermann G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G.

The finding that TβR-V is identical to LRP-1 has provided new insights into the role of LRP-1 in mediating growth regulatory signaling. Since the growth regulatory functions of IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1 are biologically important (8Huang S.S. Ling T.-Y. Tseng W.-F. Huang Y.-H. Tang F.-M. Yen H.-Y. Leal S.M. Huang J.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2068-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we investigated the interactions of the newly identified growth regulatory ligands for LRP-1 with LRP-1 in cells. We predicted that these investigations would help to disclose mechanisms by which LRP-1 regulates cellular proliferation upon stimulation by IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1. During these investigations, we discovered that all cell types examined exhibited low affinity but high density acidic pH binding sites for LRP-1 growth regulatory ligands and that these differ from LRP-1 (which has ligand binding activity with a neutral pH optimum). Since these acidic pH binding sites are likely to modulate ligand binding to LRP-1 at neutral pH, we characterized these acidic pH binding sites in responsive cells. In this communication, we demonstrate that the acidic pH binding sites share some properties (receptor-associated protein- and calcium depletion-sensitive ligand binding) with LRP-1 but differ from LRP-1 in their sensitivity to heparin and chondroitin sulfate and in their ability to bind non-LRP-1 ligands. We also show that annexin VI is the major protein purified from bovine liver plasma membranes by α2M* affinity column chromatography at acidic pH and that annexin VI directly interacts with α2M* in a pH-dependent manner with an optimum pH of 5 as demonstrated by dot blot analysis. We further demonstrate that cell surface annexin VI is involved in the binding of 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M* at acidic pH. Cell surface annexin VI is also capable of mediating internalization and degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M* at acidic pH. Additionally, it is involved in the binding of 125I-α2M* to LRP-1 at neutral pH and forms ternary complexes with 125I-α2M* and LRP-1 at neutral pH as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, we show that trifluoperazine and fluphenazine both inhibit binding of 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M* to these acidic pH binding sites and to LRP-1 at neutral pH, and block cellular degradation after internalization of cell surface-bound 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M*.

The specific radioactivities of 125I-labeled IGFBP-3 (125I-IGFBP-3) and 125I-labeled TGF-β1 (125I-TGF-β1) were 1-4 × 105 cpm/ng and 1-5 × 105 cpm/ng, respectively. Iodination of α2M* (100 μg) was done as described previously (23Huang S.S. O'Grady P. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1535-1541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu Q. Ling T.-Y.

The specific radioactivity of 125I-labeled α2M* (125I-α2M*) was 2 × 104 cpm/ng. 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M* was mixed with unlabeled TGF-β1 or α2M* to yield a specific radioactivity of 2-5 × 103 cpm/ng in specific experiments. Specific Binding of 125I-IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, and 125I-α2M* to Cells—Mv1Lu, MEF, and PEA-13 cells were plated at a cell density of 8 × 104 cells/well in 48-well clustered dishes and grown at 37 °C overnight in DMEM/50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then washed and incubated with 6 nm125I-125I-TGF-β1, or 10 nm125I-α2M* in the presence or absence of EGTA (tetrasodium salt) or BAPTA (5 mm), GST-RAP (15 μg/ml), or 200-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 or α2M* in DMEM/50 mm HEPES/acetate at pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.4 (or 7.0), and 8.0, all containing BSA (1 mg/ml). GST-RAP or 200-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 or α2M* was used to estimate nonspecific binding. After 2.5 h at 0 °C, the specific binding of 125I-IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, or 125I-α2M* was determined. BAPTA and the tetrasodium salt (but not the free acid form) of EGTA appeared to function well as chelators of Ca2+ at acidic pH (26Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Internalization and Degradation of Cell Surface-bound 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M*—Cells (8 × 104 cells/well) in 48-well clustered dishes were incubated with 125I-TGF-β1 (100 pm) or 125I-α2M* (2 nm) with or without 10 μm trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, or promethazine in the presence and absence of 200-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 or α2M* (to estimate nonspecific binding) in DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing BSA (1 mg/ml). After 2 h at 0 °C, the cells were washed and incubated with DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing BSA (1 mg/ml) with or without 10 μm trifluoperazine, fluphenazine or promethazine. After 1 h at 37 °C, the medium was collected and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactive material in the medium represented the cellular degradation products of 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M*. The cells were then treated with trypsin (5 mg/ml), maintained for 20 min at 0 °C, and centrifuged. The radioactivity in the supernatant and cell pellets represented cell surface-bound and internalized 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M*, respectively. The experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Immunoprecipitation of Cell Surface-bound 125I-α2M*—MEF and PEA-13 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) grown in 24-well clustered dishes were incubated with 1 nm125I-α2M* in the presence and absence of 200-fold excess of unlabeled α2M* in DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing BSA (1 mg/ml). After 2 h at 0 °C, the cells were lysed with 50 mm HEPES/HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 mm Ca2+, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-annexin VI IgG or control IgG in the same HEPES/HCl buffer as described previously (4Leal S.M.

The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions. 125I-α2M* appeared as a 180-kDa (monomer) band on the autoradiogram. Cell Surface Localization of Annexin VI—Cells grown on coverslips in DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing 10% fetal calf serum were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (ice cold). After 1 h, the fixed cells were washed with DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (ice cold). The coverslips were then blocked with BSA (5 mg/ml) in DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 on ice overnight. After washing with DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, the fixed cells were treated with anti-annexin VI IgG or control IgG (1:75 dilution) in DMEM/25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing BSA (5 mg/ml) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, fixed cells were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (1:50 dilution) at room temperature for 1.5 h and then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to visualize with a confocal fluorescent microscope. Affinity Column Chromatography on α2M*-Sepharose 4B—Bovine liver plasma membranes were subjected to Triton X-100 extraction according to published procedures (2O'Grady P. Kuo M.D. Baldassare J.J.

The Triton X-100 extracts were applied onto a column of α2M*-Sepharose 4B (1.6 × 20 cm) in 50 mm HEPES/acetate buffer, pH 6.0 (or pH 5.0), 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (HEPES/acetate buffer) containing 4 mm Ca2+. After extensive washing with HEPES/acetate buffer containing 4 mm CaCl2, the column was eluted with 10 mm EDTA in HEPES/acetate buffer. The fractional volume of the eluents was 1 ml. An aliquot of fractions (EDTA eluents) was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions and silver staining. The concentrated flow-through fractions and peak fraction were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-annexin VI IgG (8Huang S.S. Ling T.-Y. Tseng W.-F. Huang Y.-H. Tang F.-M. Yen H.-Y.

MALDI-TOF Analysis—A 68-kDa protein purified from α2M*-Sepharose 4B affinity column chromatography was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, stained with Coomassie Blue, and digested with trypsin. MALDI-TOF analysis of the tryptic digests was carried out at Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Dot Blot Analysis—1 μl of annexin I, II, III, IV, V, and VI (0.1 mg/ml in H2O) was applied onto nitrocellulose membranes and air-dried. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. After 2 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight with 125I-α2M* (10 nm) in 50 mm HEPES/acetate at pH 4, 5, 6 and 7 containing BSA (2 mg/ml), 2 mm Ca2+, and 0.15 m NaCl in the presence and absence of RAP (100 μg/ml) or BAPTA (5 mm). The membranes were extensively washed with the respective binding buffers containing BSA (5 mg/ml) and analyzed by autoradiography. Anti-annexin VI IgG Treatment of Cells—Mv1Lu, MEF, and PEA-13 cells (8 × 104 cells/well) grown on 48-well clustered dishes were treated with various concentrations (0, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/ml) of anti-annexin VI IgG or control IgG in DMEM/25 mm HEPES/acetate buffer at pH 6.4 or 7.4 containing BSA (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h. The treated cells were then kept on ice and additional anti-annexin VI IgG or control IgG in the same DMEM/HEPES/acetate buffer was added to wells (0, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/ml). The binding assay at pH 6.4 or 7.4 (at 0 °C) was started by adding 125I-TGF-β1 (100 pm) or 125I-α2M* (1 nm) with or without 200-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 or α2M* (to estimate nonspecific binding) to wells. After 2 h at 0 °C, the cell-associated 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M* was determined. The specific binding of 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-α2M* was estimated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. The experiments were performed in duplicate. LRP-1 Ligands Exhibit High Capacity Binding to Cells at Acidic pH—LRP-1 is a 600-kDa type I membrane glycoprotein which has been shown to bind more than 35 ligands (10Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin.

These ligands have different structures and functions but share two receptor binding properties: 1) Ca2+ dependence and 2) inhibition by RAP. Since IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1 are the newly identified ligands for LRP-1, we determined whether they share these two receptor binding properties with α2M* in Mv1Lu cells. Mv1Lu cells are a standard model cell system for investigating TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 receptors and activities (4Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

These cells were incubated with 6 nm125I-IGFBP-3, 1 nm125I-TGF-β1, or 10 nm125I-α2M* in the presence or absence of GST-RAP (15 μg/ml), EGTA or BAPTA (5 mm), or 200-fold excess of unlabeled IGFBP-3, TGF-β1 or α2M* at pH 4, 5, 6, 7.4 (or 7.0), and 8.0. After 2.5 h at 0 °C, the specific binding of 125I-IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, and 125I-α2M* was determined. GST-RAP is a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and RAP, which inhibits binding of all known ligands to LRP-1 (9Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K.

BAPTA is a Ca2+ chelator independent of pH (26Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A-C, 125I-IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, and 125I-α2M* bound to Mv1Lu cells in a pH-dependent manner. The specific binding (GST-RAP-sensitive) of 125I-IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, and 125I-α2M* exhibited a maximum at pH 5. The specific binding (GST-RAP-sensitive) of 125I-IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, and 125I-α2M* at pH 7.4 was much less than at pH 5 (Fig. 1, A-C). The pH profiles of the EDTA- or BAPTA-sensitive binding for these radioactive ligands were similar to those of the GST-RAP sensitive binding (data not shown). The apparent Kd values for binding of IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, and 125I-α2M* to TβR-V/LRP-1 at pH 7.4 are known to be 6 nm, 50-400 pm, and 75 pm, respectively (7Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

These results suggest that Mv1Lu cells may possess low affinity, high density binding sites (which are GST-RAP- and Ca2+ depletion-sensitive) for 125I-IGFBP-3, 125I-TGF-β1, and 125I-α2M* with acidic pH optima. This suggestion is supported by Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-α2M* 1nm binding to Mv1Lu cells at pH 5. As shown in Fig. 2A, 125I-α2M* bound to Mv1Lu cells in a concentration-dependent manner at pH 5 with a saturating concentration of 120 nm. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data revealed a single class of low affinity binding sites with an apparent Kd of 54 nm and 1.5 × 106 sites/cell (Fig. 2B). The Kd values of the low affinity acidic pH binding sites for 125I-IGFBP-3 and 125I-TGF-β1 were not determined. However, it is very possible that the Kd values of the low affinity acidic pH binding sites for 125I-IGFBP-3 and 125I-TGF-β1 are similar to the apparent Kd of the acidic pH binding sites for 125I-α2M*. We therefore focused on characterizing 125I-TGF-β1 and 125I-α2M* binding to the acidic pH binding sites in all of the following experiments.Fig. 2Acidic pH binding of 125I-α2M* to Mv1Lu cells.

At present it is not clear whether besides the “classical” IKKα-IKKβ-IKKγ configuration additional complexes exist in vivo that solely contain IKKβ and IKKγ (without IKKα). In the current study we were able to demonstrate in monocytic cells that endogenous complexes, which only include IKKβ as the kinase-active molecule do indeed exist in vivo and that these complexes contain IKKγ as an additional component. Furthermore, we showed that these IKKβ-IKKγ complexes are involved in mainstream NF-κB activation cascades because they can be activated by tumor necrosis factor. In contrast, these subcomplexes appear not to participate in NIK-dependent pathways. As a next step we showed that exogenous IKKβ-IKKγ complexes can be formed in an intact cell by overexpression and that these artificial complexes fulfill the requirement for participation in regular signaling. Finally, in the absence of IKKα we found a retarded proteolysis of IκBα, but not of IκB∈, which is associated with a reduced IKK activity. Differential pathways represented by various IKK subcomplexes may open attractive possibilities in treatment of inflammation or cancer allowing specific therapeutic intervention.

Activation of this high molecular weight assembly complex is achieved via signaling pathways induced by numerous molecules or conditions, e.g. cytokines like TNF, bacterial, and viral products as well as several forms of cellular stress (1Ghosh S.

Such stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of proteins of the NF-κB inhibitor family IκB, for example IκBα, -β, and -∈, which subsequently undergo ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (5Baeuerle P.A.

This frees the NF-κB dimer, most commonly p50/p65 (RelA), which is trapped in an inactive state in the cytosol by IκB (5Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Following stimulation, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to promoters or enhancers of genes, e.g. coding for cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, proteases, and procoagulatory proteins involved in inflammatory and immune responses as well as in proliferation and apoptosis (7Thanos D.

Differential signaling pathways leading to the activation of NF-κB/Rel transcription factors as well as targeted gene expression are only partly understood and may be attractive targets for specific therapeutic approaches for inflammation or cancer (9Baldwin A.S.

The core IKK complex is composed of three subunits: IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (also called NF-κB essential modulator, NEMO; IKK-associated protein 1, IKKAP1) (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 2Israël A. Nature. 2003; 423: 596-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Woronicz J.D. Gao X.

Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). IKKβ and IKKα are the two kinase-active components of this complex. IKKβ is essential for activation of the IKK complex by various proinflammatory stimuli (15Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.-F. Verma I.M.

Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It should also be mentioned that it is now evident that IKKα, although dispensable for IKK activation in response to proinflammatory stimuli, is essential for IKK activation by an alternative set of signals that do not affect the IKKβ subunit (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IKKγ has been suggested to represent an adaptor or scaffold protein, which stabilizes the high molecular weight complex and/or regulates its kinase activity (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 2Israël A. Nature. 2003; 423: 596-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Yamaoka S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The upstream signaling pathways, which lead to the activation of the IKK complex, are still only partly understood (2Israël A. Nature. 2003; 423: 596-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). A relatively well studied example is the TNF signaling pathway: Engagement of TNF with TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 results in the formation of a multiprotein signaling complex containing the cytosolic adaptor proteins TNFR-associated death domain protein, TNFR-associated factor 2, and receptor-interacting protein (3Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 28Chen G. Goeddel D.V.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These adaptor proteins in turn recruit IKKβ to the TNFR1 complex where it becomes activated, finally initiating downstream processes leading to NF-κB activation (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 28Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). Additional kinases have been suggested to activate the IKK complex such as TAK1, which is associated with Toll-like receptor/IL-1 receptor-associated signaling pathways (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 30Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Sci STKE. 2003; 2003: re3Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 31Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). The IKK signaling event may also be mediated, dependent on the stimulus, by protein kinase R, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1) or MEKK3 (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 27Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). One of the first kinases proposed to activate the IKK complex was the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), but further studies indicated that it plays a function in specific pathways, e.g. processing of p100 and depends on the catalytic activities of downstream acting IKKα (13Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 32Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12006-12012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Earlier studies indicate that IKK is a large complex with a size varying between 700 and 900 kDa, suggesting the presence of additional components (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 13Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). One possibility that has been suggested is that some of the kinases or adaptors mentioned above in the previous paragraph, as well as additional signaling molecules, temporarily associate with the core complex (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may be possible that besides the “classical” components, different subunits are present as permanent components in the IKK complex. In this context it should be mentioned that two recent reports identified cell division control (Cdc) 37 and heat shock proteins (Hsp) 90 as well as 27 as further components of a TNF-inducible IKK complex (35Park K.J. Gaynor R.B. Kwak Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35272-35278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that Hsp70 is able to form a supramolecular structure with the IKKγ subunit (25Agou F. Ye F. Goffinon S. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israël A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17464-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At present it is not clear if besides the classical IKKα-IKKβ-IKKγ configuration additional complexes exist in vivo that solely contain IKKβ and IKKγ (without IKKα) as suggested earlier (24Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennet D.B.Y. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in genetic experiments IKKα–/– mice display a significant IKK activation in response to proinflammatory stimuli and also induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity, presumably because of formation of artificial (since IKKα is missing), but still functional IKKβ-IKKγ complexes (19Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellismann M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 20Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S.

Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Recombinant IKKα and IKKβ are able to form homo- or heterodimers, which suggests that similar IKK complexes may also exist in vivo (34Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). In addition, complete recombinant reconstitution of the IKK in yeast revealed that the core IKK complex is composed of α1β1γ2, but also β2γ2 (37Schomer Miller B. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The current study was designed to examine in vivo in monocytic cells whether endogenous complexes do indeed exist which solely contain IKKβ and no IKKα and if these complexes contain IKKγ. If so, we wanted to investigate whether these IKKβ-IKKγ complexes participate in regular signaling and can be activated by certain stimuli, e.g. TNF, and to investigate which IκB proteolysis patterns are induced during this activation. Cell Culture Conditions and Reagents—THP-1 human monocytic cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in suspension in RPMI 1640 (Glutamax-1, low endotoxin) containing 7% fetal calf serum (low endotoxin), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) (38Weber M. Sydlik C. Quirling M. Nothdurfter C. Zwergal A. Heiss P. Bell S. Neumeier D. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23586-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the experiments, the cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 per well in 6-well culture dishes. Human recombinant TNF was obtained from Sigma. HeLa cells (DSMZ) were cultured in Dulbeccos's MEM (Biochrom) (10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Wild-type and IKKα knockout murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (gift from Prof. Michael Karin and Dr. Antonio Rossi, University of California, San Diego, CA and the Institute of Neurobiology and Molecular Medicine, Rome, Italy) were cultured in DMEM high glucose medium with stable glutamine (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) (7% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Endotoxin contamination was screened by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). A potential toxicity of the cell culture conditions applied was monitored by cell morphology/count, trypan blue dye exclusion, and the WST-1 test (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were isolated as described (4Fischer C. Page S. Weber M. Eisele T. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol.

The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the wet blot technique. After transfer, the membranes were incubated with antibodies against IKKα (Alexis Biochemicals, Carlsbad), IKKβ (Biocarta, San Diego), IKKγ (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), IκBα, IκB∈, NIK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), phospho-IκBα (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), FLAG (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands), or actin (Sigma). This was followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The proteins were visualized on x-ray film using the Chemiluminescent Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). The obtained signals were analyzed densitometrically, and the values corrected for the loading control for each protein. Immunoprecipitation—Cytosolic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation in TNT buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, pepstatin A, chymostatin 0.75 μg/ml each; Sigma) (4Fischer C.

Immunoprecipitation was carried out using 35 μl of 6% protein A- or G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-IKKα (BD Biosciences), IKKβ (QED Bioscience), IKKγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-FLAG antibody. Specificity of the antibodies was tested by Western blot analyses after separating the IKKα and -β bands. After washing three times with TNT buffer and three times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, pepstatin A, chymostatin 0.75 μg/ml each) the precipitated proteins were either analyzed by Western blot or kinase assay. Immunodepletion—For immunodepletion cytosolic extracts were subjected to serial immunoprecipitation 4× for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μgof specific non-cross-reactive anti-IKKα or IKKβ antibody and 250 μl of 6% protein A-agarose in TNT buffer as described above. This procedure was followed by a normal immunoprecipitation for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of antikinase antibody as described above. Kinase Assay—IP was carried out as described above and followed by the kinase assay (11Baumgartner B. Weber M. Quirling M. Fischer C. Page S. Adam M. von Schilling C. Waterhouse C. Schmid C. Neumeier D. Brand K. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 2062-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was performed in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 500 ng of the substrate GST-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were analyzed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (0.1% SDS), and following Western blot the transferred proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Densitometric analysis was performed for the obtained signals, and the values corrected for the loading control for each protein. Overexpression Experiments—The plasmids coding for IKKα, IKKβ (both wild type, FLAG-tagged) as well as NIK wild type and mutated (KK429-430AA) were obtained from Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, and the overexpression plasmid for IKKγ (NEMO) was a gift from Prof. Alain Israël and co-workers, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. RcCMV (Invitrogen) containing no insert was used as a negative control. These plasmids were transiently co-transfected into HeLa cells or IKKα knockout MEFs using Superfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (38Weber M. Sydlik C. Quirling M. Nothdurfter C. Zwergal A. Heiss P.

After overnight culture, cells were left untreated or stimulated with TNF at 2 ng/ml, and cytosolic or nuclear extracts were isolated. Detection of Endogenous IKKβ-IKKγ in Vivo in Monocytic Cells—Initial experiments were performed with monocytic cells to demonstrate the presence of endogenous complexes, which contain IKKβ as well as IKKγ but no IKKα. For this purpose THP-1 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of TNF (2 ng/ml) for 5 min, and cytosolic extracts were isolated. IKKα-containing complexes or free IKKα were removed by immunodepletion using an antibody against the IKKα protein, and this procedure was repeated up to 4× for each sample. The remaining IKK complexes were then precipitated by anti-IKKγ, and the nature of the precipitated IKK proteins was monitored by Western blot analysis. These experiments demonstrated that virtually no IKKα (associated with IKKγ) remained in the cellular extracts following the IKKα depletion procedure (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in the IKKα-depleted samples a significant level of IKKβ and, as expected, IKKγ was detected in the precipitate (Fig. 1A). Comparable results were observed in the absence or presence of TNF. The densitometric analysis of three experiments showed that during repeated immunoprecipitations with the anti-IKKα antibody the level of IKKα went down essentially to zero (Fig. 1B). Under the same conditions, a decrease of IKKβ down to ∼46% of the undepleted control was observed, which was comparable to the decrease in IKKγ (31%) at the same time (Fig. 1B). Essentially the same results were obtained when, following the IKKα immunodepletion, the anti-IKKβ antibody was used instead of anti-IKKγ to precipitate the remaining complexes for further analysis (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that IKK complexes exist in vivo in monocytic cells, whose major components are IKKβ as well as IKKγ. In the present article these complexes are designated as IKKβ-IKKγ complexes. Activation of Endogenous Monocytic IKKβ-IKKγ Complexes by TNF—In the following we wanted to evaluate whether the endogenous IKKβ-IKKγ complexes play a role in the regular NF-κB signaling pathway, and whether these can be activated by known stimuli of this system. For this purpose, THP-1 monocytic cells were incubated with TNF (2 ng/ml) and the cytosolic extracts were subjected to an immunodepletion of IKKα as described above. The supernatants containing the IKKβ-IKKγ complexes as well as undepleted samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-IKKγ antibody, and the obtained precipitate was added to a kinase assay. The experiments demonstrated a reduced baseline of IKK activity in unstimulated IKKα-depleted cells (Fig. 2A). However, exposure to TNF still significantly increased IKK activity in IKKα-depleted cells, albeit with a lower absolute peak level compared with normal, undepleted cytosolic extracts. Following the evaluation of the kinase activity the complete depletion of IKKα protein as well as the remaining amount of IKKβ- and IKKγ proteins was verified by Western blot analyses of the kinase assay precipitate (Fig. 2A). These experiments were further extended by a kinetic study in which THP-1 cells were incubated with TNF for 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min. As described above, kinase activity of IKKγ-precipitated complexes was determined followed by densitometric analysis. These data show a transient activation of IKKβ-IKKγ complexes by TNF, with fold induction values of kinase activity lowered to ∼60% compared with non-depleted samples (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that the IKKβ-IKKγ complexes in monocytic cells can be stimulated by a classical stimulus such as TNF and are therefore likely to be involved in mainstream NF-κB activation cascades potentially displaying a slightly different signaling dynamic. NIK Cannot Activate IKKβ-IKKγ Complexes—Recently, it has been shown that NIK together with IKKα- or IKKα-containing complexes is involved in specific pathways, e.g. p100 processing (32Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we wanted to test if the IKKβ-IKKγ complexes also participate in NIK-induced signaling. To investigate this we overexpressed either wild type or the dominant negative form of NIK together with the CMV vector alone as a control in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts of these cells revealed an overexpression of NIK both in the wild-type and mutated form (Fig. 3A). NIK-induced IKK activity was monitored in cytosolic extracts of these cells by kinase assay following an immunoprecipitation using an antibody against IKKα or IKKγ. These experiments demonstrated significantly increased kinase activity in HeLa cells overexpressing wild-type NIK with a more intense absolute peak level following the anti-IKKα immunoprecipitation compared with the immunoprecipitation using an antibody against IKKγ (Fig. 3B). As a next step to investigate the role of IKKα the above samples were subjected to an immunodepletion using an anti-IKKα antibody. Following two and four steps of depletion, the samples were added to an immunoprecipitation using an anti-IKKγ antibody and subjected to a kinase assay. Remarkably, NIK-induced kinase activity was reduced after two steps of immunodepletion and totally abolished following four steps of IKKα immunodepletion (Fig. 3C). Western blot analysis revealed, similar as described above, that IKKα was completely depleted while there were still IKKβ-IKKγ complexes left. These results indicate that the signaling induced by NIK overexpression cannot be mediated by IKKβ-IKKγ complexes and that the removal of IKKα abolishes the inducbility by NIK. Formation of IKKβ-IKKγ by Overexpression and Activation of These Complexes—In these experiments we aimed to reconstitute exogenous IKKβ-IKKγ complexes by overexpression experiments. HeLa cells were used to overexpress different ratios of IKKβ and IKKγ or CMV vector alone. It should be mentioned that in this case only IKKβ has a FLAG tag whereas IKKγ is untagged. A total amount of 10 μg of DNA with different ratios was transfected, and the overexpression of the different proteins was detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). As a next step, the association of IKKβ with IKKγ was tested. For this, cytosolic extracts of HeLa cells overexpressing IKKβ and IKKγ in different ratios were subjected to an immunoprecipitation for either kinase, and the FLAG- or IKKγ-precipitated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. The results demonstrate that the overexpressed IKKβ and IKKγ associate with each other and that exogenous IKKβ-IKKγ c"

Secreted mucins are produced by epithelial mucus cells and play important roles in the rheological and bacteria-binding properties of the mucus covering the epithelial tissues (5Lamblin G.

They can modulate immune functions, such as maturation of B cells and trafficking of leukocytes during inflammatory response (3Fukuda M. Biochim. Biophys.

The biological properties of both secreted and membrane-bound mucins are attributed to the structurally heterogeneous carbohydrates covalently bound to the peptide backbones. The highly heterogeneous mucin-type carbohydrate is characterized by the α-anomeric linkage between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine/threonine in the peptide backbone. Following the formation of this linkage, mucin carbohydrate is assembled by the sequential addition of one sugar at a time as catalyzed by various glycosyltransferases (7Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 8Brockhausen I. Kuhns W. Glycoproteins and Human Diseases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 5-48Google Scholar). This template-independent synthetic process is responsible for the heterogeneity of mucin carbohydrate. The branching enzymes, which catalyze the synthesis of β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminides, are unique among the glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of mucin glycans (9Beum P.V. Cheng P.-W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 491: 279-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mucin β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminides formed by these enzymes constitute the initiation sites from which additional carbohydrate can be added, thus extending the complexity of mucin carbohydrate structure and increasing the functional potential of mucins.

Cheng P.-W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 491: 279-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, all β6GnTs contain nine conserved cysteines (9Beum P.V. Cheng P.-W. Adv.

In an effort to elucidate the structural determinants that distinguish the difference in substrate specificity among members of this gene family, we characterized the disulfide linkages formed among these nine conserved cysteines in bC2GnT-M. To facilitate the effort, we generated a secreted form of the recombinant bC2GnT-M by removing the N-terminal region that contains the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain and cloned the cDNA into pSecTag2B, which contains Ig κ-chain leader sequence at the N terminus and Myc epitope and polyhistidine tag at the C-terminal end. By microsequencing of the [35S]cysteine-containing tryptic peptides separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), we identified four cystine pairs between first and sixth, third and seventh, fourth and fifth, and eighth and ninth cysteine residues. The second cysteine was not conjugated. This pattern of disulfide bond distribution is different from that of mouse C2GnT-L recently reported (12Yen T.-Y. Macher B.A. Bryson S. Chang X. Tvaroska I.

The results indicate that the conservation of nine cysteines does not lead to the formation of same disulfide bonds between different isozymes, suggesting that other factors such as secondary structures may play a crucial role in determining the formation of disulfide bonds and substrate specificity.

Dithiothreitol, ninhydrin, phenyl isothiocyanate, anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid, benzene, n-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and pyridine used for Edman degradation were obtained from Pierce. Methanol and acetonitrile for high pressure liquid chromatography was obtained from Water Associates (Milford, MA). [35S]Cysteine and [35S]methionine with specific activity of 1,075 and 540 Ci/mmol, respectively, were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The enzymatic deglycosylation kit was purchased from Prozyme, Inc. (San Leandro, CA). Cys-Arg was provided by Dr. Sam Sanderson at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (Omaha, NE). Cell Culture—Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and a water-saturated environment. The CHO cells, stably transfected with pSecTag2B (Invitrogen) containing bC2GnT-M catalytic domain, were cultured in CHO III A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 μm hypoxanthine, 1.6 μm thymidine, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% fetal bovine serum (Medium A). To prepare the recombinant C2GnT-M secreted into the conditioned medium, the recombinant CHO cells were switched to serum-free CHO III A medium containing the supplements. Cloning of pSecTag bC2GnT-M and Generation of Stable Clones in CHO Cells—The bC2GnT-M cDNA coding the catalytic domain devoid of 47 amino acids at the N terminus containing the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain of the open reading frame was cloned from pCDNA6 containing the full-length bC2GnT-M cDNA (17Choi K.H. Osorio F.A. Cheng P.-W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The PCR product was cloned into a Pichia vector (pPIC6αC) (Invitrogen) first and then transferred via EcoRI and NotI sites to pSecTag 2B vector, which contains Ig κ-chain at the N terminus and a Myc and a His6 tag at the C terminus. After confirmation by sequencing and then enzyme activity assay of the recombinant protein following a transient transfection of CHO cells by published methods (24Cheng P.-W. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 175-282Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the pSecTag2B-bC2GnT-M was used to generate stable clones in CHO cells as described next. After they were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum to 70% confluence, the CHO cells were transfected under serum-free conditions with pSecTag2B-bC2GnT-M delivered with Lipofectin supplemented with insulin as previously described (24Cheng P.-W. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 175-282Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Two days later, cells were split 1:4 and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). After 10 days, 24 clones were picked and characterized for C2GnT activity. The clone that expressed highest C2GnT activity after four passages was used for the current study. Assay of C2GnT-L, C4GnT-M, and IGnT Activities of Recombinant bC2GnT-M—The recombinant bC2GnT-M generated by the CHO cells stably transfected with pSecTag bC2GnT-M was assayed for C2GnT-L, C4GnT-M, and IGnT activities in the cells and conditioned medium as previously described (17Choi K.H. Osorio F.A. Cheng P.-W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was first concentrated 10-fold at 4 °C by centricon filtration with a 30-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane (Millipore Corp.). Metabolic Labeling of bC2GnT-M—The [35S]cysteine (or [35S]methionine)-labeled bC2GnT-M was prepared from CHO cells stably transfected with pSecTag2B-bC2GnT-M as follows. The CHO cells that had grown in T-75 flasks to 90% confluence in Medium A (see “Cell Culture”) were switched to 12 ml of serum-free Medium A containing 2 mm sodium butyrate and cultured for 6-7 h. Then the cells were exposed for 1 h to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (catalog no. 21013-024; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 15 μg/ml methionine (for preparing [35S]cysteine-labeled bC2GnT-M) (25Bedows E.

Following the addition of 63 μl of [35S]cysteine-HCl (11 mCi/ml at 1,075 Ci/mmol) or 22 μl of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml at 540 Ci/mmol) (ICN) to each T-75 flask and incubated for 1-2 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free Medium A containing 2 mm butyrate. After the cells were cultured for 24-48 h, the conditioned medium was harvested, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and used for purification. Purification of 35S-labeled bC2GnT-M—The 35S-labeled bC2GnT-M was purified from the combined supernatant in a two-step process. First, the medium was concentrated at 4 °C from 180 to 10 ml using an Amicon YM 30 centricon (Amicon Bioseparations Centriprep; Millipore) in a centrifuge (Jouan model MR 22i) at 1,500 × g for 30 min. Two ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity resin (Qiagen), which has a 5-10-mg protein-binding capacity/ml of resin, was added to the concentrated medium. After a gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight, the resin was packed in a column. Following successive rinsing of the packed resin with the supernatant twice, 10 ml of 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 10 ml of 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), and 10 ml of 20 mm imidazole (pH 6.2), the protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole buffer (pH 8.0) (26Le Grice S.F.J.

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—The purity of the recombinant bC2GnT-M purified by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE under reduced conditions followed by Coomassie Blue stain or Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (1:500) (Invitrogen). The anti-Myc antibody-treated membrane was further treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) (Invitrogen) and developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Alkylation and Reduction-Alkylation of Recombinant bC2GnT-M—To prepare bC2GnT-M with free cysteines alkylated, 20-25 μg of recombinant protein in 1.5 ml of elution buffer in a silanized tube was treated with 10 mm iodoacetamide in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min (27Huth J.R.

To prepare bC2GnT-M with all cysteines alkylated, the same amount of the recombinant bC2GnT-M was treated first with 15 mm dithiothreitol under argon gas at 37 °C for 2 h and then 10 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min. Trypsin Digestion of bC2GnT-M—Both alkylated and reduced-alkylated bC2GnT-M (90 μg in 1.5 ml of elution buffer adjusted to pH 8.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl buffer in silanized polypropylene tubes) were digested for 16 h with 50 μg of diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin in 50-150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 5 mm CaCl2 (25Bedows E. Huth J.R. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestions continued for 4 h after the addition of another 50 μg of trypsin (67 μg/ml final concentration), which was maintained at pH 8.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Samples were then centrifuged (1,500 × g), and the supernatant was kept at 4 °C prior to HPLC separation of the tryptic peptides. Tryptic Mapping Strategy—The tryptic mapping strategy consisted of three steps (25Bedows E. Huth J.R. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Le Grice S.F.J. Ruddon R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 187: 307-314Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 27Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, the [35S]cysteine-containing bC2GnT-M was fully reduced and alkylated and then digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were separated by C18 RP-HPLC. Those HPLC fractions containing cysteine were identified by virtue of their radiolabel and pooled, and the attendant peptides were identified by Edman degradation. In the second step, the [35S]cysteine-labeled bC2GnT-M was digested with trypsin without prior reduction and alkylation. The tryptic digests were subjected to chromatography on C8 RP-HPLC. In the third step, each [35S]cysteine-containing peak from C8 chromatographic profile was reduced, alkylated, and rechromatographed by C18 RP-HPLC. The cysteines involved in cystine pairing were identified by comparing the profile with that obtained in step one. In this study, [35S]methionine labeling was also employed to identify the peptides that contain both cysteine and methionine. RP-HPLC Separation of Tryptic Peptides from Reduced-Alkylated bC2GnT-M Labeled with [35S]Cysteine or [35S]Methionine—C18 (0.46 × 25 cm) (Vydac; 300 Å, 5 μm) column was used for establishing the profile of fully reduced and alkylated tryptic peptides first. It was then used for identification of the cysteines involved in cystine pairing. Tryptic peptides prepared from reduced-alkylated bC2GnT-M labeled with [35S]cysteine or [35S]methionine were injected onto a C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A) at 42 °C. The column was eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min for 3 min with buffer A followed by an acetonitrile gradient at 0.32%/min for 100 min, 4.2%/min for 15 min and then re-equilibrated with buffer A. One-minute fractions were collected in silanized polypropylene tubes containing 4.5 μg of myoglobin/tube as carrier (25Bedows E. Huth J.R. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions were monitored by liquid scintillation counting. The fractions containing 35S label were concentrated by Speed-Vac and stored at -20 °C before amino acid sequencing. RP-HPLC Separation of Tryptic Peptides from Alkylated bC2GnT-M Labeled with [35S]Cysteine or [35S]Methionine—A C8 reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) (Vydac; 300 Å, 5 μm) was used to isolate glycopeptides linked via disulfide bonds. Tryptic peptides of alkylated bC2GnT-M labeled with [35S]cysteine or [35S]methionine were injected onto a C8 column equilibrated with buffer A at 42 °C. The column was eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min for 3 min with buffer A followed by acetonitrile gradients (0.8%/min for 30 min, 0.23%/min for 70 min, 4.2%/min for 15 min) and then re-equilibrated with buffer A. The 35S-containing fractions collected and analyzed as described above were concentrated by Speed-Vac, reconstituted in 1.5 ml of 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol under argon gas, and incubated at 37 °C for 3-5 h. Then free thiols were alkylated with 15 mm iodoacetamide under subdued light (26Le Grice S.F.J. Ruddon R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 187: 307-314Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 27Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxymethylated [35S]cysteine (or methionine)-containing peptides were then separated by C18 RP-HPLC as described above. Amino Acid Sequencing—[35S]Cysteine- or [35S]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides were concentrated to less than 50 μl using a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant). Each sample was loaded onto a Polybrene-coated, trifluoroacetic acid-treated cartridge filter (Applied Biosystems) and sequenced using a pulse liquid protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 477A). After each cycle of Edman degradation, the released amino acid derivatives were collected and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to determine the position(s) of radiolabeled cysteine or methionine in each peptide (28Carlson R.B. Bahl O.P. Swaminathan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6810-6827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing was performed in the protein sequencing facility at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (Omaha, NE). Bio-Gel P-4 Column Chromatography—A Bio-Gel P-4 (200-400-mesh) column (1 × 50 cm) was employed to separate the two cysteine-containing peptides, which co-eluted at peak a (see Fig. 2) of the C18 RP-HPLC chromatogram of the tryptic peptides prepared from reduced-alkylated bC2GnT-M. The column was eluted with water at 1 ml/min and collected at 1 ml/fraction. Fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to localize the [35S]cysteine in these two [35S]cysteine-containing peptides. Deglycosylation of bC2GnT-M—The purified bC2GnT-M was treated under denaturing conditions at 37 °C for 3 h with 1) buffer alone, 2) N-glycanase, 3) sialidase A plus O-glycanase, and 4) N-glycanase and sialidase A plus O-glycanase according to the protocol provided (Prozyme, Inc.). The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The fetuin provided by the supplier was treated under same conditions to validate the reagents and the protocol. Fold Recognition and Molecular Modeling of bC2GnT-M—Due to the lack of appropriate templates (with sequence similarity greater than 30%) for homology modeling, the “inverse folding” approach (29Godzik A. Skolnick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12098-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was used to determine a set of known three-dimensional protein structures, which were compatible with our sequence of interest. The Matchmaker module of SYBYL 6.8 software package (TRIPOS, Inc., St. Louis, MO) was utilized to find crystal structures from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (available on the World Wide Web at www.pdb.org) with three-dimensional folds that match structural properties of the sequence of bC2GnT-M. Matchmaker examines propensities of amino acid residues from the protein sequence to be in a certain environment (solvent-exposed or buried), finds the optimal alignment (frozen or thawed mode) of the sequence to the “structural fingerprint” describing the three-dimensional environment at each residue position, and estimates pseudoenergy scores for different protein folds. Three sets of gap penalties corresponding to Standard, Restrictive or Permissive parameters were used to scan the structural data base. Matchmaker and SYBYL graphical interfaces were used to analyze results. Finally, the Biopolymer module of SYBYL was used to build and analyze structural model of the bC2GnT-M molecule. Purification and Characterization of the Recombinant bC2GnT-M Secreted into the Medium—We found that the recombinant enzyme secreted into the medium was fully active. However, the relative activity of the recombinant bC2GnT-M toward the three acceptors, core 1, core 3, and blood group i oligosaccharides, was changed from 0.7/1.0/0.4 in the wild-type bC2GnT-M (17Choi K.H. Osorio F.A. Cheng P.-W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to 6.0/1.0/1.0 in the recombinant bC2GnT-M. Treatment with dithiothreitol (2.5 mm) and β-mercaptoethanol (10 mm) did not affect the enzyme activity. The yield of the recombinant C2GnT-M isolated from the serum-free conditioned medium by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column was about 1.5 μg/ml. Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-PAGE gel of the purified recombinant showed a single band of about 58 kDa (Fig. 1), which was larger than the calculated molecular mass (52,479 Da) of the recombinant protein. Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody also showed one band. Treatment of the purified enzyme with N-glycanase with or without sialidase A plus O-glycanase decreased the size of the recombinant protein by about 4-5 kDa, suggesting that the recombinant protein was N-glycosylated at one or both of the two potential N-glycosylation sites, N-72 and N-108 (17Choi K.H. Osorio F.A. Cheng P.-W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The lack of apparent change in size after treatment with sialidase A plus O-glycanase suggests either the absence or presence of a small amount of O-glycan T antigen with or without sialic acid in the recombinant bC2GnT-M.
