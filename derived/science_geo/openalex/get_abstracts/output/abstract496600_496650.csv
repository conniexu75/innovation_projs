https://openalex.org/W2162785195,"Dynamic instability, the stochastic switching between growth and shrinkage, is essential for microtubule function. This behavior is driven by GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice and is inhibited by anticancer agents like Taxol. We provide insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures (4.7-5.6 Å) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by GMPCPP or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the α-tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both α- and β-tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a GMPCPP-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces."

However, the nature and extent of TCR cross-reactivity has not been conclusively measured experimentally. We developed a system to identify MHC-presented peptide ligands by combining TCR selection of highly diverse yeast-displayed peptide-MHC libraries with deep sequencing. Although we identified hundreds of peptides reactive with each of five different mouse and human TCRs, the selected peptides possessed TCR recognition motifs that bore a close resemblance to their known antigens. This structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface allowed us to exploit deep-sequencing information to computationally identify activating microbial and self-ligands for human autoimmune TCRs. The mechanistic basis of TCR cross-reactivity described here enables effective surveillance of diverse self and foreign antigens without necessitating degenerate recognition of nonhomologous peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2069202441,"E-cadherin is a major homophilic cell-cell adhesion molecule that inhibits motility of individual cells on matrix. However, its contribution to migration of cells through cell-rich tissues is less clear. We developed an in vivo sensor of mechanical tension across E-cadherin molecules, which we combined with cell-type-specific RNAi, photoactivatable Rac, and morphodynamic profiling, to interrogate how E-cadherin contributes to collective migration of cells between other cells. Using the Drosophila ovary as a model, we found that adhesion between border cells and their substrate, the nurse cells, functions in a positive feedback loop with Rac and actin assembly to stabilize forward-directed protrusion and directionally persistent movement. Adhesion between individual border cells communicates direction from the lead cell to the followers. Adhesion between motile cells and polar cells holds the cluster together and polarizes each individual cell. Thus, E-cadherin is an integral component of the guidance mechanisms that orchestrate collective chemotaxis in vivo."

Although the molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity are well characterized in excitatory neurons, the mechanisms that regulate this process in inhibitory neurons are only poorly understood. Here, we describe a transcriptional program that is induced by neuronal activity in inhibitory neurons. We find that, while neuronal activity induces expression of early-response transcription factors such as Npas4 in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, Npas4 activates distinct programs of late-response genes in inhibitory and excitatory neurons. These late-response genes differentially regulate synaptic input to these two types of neurons, promoting inhibition onto excitatory neurons while inducing excitation onto inhibitory neurons. These findings suggest that the functional outcomes of activity-induced transcriptional responses are adapted in a cell-type-specific manner to achieve a circuit-wide homeostatic response.

These findings suggest that the functional outcomes of activity-induced transcriptional responses are adapted in a cell-type-specific manner to achieve a circuit-wide homeostatic response. Experience-dependent synaptic plasticity underlies multiple aspects of learning and memory and is important early in life during critical periods when sensory experience is necessary for the development of cortical circuits (Hensch, 2005Hensch T.K. Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, Wiesel and Hubel, 1963Wiesel T.N. Hubel D.H. Single-cell responses in striate cortex of kittens deprived of vision in one eye.J. Neurophysiol. 1963; 26: 1003-1017PubMed Google Scholar). Research over several decades has revealed that physical changes at synapses that form on excitatory and inhibitory neurons are important for the nervous system’s adaptive responses to sensory input. Though specific molecular mechanisms by which neuronal activity modifies synapses on excitatory neurons have been identified, it remains to be determined how synapses on cortical inhibitory neurons adapt to changing levels of neuronal activity. Because inhibition is critically important for experience-dependent plasticity and normal cognitive function (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis D.A. Hashimoto T. Volk D.W. Cortical inhibitory neurons and schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar), identifying these molecular mechanisms in inhibitory neurons is key to understanding how cortical circuits respond to sensory input. Inhibitory neurons regulate cortical function by controlling action potential generation, preventing runaway excitation, sharpening excitatory neuron tuning, and entraining oscillatory firing of cohorts of excitatory neurons (Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011Isaacson J.S. Scanziani M. How inhibition shapes cortical activity.Neuron. 2011; 72: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005Somogyi P. Klausberger T. Defined types of cortical interneurone structure space and spike timing in the hippocampus.J. Physiol. 2005; 562: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Subtypes of inhibitory neurons differ from each other with respect to their developmental lineage, morphology, gene expression program, electrophysiological properties, and postsynaptic targets (Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Despite this diversity, inhibitory neurons can be broadly grouped into three nonoverlapping functionally distinct subtypes based on whether they express somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), or the 5HT3a receptor (Rudy et al., 2011Rudy B. Fishell G. Lee S. Hjerling-Leffler J. Three groups of interneurons account for nearly 100% of neocortical GABAergic neurons.Dev. Neurobiol. 2011; 71: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). A variety of cellular mechanisms have been identified that mediate the response of inhibitory neurons to sensory input; for instance, sensory experience promotes the maturation of inhibitory neurons by increasing their membrane excitability during brain development and by promoting the growth of dendritic and axonal arbors (Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004Chattopadhyaya B. Di Cristo G. Higashiyama H. Knott G.W. Kuhlman S.J. Welker E. Huang Z.J.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7040-7052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Excitatory synaptic inputs to inhibitory neurons also undergo changes in response to activity, including short- and long-lasting plasticity (Kullmann et al., 2012Kullmann D.M. Moreau A.W. Bakiri Y. Nicholson E. Plasticity of inhibition.Neuron. 2012; 75: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite this increased understanding of the cellular basis of inhibitory neuron plasticity, the molecular mechanisms by which neuronal activity affects the development and plasticity of excitatory synapses onto inhibitory neurons are poorly characterized. Studies of excitatory neurons have revealed that neuronal activity regulates synapse development and function through several distinct mechanisms, including the transcriptional induction of regulators of synaptic function (Flavell and Greenberg, 2008Flavell S.W. Greenberg M.E. Signaling mechanisms linking neuronal activity to gene expression and plasticity of the nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 563-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Upon membrane depolarization, calcium enters neurons through NMDA receptors and L-type calcium channels and initiates a signaling cascade that activates pre-existing transcription factors. These factors then induce the transcription of early-response genes, which are enriched for additional transcription factors (e.g., Fos, Npas4, Zif268) that subsequently promote the transcription of late-response genes. These late-induced genes include regulators of synaptic connectivity that act locally at synaptic sites (e.g., Bdnf, Cpg15/Nrn1, Homer1). In excitatory neurons, this gene network functions to promote neuronal survival and dendritic morphogenesis, as well as to restrict the number of excitatory synapses and increase the number of inhibitory synapses that form on excitatory neurons (Bloodgood et al., 2013Bloodgood B.L.

Activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory synapse development by Npas4.Nature. 2008; 455: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Npas4 is an early-response transcription factor that is enriched in the brain and induced in excitatory neurons specifically upon calcium influx and that has been suggested to regulate excitatory-inhibitory balance within neural circuits (Bloodgood et al., 2013Bloodgood B.L. Sharma N. Browne H.A. Trepman A.Z. Greenberg M.E.

Npas4: a neuronal transcription factor with a key role in social and cognitive functions relevant to developmental disorders.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e46604Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Npas4 deletion leads to an impairment of several forms of neuronal plasticity, suggesting that expression of Npas4 is necessary for the nervous system to adapt to sensory input (Maya-Vetencourt et al., 2012Maya-Vetencourt J.F. Tiraboschi E. Greco D. Restani L. Cerri C. Auvinen P. Maffei L. Castrén E. Experience-dependent expression of NPAS4 regulates plasticity in adult visual cortex.J.

Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We show here that neuronal activity induces a distinct Npas4-dependent gene program in inhibitory neurons that functions to promote the development of excitatory synapses on SST-positive inhibitory neurons. Though neuronal activity induces the same early-response transcription factors such as Npas4 in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, it induces distinct but overlapping sets of late-response genes in these two types of neurons. This allows the synapses that form on inhibitory and excitatory neurons to be modified by neuronal activity in a manner specific to their function within a circuit. In excitatory neurons, Npas4 activates transcription of Bdnf, thereby promoting an increased number of inhibitory synapses on excitatory neurons. In SST neurons, Npas4 regulates a distinct set of target genes that serve to increase excitatory input onto SST neurons, likely resulting in enhanced feedback inhibition within cortical circuits. Thus, the same activity-regulated transcription factor, by controlling distinct networks of genes, differentially regulates synaptic input to excitatory and inhibitory neurons, thereby facilitating appropriate circuit responses to sensory experience. To study activity-dependent gene expression in inhibitory neurons, we prepared neuronal cultures highly enriched for these neurons by taking advantage of the fact that, early in their development, inhibitory neurons are localized to specialized regions of the embryonic brain, the ganglionic eminences, that are devoid of excitatory neurons (Wonders and Anderson, 2006Wonders C.P. Anderson S.A. The origin and specification of cortical interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). We dissected the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) at embryonic day 14 (E14), dissociated the tissue, and maintained the resulting cells in vitro for 10 days (Figure 1A). We find by immunostaining, western blot, quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR), and microarray analysis (see below) that MGE cultures are highly enriched for the inhibitory markers Gad65/67 (Figures 1B–1D and S1A and S1G ). Conversely, MGE cultures are almost completely devoid of markers of excitatory neurons such as Vglut1 (Slc17a7) and Tbr1 and of glia-specific GFAP (Figures 1D, S1A, S1C, and S1G). Moreover, by immunostaining with antibodies directed against markers of various inhibitory neuron subtypes, we find that MGE cultures contain a variety of inhibitory neuron subtypes that match the subtypes found in the MGE in vivo (Figure S1C; Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Finally, using double immunolabeling for pre- and postsynaptic marker proteins (Figure S1D) and electrophysiological recordings of miniature synaptic currents (data not shown), we detect a large number of inhibitory synapses but very few excitatory synapses in MGE cultures. For the purpose of comparison, we also prepared cultures that are devoid of inhibitory neurons by dissecting and dissociating the mouse cortex at E14, a time during brain development before most inhibitory neurons have migrated to the cortex (named from here on CTX cultures; Figure 1A). DIV10 CTX cultures are almost completely devoid of Gad65/67-positive neurons, and they contain substantially more Vglut1 (Slc17a7) mRNA than MGE cultures (Figures 1B–1D and S1G). Thus, MGE and CTX cultures are highly enriched for inhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively, and as such should be useful for examining how neuronal activity affects gene expression in these two subsets of neurons.Figure S1Neuronal Culture Systems to Assay Cell-Type-Specific Inducible Transcriptional Programs in Inhibitory and Excitatory Neurons, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis of marker proteins Tbr1 (expressed only in excitatory neurons) and Gad65/67 (expressed only in inhibitory neurons) in age-matched MGE (E14 embryos, DIV9) and mixed cortical (E16.5 embryos, DIV7) cultures.(B) Western blot analysis of Npas4 and Fos protein in lysates of age-matched MGE (DIV9) and mixed cortical cultures (DIV7) silenced overnight with TTX and AP-5 and depolarized with 55 mM KCl for 0 (-) or 2 hr (+).(C) MGE-derived cultures contain multiple inhibitory neuron subtypes.

(G) Controls for the cell type specificity of the samples analyzed by microarray. Heatmap showing probe set intensity of known cell-type-specific genes in each experimental condition. Probe set intensities are the mean values from two independent biological replicates. To identify the activity-dependent gene program in inhibitory neurons, MGE cultures were incubated with TTX and AP-5 to block sodium channels and NMDA receptors, respectively, and were then exposed to elevated levels of potassium chloride (55 mM KCl) to induce membrane depolarization and calcium influx. RNA was purified from samples after 0, 1, and 6 hr of stimulation, and microarray analysis was performed. We also performed a similar depolarization experiment using CTX cultures so that we could compare the activity-dependent gene program induced in those two neuronal subpopulations. In MGE cultures, almost all of the probe sets maximally induced after 1 hr of membrane depolarization (26 out of 28) were also induced in CTX cultures 1 hr after depolarization, indicating that the early transcriptional response to membrane depolarization is very similar in MGE and CTX cultures (Figures 1E and 1F). As in excitatory neurons, the set of early-response genes in MGE cultures is significantly enriched for transcriptional regulators (Gene Ontology term “Transcription Regulator Activity”; p = 2.7 × 10−4). Strikingly, 11 of the 12 transcriptional regulators acutely induced by neuronal activity in MGE-derived cultures are also induced in excitatory neurons and include immediate-early genes such as Fos, FosB, Egr1-3, Nr4a1, and Npas4 that are known to robustly respond to neuronal activity and to mediate important neuronal functions (Table S3; Flavell and Greenberg, 2008Flavell S.W. Greenberg M.E. Signaling mechanisms linking neuronal activity to gene expression and plasticity of the nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 563-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the opposing functions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within a neural circuit, neuronal activity induces a common early-response gene program in excitatory and inhibitory neurons that is enriched for transcriptional activators (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1B). We next asked whether the shared early-response transcription factors induced in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons regulate the same set of late-response genes or whether they regulate cell-type-specific sets of late-response genes that might mediate the response of specific neuronal subtypes to sensory input. To this end, we identified probe sets maximally induced 6 hr after membrane depolarization in MGE and CTX cultures and found a large number of late-induced probe sets in both cultures (MGE, 438 probe sets; CTX, 808 probe sets). However, only ∼25% of these probe sets (230 out of 1025) are induced in both MGE and CTX cultures, indicating that neuronal activity induces distinct sets of late-response genes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Figures 1E and 1F). These findings were corroborated by high-throughput sequencing of MGE cultures (RNA-seq) and qPCR experiments (Figures 1G and S1F). Stimulation of MGE and CTX cultures with glutamate confirmed that common sets of early-response genes and distinct sets of late-response genes are activated by multiple activity paradigms in vitro (Figure S1E). Taken together, these analyses indicate that inhibitory and excitatory neurons share a common set of rapidly induced transcription factors that likely regulate distinct sets of late-response genes. To determine whether neuronal activity driven by sensory experience in vivo also induces shared early-response genes and distinct sets of late-response genes in inhibitory and excitatory neurons, we generated mice heterozygous for alleles of either Emx1-Cre (expressed specifically in excitatory neurons) or Gad2-Cre (expressed specifically in inhibitory neurons) harboring the Rpl22-HA (RiboTag) allele, which expresses an HA-tagged ribosomal subunit specifically in Cre-expressing neurons (Sanz et al., 2009Sanz E. Yang L. Su T. Morris D.R. McKnight G.S. Amieux P.S. Cell-type-specific isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA from complex tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 13939-13944Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The resulting animals permit the immunopurification of ribosomally associated RNAs selectively from either excitatory or inhibitory neurons using anti-HA antibodies. qPCR analysis of cell-type-specific marker genes showed that samples immunopurified from Emx1-Cre mice were highly enriched for Tbr1 and Vglut1 (Slc17a7) mRNA, whereas samples from Gad2-Cre mice were highly enriched for Gad65 (Gad2) and Gad67 (Gad1) mRNA (Figure 2A). With this approach, we examined the cell-type-specific regulation of selected activity-responsive genes in vivo. RiboTag animals maintained in the dark were exposed to light for 0, 1, 3, or 7.5 hr, their visual cortices dissected, and ribosomal-associated RNA immunopurified from either excitatory or inhibitory neurons. qPCR analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitates confirms the induction of a common set of early-response factors, including Egr1, Fos, FosB, and Npas4 in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons (Figure 2B). Although a subset of late-response genes shared between excitatory and inhibitory cell types is apparent (e.g., Fosl2, Gpr3, Rgs2, and Vgf), we also observe cell-type-specific regulation of late-response genes that recapitulated the expression patterns observed in vitro, including late-response genes specific to either inhibitory (e.g., E530001K10RIK, Igf1, Pnoc, Pthlh) or excitatory (e.g., Adcyap1, Bdnf, Nrn1, and Ptgs2) neurons (Figures 2C–2E). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that sensory experience induces shared sets of early-response genes and distinct but overlapping sets of late-response genes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in vivo in an intact neural circuit. Furthermore, these in vivo experiments confirm that MGE and CTX cultures are a useful paradigm for studying the cell-type-specific molecular events that occur in response to neuronal activity in inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Rather than focus on a single late-response gene induced selectively in MGE cultures, to assess the general function of the activity-dependent gene program in inhibitory neurons, we investigated the function of a shared early-response transcription factor, Npas4. Because Npas4 promotes inhibitory synapse development on excitatory neurons by activating Bdnf but Bdnf is not expressed in inhibitory neurons in vitro or in vivo, we hypothesized that Npas4 induces distinct sets of late-response genes in excitatory or inhibitory neurons, thereby mediating cell-type-specific responses that are tuned to the function of a neuron within a circuit. By identifying the specific function of Npas4 and its transcriptional targets in inhibitory neurons, we might characterize the molecular response of inhibitory neurons to activity. We first asked which inhibitory neuron subtypes express Npas4 in vitro in response to membrane depolarization and in vivo in response to sensory stimulation. We membrane depolarized E16.5 mixed cortical cultures and immunostained for Npas4 and marker proteins that are selectively expressed in distinct inhibitory neuron subtypes. Upon membrane depolarization, each of the inhibitory neuron subtypes examined expresses Npas4 (Figures S2A and S2B). To assess Npas4 expression in vivo, we generated mice in which genetically defined subtypes of inhibitory neurons were fluorescently labeled. These mice were dark housed for several days and perfused either without having been exposed to light (dark housed) or after 2.5 hr of light exposure (light exposed). We immunolabeled brain sections with anti-Npas4 antibodies and quantified the percentage of each inhibitory neuron subtype that stained positive for Npas4. No Npas4-positive inhibitory neurons were observed in the visual cortex of dark-housed mice; however, upon light exposure, we find induction of Npas4 expression in all inhibitory neuron types analyzed (e.g., Dlx5/6, PV, SST, VIP) (Figure 2F). Consistent with our in vitro results, Npas4 is expressed in SST- and VIP-positive neurons and in a smaller fraction of PV-positive neurons (Figure 2G). This pattern of Npas4 induction is also observed when subtypes of inhibitory neurons were identified using antibodies that recognize proteins that are selectively expressed in specific inhibitory neuron subtypes (Figure S2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Npas4 is induced in multiple inhibitory neuron subtypes in vitro upon membrane depolarization and in vivo after sensory stimulation. To investigate the function of Npas4 in inhibitory neurons, we focused on SST-expressing neurons because Npas4 is highly induced in these neurons and because SST neurons media"

https://openalex.org/W1966758872,"The evolution of the ratite birds has been widely attributed to vicariant speciation, driven by the Cretaceous breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madagascan elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest ratite lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant birds and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these birds are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal ratite lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted dispersal in all major ratite lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2029687716,"DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic gene-regulation mechanism. DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE (DRM) is a key de novo methyltransferase in plants, but how DRM acts mechanistically is poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the methyltransferase domain of tobacco DRM (NtDRM) and reveal a molecular basis for its rearranged structure. NtDRM forms a functional homodimer critical for catalytic activity. We also show that Arabidopsis DRM2 exists in complex with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) and preferentially methylates one DNA strand, likely the strand acting as the template for RNA polymerase V-mediated noncoding RNA transcripts. This strand-biased DNA methylation is also positively correlated with strand-biased siRNA accumulation. These data suggest a model in which DRM2 is guided to target loci by AGO4-siRNA and involves base-pairing of associated siRNAs with nascent RNA transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2073120856,"Cancer cells must integrate multiple biosynthetic demands to drive indefinite proliferation. How these key cellular processes, such as metabolism and protein synthesis, crosstalk to fuel cancer cell growth is unknown. Here, we uncover the mechanism by which the Myc oncogene coordinates the production of the two most abundant classes of cellular macromolecules, proteins, and nucleic acids in cancer cells. We find that a single rate-limiting enzyme, phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2), promotes increased nucleotide biosynthesis in Myc-transformed cells. Remarkably, Prps2 couples protein and nucleotide biosynthesis through a specialized cis-regulatory element within the Prps2 5' UTR, which is controlled by the oncogene and translation initiation factor eIF4E downstream Myc activation. We demonstrate with a Prps2 knockout mouse that the nexus between protein and nucleotide biosynthesis controlled by PRPS2 is crucial for Myc-driven tumorigenesis. Together, these studies identify a translationally anchored anabolic circuit critical for cancer cell survival and an unexpected vulnerability for ""undruggable"" oncogenes, such as Myc. PAPERFLICK:"

In addition, overexpression of these miRNAs inhibits tumorigenesis, leading to broad consensus that they function as cell-autonomous epithelial tumor suppressors. We generated mice with deletion of miR-143/145 to investigate the functions of these miRNAs in intestinal physiology and disease in vivo. Although intestinal development proceeded normally in the absence of these miRNAs, epithelial regeneration after injury was dramatically impaired. Surprisingly, we found that miR-143/145 are expressed and function exclusively within the mesenchymal compartment of intestine. Defective epithelial regeneration in miR-143/145-deficient mice resulted from the dysfunction of smooth muscle and myofibroblasts and was associated with derepression of the miR-143 target Igfbp5, which impaired IGF signaling after epithelial injury.

Instead, miRNA deletion has repeatedly been associated with latent pathological defects exposed only upon stressing or taxing an organ system (Leung and Sharp, 2010Leung A.K.L. Sharp P.A.

These experimental findings have led to the suggestion that mammalian miRNAs commonly function in vivo to buffer cells and tissues against stressors and thereby maintain homeostasis. In keeping with their roles in stress-activated pathways, miRNAs have repeatedly emerged as important diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in human disease states. A particularly important role for miRNAs in cancer pathogenesis has been uncovered through the examination of human tumor samples. Virtually all examined tumor types are characterized by globally abnormal miRNA expression patterns and profiles of miRNA expression are highly informative for tumor classification, prognosis, and response to therapy (Kong et al., 2012Kong Y.W.

Based on these data, it is broadly accepted that miR-143/145 function as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors in colon cancer and other epithelial tumor types. Nevertheless, the natural functions of miR-143/145 in the mammalian intestine and other epithelial tissues that underlie their presumed tumor suppressor activity have not been investigated. The intestine is unique among mammalian tissues in the rate and number of ongoing mitotic divisions it requires for homeostasis. The rapid turnover of the intestinal epithelium depends on the presence of renewing stem cells that can provide a continuous supply of epithelial cells under basal conditions as well as additional cells to re-establish the epithelial barrier after mucosal injury (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H.

The delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation, as well as robust responses to various insults, relies both on intrinsic epithelial mechanisms and extrinsic signals from several sources, including local mesenchymal cells and immune cells. Among the most important regulators of the intestinal epithelium are pericryptal mesenchymal cells, sometimes referred to as intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs), which occupy a position just below the basement membrane of the epithelium. ISEMFs provide important paracrine regulatory signals to intestinal epithelial cells during normal physiologic turnover and in the setting of wound repair (Madison et al., 2005Madison B.B.

The precise origin of these cells is ill defined, but may include activation of resident fibroblasts, dedifferentiation of local smooth muscle cells, or even migration of bone marrow resident progenitors (Powell et al., 2011Powell D.W.

A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that regulate myofibroblast behavior after injury and the paracrine factors that these and other stromal cells secrete to regulate epithelial proliferation and repair is of broad interest because it may allow the co-option of these pathways for therapeutic benefit. To better understand the functions of miR-143/145 in intestinal physiology and disease in vivo, we generated mice with constitutional or tissue-restricted deletion of these miRNAs. While miR-143/145 loss-of-function had no overt effect on intestinal development, we uncovered an essential role for these miRNAs in the epithelial regenerative response induced by intestinal injury. Surprisingly, this phenotype was entirely attributable to a mesenchymal function, as demonstrated by a complete absence of miR-143/145 expression in the intestinal epithelium and lineage-specific deletion studies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the observed defect in epithelial regeneration is mediated by aberrant paracrine signaling by smooth muscle and myofibroblasts. These findings provide important insight into the functions of miR-143/145 in intestinal physiology and tumorigenesis and contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern epithelial repair in this tissue. To study the physiologic functions of miR-143/145 in the intestinal epithelium in vivo, we generated mice harboring miR-143/145flox (miRflox) and miR-143/145null (miR–) alleles using standard homologous recombination techniques (Figure S1A available online). As expected, miR-143/145 were undetectable in miR–/– animals whereas miRflox/flox animals exhibited normal levels of the miRNAs in the absence of Cre (Figures 1A and S1B). As reported elsewhere, germline deletion of these miRNAs resulted in no overt developmental defects and the targeted alleles were transmitted at the expected Mendelian ratios (data not shown) (Boettger et al., 2009Boettger T.

Detailed histologic examination of adult (8–10 weeks of age) wild-type (miR+/+) and miR–/– mice did not reveal any overt abnormalities in the architecture of the intestinal crypt or villus compartments in small and large intestines (Figure 1B and data not shown). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase experiments demonstrated equivalent BrdU uptake and epithelial turnover rates in miR+/+ and miR–/– intestines (Figure S2). Thus, miR-143/145 are dispensable for normal small and large intestinal development in the mouse and do not appreciably regulate the baseline rate of epithelial turnover in this tissue. To assess whether a latent stress-induced defect exists in the intestines of miR–/– mice, we administered dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), which induces a well-tolerated epithelial injury-regeneration sequence in wild-type animals (Clapper et al., 2007Clapper M.L. Cooper H.S. Chang W.-C.L. Dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis-associated neoplasia: a promising model for the development of chemopreventive interventions.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2007; 28: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Following 5 days of DSS administration via drinking water, control mice exhibited transient weight loss and severe acute colitis, leaving patches of completely de-epithelialized mucosa (Figures S3A and S3B). This was followed by a robust regenerative response, evident by 2 days after removal of DSS (experimental day 5+2, hereafter referred to as D5+2), characterized by the presence of elongated, hyperproliferative crypts in ulcer-adjacent areas that stained positively for Ki67 and phosphorylated histone H3 (pH3, a mitotic marker) throughout their lengths, but lacked differentiated goblet cells (Figure 1C). Near complete restoration of the intestinal mucosal architecture was achieved by 9 days after DSS injury (data not shown). Surprisingly, when miR–/– animals were subjected to the identical DSS treatment, a majority succumbed to fulminant disease by D5+2 (Figure 1D). Grossly, the colons of these animals uniformly appeared distended, hemorrhagic, and necrotic (Figure 1E). The mortality of miR–/– mice following exposure to DSS could result from more extensive epithelial injury or a failure to regenerate the damaged epithelium. Weight loss of wild-type and knockout mice after DSS treatment was indistinguishable, suggesting equivalent injury (Figure S3A). Similarly, histologic evidence of tissue injury and apoptosis on experimental day 5 were comparable between miR+/+ and miR–/– animals (Figure S3B). However, despite the similar appearance of wild-type and knockout colons immediately after exposure to DSS, miR–/– mice exhibited a striking deficiency of regenerating crypts after injury (D5+2) (Figure 1C). In miR–/– mice, ulcer-adjacent crypts remained exclusively in the nonregenerative state with numerous goblet cells and proliferation limited to the base. Together, these data indicate that mortality following DSS treatment in miR–/– mice is specifically attributable to a failure of the intestinal epithelium to mount a regenerative response following injury. The regenerative failure in miR–/– mice could result either from an intrinsic epithelial proliferative defect or from a non-cell-autonomous abnormality in a supporting cell population that produces one or more critical paracrine factors. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we first examined the miR-143/145 expression domain in mouse colon using in situ hybridization (ISH) (Figures 2A and 2B ). Robust miR-143/145 expression was detected in the mesenchymal cells of the intestine, especially in smooth muscle cells as reported elsewhere (Boettger et al., 2009Boettger T. Beetz N. Kostin S. Schneider J. Krüger M. Hein L. Braun T. Acquisition of the contractile phenotype by murine arterial smooth muscle cells depends on the Mir143/145 gene cluster.J. Clin.

In contrast, expression of these miRNAs was not detectable within intestinal epithelial cells, contrary to some previously reported ISH studies (Zhu et al., 2011Zhu H. Dougherty U. Robinson V. Mustafi R. Pekow J. Kupfer S. Li Y.-C. Hart J. Goss K. Fichera A. et al.EGFR signals downregulate tumor suppressors miR-143 and miR-145 in Western diet-promoted murine colon cancer: role of G1 regulators.Mol. Cancer Res. 2011; 9: 960-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because these data were at odds with a large body of published literature that implicates miR-143/145 as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors in the intestine, we measured miRNA expression in purified epithelial cells using a more sensitive quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Consistent with our ISH findings, miR-143 and miR-145 were easily detectable in whole colon but nearly undetectable by PCR in mouse (Figure 2C) and human (Figure 2D) epithelial preparations. We also considered the possibility that miR-143/145 might be selectively induced in epithelial cells following injury, but crypt isolation during and after DSS treatment revealed an identical nonepithelial expression pattern at all time points (Figure S4A). A low level of amplification of miR-143/145 in purified epithelium was most likely due to residual contaminating mesenchymal cells in these preparations. To address this possibility directly, we took advantage of our conditional miRflox allele, which can be deleted in specific lineages using appropriate Cre driver lines.

We confirmed the specificity of both Cre lines by crossing to ROSA26LSL-LacZ reporter mice (Figure 3A) and directly examining recombination of the miR-143/145 locus in small and large intestine (Figure S5A). Additionally, a low level of recombination in total bone marrow cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and major hematopoietic lineages was confirmed in Twist2Cre/+; miRflox/flox animals (Figure S5B). miR-143 and miR-145 levels in whole colon were unchanged in Villin-Cre; miRflox/flox animals compared to control littermates, indicating that the detectable miR-143/145 expression in this tissue does not derive from the epithelial compartment (Figure S5C).

https://openalex.org/W2082219413,"The sensation of pain is associated with increased mortality, but it is unknown whether pain perception can directly affect aging. We find that mice lacking TRPV1 pain receptors are long-lived, displaying a youthful metabolic profile at old age. Loss of TRPV1 inactivates a calcium-signaling cascade that ends in the nuclear exclusion of the CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator CRTC1 within pain sensory neurons originating from the spinal cord. In long-lived TRPV1 knockout mice, CRTC1 nuclear exclusion decreases production of the neuropeptide CGRP from sensory endings innervating the pancreatic islets, subsequently promoting insulin secretion and metabolic health. In contrast, CGRP homeostasis is disrupted with age in wild-type mice, resulting in metabolic decline. We show that pharmacologic inactivation of CGRP receptors in old wild-type animals can restore metabolic health. These data suggest that ablation of select pain sensory receptors or the inhibition of CGRP are associated with increased metabolic health and control longevity."

In corticotropin-independent Cushing’s syndrome, the excess cortisol production is primarily attributed to an adrenocortical adenoma, in which the underlying molecular pathogenesis has been poorly understood. We report a hotspot mutation (L206R) in PRKACA , which encodes the catalytic subunit of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)–dependent protein kinase (PKA), in more than 50% of cases with adrenocortical adenomas associated with corticotropin-independent Cushing’s syndrome. The L206R PRKACA mutant abolished its binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA (PRKAR1A) that inhibits catalytic activity of PRKACA, leading to constitutive, cAMP-independent PKA activation. These results highlight the major role of cAMP-independent activation of cAMP/PKA signaling by somatic mutations in corticotropin-independent Cushing’s syndrome, providing insights into the diagnosis and therapeutics of this syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2126175292,"Period (PER) proteins are essential components of the mammalian circadian clock. They form complexes with cryptochromes (CRY), which negatively regulate CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent transactivation of clock and clock-controlled genes. To define the roles of mammalian CRY/PER complexes in the circadian clock, we have determined the crystal structure of a complex comprising the photolyase homology region of mouse CRY1 (mCRY1) and a C-terminal mouse PER2 (mPER2) fragment. mPER2 winds around the helical mCRY1 domain covering the binding sites of FBXL3 and CLOCK/BMAL1, but not the FAD binding pocket. Our structure revealed an unexpected zinc ion in one interface, which stabilizes mCRY1-mPER2 interactions in vivo. We provide evidence that mCRY1/mPER2 complex formation is modulated by an interplay of zinc binding and mCRY1 disulfide bond formation, which may be influenced by the redox state of the cell. Our studies may allow for the development of circadian and metabolic modulators."

The skeletal structure and bonding of the molecule are revealed from imaging the spatial variations of a CO vibration as the CO-terminated tip probes the core of the interactions between adjacent atoms.

TRPM7 is a ubiquitously expressed cationic ion channel and serine/threonine kinase (Nadler et al., 2001Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P.

Global disruption of Trpm7 in mice results in embryonic lethality before embryonic day 7 (E7) (Jin et al., 2008Jin J. Desai B.N. Navarro B. Donovan A. Andrews N.C. Clapham D.E. Deletion of Trpm7 disrupts embryonic development and thymopoiesis without altering Mg2+ homeostasis.Science. 2008; 322: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific reduction of TRPM7 gene expression between E7 and E12 of development results in abnormalities of multiple organs (Jin et al., 2012Jin J. Wu L.J. Jun J. Cheng X. Xu H. Andrews N.C. Clapham D.E. The channel kinase, TRPM7, is required for early embryonic development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E225-E233Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). TRPM7-deficient thymocytes exhibit dysregulated synthesis of many growth factors that are necessary for the differentiation and maintenance of thymic epithelial cells (Jin et al., 2008Jin J. Desai B.N. Navarro B. Donovan A. Andrews N.C. Clapham D.E. Deletion of Trpm7 disrupts embryonic development and thymopoiesis without altering Mg2+ homeostasis.Science. 2008; 322: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Loss of TRPM7 at an intermediate developmental time point alters the myocardial transcriptional profile in adulthood, impairing ventricular function (Sah et al., 2013Sah R. Mesirca P. Mason X. Gibson W. Bates-Withers C. Van den Boogert M. Chaudhuri D. Pu W.T. Mangoni M.E. Clapham D.E. Timing of myocardial trpm7 deletion during cardiogenesis variably disrupts adult ventricular function, conduction, and repolarization.Circulation. 2013; 128: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TRPM7 overexpression in human embryonic kidney cells alters the transcriptional profile of hundreds genes (Lee et al., 2011Lee B.C. Hong S.E. Lim H.H. Kim H. Park C.S. Alteration of the transcriptional profile of human embryonic kidney cells by transient overexpression of mouse TRPM7 channels.Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2011; 27: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These data indicate that TRPM7 is intimately associated with developmental, tissue-specific regulation of gene activity. We set out to determine how TRPM7’s channel or kinase function has such broad, tissue-specific, and age-dependent effects on gene activity. Initially, TRPM7 was thought to mediate cellular Mg2+ homeostasis based on growth arrest in TRPM7-deficient DT-40 B cells: growth arrest could be restored by culturing these cells in media supplemented with high Mg2+ (Nadler et al., 2001Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A.

In other cell types, however, loss of TRPM7 expression resulted in defects in cell growth that could not be rescued by excess Mg2+ (Hanano et al., 2004Hanano T. Hara Y. Shi J. Morita H. Umebayashi C. Mori E. Sumimoto H. Ito Y. Mori Y. Inoue R. Involvement of TRPM7 in cell growth as a spontaneously activated Ca2+ entry pathway in human retinoblastoma cells.J. Pharmacol.

Silencing TRPM7 promotes growth/proliferation and nitric oxide production of vascular endothelial cells via the ERK pathway.Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 83: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, TRPM7 was not essential for proliferation and maintenance of Mg2+ levels in thymocytes derived from mice with a tissue-targeted TrpM7 deletion (Jin et al., 2008Jin J. Desai B.N. Navarro B. Donovan A. Andrews N.C. Clapham D.E. Deletion of Trpm7 disrupts embryonic development and thymopoiesis without altering Mg2+ homeostasis.Science. 2008; 322: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In some cases, TRPM7 appears to modulate Ca2+ signaling (Du et al., 2010Du J. Xie J. Zhang Z. Tsujikawa H. Fusco D. Silverman D. Liang B. Yue L. TRPM7-mediated Ca2+ signals confer fibrogenesis in human atrial fibrillation.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 992-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, Hanano et al., 2004Hanano T. Hara Y. Shi J.

Wessels L.F. et al.TRPM7 is required for breast tumor cell metastasis.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, the consequences of TRPM7’s channel function are not settled; it may vary by tissue type and/or by its relative localization and gating in the cell’s plasma or intracellular membranes. TRPM7’s most unique aspect is its C-terminal active serine/threonine kinase. The functional significance of this coupling of channel and kinase is not clear. Aside from the hypothesis that channel-dependent changes in cytosolic Mg2+ may control the activity of the kinase (Schmitz et al., 2003Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Regulation of vertebrate cellular Mg2+ homeostasis by TRPM7.Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), no experimental data suggest that kinase activity is channel dependent. In turn, kinase activity is not essential for channel gating (Clark et al., 2006Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N.

Although TRPM7 kinase activity may be controlled through the autophosphorylation of a serine/threonine-rich region located N terminal to the catalytic domain (Clark et al., 2008bClark K. Middelbeek J. Morrice N.A. Figdor C.G. Lasonder E. van Leeuwen F.N. Massive autophosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich domain controls protein kinase activity of TRPM6 and TRPM7.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), external signals regulating the kinase activity are not known. In vitro substrates for the TRPM7 kinase, annexin A1 (Dorovkov and Ryazanov, 2004Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. Phosphorylation of annexin I by TRPM7 channel-kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50643-50646Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and myosin IIA heavy chain (Clark et al., 2008aClark K. Middelbeek J. Lasonder E. Dulyaninova N.G. Morrice N.A. Ryazanov A.G.

Biol. 2008; 378: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), are not necessarily substrates in vivo. More recently, the TRPM7 kinase was proposed to regulate phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) via activation of the eEF2-kinase (Perraud et al., 2011Perraud A.L. Zhao X. Ryazanov A.G. Schmitz C. The channel-kinase TRPM7 regulates phosphorylation of the translational factor eEF2 via eEF2-k.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we show that in many cell lines and normal tissues, TRPM7’s kinase is released from the channel domain in a cell-type-specific fashion. TRPM7 cleaved kinases (M7CKs) translocate to the nucleus and bind multiple components of chromatin-remodeling complexes, including Polycomb group proteins. In the nucleus, TRPM7’s kinase modifies specific histone phosphorylation, particularly in the promoters of TRPM7-dependent genes. We show that cytosolic free zinc levels are TRPM7 dependent and regulate M7CK binding to transcription factors containing zinc-binding domains. We hypothesize that TRPM7-mediated increases in cytoplasmic zinc couples channel function to chromatin covalent modification and thus affects cellular differentiation and embryonic development. Although ubiquitously expressed, TRPM7 protein is of low abundance. In order to detect endogenous protein expression, we isolated the protein from large numbers of cells using a mouse antibody for immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by western blot (WB) with rabbit antibodies to avoid antibody cross-reaction. In the course of these experiments, we noticed that in addition to a 210 kDa band corresponding to full-length TRPM7, several lower-molecular-weight bands were consistently detected (Figure 1A). This finding suggested that the endogenous TRPM7 molecule is proteolytically cleaved at specific sites. We refer to these fragments as TRPM7-cleaved kinases (M7CKs). Because both antibodies recognize the TRPM7 C terminus, the major bands corresponded to TRPM7 fragments that were cleaved between the transmembrane and kinase domains. These fragments were not the result of proteolysis during IP because their relative abundance did not vary with time over 2–17 hr (Figure S1A available online). It is unlikely that these bands belong to proteins unrelated to TRPM7, because they were sequentially recognized with two different TRPM7 antibodies used for IP and WB. Yet, to rule out this possibility, we stably expressed C-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TRPM7 and used the well-characterized anti-HA-tag antibody (αHA) for IP and WB. Figure 1A shows that the ectopically expressed TRPM7-HA yielded major fragments identical to those for endogenous TRPM7 as well as a few minor lower-molecular-weight fragments that may have resulted from elevated protein expression. Because TRPM7-HA was ectopically expressed, this result obviates the possibility that C-terminal TRPM7 fragments were products of alternative RNA splicing. The fragments could have been generated from M7CK translation from multiple internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) present on its C terminus or specific posttranslational proteolytic cleavage. However, IRES-dependent translation is unlikely, because among more then 100 eukaryotic cellular mRNAs proposed to contain IRESs, few have putative IRES sequences within exons (Thompson, 2012Thompson S.R. So you want to know if your message has an IRES?.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2012; 3: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; see also http://iresite.org). Moreover, there were no confirmed multiple IRESs within one mRNA. Thus, it is most likely that a proteolytic mechanism underlies the C-terminal fragment formation, as we previously demonstrated for caspase-mediated TRPM7 cleavage (Desai et al., 2012Desai B.N. Krapivinsky G. Navarro B. Krapivinsky L. Carter B.C. Febvay S. Delling M. Penumaka A. Ramsey I.S. Manasian Y. Clapham D.E.

Cell. 2012; 22: 1149-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, a substantial fraction of TRPM7 is cleaved in specific positions of the TRPM7 C terminus, liberating the protein kinase from the channel domain.Figure S1Cleavage Properties of Endogenous TRPM7, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Endogenous TRPM7 cleavage is independent of time after cell lysis.

This result is consistent with the lack of M7CK in neural precursors and the proposed role of M7CK in H3 histone phosphorylation.(D) The endogenous TRPM7 channel moiety is not detected on western blot after kinase cleavage. Stop codons were introduced into N-terminal HA-tagged TRPM7 cDNA to produce TRPM7 truncated after amino acids 1444 (Δ1445), 1396 (Δ1397) and 1298 (Δ1299), corresponding to truncations produced by kinase domain cleavage sites (see Figure S3A).

Stop codons were introduced into N-terminal HA-tagged TRPM7 cDNA to produce TRPM7 truncated after amino acids 1444 (Δ1445), 1396 (Δ1397) and 1298 (Δ1299), corresponding to truncations produced by kinase domain cleavage sites (see Figure S3A). Upper panel: TRPM7 mutant constructs were transiently expressed in 293T cells, IP’d and western-blotted with αHA antibody. Lower panel: TRPM7 was IP’d with αNFP antibody (recognizing the epitope on the TRPM7 N terminus) from cells with high levels of TRPM7 cleavage (>90% in mouse kidney, 50%–70% in SV40 mes13 cells) and western-blotted with αCFP antibody recognizing epitope located at the TRPM7 C terminus. 1 μg SV40 mes13 and 6 μg mouse kidney lysate were used for IP. To increase band resolution, proteins were separated on 3%–8% Tris-acetate gel (Invitrogen). Note that αCFP antibody did not recognize the Δ1299 protein. (E) TRPM7 mRNA was equally expressed (left panel; qPCR data, mean ± SD) in normal (J1) and the Δkinase (TRPM7 truncated after amino acid 1537; Ryazanova et al., 2010Ryazanova L.V. Rondon L.J.

Arrow indicates predicted position for the TRPM7-1537-STOP protein. Different cell types display specific TRPM7 cleavage patterns seen as differences in relative expression of major fragments and generation of unique fragments (Figure 1B). This suggests there are cell-type-specific mechanisms defining the cleavage site and potentially distinct functions for each cleaved fragment. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the TRPM7 cleavage pattern changes during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into specific progenitors (Figure S1). Upon differentiation into embryoid bodies, distinct C-terminal cleaved fragments transiently appeared on days 8–12 of differentiation (Figure S1B). Neuronal progenitors derived from mESCs lack the 65 kDa C-terminal fragment detected in mESCs and display only full-length TRPM7 protein (Figure S1C). Animal tissues also display a diversity of TRPM7 cleavage patterns (Figure 1C) more complex than those observed in cell lines, presumably because each tissue is composed of many cell types. Because a substantial proportion of TRPM7 protein was found as C-terminal fragments in many different cell types (e.g., 50%–70% in SV40 mes13 cells and close to 100% in mouse kidney), we expected to find equivalent amounts of the truncated channel. Thus, we immunoprecipitated TRPM7 with antibody recognizing the N-terminal epitope (NFP, amino acids 532–620) and western blotted with a C-terminal antibody (αCFP, amino acids 1,277–1,380) recognizing an epitope situated upstream of the C-terminal cleavage sites. This antibody combination reliably recognized transiently expressed recombinant full-length or truncated TRPM7 as well as endogenous full-length protein but failed to detect endogenous truncated channels (Figure S1D). The lack of channel-domain-containing protein suggests that the truncated channel was eliminated after C-terminal cleavage. This is consistent with results obtained using genetically modified mESCs that produce a TRPM7 RNA with the stop codon placed in front of kinase domain (halting translation after amino acid 1,537; Ryazanova et al., 2010Ryazanova L.V. Rondon L.J. Zierler S. Hu Z. Galli J. Yamaguchi T.P. Mazur A. Fleig A. Ryazanov A.G. TRPM7 is essential for Mg(2+) homeostasis in mammals.Nat.

Our antibody combination readily detected the full-length channel in WT mESCs and the caspase-cleaved endogenous channel (Desai et al., 2012Desai B.N. Krapivinsky G. Navarro B. Krapivinsky L.

These data suggest that C-terminally truncated TRPM7 protein containing the channel domain is normally eliminated from proliferating cells. In previous experiments (Krapivinsky et al., 2006Krapivinsky G. Mochida S. Krapivinsky L. Cibulsky S.M. Clapham D.E. The TRPM7 ion channel functions in cholinergic synaptic vesicles and affects transmitter release.Neuron. 2006; 52: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we identified proteins that interact with TRPM7 using yeast two-hybrid screening. Evolutionarily conserved protein fragments of the human TRPM7 N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains were chosen as baits. Screening of a human brain library with a bait containing a portion of the TRPM7 C terminus (amino acids 1,364–1,865 of NP_060142.3) revealed the Ring1 and YY1 binding protein, RYBP (NP_036366.3), as a potential TRPM7 interactor. Because RYBP is a transcription factor strictly confined to the nucleus (García et al., 1999García E. Marcos-Gutiérrez C. del Mar Lorente M. Moreno J.C. Vidal M. RYBP, a new repressor protein that interacts with components of the mammalian Polycomb complex, and with the transcription factor YY1.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3404-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and the TRPM7 channel is a plasma membrane and vesicular protein, we assumed that it was a false positive. However, when we performed tandem affinity purification of the same TRPM7 fragment stably expressed in SV40 mes13 cells, we identified a number of nuclear proteins that copurified with TRPM7 (see Table S1). Given that portions of the TRPM7 C terminus are naturally cleaved from the channel and located in the nucleus (shown in Figure 3), we set out to investigate these potential interactions. In order to verify endogenous M7CK-interacting proteins, we generated mESCs lacking TrpM7 (TrpM7−/−; see Experimental Procedures, Figure 1B, and Figure S2) and used these cells as negative controls in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. TRPM7 IP from mESCs confirmed binding of endogenous TRPM7 with the nuclear proteins RYBP, Ruvbl1/pontin, Ruvbl2/reptin, DDX3X, DDB1, and DBC1 (Figure 2A; Figure S3), all constituents of chromatin-remodeling complexes (see Table S2 for annotation of these proteins). RYBP is a component of Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) and also interacts with the transcription factor YY1 (García et al., 1999García E. Marcos-Gutiérrez C. del Mar Lorente M. Moreno J.C.

While neuroanatomical methods enable high-resolution mapping of neural circuitry, these approaches do not allow systematic molecular profiling of neurons based on their connectivity. Here, we report the development of an approach for molecularly profiling projective neurons. We show that ribosomes can be tagged with a camelid nanobody raised against GFP and that this system can be engineered to selectively capture translating mRNAs from neurons retrogradely labeled with GFP. Using this system, we profiled neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. We then used an AAV to selectively profile midbrain dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. By comparing the captured mRNAs from each experiment, we identified a number of markers specific to VTA dopaminergic projection neurons. The current method provides a means for profiling neurons based on their projections."

Yeast metacaspases are structural and possibly functional homologs of caspases that execute apoptosis—programmed cell death—in higher organisms.

Boosting metacaspase levels caused a substantial and robust extension of life span. This lifespan extension was only partly dependent on the caspase activity of Mca1 but required the presence of the protein disaggregase Hsp104. Consistent with a role in proteostasis, Mca1 was recruited to chaperone-enriched aggregates during aging.

Partial melting of the bulk lower mantle is often advocated as the cause, but this does not explain the nonubiquitous character of these regional seismic features. We explored the melting properties of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of melting occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus.

Antibodies to PfSEA-1 decreased parasite replication by arresting schizont rupture, and conditional disruption of PfSEA-1 resulted in a profound parasite replication defect. Vaccination of mice with recombinant Plasmodium berghei PbSEA-1 significantly reduced parasitemia and delayed mortality after lethal challenge with the Plasmodium berghei strain ANKA. Tanzanian children with antibodies to recombinant PfSEA-1A (rPfSEA-1A) did not experience severe malaria, and Kenyan adolescents and adults with antibodies to rPfSEA-1A had significantly lower parasite densities than individuals without these antibodies. By blocking schizont egress, PfSEA-1 may synergize with other vaccines targeting hepatocyte and RBC invasion."

FoxP mutants took longer than wild-type flies to form decisions of similar or reduced accuracy, especially in difficult, low-contrast tasks.

https://openalex.org/W1970724810,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has evolved various mechanisms by which the bacterium can maintain homeostasis under numerous environmental assaults generated by the host immune response. M. tuberculosis harbors enzymes involved in the oxidative stress response that aid in survival during the production of reactive oxygen species in activated macrophages. Previous studies have shown that a dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) is encapsulated by a bacterial nanocompartment, encapsulin (Enc), whereby packaged DyP interacts with Enc via a unique C-terminal extension. M. tuberculosis also harbors an encapsulin homolog (CFP-29, Mt-Enc), within an operon with M. tuberculosis DyP (Mt-DyP), which contains a C-terminal extension. Together these observations suggest that Mt-DyP interacts with Mt-Enc. Furthermore, it has been suggested that DyPs may function as either a heme-dependent peroxidase or a deferrochelatase. Like Mt-DyP, M. tuberculosis iron storage ferritin protein, Mt-BfrB, and an M. tuberculosis protein involved in folate biosynthesis, 7,8-dihydroneopterin aldolase (Mt-FolB), have C-terminal tails that could also interact with Mt-Enc. For the first time, we show by co-purification and electron microscopy that mycobacteria via Mt-Enc can encapsulate Mt-DyP, Mt-BfrB, and Mt-FolB. Functional studies of free or encapsulated proteins demonstrate that they retain their enzymatic activity within the Mt-Enc nanocompartment. Mt-DyP, Mt-FolB, and Mt-BfrB all have antioxidant properties, suggesting that if these proteins are encapsulated by Mt-Enc, then this nanocage may play a role in the M. tuberculosis oxidative stress response. This report provides initial structural and biochemical clues regarding the molecular mechanisms that utilize compartmentalization by which the mycobacterial cell may aid in detoxification of the local environment to ensure long term survival."

RGCs stimulated out of synchrony rapidly lost the ability to drive tectal postsynaptic partners while their axons grew and added many new branches. In contrast, synchronously activated RGCs produced fewer new branches, but these were more stable. The effects of synchronous activation were prevented by the inhibition of neurotransmitter release and N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade, which is consistent with a role for synaptic NMDAR activation in the stabilization of axonal branches and suppression of further exploratory branch addition."

On the basis of experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, at pressures of 95 to 101 gigapascals and temperatures of 2200 to 2400 kelvin, we found that such perovskite is unstable; it loses its Fe and disproportionates to a nearly Fe-free MgSiO 3 perovskite phase and an Fe-rich phase with a hexagonal structure.

We found that fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3, H-FABP), a factor critical for arachidonic acid (AA) transport and metabolism in brain, is highly expressed in DA neurons. Fabp3 knock-out (Fabp3(-/-)) mice were resistant to 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine-induced DA neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta and showed improved motor function. Interestingly, FABP3 interacted with αSyn in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and αSyn accumulation following 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine treatment was attenuated in Fabp3(-/-) compared with wild-type mice. We confirmed that FABP3 overexpression aggravates AA-induced αSyn oligomerization and promotes cell death in PC12 cells, whereas overexpression of a mutant form of FABP3 lacking fatty-acid binding capacity did not. Taken together, αSyn oligomerization in DA neurons is likely aggravated by AA through FABP3 in Parkinson disease pathology."

AR-containing proteins (ARPs) with a hydrophobic residue at the 13th position of two consecutive ARs bind RanGDP efficiently, and consequently enter the nucleus. This code, experimentally tested in 17 ARPs, predicts the nuclear-cytoplasmic localization of over 150 annotated human ARPs with high accuracy and is acquired by the most common familial melanoma-associated CDKN2A mutation, leading to nuclear accumulation of mutant p16ink4a.

Here, we demonstrate that NO-induced S-nitrosylation of CaMKIIα also directly generated autonomous activity, and that CaMKII inhibition protected from NO-induced neuronal cell death.

The results of this study show that specific S-nitrosylation generated CaMKII autonomy and that CaMKII inhibition protected from NO-induced neuronal cell death. CaMKIIα wt and CaM were purified after baculovirus/sf9 cell expression or bacterial expression as previously described (16Coultrap S.J. Buard I. Kulbe J.R. Dell'Acqua M.L. Bayer K.U.

Briefly, HEK cells were homogenized with a motorized pellet pestle (Kontes) for 10 s in 0.4 ml of ice-cold 50 mm PIPES pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and complete protease inhibitor (Roche), then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The CaMKII concentration from the resulting supernatant was determined by their GFP-fluorescence measured in a spectrophotometer (Fluoromax 3; Horiba Jobin Yvon). For the comparison of CaMKII wt to T286A, these extracts were adjusted for equal CaMKII and total HEK cell protein amounts (26Coultrap S.J. Barcomb K. Bayer K.U.

All other mutants were further purified as previously described (16Coultrap S.J. Buard I. Kulbe J.R. Dell'Acqua M.L. Bayer K.U.

Neuromethods: Protein Kinase Technologies. Springer, 2012: 49-72Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 2A C subunit was purchased from Cayman Chemical. The substrate peptide Syntide-2 was from Genescript. NO release from the NO donor Diethylamine NONOate (DEA-NONOate) was measured spectrophotometrically in reaction buffer or deionized water by the disappearance of absorption at 250 nm due to loss of parent compound (ϵ = 6500 m−1cm−1). CaMKII was made autonomous by reacting 200–300 nm kinase for 5 min with Ca2+/CaM (1 mm/1 μm) and 50 mm PIPES pH 7.1 in the presence of either ATP/Mg2+ (0.1/10 mm) on ice (for Thr-286 autophosphorylation) or at room temperature with DEA-NONOate (3 mm; for nitrosylation; Cayman Chemical) or H202 (3 mm; for oxidation). The reaction was diluted and Ca2+ chelated with EDTA (5 mm). Where indicated, kinase was reacted with peroxynitrite (ONOO− Cayman Chemical) instead of NO, and/or in the absence or presence of the ONOO− scavengers tryptophan (Sigma) or MnTMPyP (A.G. Scientific). For experiments where kinase was both phosphorylated and nitrosylated, CaMKII was reacted with DEA-NONOate at room temperature followed by phosphorylation of Thr-286 by addition of ATP/Mg2+ on ice, or this was reversed and kinase was first phosphorylated at Thr-286 on ice, phosphorylation was stopped by addition of EDTA, then the kinase was reacted with NO at room temperature. Thr-305/306 phosphorylation was induced by chelating Ca2+ in the presence of ATP (after Thr-286 phosphorylation or nitrosylation). Kinase activity was assessed by 32P incorporation into the peptide substrate syntide 2, either in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (1.2 mm/1 μm) or EGTA (1.5 mm), as previously described (16Coultrap S.J. Buard I. Kulbe J.R. Dell'Acqua M.L. Bayer K.U. CaMKII autonomy is substrate-dependent and further stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin.J. Biol.

Neuromethods: Protein Kinase Technologies. Springer, 2012: 49-72Google Scholar). To ensure that reactions are within the linear range, 1 min reaction times (at 30 °C) were used for stimulated activity and Thr-286-induced autonomy (16Coultrap S.J. Buard I. Kulbe J.R. Dell'Acqua M.L. Bayer K.U. CaMKII autonomy is substrate-dependent and further stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17930-17937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); reaction times of up to 5 min were used only for conditions with lower activity. Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm DTT, 67.5 mm Tris pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.16 mg/ml bromphenol blue), separated on 10% acrylamide gels then transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (or 5% BSA for the phospho-T305 detection) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either antibodies against either CaMKIIα (1:2000; CBα2, produced in-house), phospho-T286 (1:3000; Phosphosolutions), or phospho-T305 (1:1000; AssayBiotech). Blots were imaged with a chemiimager (Alpha Innotech) after exposure to Supersignal West Femto ECL reagent (Pierce). Detection of S-nitrosylation was assessed using the biotin-switch method (28Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. The biotin switch method for the detection of S-nitrosylated proteins.Sci STKE. 2001; 2001: pl1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaMKII WT or mutant was nitrosylated in the presence of Ca2+/CaM in HEPES pH 7.1 buffer as described above, then diluted in HEN buffer (HEPES pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm neocuprione). Proteins were then precipitated at −20 °C with 4 volumes of cold acetone for 20 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was rinsed with ice cold acetone, resuspended in HEN buffer, then non-nitrosylated cysteines were blocked with 25 mm MMTS in 2.5% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C. Proteins were again acetone precipitated to remove unreacted MMTS and resuspended in HEN buffer with 1% SDS. The nitro-cysteine was then reduced with 1 mm ascorbate and the reduced cysteine labeled using the non-cleavable biotin-BMCC (250 μm) for 1 h at room temperature. Unreacted biotin was removed by acetone precipitating the proteins. Proteins were then run on Western blots, and biotinylation was detected using the avidin-based vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories). Neuronal cell death was measured by release of LDH into the media using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche) as previously described (6Vest R.S. O'Leary H. Coultrap S.J. Kindy M.S. Bayer K.U. Effective post-insult neuroprotection by a novel Ca(2+)/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20675-20682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, medium density primary disassociated hippocampal cultures were prepared from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats and plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates. Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal A media with B-27 supplement, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mm Glutamax at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 14 DIV, cell death was induced by addition of 100 μm glutamate or 300 μm DEA-NONOate to the media for 5 min. Wells with inhibitor had 100 μm APV or 5 μm tatCN21 or scrambled control peptide included during the treatment as well a 20-min pretreatment. Incubation of purified CaMKIIα (in the presence of Ca2+/CaM) either with an oxidizer (H2O2) or with an NO donor (DEA-NONOate) both generated autonomous activity (measured after chelation of Ca2+), with higher autonomy generated by the NO donor (Fig. 2A). NO release by the NO donor is well controlled, with no release under acidic conditions (as in deionized water) and with near maximal release within 5 min after addition to buffer at pH 7.2 (Fig. 2B). As expected, NO-induced autonomy was abolished by C280/M281V mutation (analogous to CaMKIIδ oxidation and M281/282V mutation; Ref. 11Erickson J.R. Joiner M.L. Guan X. Kutschke W. Yang J. Oddis C.V. Bartlett R.K. Lowe J.S. O'Donnell S.E. Aykin-Burns N. Zimmerman M.C. Zimmerman K. Ham A.J. Weiss R.M. Spitz D.R. Shea M.A. Colbran R.J. Mohler P.J. Anderson M.E. A dynamic pathway for calcium-independent activation of CaMKII by methionine oxidation.Cell. 2008; 133: 462-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, autonomy was also abolished by C289V mutation (Fig. 2A), indicating that simultaneous S-nitrosylation of both Cys-280 and Cys-289 was required to induce autonomy, and that individual nitrosylation of either residue alone was not sufficient. To test the possibility that generation of autonomous CaMKII activity by the NO donor was dependent on promoting Thr-286 autophosphorylation, a CaMKII T286A mutant was used. The NO donor induced autonomy also for the CaMKII T286A mutant (Fig. 2C), indicating that the effect was independent of Thr-286 phosphorylation. If any, NO-induced autonomy of the T286A mutant was even higher compared with CaMKII wild type (Fig. 2C), an effect that could be due to reduced auto-inhibitory interactions within the T286A mutant. Additionally, the effects of two mechanistically distinct CaMKII inhibitors were tested: KN93, which is Ca2+/CaM-competitive (29Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. The newly synthesized selective Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN-93 reduces dopamine contents in PC12h cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and tatCN21, which does not act through competition with Ca2+/CaM (27Vest R.S. Davies K.D. O'Leary H. Port J.D. Bayer K.U. Dual Mechanism of a Natural CaMKII Inhibitor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 5024-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As expected based on these different modes of inhibition, tatCN21 completely blocked NO-induced autonomous CaMKII activity, while KN93 had no significant effect (Fig. 2C). The same differential effect of these two inhibitors has been observed previously for Thr-286-induced CaMKII autonomy (6Vest R.S. O'Leary H. Coultrap S.J. Kindy M.S. Bayer K.U. Effective post-insult neuroprotection by a novel Ca(2+)/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20675-20682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). While a 5-min incubation with the NO donor and Ca2+/CaM generated autonomous CaMKII activity (Figs. 2A and 3A), it did not affect maximally Ca2+/CaM-stimulated activity (Fig. 3A), as measured by subsequent activity assays with or without chelation of Ca2+ after the initial incubation. Presence of Ca2+/CaM was required to induce CaMKII autonomy by the NO donor, as no autonomous activity was induced when Ca2+/CaM was omitted from the initial incubation (Fig. 3A). Thus, generation of this novel form of CaMKII autonomy requires coinciding NO and Ca2+ signals. A previous study showed that NO inhibits CaMKII activity through S-nitrosylation at C6 (30Song T. Hatano N. Kambe T. Miyamoto Y. Ihara H. Yamamoto H. Sugimoto K. Kume K. Yamaguchi F. Tokuda M. Watanabe Y. Nitric oxide-mediated modulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To address this apparently conflicting finding, CaMKII was exposed to NO for varying periods of time (Fig. 3B). Indeed, while Ca2+/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity was unaffected by a 5 min exposure to NO, it was significantly reduced after prolonged exposure times (Fig. 3B). A similar time-dependent reduction was also observed for the NO-induced autonomous activity (Fig. 3B), indicating that the observed reduction of CaMKII activity was not mediated by interference with Ca2+/CaM-stimulation. Thus, while NO can indeed inhibit both stimulated and autonomous CaMKII activity, this opposing effect requires prolonged NO signaling, while shorter NO signals are sufficient to generate autonomous activity. For other forms of Thr-286-independent forms of CaMKII autonomy, a positive cross regulation with Thr-286-induced autonomy has been suggested (10Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Interaction with the NMDA receptor locks CaMKII in an active conformation.Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 11Erickson J.R. Joiner M.L. Guan X.

Diabetic hyperglycaemia activates CaMKII and arrhythmias by O-linked glycosylation.Nature. 2013; 502: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). By contrast, previous exposure to NO in presence of Ca2+/CaM dramatically reduced subsequent CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr-286, which was induced by addition of ATP (Fig. 4A). While both Thr-286 phosphorylation and NO generate autonomous CaMKII activity, the level of Thr-286-induced autonomy is higher: While autonomy by Thr-286 phosphorylation is ∼20% of maximally stimulated activity (8Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B.

Buard I. Kulbe J.R. Dell'Acqua M.L. Bayer K.U. CaMKII autonomy is substrate-dependent and further stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17930-17937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), autonomy by NO was only ∼10% (see Fig. 2A). Indeed, addition of NO donors prior to a Thr-286 autophosphorylation reaction reduced not only Thr-286 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), but also the resulting autonomous activity (Fig. 4B). A similar effect was caused by the oxidizer H2O2 (Fig. 4B) that generated a lower level of autonomy than NO (see Fig. 2A). CaMKII Thr-305/306 autophosphorylation inhibits subsequent Ca2+/CaM binding (31Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Inhibitory autophosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Colbran R.J. Inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II by basal autophosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7163-7170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vice versa, Ca2+/CaM binding also suppresses Thr-305/306 phosphorylation. Thus, Thr-305/306 is most efficiently autophosphorylated after dissociation of CaM from Thr-286-phosphorylated autonomous CaMKII. Additional NO exposure of previously Thr-286-phosphorylated CaMKII did not reduce the Thr-305 autophosphorylation that was induced by chelating Ca2+ to dissociate CaM (Fig. 5). Thus, the NO-mediated inhibition of CaMKII autophosphorylation was specific to Thr-286 (see Fig. 4) and did not extend to Thr-305. This finding raised the possibility that generation of autonomous CaMKII activity by NO exposure may even substitute for Thr-286 phosphorylation in enabling efficient Thr-305/306 phosphorylation. However, NO exposure did not cause any significant increase in Thr-305 autophosphorylation for CaMKII that was not previously Thr-286 phosphorylated (Fig. 5). In addition to S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, NO can induce oxidation of cysteine and methionine residues, the latter through formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−). However, four independent lines of evidence showed that the NO-induced CaMKII autonomy was indeed caused by S-nitrosylation of Cys-280/Cys-289 and not by ONOO−-mediated oxidation: The effect of NO donors was larger compared with oxidation by H2O2 (see Fig. 2A), consistent with a bulkier modification by nitrosylation causing more efficient relief from autoinhibition.NO donors indeed caused S-nitrosylation of CaMKII (Fig. 6A), as detected by the biotin-switch method (28Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. The biotin switch method for the detection of S-nitrosylated proteins.Sci STKE. 2001; 2001: pl1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This specifically included nitrosylation of Cys-280/Cys-289, as mutation of these residues clearly reduced the detected nitrosylation (Fig. 6B).The ONOO− scavengers tryptophan (Trp) or MnTMPyP (MnTP) did not r"
https://openalex.org/W1991823683,"The wall-associated kinases (WAKs) have a cytoplasmic protein kinase domain that spans the plasma membrane and binds pectin in the extracellular matrix of plants. WAKs are required for cell expansion during Arabidopsis seedling development but are also an integral part of the response to pathogens and stress that present oligogalacturonides (OGs), which subsequently bind to WAKs and activate a MPK6 (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway. It was unclear how WAKs distinguish native pectin polymers and OGs to activate one or the other of these two pathways. A dominant allele of WAK2 constitutively activates the stress response, and we show here that the effect is dependent upon EDS1 and PAD4, transcriptional activators involved in the pathogen response. Moreover, the WAK2 dominant allele is suppressed by a null allele of a pectin methyl esterase (PME3) whose activity normally leads to cross-linking of pectins in the cell wall. Although OGs activate a transcriptional response in wild type, the response is enhanced in a pme3/pme3 null, consistent with a competition by OG and native polymers for activation of WAKs. This provides a plausible mechanism for WAKs to distinguish an expansion from a stress pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2022611274,"Developmental signaling is remarkably robust to environmental variation, including temperature. For example, in ectothermic animals such as Drosophila, Notch signaling is maintained within functional limits across a wide temperature range. We combine experimental and computational approaches to show that temperature compensation of Notch signaling is achieved by an unexpected variety of endocytic-dependent routes to Notch activation which, when superimposed on ligand-induced activation, act as a robustness module. Thermal compensation arises through an altered balance of fluxes within competing trafficking routes, coupled with temperature-dependent ubiquitination of Notch. This flexible ensemble of trafficking routes supports Notch signaling at low temperature but can be switched to restrain Notch signaling at high temperature and thus compensates for the inherent temperature sensitivity of ligand-induced activation. The outcome is to extend the physiological range over which normal development can occur. Similar mechanisms may provide thermal robustness for other developmental signals."

The primary focus of this study was to examine structural and functional brain deficits in ESRD patients.Thirty ESRD patients on hemodialysis (without clinical neurological disease) and 30 age- and gender-matched control individuals (without renal or neurological problems) were recruited in a prospective, single-center study. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting state functional MRI were performed on both groups to detect the subtle cerebral deficits in ESRD patients. Voxel-based morphometry was used to characterize gray matter deficits in ESRD patients. The impact of abnormal morphometry on the cerebral functional integrity was investigated by evaluating the alterations in resting state functional connectivity when brain regions with gray matter volume reduction were used as seed areas.A significant decrease in gray matter volume was observed in ESRD patients in the bilateral medial orbito-prefrontal cortices, bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, and the left middle temporal cortex. When brain regions with gray matter volume reduction were used as seed areas, the integration was found to be significantly decreased in ESRD patients in the fronto-cerebellum circuits and within prefrontal circuits. In addition, significantly enhanced functional connectivity was found between the prefrontal cortex and the left temporal cortex and within the prefrontal circuits.Our study revealed that both the structural and functional cerebral cortices were impaired in ESRD patients on routine hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2007111091,"Protein secretion in Gram-negative bacteria is essential for both cell viability and pathogenesis. The vast majority of secreted proteins exit the cytoplasm through a transmembrane conduit called the Sec translocon in a process that is facilitated by ancillary modules, such as SecA, SecDF-YajC, YidC, and PpiD. In this study we have characterized YfgM, a protein with no annotated function. We found it to be a novel ancillary subunit of the Sec translocon as it co-purifies with both PpiD and the SecYEG translocon after immunoprecipitation and blue native/SDS-PAGE. Phenotypic analyses of strains lacking yfgM suggest that its physiological role in the cell overlaps with the periplasmic chaperones SurA and Skp. We, therefore, propose a role for YfgM in mediating the trafficking of proteins from the Sec translocon to the periplasmic chaperone network that contains SurA, Skp, DegP, PpiD, and FkpA."

Sequence alignment reveals two consensus regions, containing glutamate-rich (E/Q)XXXE plus PGXSRSXXT motifs and a histidine residue, specific to the bacterial UppP enzymes. The predicted topological model suggests that both of these regions are localized near the aqueous interface of UppP and face the periplasm, implicating that its enzymatic function is on the outer side of the plasma membrane. The mutagenesis analysis demonstrates that most of the mutations (E17A/E21A, H30A, S173A, R174A, and T178A) within the consensus regions are completely inactive, indicating that the catalytic site of UppP is constituted by these two regions. Enzymatic analysis also shows an absolute requirement of magnesium or calcium ions in enzyme activity. The three-dimensional structural model and molecular dynamics simulation studies have shown a plausible structure of the catalytic site of UppP and thus provides insights into the molecular basis of the enzyme-substrate interaction in membrane bilayers.

Fig. 1 shows a detailed pathway of the C55-P serving as a carrier lipid for the translocation of the hydrophilic oligosaccharide precursors (lipid II) across the cell membranes via a recently identified flippase (most probably by FtsW proteins) for peptidoglycan assembly in the periplasm (6Mohammadi T. van Dam V.

In Escherichia coli, four genes, uppP (formerly bacA), pgpB, ybjG, and lpxT (formerly yeiU), have been identified encoding integral membrane proteins with C55-PP phosphatase activity. UppP has been suggested to generate 75% of the total cellular C55-PP phosphatase activity, whereas the additional enzymes may account for the remaining 25% phosphatase activity (3El Ghachi M.

Genomic disruption of each one or in pairs was shown to be nonlethal in E. coli, suggesting that no single enzyme among them is essential for cell growth (3El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D.

However, inactivation of all three genes (uppP, ybjG, and pgpB) caused cell lysis due to the depletion of the pool of C55-P as well as the accumulation of peptidoglycan nucleotide used for cell wall synthesis (7El Ghachi M. Derbise A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Identification of multiple genes encoding membrane proteins with undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (UppP) activity in Escherichia coli.J. Biol.

In both ways, C55-PP must be dephosphorylated before it can be used or reused as a carrier lipid for polymer biosynthesis. It has been suggested that UppP participates in the C55-PP de novo synthesis at the cytoplasmic site, whereas the other three enzymes (PgpB, YbjG, and LpxT) participate in the C55-PP recycling pathway at the periplasmic site. Tatar et al. and Touzé et al. (4Tatar L.D. Marolda C.L. Polischuk A.N. van Leeuwen D.

On the contrary, the topological model of UppP revealed a large cytosolic loop that is conserved in bacterial UppP enzymes, suggesting that it may participate in C55-PP de novo synthesis in the cytoplasm (4Tatar L.D.

To date, however, it is still unclear on which side of the plasma membrane the dephosphorylation of C55-PP molecules occurs. Whether the dephosphorylation of C55-PP occurs on both sides of the plasma membrane or only on one side needs to be determined. Although UppP, PgpB, YbjG, and LpxT all share the C55-PP phosphatase activity, UppP has no sequence homology to the others. Sequence alignment shows that the bacterial PgpB together with YbjG and LpxT belong to the phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 superfamily, which is characterized by three conserved motifs (KX6RPX12–54PSGHX31–54SRX5HX3D) (9Touzé T.

Ishikawa et al. (15Ishikawa K. Mihara Y. Gondoh K. Suzuki E. Asano Y.

Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Substrate specificity and membrane topology of Escherichia coli PgpB, an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase.J. Biol.

Because no crystal structures of the bacterial UppP or a similar protein of this family are currently available, structure-function relationships of UppP are therefore unknown. A recent study in topology analysis of UppP showed that two consensus motifs are specific to the UppP enzymes (10Bickford J.S. Nick H.S. Conservation of the PTEN catalytic motif in the bacterial undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase, BacA/UppP.Microbiology. 2013; 159: 2444-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One is located at the putative first transmembrane helix embedded within the plasma membrane, suggesting lipid substrate binding, whereas the other one is located in a large cytosolic loop and is suggested to be a catalytic motif. Sequence alignment also revealed that the latter conserved motif could resemble a tyrosine phosphate phosphatase motif of the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog. However, its exact role in the reaction of the carrier lipid dephosphorylation, including the enzyme catalytic mechanism and structural information, is still not known. UppP is predicted to be a highly hydrophobic protein with eight transmembrane helices. Therefore, the difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of properly folded and active proteins for structural and functional studies are anticipated. We recently have successfully purified active UppP (N terminus is located in the cytoplasm) from E. coli by using a bacteriorhodopsin as a tag fused at the N terminus of the target proteins (16Hsu M.F. Yu T.F. Chou C.C. Fu H.Y. Yang C.S. Wang A.H. Using Haloarcula marismortui bacteriorhodopsin as a fusion tag for enhancing and visible expression of integral membrane proteins in Escherichia coli.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e56363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This opens new opportunities to investigate the specific amino acids critical to enzymatic catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis. In this study, we predict a two-dimensional structure of UppP, showing that both of the consensus regions, containing (E/Q)XXXE plus PGXSRSXXT motifs and a histidine residue, are localized near the aqueous interface of UppP and oriented toward the periplasmic site, implicating that its biological function is on the outer side of the plasma membrane. We also propose a three-dimensional model for UppP constructed by the Rosetta membrane ab initio modeling program (17Barth P. Schonbrun J. Baker D. Toward high-resolution prediction and design of transmembrane helical protein structures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15682-15687Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The model was validated by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis as well as the site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids putatively involved in enzyme catalysis. Our study demonstrates that both mutations (E17A and E21A) of the residues Glu-17 and Glu-21 within the (E/Q)XXXE motif, interacting with the pyrophosphate moiety of Upp through a magnesium ion in the model, result in a decrease of kcat values of ∼5 fold, and the Km value of E17A for Fpp increases ∼4–5-fold compared with the wild type. The double mutation E17A/E21A completely eliminates enzyme activity. In the PGXSRSXXT motif, a putative structural P-loop, Arg-174, also establishes a hydrogen bond with the OH group of the pyrophosphate moiety in the model. The R174A mutant is completely inactive. The conserved His-30 residue is spatially in close proximity to the pyrophosphate moiety in the model. The H30A mutant also results in a severely impaired enzyme activity. Our data demonstrate that the active site of UppP is composed of these two consensus regions. This study provides a first insight into structure-function relationships of UppP in E. coli and probably in other bacterial species. Mutants were constructed using KOD Hot Start Master Mix obtained from Novagen. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at Genomics (Taiwan). Sequence verification of the mutagenesis products was performed at Mission Biotech (Taiwan). Expression and purification of the E. coli UppP were performed as described previously (16Hsu M.F. Yu T.F. Chou C.C. Fu H.Y. Yang C.S. Wang A.H. Using Haloarcula marismortui bacteriorhodopsin as a fusion tag for enhancing and visible expression of integral membrane proteins in Escherichia coli.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e56363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression vector harboring the Hmbop1/D94N-uppP gene was transformed into E. coli C41 (DE3), which was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. When the A600 reached about 0.9, the final concentrations of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and 5–10 mm all-trans-retinal (Sigma) were added for 5 h of induction at 37 °C. For purification of UppP, the cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl). The cells were disrupted by Constant Cell Disruption Systems (Constant Systems Ltd.), and the membrane was collected by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1.5 h. The pellet was solubilized in buffer A with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside at 4 °C for 2.5 h. The latter solution was centrifuged again (20,000 rpm for 0.5 h at 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and washed with buffer A containing 75 mm imidazole and 0.05% DDM. Tobacco etch virus protease was then added for digestion during the buffer dialysis at 4 °C overnight. Finally, the protein solution was loaded onto Ni-NTA column, and the native UppP was eluted by washing with buffer A containing 0.02% DDM. For enzyme long term storage, aliquots of protein were dropped directly in liquid nitrogen and stocked in a −80 °C freezer. The mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed at the Core Facility for Protein Structural Analysis in Academia Sinica (Taiwan). The dried gel pieces containing purified UppP proteins were prepared for trypsin digestion, and then the peptide mixtures were purified and desalted for mass analysis. MS analysis was performed on an ABI 4700 TOF-TOF Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Data were searched using GPS Explorer (Version 3.6) with the search engine MASCOT. The UppP activity was measured as described previously (16Hsu M.F. Yu T.F. Chou C.C. Fu H.Y. Yang C.S. Wang A.H. Using Haloarcula marismortui bacteriorhodopsin as a fusion tag for enhancing and visible expression of integral membrane proteins in Escherichia coli.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e56363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Basically, the phosphatase activity was determined by using a phosphate colorimetric assay kit (BioVision). The enzymatic assay reaction mixture (200 μl) contains 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% DDM, 35 mm Fpp (Sigma), and 20 nm purified UppP. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C and then quenched by adding 30 μl of Malachite Green reagent. The released phosphate was measured at 650 nm and quantified based on the phosphate standard curve. The effect of pH on UppP activity was assayed at various pH values, pH 5–6 (sodium acetate), pH 6.5–8 (Hepes), and pH 9 (Tris-HCl). For determination of Fpp kinetic parameters of wild-type and UppP mutants, 0.3–57 μm Fpp were used along with 20–40 nm UppP. All reactions were carried out in 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% DDM at 37 °C. The initial velocity data were fitted to Michaelis-Menten equation using the KaleidaGraph computer program (Synergy software) to obtain Km and kcat values. The measurement of the inhibition constant for bacitracin was performed in a reaction mixture containing 20 nm UppP and 35 μm Fpp in the buffer of 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% DDM in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C and quenched by adding 30 μl of Malachite Green reagent as described previously. The initial rate was obtained from different concentrations (0–100 μm) of the bacitracin, and the Ki value was determined by fitting Equations 1 and 2(18Segel I.H. Seqel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 100-118Google Scholar) and calculated by nonlinear regression using the KaleidaGraph computer program (19Laskovics F.M. Poulter C.D.

A(l)=A(0)×{1-(l/(l+Ki(1+S/KM)))}(Eq. 1) IC50=Ki(1+S/KM)(Eq. 2) In these equations, A(I) is the enzyme activity with the inhibitor concentration I; A(0) is enzyme activity without inhibitor; I is the inhibitor concentration; Ki is the inhibition constant of the inhibitor; S is Fpp concentration, and Km is Michaelis constant of Fpp. Multiple sequence alignment of several UppPs was first aligned by CLC sequence viewer software, a bioinformatic tool for multiple sequence alignment and editing. The transmembrane helical regions of UppP were then estimated through the comparison of the secondary structure and membrane protein topology predictions, which were done by Phyre2 (20Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar) and Topcons (21Bernsel A. Viklund H. Hennerdal A. Elofsson A. TOPCONS: consensus prediction of membrane protein topology.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W465-W468Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) servers, respectively. Certain known information based on the experiments, such as both the N and C termini of UppP localized in the cytoplasm and the active site comprising regions I and II, were also required in this assignment. These studies are important and provide critical information for model generation (Rosetta membrane ab initio modeling prediction). The atomic three-dimensional model of E. coli UppP was generated by the Rosetta membrane ab initio modeling procedure (17Barth P. Schonbrun J. Baker D. Toward high-resolution prediction and design of transmembrane helical protein structures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15682-15687Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The lipophilicity of each residue in the defined transmembrane regions of E. coli UppP was first calculated. Two-fragment (3 and 9 amino acids) databases generated by the Rosetta Fragment Libraries server were then utilized to generate the atomic models. One thousand models were generated with the default parameters. The three-dimensional lookup table was used for residue neighbor calculations. No nonhelical secondary structure fragments were in the predicted transmembrane regions in the hydrophobic layer of the membrane. To reduce the calculation time, the total number of Monte Carlo-based membrane normal cycles was set to 40. The magnitude of membrane normal angle search step size was 15°, and the center search step size was 2 Å and sorted according to the Rosetta scoring function. Eighteen candidates were filtered on the basis of the criteria that the Cα positions of three residues Glu-21, His-30, and Arg-174 were in a 10 Å diameter (an average distance of H-bond and the side chain of arginine) of sphere. All the model candidates were checked manually, and only the models composed of an active site pocket were considered. Finally, the best model was chosen and optimized by PyMol software, XtalView (22McRee D.E. XtalView/Xfit-A versatile program for manipulating atomic coordinates and electron density.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar), and RefMac (23Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B. Leslie A.G.

Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9200) Google Scholar). The optimal model of Upp molecule was also applied to the PPM server to validate the position of E. coli UppP in the lipid bilayers. The three-dimensional structure of Upp substrate was prepared and optimized by the MarvinSketch software for the UppP and Upp complex modeling. The conformation of Upp was carefully adjusted and fitted into the predicted active site along with a Mg2+ ion that was coordinated with the pyrophosphate group and two glutamates in the conserved (E/Q)XXXE motif. The rest part of the 55-carbon chain was docked into the hydrophobic surface composed of TM2, TM3, TM4, and TM5. To evaluate the stability of E. coli UppP model in the membrane, the MD simulation was performed using NAMD version 2.9 (24Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13144) Google Scholar). The pre-oriented E. coli UppP model calculated by the PPM server was loaded into the membrane builder module of CHARMM-GUI server (25Jo S. Lim J.B. Klauda J.B. Im W. CHARMM-GUI membrane builder for mixed bilayers and its application to yeast membranes.Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The cross-sectional area profile was calculated to assist the alignment of protein and lipid bilayer. The rectangular box was selected, and 1.5 lipid layers between neighboring proteins was set (1.5 lipid layers mean, at least, three lipid molecules will be placed between two proteins in the system). A homogeneous lipid bilayer was built with palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, and the water thickness was 15 Å on the top and bottom of the protein. The E. coli UppP model was then inserted into the pre-equilibrated lipid bilayer with a hole whose size is comparable with the protein size. Finally, the assembled system contained 42,738 atoms (1 protein, 112 palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholines, 7,826 waters, and 2 Cl− ions). Six steps of system equilibration were performed to ensure gradual equilibration of the initially assembled system. Various restraints were applied to the protein, water, ions, and lipid molecules, and the forces were reduced slowly as the equilibration progresses. The NVT (constant volume and temperature) was used for the first two steps, and the NPAT (constant pressure, area, and temperature) was used for the following four steps at 303.15 K. The first five steps were done on CHARMM-GUI server. Step 6 of system equilibration and the 30 ns of production runs were done on the ALPS1 computing facility of National Center for High Performance Computing, Hsinchu, Taiwan. The output trajectory files were analyzed using VMD (26Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: Visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38391) Google Scholar) to obtain the values of root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) and root mean square fluctuation (r.m.s.f.). The sausage representation of r.m.s.f. distribution was performed by PyMOL software. The amino acid sequence alignment of UppP enzymes from 12 bacteria is presented in Fig. 2. This alignment reveals two highly conserved regions, region I (residues 17–30) and region II (residues 170–178). Region I contains three highly conserved charged amino acids, including two negatively charged residues Glu-17 and Glu-21, one histidine (His-30), and two conserved polar residues Ser-26 and Ser-27. In this region, a glutamate-rich (E/Q)XXXE motif (residues 17–21) constructed by two highly conserved residues, Glu-17 and Glu-21, is found. This motif could be functionally similar to the aspartate-rich DDXXD motif that has been shown to be essential for the catalytic function and substrate binding of metal ion-complexed pyrophosphate ester by x-ray structural and site-directed mutagenesis studies (27Joly A.

https://openalex.org/W2003295134,"DNA methylation and histone acetylation inhibitors are widely used to study the role of epigenetic marks in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, several of these molecules are being tested in clinical trials or already in use in the clinic. Antimetabolites, such as the DNA-hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC), have been shown to lower malignant progression to acute myeloid leukemia and to prolong survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Here we examined the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors on the expression of lipid biosynthetic and uptake genes. Our data demonstrate that, independently of DNA methylation, 5-AzaC selectively and very potently reduces expression of key genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (e.g. PCSK9, HMGCR, and FASN) in all tested cell lines and in vivo in mouse liver. Treatment with 5-AzaC disturbed subcellular cholesterol homeostasis, thereby impeding activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (key regulators of lipid metabolism). Through inhibition of UMP synthase, 5-AzaC also strongly induced expression of 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 9 (AGPAT9) and promoted triacylglycerol synthesis and cytosolic lipid droplet formation. Remarkably, complete reversal was obtained by the co-addition of either UMP or cytidine. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis by 5-AzaC disturbs cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, probably through the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway, which may contribute mechanistically to its beneficial cytostatic properties.

Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, finely alter chromatin structure to precisely control gene expression in a time-, cell-, and tissue-specific manner (1Jaenisch R. Bird A. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression: how the genome integrates intrinsic and environmental signals.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar). DNA cytosine methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases forming 5-methylcytosine at specific CpG dinucleotides, is responsible for the establishment of silent chromatin regions (2Gnyszka A. Jastrzebski Z. Flis S. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and their emerging role in epigenetic therapy of cancer.Anticancer Res. 2013; 33: 2989-2996PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases, such as the unmethylable cytosine analogs 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC) 4The abbreviations used are:5-AzaC5-azacytidineDAC5-aza-2′-deoxycytidineMDSmyelodysplastic syndromesSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinERendoplasmic reticulumCHXcycloheximideLPDSlipoprotein-deficient serumTBPTATA box-binding proteinSREsterol response elementPAphosphatidic acidCDSPA-CTP cytidylyltransferaseTGtriacylglycerolLDlipid dropletSCAPSREBP cleavage-activating proteinS1P and S2Psite 1 and site 2 protease, respectivelyQPCRquantitative PCR. and 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC), generate hypomethylated DNA, allowing re-expression of silenced hypermethylated genes (2Gnyszka A. Jastrzebski Z. Flis S. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and their emerging role in epigenetic therapy of cancer.Anticancer Res. 2013; 33: 2989-2996PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, based on the premise that they induce re-expression of tumor suppressor genes and because they lower malignant progression to acute myeloid leukemia and increase survival, both 5-AzaC and DAC are used as standards of care for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (3Estey E.H.

Comparative studies have revealed major mechanistic disparities between DAC and 5-AzaC. Although DAC is the most effective hypomethylating agent, 5-AzaC is more potent to reduce cell viability and proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (4Hollenbach P.W. Nguyen A.N. Brady H. Williams M. Ning Y. Richard N. Krushel L. Aukerman S.L. Heise C. MacBeth K.J.

Global DNA microarray analyses demonstrated that the effect of each drug on the cellular transcriptome was very distinct, with largely non-overlapping gene expression profiles. In order to be incorporated into DNA, 5-AzaC has to be converted to DAC by ribonucleotide reductase, which is an inefficient process (∼10–20%) (2Gnyszka A. Jastrzebski Z. Flis S. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and their emerging role in epigenetic therapy of cancer.Anticancer Res. 2013; 33: 2989-2996PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, 5-AzaC can also be incorporated into different RNA subspecies and may affect nucleic acid and protein metabolism (6Cihák A. Biological effects of 5-azacytidine in eukaryotes.Oncology. 1974; 30: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, 5-AzaC antineoplastic effects on abnormal hematopoietic cells may rely on methylation-independent mechanisms, which remain to be determined (4Hollenbach P.W. Nguyen A.N. Brady H. Williams M.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of transcription factors that coordinates homeostatic gene expression of proteins and enzymes required for uptake and biosynthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and phospholipids (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cholesterol feedback: from Schoenheimer's bottle to Scap's MELADL.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S15-S27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The proteolytic release of the N-terminal transcriptionally active fragment of SREBPs from their membrane-bound precursor is finely regulated by cholesterol through a negative feedback loop mediated by sterol-sensing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins. Impairment of this mechanism can result in imbalance of cellular cholesterol and lipid content and is associated with severe clinical complications, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer (10Moon Y.A.

Indeed, mounting evidence indicates that gene promoter DNA methylation levels may be associated with lipid metabolism gene expression (15Ehara T. Kamei Y. Takahashi M. Yuan X. Kanai S. Tamura E.

In the present study, we explored the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors 5-AzaC and DAC on cholesterogenic and lipid gene expression and defined a previously unrecognized mechanism regulating the activation of SREBPs. Treatment of various cell lines or injection of mice with 5-AzaC strongly and selectively reduced expression of SREBP target genes independently of DNA methylation. Our data show that 5-AzaC, unlike DAC, promotes triglyceride synthesis and accumulation of lipid droplets and impedes SREBPs activation. In sterol-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells, the activation of SREBP-2 was insensitive to 5-AzaC, indicating that this antimetabolite alters the ER cholesterol content. Co-incubation with UMP or cytidine completely reversed the effects of 5-AzaC, demonstrating that inhibition of UMP synthase and CTP depletion is the underlying mechanism. Taken together, these data highlight a major DNA methylation-independent effect of 5-AzaC and the existing link between the de novo pyrimidine and glycerolipid biosynthesis pathways and SREBP signaling.

Three cross-link sites were identified using LC-MS/MS and electrospray ionization-MS/MS as follows: 1) a sulfhydryl cross-link between C3.53(134) in TMH3 and the Gαi C-terminal i-3 residue Cys-351; 2) a lysine cross-link between K6.35(245) in TMH6 and the Gαi C-terminal i-5 residue, Lys-349; and 3) a lysine cross-link between K5.64(215) in TMH5 and the Gαi α4β6 loop residue, Lys-317. To investigate the dynamics and nature of the conformational changes involved in CB2·Gi complex formation, we carried out microsecond-time scale molecular dynamics simulations of the CB2 R*·Gαi1β1γ2 complex embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer, using cross-linking information as validation. Our results show that although molecular dynamics simulations started with the G protein orientation in the β2-AR*·Gαsβ1γ2 complex crystal structure, the Gαi1β1γ2 protein reoriented itself within 300 ns. Two major changes occurred as follows. 1) The Gαi1 α5 helix tilt changed due to the outward movement of TMH5 in CB2 R*. 2) A 25° clockwise rotation of Gαi1β1γ2 underneath CB2 R* occurred, with rotation ceasing when Pro-139 (IC-2 loop) anchors in a hydrophobic pocket on Gαi1 (Val-34, Leu-194, Phe-196, Phe-336, Thr-340, Ile-343, and Ile-344). In this complex, all three experimentally identified cross-links can occur. These findings should be relevant for other class A G protein-coupled receptors that couple to Gi proteins.

Anatomical profiling of G protein-coupled receptor expression.Cell. 2008; 135: 561-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Class A GPCRs are thought to have a common topology that includes an extracellular N terminus, a transmembrane core formed by a bundle of seven transmembrane α-helices (TMH1–7), three extracellular (EC) and three intracellular (IC) loops that connect these helices, and an intracellular C terminus that begins with a short amphipathic helix lying parallel to the membrane (3Hanson M.A. Roth C.B.

Structural basis for molecular recognition at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Physiologically, GPCRs are activated by ligands (extracellular and membrane-based) that enable the receptors to interact with and activate distinct sets of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ), as well as β-arrestins (7Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Transduction of receptor signals by β-arrestins.Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar, 8Weis W.I. Kobilka B.K. Structural insights into G-protein-coupled receptor activation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Specifically, ligand-activated GPCRs catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit. GTP binding to Gα is predicted to trigger the dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein into Gα-GTP and free βγ, which are then able to modulate the activity of a multitude of downstream effectors, including adenylate cyclase and ion channels, such as G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK2 and GIRK4), phospholipase Cβ, and plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps (9Clapham D.E.

We have previously performed microseconds long MD simulations of the CB2 endogenous ligand, sn-2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), entering and activating CB2 via the lipid bilayer (17Hurst D.P.

Activation of CB2 has been shown experimentally to produce coupling to Gαi inhibitory protein (18Demuth D.G. Molleman A.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although a significant amount of information is available for GPCR-catalyzed activation of G proteins (21Preininger A.M. Meiler J. Hamm H.E. Conformational flexibility and structural dynamics in GPCR-mediated G protein activation: a perspective.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), many atomic level details concerning complex formation and signal transduction remain unanswered. In this work, we studied the formation of a CB2R*·G protein complex both experimentally and computationally. Systematic cross-linking experiments were performed using HgCl2 and a short bi-functional, irreversible chemical cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). These studies yielded three specific contact sites between CB2 and Gαi1 protein, providing new insights into the molecular architecture of the CB2 and Gαi1 interaction. Then, to place these cross-links in a structural perspective and also to explore the dynamic formation of the CB2R*·Gαi1β1γ2 complex, we undertook two independent microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of the CB2R*·Gαi1β1γ2 complex in a POPC bilayer. These studies revealed a stepwise formation of the complex that brings all cross-linked pairs into spatial proximity. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Expression plasmids containing the N-terminal FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK)-tagged human CB2 cannabinoid receptors were stably transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine, according to manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing 800 μg/ml geneticin. Having established cell lines stably expressing FLAG-CB2 receptors, the cells were maintained in growth medium containing 400 μg/ml geneticin until needed for experiments. The CB2 receptor has been shown to exhibit high constitutive activity (19Bouaboula M. Desnoyer N. Carayon P. Combes T. Casellas P. Gi protein modulation induced by a selective inverse agonist for the peripheral cannabinoid receptor CB2: implication for intracellular signalization cross-regulation.Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 473-480PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, cross-linking experiments were conducted in the absence of exogenous agonist. For each cross-linker, the cross-linking reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells expressing FLAG-CB2 receptors were collected, and cell membranes were prepared as described previously (22Zhang R. Kim T.K. Qiao Z.H. Cai J. Pierce Jr., W.M. Song Z.H. Biochemical and mass spectrometric characterization of the human CB2 cannabinoid receptor expressed in Pichia pastoris–importance of correct processing of the N terminus.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 55: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in 20 mm HEPES buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. After adding cross-linkers at a final concentration of 2 mm, the cell membranes were incubated on ice for 2 h. At the end of incubation, the cross-linking reactions were terminated by adding quench solutions. Subsequently, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the membrane suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h by end-to-end gentle rotations. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove unsolubilized particles. For anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography, the solubilized suspension was incubated with 0.5 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rocking. After extensive washing with 20 mm HEPES containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100, the bound CB2 was eluted with 8-column volumes of 0.1 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.5, containing 1% Triton X-100. The purified CB2 complex was resolved by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to Western blot and Coomassie Blue staining. Both anti-CB2 antibody and anti-G protein antibody were used to identify the band corresponding to the CB2·G protein complex. The CB2·G protein complex band was then excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gel and subjected to enzymatic digestions according to a published protocol (22Zhang R. Kim T.K. Qiao Z.H. Cai J. Pierce Jr., W.M. Song Z.H.

Briefly, the bands were cut into small pieces, destained with 50 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v), and digested with 10 ng/μl pepsin overnight. Peptides from the enzymatic digests were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS as described previously (22Zhang R. Kim T.K. Qiao Z.H. Cai J. Pierce Jr., W.M. Song Z.H. Biochemical and mass spectrometric characterization of the human CB2 cannabinoid receptor expressed in Pichia pastoris–importance of correct processing of the N terminus.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 55: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides from the enzymatic digests were condensed to 1–2 μl with a Speedvac, diluted with 5 μl of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and analyzed by a Waters CapLC coupled to a Q-TOF API-US mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). The samples (5 μl) were injected onto a 300-μm × 5-mm PepMap C18 precolumn (LC Packing, Sunnyvale, CA), washed with 5% ACN in 0.1% formic acid at 30 μl/min for 3 min, eluted onto and separated with a 75-μm × 150-mm Atlantis dC18 analytical column (Waters). Separation was started with a 5-min isocratic elution with 95% solvent A (5% ACN with 0.1% formic acid) and 5% solvent B (95% ACN with 0.1% formic acid) and followed by a linear gradient from 5% solvent B to 40% solvent B over 115 min and then from 40% solvent B to 60% solvent B in 30 min. The flow rate on the column was about 200 nl/min. The eluted peptides were directed to a Q-TOF API-US mass spectrometer with a nanoflow source, and MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired by data-dependent scan. Data analyses were performed with the aid of on-line server MS3D (24Yu E.T. Hawkins A. Kuntz I.D. Rahn L.A. Rothfuss A. Sale K. Young M.M. Yang C.L. Pancerella C.M. Fabris D.

First, the precursor peptide ions from LC-MS/MS were screened by the “Links” program from MS3D. Links calculates the theoretical cross-linking possibilities for the CB2·G protein complex, with information provided about the cross-linkers and protease used and the expected amino acid modifications. The Links program then gives us putative assignments within a defined mass error threshold for a list of input mass (MH+) values. Once the candidates of CB2-G protein cross-linked peptides were obtained, each candidate peptide was further analyzed by the “MS2Links” program from MS3D. MS2Links is a program for assigning tandem MS peak lists generated from the fragmentation of cross-linked, modified, or unmodified peptides. MS2Links calculate the theoretical MS/MS fragment library given information about the identity of the base ion, cross-linkers, desired ion types, and amino acid modifications. MS2Links then returns assignments within a defined mass error threshold for the list of input mass (MH+) values. The CB2 model employed here was taken from our previous microsecond-long simulation of the activation of the CB2 receptor by the endogenous ligand, 2-AG, via the lipid bilayer (17Hurst D.P.

In this simulation, the ionic lock at the IC ends of TMH3-TMH6 (R3.55–D6.30) was broken within 3 ns of a 2-AG headgroup entry between TMH6 and TMH7 from the lipid bilayer (POPC). To represent the CB2-activated state, we chose coordinates corresponding to time point 184.138 ns from trajectory E in which the salt bridge between TMH3 and TMH6 is broken (17Hurst D.P.

The α-carbon distance between R3.55(136) and D6.30(240) was 15.2 Å, and the heteroatom distance N (R3.55(136))-O (D6.30(240)) was 12.7 Å (17Hurst D.P. Grossfield A. Lynch D.L. Feller S. Romo T.D.

In this bundle, the C terminus contains the palmitoylation site at Cys-320 and was truncated after Gly-322. For this study, the crystal structure of Gαi1β1γ2 (26Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E.

The extreme Gαi1 C terminus is unresolved in this structure, so the undecapeptide NMR structure (27Kisselev O.G. Kao J. Ponder J.W. Fann Y.C. Gautam N. Marshall G.R.

Palmitic acid was attached to the N terminus of Gαi1 at Cys-3 (29Parenti M. Viganó M.A. Newman C.M. Milligan G. Magee A.I. A novel N-terminal motif for palmitoylation of G-protein α subunits.Biochem.

The relative orientations of CB2 R* and Gαi1β1γ2 were based on the β2-AR·Gαsβ1γ2 complex crystal structure (32Rasmussen S.G. DeVree B.T. Zou Y. Kruse A.C. Chung K.Y. Kobilka T.S. Thian F.S. Chae P.S.

Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). To get a relative receptor position, first the activated CB2 receptor was superimposed onto the α carbon atoms of the residues N1.50, D2.50, R3.50, and W4.50 on the β2-AR receptor from the β2-AR·Gαsβ1γ2 complex. To obtain the relative orientation of Gαi1β1γ2 heterotrimer with the CB2 receptor, Gβ1 of Gαi1β1γ2 was superimposed on the α carbon atoms of residues from 51 to 340 of Gβ1 in the Gαsβ1γ2 protein from the β2-AR·Gαsβ1γ2 complex. To relieve steric clashes between CB2 and Gαi1, the whole Gαi1β1γ2 heterotrimer was translated in the z-direction. The CB2 R*·G protein complex was aligned such that the transmembrane region of the CB2 receptor was centered at the middle of the POPC lipid bilayer and the amphipathic helix 8 was oriented parallel to the plane of the membrane at approximately the lipid/water interface. The model membrane simulation cell was constructed with the replacement method, using scripts derived from CHARMM-GUI (33Jo S. Kim T. Iyer V.G. Im W.

The parameters for the palmitoylation sites were taken from our earlier simulations (17Hurst D.P. Grossfield A. Lynch D.L. Feller S. Romo T.D. Gawrisch K. Pitman M.C. Reggio P.H.

Parameters for the myristoylation of Gαi and prenylation of the Gγ2 covalent linkages were taken by analogy with existing CHARMM force field parameters. Given that the primary role for these lipidation sites in these simulations is to anchor their respective proteins to the lipid matrix, no further optimization was performed. All lipidation parameters and patches used to generate the topologies are available upon request. Charge neutrality was enforced with addition of chloride counter ions, and an overall ionic strength of 0.1 m was obtained by adding NaCl. The final system contained 451 POPC lipid molecules, the protein complex, ions, and solvating water molecules with a simulation cell size of 130.0 × 130.0 × 170.6 Å. To relieve poor initial contacts, 500 steps of steepest descent minimization were performed using CHARMM (38Brooks B.R. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Nilsson L. Petrella R.J. Roux B. Won Y.

The fully minimized system was heated in 10 K increments to 310 K with restraints on the protein (force constant of 10 kcal/mol/Å2/5.0 kcal/mol/Å2 for the backbone/side chains and ligands respectively), on the POPC phosphates (force constant of 5.0 kcal/mol/Å2), and a harmonic dihedral restraint on the POPC cis double bond and the glycerol c2 chiral center (force constant of 500 kcal/mol/rad2). At each increment, 500 steps of minimization were performed followed by 20 ps of dynamics at the higher temperature. Equilibration was continued for 100 ps of molecular dynamics, and then the restraints were released in six steps over 1.5ns. For all production runs, NAMD (39Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J.

https://openalex.org/W1971168001,"CCR5 binds the chemokines CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 and is the major coreceptor for HIV-1 entry into target cells. Chemokines are supposed to form a natural barrier against human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, we showed that their antiviral activity is limited by CCR5 adopting low-chemokine affinity conformations at the cell surface. Here, we investigated whether a pool of CCR5 that is not stabilized by chemokines could represent a target for inhibiting HIV infection. We exploited the characteristics of the chemokine analog PSC-RANTES (N-α-(n-nonanoyl)-des-Ser(1)-[l-thioprolyl(2), l-cyclohexylglycyl(3)]-RANTES(4-68)), which displays potent anti-HIV-1 activity. We show that native chemokines fail to prevent high-affinity binding of PSC-RANTES, analog-mediated calcium release (in desensitization assays), and analog-mediated CCR5 internalization. These results indicate that a pool of spare CCR5 may bind PSC-RANTES but not native chemokines. Improved recognition of CCR5 by PSC-RANTES may explain why the analog promotes higher amounts of β-arrestin 2·CCR5 complexes, thereby increasing CCR5 down-regulation and HIV-1 inhibition. Together, these results highlight that spare CCR5, which might permit HIV-1 to escape from chemokines, should be targeted for efficient viral blockade."
https://openalex.org/W1999059826,"The Saccharomyces genus is the main yeast involved in wine fermentations to play a crucial role in the production and release of aromatic compounds. Despite the several studies done into the genome-wide expression analysis using DNA microarray technology in wine S. cerevisiae strains, this is the first to investigate other species of the Saccharomyces genus. This research work investigates the expression of the genes involved in flavor compound production in three different Saccharomyces species (S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus var. uvarum and S. kudriavzevii) under low (12°C) and moderate fermentation temperatures (28°C). The global genes analysis showed that 30% of genes appeared to be differently expressed in the three cryophilic strains if compared to the reference strain (mesophilic S. cerevisiae), suggesting a very close cold adaptation response. Remarkable differences in the gene expression level were observed when comparing the three species, S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus var. uvarum and S. kudriavzevii, which will result in different aroma profiles. Knowledge of these differences in the transcriptome can be a tool to help modulate aroma to create wines with the desired aromatic traits."

In canine cardiac myoblasts, treatment with high insulin (10−8 to 10−7 m) for 0–24 h increased insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 phosphorylation at Ser-307, decreased protein levels of chaperone-associated ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligase C terminus of heat shock protein 70-interacting protein (CHIP), increased SRF activity, as well as β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myocardin expressions.

In patients with insulin resistance, insulin and TNF-α may synergize in both pro-inflammatory and cardiac hypertrophy signaling. A number of clinical studies have indeed indicated a link between NF-κB activation, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiovascular disease (22Zelarayan L. Renger A. Noack C. Zafiriou M.P.

Despite this body of evidence, the mechanisms and targets by which insulin signals inflammation and hypertrophy remain poorly understood. Aims of this study were therefore to elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy in insulin resistance, to test whether high insulin levels affect TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, and to examine the relationship between myocardin, SRF, and NF-κB in the regulation of the hypertrophy signaling in cardiac myoblasts. TNF-α, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and MTG132 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Akt/phosphatidyl inositol (PI3)-kinase inhibitor LY294002 was from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. The study population comprised wild-type C57BL/6 (body weight: 22 ± 4 g, n = 3 male and n = 3 female), and Leprdb (db/db) mice on a C57BL/6 background (homozygotes for a mutation in the leptin receptor gene leading to the loss of a functional leptin receptor) (25Chen C.Y.

Obese and diabetes: two mutant genes causing diabetes-obesity syndromes in mice.Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The latter, despite being more severely insulin resistant are less hyperglycemic compared with db/db mice on a C57BL/6J background (27Coleman D.L.

Erythropoietin protects myocardin-expressing cardiac stem cells against cytotoxicity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Iscove's medium supplemented with 15% embryonic stem cell-qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. At subconfluence, passage 3 CMs were serum-starved for 12 h before being further incubated with insulin (10−8 to 10−7 mol/liter) for up to 24 h with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or LY294002 (50 μmol/liter). Cell viability after treatments was assessed by evaluating several parameters, including cell morphology and size at phase-contrast microscopy, Trypan Blue exclusion, determination of total proteins. Transfections were performed on subconfluent canine cardiac myoblasts by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 days. Neomycin-resistant clones were used for further experiments. pcDNA3.1 myc-His expression plasmid (Invitrogen, Catalogue number V855-20) encoding cDNA for human CHIP (GenBankTM accession number NM_005861.2) and pcDNA3.1 myc-His empty vector were a gift from Cam Patterson (among the co-authors of this study) (data not shown). The construct was confirmed by HindIII and XbaI restriction enzyme digest analysis (data not shown). Western analysis was used to analyze protein expression of CHIP in canine cardiac myoblasts by means of anti-CHIP antibody and anti-His6 antibody (Invitrogen). A pool of three different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) oligonucleotides against CHIP or myocardin or NF-κB, or scrambled negative control siRNAs, were obtained from Ambion. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates in low-serum medium without antibiotics (OptiMem, Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with 6 μl of siRNA transfection reagent containing 15 nmol/liter of one of the following: a mixture of 3 different siRNAs against CHIP, or against myocardin, or against NF-κB or scrambled siRNA (negative control). Transfection medium was added up to a total volume of 800 μl. After 24 h, fresh medium was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 16 h. At the end of incubations, total RNA was harvested for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or protein extracted for Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), as described below. Total RNA was isolated by using a Qiagen RNA isolation kit and used directly for qRT-PCR with the SuperScript™ III Platinum® SYBR® Green One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers for qRT-PCR were designed by using the OligoPerfectTM Designer software (Invitrogen). All qRT-PCR reactions were performed in triplicate by using a MyiQTM single-color RT-PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). A melting curve was generated at the end of every run to ensure product uniformity. Relative expression values were obtained by normalizing CT values of the tested genes in comparison with CT values of the RNA 18 S using the ΔΔCT method. Total or nuclear proteins were extracted as described (29Madonna R. Di Napoli P. Massaro M. Grilli A. Felaco M. De Caterina A. Tang D. De Caterina R. Geng Y.J.

Proteins were separated under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: total or phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), myocardin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), MEF2c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CHIP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), lamin-B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-MHC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Akt1 isoform and total pAkt (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and β-actin (Sigma). Blots were developed by using a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Pierce). The intensity of each immunoreactive protein band was measured by densitometry. For immunoprecipitation, the nuclear lysates were mixed with a primary antibody against myocardin (R&D), and immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein-G beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were then eluted, concentrated, and subjected to immunoblotting. For in vitro ubiquitination reactions, immunoprecipitates were incubated in 50 μl of control buffer (phosphate-buffered saline) or Ub reaction buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 μg/ml creatine kinase), 30 nm of E1 enzyme (purchased from Boston Biochem), 0.5 μm of E2 enzyme (Boston Biochem), and 10 μm ubiquitin (Boston Biochem). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Cells grown in eight-well glass chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Pieve D'Alpago, Italy) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were incubated in this solution with a primary antibody against α-sarcomeric actinin (Sigma Aldrich) or β-MHC for 1 h at 4 °C. After being incubated and washed in PBS, the slides were incubated with a Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Non-immune IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the isotype control. Slides were washed and mounted with a solution containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (VectaShield; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and viewed through a fluorescence microscope. The cell surface area of α-sarcomeric actinin-stained cells or unstained cells was measured with the computer-assisted planimetry (N.I.H. Image J) software. The size of adherent cells was assessed by examining 8 different high-power fields (0.09 mm2/field), randomly located at half-radius distance from the center of the monolayers. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (29Madonna R. Di Napoli P. Massaro M. Grilli A. Felaco M. De Caterina A. Tang D. De Caterina R. Geng Y.J.

Double-stranded serum response element (SRE) consensus oligonucleotides (5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′), SRE mutant oligonucleotides (5′-GGATGTCCATATTATTACATCT-3′) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and NF-κB oligonucleotides (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ and 5′-CCT GGG AAA GTC CCC TCA ACT-3′) (Promega) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions containing 10 μg of crude nuclear extract were performed by using an EMSA core system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For supershift assays, goat monoclonal anti-myocardin or anti-p65 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Two-group comparisons were performed with the Student's t test for unpaired values. Multiple-group comparisons were performed with the analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Although insulin is known to be able to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (2Li H. Watford W. Li C. Parmelee A. Bryant M.A. Deng C. O'Shea J. Lee S.B.

Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H787-H796Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and although myocardin is known to be able to mediate hypertrophy signals (31Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Myocardin induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whether myocardin conveys the hypertrophic signal of insulin is unknown. We therefore explored whether myocardin is necessary for insulin to induce hypertrophy, and analyzed myocardin levels in response to insulin treatment. Treatment of cells with pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of insulin (10−8–10−7 mol/liter) increased myocardin levels and activated insulin signaling, as shown by increased levels of phosphorylated IRS-1 (Fig. 1, panel A). The Akt-mediated insulin signaling inhibitor LY-294002 attenuated myocardin levels upon insulin treatment. Because MEF2c, a key regulator of early cardiomyogenesis, is known to regulate transcriptional expression of myocardin through its enhancer (32Creemers E.E. Sutherland L.B. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Myocardin is a direct transcriptional target of Mef2, Tead and Foxo proteins during cardiovascular development.Development. 2006; 133: 4245-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we also analyzed MEF2c levels in response to insulin treatment. Treatment of cells with insulin (10−8–10−7 mol/liter) led to an increase in MEF2c levels (Fig. 1, panels A and B), which was attenuated by LY-294002 (Fig. 1, panels A and B). These data suggest that insulin induces myocardin and its activator MEF2c in canine cardiac myoblasts. To determine if myocardin plays a functional role in insulin-induced hypertrophy, we tested whether the inhibition of myocardin is able to influence hypertrophy. We used siRNA-mediated targeted disruption of myocardin gene expression to specifically block myocardin. Transfection efficiency with myocardin siRNA was >90%. Myocardin siRNA did not affect cell proliferation (data not shown). Treatment with myocardin siRNA, but not a scrambled siRNA sequence, resulted in a substantial (90%) reduction of myocardin protein expression (Fig. 1D). Treatment of canine cardiac myoblasts with insulin (10−7 mol/liter) resulted in an increase in the hypertrophic marker β-MHC (Fig. 1C). Western analysis of ANP did not show any re-expression of this fetal gene in canine cardiac myoblasts at baseline and after insulin treatment (data not shown). Myocardin siRNA attenuated insulin-induced increase in β-MHC expression (Fig. 1C). Insulin treatment also led to an increase in cell size of canine cardiac myoblasts, which was inhibited by siRNAs against myocardin (Fig. 1E). Thus, myocardin likely participates in conveying the hypertrophy signals of insulin. SRF is a nuclear transcription factor that binds to the SRE of DNA sequences located in the promoter of genes critical for cardiovascular myogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy (25Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J.

To determine if myocardin, an important co-activator of SRF, can interact with SRF in response to insulin treatment by binding to SREs located in the promoter of such genes, we performed EMSA with nuclear extracts from canine cardiac myoblasts treated with insulin (10−8-10−7 mol/liter) and incubated with a radiolabeled double-stranded DNA SRE probe ([32P]SRE). SRF-SRE activity, a preliminary requirement for myogenesis, was thus detected (Fig. 2, panels A and B). In nuclear protein extracts from cells treated with insulin, a strong binding activity was indicated by the appearance of shifted bands. The specificity of the SRF-32P-SRE binding was confirmed with the use of mutant probes or by competition with non-radioactive or mutated probes, which led to the disappearance of shifted bands. Moreover, addition of a specific antibody against myocardin resulted in super-shifted bands (Fig. 2, panels A and B), indicating that myocardin was present in the protein-SRE probe complexes. Quantitative analysis of the shifted bands confirmed that insulin treatment enhanced SRF binding activity. The Akt inhibitor LY-294002 attenuated the SRF-SRE activity upon insulin treatment. To further confirm that myocardin plays a functional role in insulin-induced SRF-SRE activity, we also tested whether the inhibition of myocardin can influence insulin-induced SRF-SRE activity. Indeed, myocardin siRNA could substantially attenuate the SRF-SRE binding induced by insulin (Fig. 2, panels C and D). Thus, insulin treatment increases the binding of SRF to the SRE in canine cardiac myoblasts through the activation of myocardin. Insulin stimulates the chaperone-associated ubiquitin (Ub) ligase CHIP (35Belova L. Sharma S. Brickley D.R. Nicolarsen J.R. Patterson C. Conzen S.D.

Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that the intracellular level of USP33 is highly sensitive to the activity of p97. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of p97 causes robust accumulation of USP33 due to inhibition of its degradation. The p97 adaptor complex involved in this function is the Ufd1-Npl4 heterodimer. Furthermore, we identified HERC2, a HECT domain-containing E3 ligase, as being responsible for polyubiquitination of USP33. Inhibition of p97 causes accumulation of polyubiquitinated USP33, suggesting that p97 is required for postubiquitination processing.

By removing monoubiquitin or disassembling polyubiquitin chains from substrate proteins, DUBs counteract or regulate the activities of E3 ubiquitin ligases (1Reyes-Turcu F.E. Ventii K.H.

USP33 has been implicated in several important cellular functions. These functions include centrosome amplification (3Li J. D'Angiolella V. Seeley E.S. Kim S. Kobayashi T. Fu W. Campos E.I. Pagano M.

In addition, USP33 is involved in SLIT-dependent axon guidance and cell migration events (6Yuasa-Kawada J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Wu G. Rao Y. Wu J.Y.

Invest. 2003; 112: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Many of these pathways are sensitive to USP33 levels, as both knockdown and overexpression of USP33 result in specific cellular defects. Consequently, there appears to be a need to tightly regulate the levels of USP33. USP33 is a short lived DUB that is constantly turned over by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (9Li Z. Na X. Wang D. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Ubiquitination of a novel deubiquitinating enzyme requires direct binding to von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein.J. Biol.

A previous study identified USP33 as an interacting protein of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), an E3 ligase. pVHL-mediated polyubiquitination was proposed to target USP33 for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (9Li Z. Na X. Wang D. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Ubiquitination of a novel deubiquitinating enzyme requires direct binding to von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein.J. Biol.

However, this study utilized in vitro assays or cellular assays with exogenously expressed USP33, and the role of pVHL in regulating endogenous USP33 has not been validated. It therefore remains possible that additional pathways are involved in USP33 degradation. In this study, we have identified and characterized a number of proteins critical for regulating the intracellular levels of USP33 using quantitative mass spectrometry, RNA interference, and biochemical approaches. These proteins consist of p97 (also known as VCP; CDC48 in yeast), its adaptor complex Ufd1-Npl4, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2. Together, p97, Ufd-Npl4, and HERC2 constitute a novel pathway to target USP33 for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. HeLa, 293T, NIH-3T3, 786-O, RCC4, and 293 Flp-In T-Rex cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293 Flp-In T-Rex HERC2-ShB cells expressing doxycycline-inducible and shRNA-resistant HERC2, or catalytically inactive (C4762S) HERC2 were generated by the Flp-In T-Rex system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 786-O and RCC4 cells stably infected with control vector or HA-pVHL were kind gifts from William G.

For SILAC, HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (light labeling). For heavy labeling, Arg6 (U-13C6) and Lys8 (U-13C6, U-15N2) (Cambridge Isotopes) were supplemented at the same concentration as in the standard DMEM formulation. For SILAC, a membrane fraction enriched with mitochondria was prepared from a 1:1 mixture of heavy and light SILAC-labeled HeLa p97-V1 cells (treated in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 2 days). This fraction was prepared as described previously (11Chan N.C. Salazar A.M. Pham A.H. Sweredoski M.J. Kolawa N.J. Graham R.L. Hess S. Chan D.C.

Mass spectrometry experiments were performed on an EASY-nLC connected to a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap classic (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems) as described previously (12Kalli A.

Proteome Res. 2013; 12: 3071-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated on a 15-cm reversed-phase analytical column (75-μm internal diameter) in-house packed with 3-μm C18 beads (ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ medium; Dr. Maisch GmbH) with a 160-min gradient from 2 to 30% acetonitrile in 0.2% formic acid at a flow rate of 350 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode to switch automatically between full scan MS and tandem MS acquisition. Survey full scan mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (300–1700 m/z), after accumulation of 500,000 ions, with a resolution of 60,000 at 400 m/z. The top 10 most intense ions from the survey scan were isolated and, after the accumulation of 5,000 ions, fragmented in the linear ion trap by collision-induced dissociation (collisional energy 35% and isolation width 2 Da). Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled and all singly charged and unassigned charge states were rejected. The dynamic exclusion list was set with a maximum retention time of 90 s, a relative mass window of 10 ppm. Early expiration was enabled. Raw data files were analyzed by MaxQuant (v 1.4.1.2) (13Cox J. Mann M.

The latter consisted of reversed sequences with tryptic digestion and was searched with a maximum of two missed cleavages, fixed carboxyamidomethyl modifications of cysteine, variable oxidation modifications of methionine, and variable protein N terminus acetylations, with 1% false discovery rate thresholds for both peptides and proteins as estimated by the target decoy approach (16Elias J.E.

At least two different peptide sequences were required for protein identification, and two different ratio measurements were required for protein quantitation. Protein SILAC ratio p values were calculated as described previously using a hierarchical bootstrap statistical model (17Pierce N.W. Lee J.E. Liu X. Sweredoski M.J. Graham R.L. Larimore E.A. Rome M.

N-terminally 3×FLAG-tagged HERC2 fragments (F1–F6) were PCR-amplified from HeLa cDNA library and cloned into pcDNA3.1+. N-terminally 3×FLAG-tagged full-length HERC2 (WT), and C4762S constructs were cloned into pcDNA5 FRT/TO and were generated by a combination of fusion PCR and multiple cloning steps. N-terminal 3×FLAG-tagged Npl4 and C-terminally single FLAG-tagged Ufd1 were PCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+). All DNA transfection experiments were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For RNAi-resistant USP33, silent mutations that render the construct refractory to the USP33-ShA construct were introduced into the coding sequence of USP33 via PCR and cloned into a modified version of pRetroX Tet-on Advanced, where replacement of the rtTA segment results in constitutive expression of USP33 under the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Expression of this construct was mediated via retroviral transduction. All antibodies used in this study are commercially available. The following monoclonal antibodies were used: USP33 (clone 5B5; Sigma), actin (clone C4; Millipore), FLAG and FLAG-peroxidase (clone M2; Sigma). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies used were: USP33 (Millipore), USP33 (Bethyl Laboratories), USP20 (Bethyl Laboratories), p97 (Cell Signaling), Oxa1 (Proteintech Group), HERC2 (Bethyl Laboratories), actin (Sigma), Npl4 (Bethyl Laboratories), UfD1 (Bethyl Laboratories), pVHL (Thermo Scientific). Cell lines (HeLa, 293T, NIH-3T3) with doxycycline-inducible expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against p97 were established using the TRIPZ lentiviral shRNA system (Thermo Scientific). The targeted sequences for p97-V1 and p97-V4 are 5′-AACAGCCATTCTCAAACAGAA-3′ and 5′-GAATAGAGTTGTTCGGAATAA-3′, respectively. For UBXD7-V1, the targeted sequence is 5′-AAGCAACGAAGCTGTGAAGAAT-3′. In all experiments, 1 μg/ml doxycycline was used to induce shRNA expression, and a nontargeting shRNA was used as control (Thermo Scientific). For rescue experiments, p97 containing silent mutations that render the construct refractory to the p97-V1 shRNA was expressed via retroviral transduction in HeLa p97-V1 cells. The shRNA-resistant p97 construct was cloned into pRetroX-Tet-On Advanced (Clontech) to replace the rtTA-Advanced segment, resulting in constitutive expression of p97 under the CMV promoter. Transduced cells were selected by 1 mg/ml G418. For shRNA-mediated knockdown of USP33, HERC2, and Npl4, the indicated cell lines were transduced with retrovirus expressing shRNA from the human H1 promoter. The targeted sequences were: USP33-ShA (5′-GGACCAAATCTTTGGGCATGT-3′), HERC2-ShA (5′-GCCAATGTGATTGGTCCAATC-3′), HERC2-ShB (5′-GCACGCACATTGGAGATATAC-3′), HERC2-ShC (5′-GCAGTTCCTTTCTTAGCTTCG-3′), HERC2-ShD (5′-GGAAGAAAGTCATCGCCATCG-3′), Npl4-ShA (5′-GCTGAAGTGGCTGCGATTTAT-3″), Npl4-ShC (5′-GCGGAAGGTTGGCTGGATATT-3′). For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, dicer-substrate RNA (DsiRNA) duplexes were used (IDT). The target sequences were: Npl4 siRNA1 (5′-CGGTTTACATCAATAGAAACAAGAC-3′), Ufd1 siRNA1 (5′-CAAACTGACCAATAAGAATTCGGAC-3′), nontargeting control (5′-CGTTAATCGCGTATAATACGCGTAT-3′). Transfections of siRNA were performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Freshly harvested cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by lysis in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Igepal CA-630) supplemented with 1× Halt protease inhibitors mixture (Pierce) and 10 μm MG132. Cell lysis was carried out at 4 °C with constant rotation for 1 h, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations of the cleared lysates were quantified, and 1–5 mg of total protein was used for co-immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. For control experiments, an equal amount of purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the host species was used. Protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) was subsequently used to capture the immuno-complexes (1.5 h at 4 °C), followed by four washes with IP buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was used. Freshly harvested cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, followed by lysis in IP buffer containing 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 μm MG132, 50 μm PR-619 (LifeSensors Inc.), and 1× Halt protease inhibitors mixture. Cleared lysates were prepared as described for the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and ubiquitinated proteins were affinity-purified from ∼2 mg of total protein using Ubiquilin 1 Tandem UBA (TUBE2) agarose (Boston Biochem) at 4 °C, with constant rotation for 2 h. Bound proteins were washed four times using the same buffer and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. p97 is an abundant, ubiquitously expressed member of the AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) protein family and is involved in a broad range of cellular activities (18Meyer H.

With help from distinct cofactor proteins and using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis, p97 can structurally remodel or unfold ubiquitinated client proteins (21Stolz A. Hilt W. Buchberger A.

This ability enables p97 to function as a “segregase,” whereby it mechanically extracts client proteins from their native environment. Examples include dissociation of protein complexes or extraction of proteins from membrane surfaces. In doing so, p97 can facilitate membrane trafficking, protein complex remodeling, and proteasomal protein degradation (19Dantuma N.P. Hoppe T.

To identify p97-regulated proteins, quantitative mass spectrometry was used to measure protein levels in a mitochondria-enriched fraction after depletion of p97. We used a HeLa cell line (HeLa p97-V1) in which efficient silencing of p97 is achieved via doxycycline-inducible expression of an shRNA construct against p97 (Fig. 1A). After 2 days of p97 depletion, the cells reproducibly showed a ∼3.3-fold increase in the levels of USP33 (Fig. 1B). Other DUBs in the mass spectrometry dataset were unaffected. Although we initially identified USP33 from a mitochondria-enriched fraction, other studies have indicated localization of USP33 to nonmitochondrial sites, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and centrosome (3Li J.

Isoform-specific localization of the deubiquitinase USP33 to the Golgi apparatus.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also have not found evidence for a mitochondrial localization, and therefore our identification of USP33 in the mitochondrial fraction likely resulted from the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry coupled with low level contamination of this fraction by other cellular components. Nevertheless, these data suggest that USP33 accumulates upon depletion of p97. To validate the mass spectrometry results, we cultured HeLa p97-V1 cells in the presence of doxycycline for 3 days and analyzed the steady-state levels of endogenous USP33 by immunoblotting total cell lysates. We found that the levels of USP33 increased up to 8-fold upon depletion of p97 (Fig. 1C). The effect of p97 knockdown on USP33 was not limited to HeLa cells, as similar results were obtained from the human cell line HEK293 and the murine cell line NIH-3T3 (Fig. 1D). An independent shRNA targeted against a different region of the p97 transcript caused similar accumulation, whereas a nontargeting shRNA did not (Fig. 1E). Further arguing against an off-target effect, expression of shRNA-resistant p97 completely suppressed the accumulation of USP33 caused by knockdown of endogenous p97 (Fig. 1F). p97 facilitates the degradation of a number of proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (25Heo J.M.

To test whether p97 regulates USP33 posttranslationally, we exogenously expressed an RNAi-resistant version of USP33 in a modified p97-V1 cell line where the endogenous expression of USP33 is constitutively silenced. Upon knockdown of p97 via doxycycline treatment, we found that the exogenously expressed USP33 also accumulated (Fig. 1G), thus demonstrating that USP33 is regulated by p97 at a posttranslational level. Using cycloheximide chase experiments, we compared the degradation rate of endogenous USP33 with and without p97 activity. For these experiments, shRNA against p97 is not ideal, because long term knockdown of p97 results in higher starting levels of USP33. We therefore used the recently described p97 inhibitor NMS-873 (33Polucci P. Magnaghi P. Angiolini M. Asa D. Avanzi N. Badari A. Bertrand J. Casale E. Cauteruccio S. Cirla A. Cozzi L. Galvani A.

Biol. 2013; 9: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which causes acute inhibition of p97 activity and circumvents potential secondary effects that may result from long term p97 depletion. Upon addition of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis, USP33 degradation was monitored. Addition of NMS-873 to the cycloheximide chase experiment did not impact the starting levels of USP33 but caused complete inhibition of USP33 degradation over the course of 9 h (Fig. 1H). In control cells, ∼70% of USP33 was degraded by 9 h. We therefore conclude that the effect of p97 knockdown on USP33 is at the level of protein degradation. Because USP33 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (9Li Z. Na X. Wang D. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Ubiquitination of a novel deubiquitinating enzyme requires direct binding to von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we tested whether inhibition of p97 results in changes in the polyubiquitination levels of endogenous USP33. A 12-h treatment with NMS-873 caused a modest increase in the steady-state levels of USP33 (Fig. 1I). Upon affinity purification of polyubiquitinated proteins, we found a substantial increase in the level of high molecular weight USP33 species in the NMS-873 treated cells (Fig. 1I). These data support the notion that p97 is important for targeting polyubiquitinated USP33 for proteasomal degradation. p97 can interact with a multitude of protein cofactors and binding partners. These cofactor proteins are generally thought to act as adaptors to direct p97 to its different substrates, thereby enabling the functional diversity of p97 (22Schuberth C. Buchberger A.

C., Kaden, D., Multhaup, G., and Than, M. E. (2012) J. Mol. Biol. 416, 438-452), but unresolved is the nature and functional importance of metal ion binding to APLP1 and APLP2. We found here that zinc ions bound to APP and APLP1 E2 domains and mediated their oligomerization, whereas the APLP2 E2 domain interacted more weakly with zinc possessing a less surface-exposed zinc-binding site, and stayed monomeric. Copper ions bound to E2 domains of all three proteins. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses examined the effect of metal ion binding to APP and APLPs in the cellular context in real time. Zinc ions specifically induced APP and APLP1 oligomerization and forced APLP1 into multimeric clusters at the plasma membrane consistent with zinc concentrations in the blood and brain. The observed effects were mediated by a novel zinc-binding site within the APLP1 E2 domain as APLP1 deletion mutants revealed. Based upon its cellular localization and its dominant response to zinc ions, APLP1 is mainly affected by extracellular zinc among the APP family proteins. We conclude that zinc binding and APP/APLP oligomerization are intimately linked, and we propose that this represents a novel mechanism for regulating APP/APLP protein function at the molecular level."

Central corneal thickness (CCT), thinnest corneal thickness (TCT), and midperipheral corneal thickness (MPCT; measured at superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal locations with a distance of 1 mm (CT2mm) or 2.5 mm (CT5mm) from the corneal apex) were analyzed. Differences and agreement between measurements were assessed using the repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bland-Altman analyses, respectively.Statistically significant differences (p<0.001) among the four devices were revealed in CCT, TCT and CT2mm measurements. The CCT, TCT, and CT2mm values were ranked from the thickest to the thinnest as follows: Galilei>Sirius>Pentacam>RTVue OCT. For these measurements, agreement between measurements by Sirius and Pentacam was good, whereas Galilei overestimated and RTVue underestimated corneal thickness compared to Sirius and Pentacam. As regards CT5mm measurements, Pentacam provided the largest values, whereas RTVue OCT yielded the smallest values. Agreement of the CT5mm measurements was good between the Pentacam, Sirius, moderate between Galilei and the other two Scheimpflug systems, and poor between the RTVue OCT and the remaining devices.The Pentacam and Sirius can be used interchangeably for CCT measurements, while the Galilei and RTVue systematically over- and underestimate CCT, respectively. The three Scheimpflug cameras, but not the RTVue, may be used interchangeably for MPCT measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1966296159,"The heat shock response, resulting in the production of heat shock proteins or molecular chaperones, is triggered by elevated temperature and a variety of other stressors. Its master regulator is heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). Heat shock factors generally exist in multiple isoforms. The two known isoforms of HSF1 differ in the inclusion (HSF1α) or exclusion (HSF1β) of exon 11. Although there are some data concerning the differential expression patterns and transcriptional activities of HSF2 isoforms during development, little is known about the distinct properties of the HSF1 isoforms. Here we present evidence for two novel HSF1 isoforms termed HSF1γα and HSF1γβ, and we show that the HSF1 isoform ratio differentially regulates heat shock protein gene transcription. Hsf1γ isoforms are expressed in various mouse tissues and are translated into protein. Furthermore, after heat shock, HSF1γ isoforms are exported from the nucleus more rapidly or degraded more quickly than HSF1α or HSF1β. We also show that each individual HSF1 isoform is sufficient to induce the heat shock response and that expression of combinations of HSF1 isoforms, in particular HSF1α and HSF1β, results in a synergistic enhancement of the transcriptional response. In addition, HSF1γ isoforms potentially suppress the synergistic effect of HSF1α and HSF1β co-expression. Collectively, our observations suggest that the expression of HSF1 isoforms in a specific ratio provides an additional layer in the regulation of heat shock protein gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2078691626,"Background To identify social factors determining the frequency of community health service (CHS) utilization among CHS users in China. Methods Nationwide cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. A total of 86,116 CHS visitors selected from 35 cities were interviewed. Descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis were employed to analyze characteristics of CHS users, frequency of CHS utilization, and the socio-demographic and socio-economic factors influencing frequency of CHS utilization. Results Female and senior CHS clients were more likely to make 3–5 and ≥6 CHS visits (as opposed to 1–2 visits) than male and young clients, respectively. CHS clients with higher education were less frequent users than individuals with primary education or less in 2008 and 2009; in later surveys, CHS clients with higher education were the more frequent users. The association between frequent CHS visits and family income has changed significantly between 2008 and 2011. In 2011, income status did not have a discernible effect on the likelihood of making ≥6 CHS visits, and it only had a slight effect on making 3–5 CHS visits. Conclusion CHS may play an important role in providing primary health care to meet the demands of vulnerable populations in China. Over time, individuals with higher education are increasingly likely to make frequent CHS visits than individuals with primary school education or below. The gap in frequency of CHS utilization among different economic income groups decreased from 2008 to 2011."
https://openalex.org/W2056548467,"Objective Patients with a history of deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) are prescribed a greater amount of medication than the general public. DSP is the most robust risk factor for repeat episodes of DSP and subsequent death by suicide, and one might therefore expect that access to prescribed medication would be reduced following an episode of DSP. However, it is unclear whether access to prescribed medication changes after an episode of DSP. The objectives of this study were to investigate changes in 1) overall, psychotropic, non-psychotropic and the psychotropic subgroup antidepressant prescribed medication availability in DSP patients following an episode of DSP, 2) prescribing of the medication ingested in the episode, and 3) potential effects of gender, age and repeater status on such change. Methods The design was longitudinal. We included 171 patients admitted for DSP between January 2006 and March 2007. Data on patients' prescriptions prior to admission were retrieved from The Norwegian Prescription Database. The outcome measure was the difference between medication load in the year following compared to the year prior to the DSP episode. Results There was a significant increase in total medication load following DSP, including both psychotropic and non-psychotropic medication. Antidepressant medication load remained stable. There was a tendency for access to drugs ingested in the episode to increase following the episode, albeit not significantly. Medication load increased with age across all medication groups irrespective of time period and gender. Conclusions The findings show that physicians do not curb prescribing to patients who have recently deliberately self-poisoned. Moreover, they highlight the need for cautious and judicious prescribing for these patients, in combination with psychological and social interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2092996425,"The regulator of G protein signaling homology (RH) Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) (p115RhoGEF, leukemia-associated RhoGEF, and PDZ-RhoGEF) contain an RH domain and are specific GEFs for the monomeric GTPase RhoA. The RH domains interact specifically with the α subunits of G12 heterotrimeric GTPases. Activated Gα13 modestly stimulates the exchange activity of both p115RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF but not PDZ-RhoGEF. Because all three RH-RhoGEFs can localize to the plasma membrane upon expression of activated Gα13, cellular localization of these RhoGEFs has been proposed as a mechanism for controlling their activity. We use a small molecule-regulated heterodimerization system to rapidly control the localization of RH-RhoGEFs. Acute localization of the proteins to the plasma membrane activates RhoA within minutes and to levels that are comparable with activation of RhoA by hormonal stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. The catalytic activity of membrane-localized RhoGEFs is not dependent on activated Gα13. We further show that the conserved RH domains can rewire two different RacGEFs to activate Rac1 in response to a traditional activator of RhoA. Thus, RH domains act as independent detectors for activated Gα13 and are sufficient to modulate the activity of RhoGEFs by hormones via mediating their localization to substrate, membrane-associated RhoA."
