https://openalex.org/W1591190363,"The amino acid sequence of beta-galactosidase has been determined. The monomer contains 1,021 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain and has a molecular weight of 116,349. All 80 tryptic peptides as well as all 24 CNBr peptides have been isolated in pure form. Evidence is presented for the ordering of the CNBr peptides. The sequence determination was aided by analysis of cyanogen bromide peptides obtained from a polypeptide fragment produced by a lacZ termination mutant strain."

Among mothers of surviving infants, differences in maternal care produced differences in age of weaning and age of independence but did not result in differences in interbirth intervals."
https://openalex.org/W2043471961,"Three cloned segments of Drosophila melanogaster DNA have been isolated that derive from the major heat shock site at 87C in chromosome 3. Each of these segments contains sequences homologous to a class of polysomal poly(A)+ RNAs whose synthesis is induced by heat shock of cultured cells. A combination of R loop, heteroduplex and restriction fragment maps of these segments reveals that their RNA-homologous sequences are arranged in tandemly repeated units, each unit consisting of an α element (0.49 kb) joined to a β element (1.10 kb). The polysomal RNAs homologous to these αβ units (1.59 kb) are distributed into three size classes exhibiting approximate lengths of 1, 2 and 3 kb. R loop mapping demonstrated that the sequence of the 2 kb RNA is αβα, indicating that it, and presumably the 3 kb RNA, derive from transcripts covering more than one repeated unit. One of the cloned segments contains a variant repeat unit, αγ, located between two αβ units. This unit has the same α element, but the β element has been replaced by a nonhomologous γ element (0.87 kb). Analysis of the total D. melanogaster DNA indicates that the 87C locus contains at least 21 tandemly repeated units, twelve of which were identified as αβ units and six as αγ units. The 21 or more units are distributed among at least three different tandem arrays separated by different spacer regions, one of which is within a cloned segment. Sequences in the γ element, but not those in the α or β elements, are also found at 87A, which contains another heat shock site. The possible roles of the αβ-type RNAs and of the γ sequences are discussed in the light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W2055302782,"The absence of either of the enzymes adenosine deaminase (ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase is associated with an immunodeficiency disease. Because all four nucleoside substrates of the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase accumulate in the urine of patients who lack this enzyme (Cohen et al., 1976), we examined the toxicity of each of the four substrates using a mouse T cell lymphoma (S49) in continuous culture. Of the four substrates (inosine, deoxyinosine, guanosine and deoxyguanosine), only deoxyguanosine is cytotoxic at concentrations lower than 100 μM; furthermore, only deoxyguanosine is directly phosphorylated in S49 cells. Mutant S49 cells lacking deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74) are resistant to the toxic effects of deoxyguanosine, and these same mutants do not phosphorylate deoxyguanosine. Thus the cytotoxicity of exogenous deoxyguanosine correlates with the intracellular concentration of accumulated deoxyGTP. The addition of deoxyguanosine results in the depletion of deoxyCTP in S49 cells, indicating that deoxyGTP is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. Furthermore, the addition of deoxycytidine prevents the toxic effects of deoxyguanosine. Thus a therapy for purine nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient patients might include deoxycytidine to alleviate the proposed deoxyCTP starvation in those tissues capable of phosphorylating deoxyguanosine."
https://openalex.org/W2046157381,"The isolation and partial characterization of two cloned segments of Drosophila melanogaster DNA containing ""heat shock"" gene sequences is described. We have inserted sheared embryonic D. melanogaster DNA by the poly(dA-dt) connector method (Lobban and Kaiser, 1973) into the R1 restriction site of the ampicillin-resistant plasmid pSF2124 (So, Gill and Falkow, 1975). A collection of independent hybrid plasmids was screened by colony hybridization (Grunstein and Hogness, 1975) for sequences complementary to in vitro labeled polysomal poly(A)+ heat shock RNA. Two clones were identified which contain sequences complementary to a heat shock mRNA species that directs the in vitro synthesis of the 70,000 dalton heat-induced polypeptide. Both cloned segments hybridize in situ to the heat-induced puff sites located at 87A and 87C of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2027862346,"Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are hematopoietic cells transformed with Friend virus complex and therefore able to proliferate continuously in culture, but these cells may also be induced to undergo erythroid maturation and accumulate globin mRNA. Using pancreatic DNAase I as a probe for transcriptionally active genes, we have compared the conformation of the globin genes in nuclei from induced and uninduced MEL cells. Three MEL cell lines were chosen: C-19 had a moderate level of globin mRNA in the uninduced state and exhibited an 8 fold increase after incubation in Me2SO; GM979 had a very low level of globin mRNA in the uninduced state and exhibited a 45 fold increase on incubation in Me2SO; 4-3 was noninducible, having a very low level of globin mRNA both before and after incubation in Me2SO. Digestion of 10–15% of the nuclear DNA by DNAase I in nuclei from induced and uninduced cells from each of these lines resulted in virtually complete digestion of globin gene sequences. Two additional cell lines were characterized with regard to the conformation of the globin genes. A cybrid line formed by fusion of MEL cells to enucleated mouse fibroblasts was partially inducible in that 40% of the cells became benzidine-positive in Me2SO; 40–45% of the globin gene sequences were resistant to DNAase I. In contrast, the globin genes in nuclei from a lymphoblast line (L5178Y-2BF) were completely sensitive to DNAase I, implying that these noninducible cells nonetheless shared certain properties with erythroid progenitor cells. Two types of controls were performed. Incubation of nuclei from mouse adult liver cells and a mouse hepatoma cells with pancreatic DNAase I did not lead to digestion of the globin genes, while the globin genes were digested in nuclei from mouse fetal erythroid liver. The specificity for digestion of the globin genes in MEL cell nuclei was tested by annealing these DNA samples to cDNA prepared with mouse myeloma cell mRNA naturally rich in immunoglobulin light chain mRNA sequences. DNA from all nuclei which had been exposed to DNAase I annealed equally to this probe. We conclude that Me2SO-induced accumulation of globin mRNA in MEL cells is not due to changes in the conformation of the globin gene in nuclei, but rather that the potential for transcription of the globin gene is acquired at a point early in erythroid maturation beyond which MEL cells have progressed. While the conformation of specific genes in nuclei as reflected by their DNAase I sensitivity is necessary to permit their transcription, the actual rate of transcription of these genes and the accumulation of their mRNAs must depend upon other factors."
https://openalex.org/W2061372853,Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae rapidly accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle when exposed to the chelating agents o-phenanthroline (OP) or 8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ). Zinc salts fully reversed the growth-inhibitory effect of both OP and HQ. Cells treated with these chelating agents showed limited RNA accumulation and little RNA degradation. Rates of RNA synthesis were drastically reduced by low concentrations of these compounds. Whereas rates of protein synthesis were essentially unaffected. Rates of synthesis of mRNA and tRNA were less affected than were rates of synthesis of high molecular weight RNA. Processing of ribosomal precursor RNA was altered. these results suggest that the primary effect of OP and HQ is on rRNA synthesis. RNA metabolism must therefore have a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle.
https://openalex.org/W1497294456,"A DNA glycosylase that releases free hypoxanthine by selective cleavage of dIMP residues in polydeoxynucleotides and DNA containing this nonconventional nucleotide is present in Escherichia coli cell extracts. The partly purified enzyme, termed hypoxanthine-DNA glycosylase, does not require divalent cations or phosphate for activity, and it acts more efficiently on double-stranded than on single-stranded substrates. The enzyme has properties different from either uracil-DNA glycosylase or 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase and is present at normal levels in E. coli mutants deficient in either of the latter two DNA glycosylases."

https://openalex.org/W1999601580,"Antisera have been produced against five molecular weight subfractions of the Drosophila proteins readily extracted from nuclei following limited DNAase I digestion. Immunofluorescence staining techniques were used to assess the distributions of these proteins in the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila. In three cases, the antigens were widely distributed; in one case, the antigens appeared to be slightly more concentrated at active loci; and in one case, the antigens were strongly concentrated at a defined set of loci, including puffs and most of the loci which are active (puffed) at some time during third instar larval and prepupal development. The latter distribution pattern differs from that of RNA polymerase. Nonhistone chromosomal proteins of this type may have a key role in establishing and/or maintaining the altered chromatin structure characteristic of the active state."
https://openalex.org/W2102495005,"To delineate the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency disease associated with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, the effects of guanosine, inosine, deoxyguanosine and deoxyinosine on the growth of a mouse T cell lymphoma line in culture were studied. Of these four purine nucleosides, deoxyguanosine was the most toxic. At 5 x 10−6 to 10−5 M, deoxyguanosine inhibits growth of the lymphoma cells; higher concentrations result in complete killing. The cytotoxic effects of this deoxynucleoside can be prevented by simultaneous addition to culture medium of deoxycytidine and hypoxanthine. Determination of nucleotide pools in deoxyguanosine-treated cells shows a marked reduction of the deoxycytidine triphosphate and the adenine ribonucleotide pools, accompanied by a sharp rise in the guanosine deoxyribonucleotide and a smaller increase in the corresponding ribonucleotide pools. Deoxyguanosine as well as guanosine, inosine and deoxyinosine were known to accumulate to relatively high levels in the plasma of a patient with T cell immunodeficiency disease associated with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. The other three purine nucleosides are much less toxic than deoxyguanosine. Thus it is very probable that the patient's clinical manifestations of T lymphocytopenia are the consequence of deoxyguanosine inhibition of lymphoid cell proliferation, resulting from depletion of deoxycytidine triphosphate and adenine nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1509508362,"Over 99% of thyroxine (T4), the major form of thyroid hormone in plasma, is bound to the plasma glycoprotein thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). The carbohydrate composition of TBG (14.6% by weight) consists of mannose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid in the molar ratios of 11:9:16:10 per mol of glycoprotein. No fucose or N-acetylgalactosamine were detected. Amino acid analyses were performed. Glycopeptides, prepared by exhaustive pronase treatment of the glycoprotein, were separated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. All glycopeptides contained the four sugars present in the native glycoprotein. One-fourth of the glycopeptide fraction was resolved into a discrete component, glycopeptide I. The remaining glycopeptides were a mixture termed glycopeptides II and III. Glycopeptides II and III were resolved into two discrete carbohydrate units, termed oligosaccharides A and B, by alkaline-borohydride treatment and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. We propose that TBG contains four oligosaccharide chains as calculated from the molecular weights of the glycopeptides and from compositional data assuming 1 asparagine residue/glycopeptide. The carbohydrate structures of the glycopeptides and relative affinities of TBG, glycopeptides and oligosaccharides for hepatocyte plasma membrane binding are presented in the accompanying paper (Zinn, A.B., Marshall, J.S., and Carlson, D.M. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6768-6773."

https://openalex.org/W1604051891,"Mycolic acids derived from the cell walls of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Mycobacterium bovis Bovinus I, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv have been fractionated as their p-bromophenacyl esters by a two-step high performance liquid chromatographic procedure: 1) adsorption chromatography on 10-micrometer particle size silica gel, and 2) reverse phase partition chromatography on a 10-micrometer particle size support containing a C18 bonded phase. This procedure has resulted in the isolation of approximately 24 mycolic acids from each bacterium (very likely homologs of various mycolate types) instead of the two to four that have previously been described. The implication of these results on the previously determined structures of these fatty acids is discussed."

Comparison of this sequence with those of reductases from other bacterial sources shows that the enzymes are homologous. The Lactobacillus casei reductase sequences shows a 29% sequence identity with that of the Escherichia coli enzyme and a 34% identity with the sequence of the enzyme from Streptococcus faecium.

https://openalex.org/W1702464641,"Membranes from Bacillus cereus AHU 1356 incorporated radioactivity from UDP-N-acetyl[14C]glucosamine into three alkaline-stable and acid-labile lipids which were extracted into chloroform:methanol (2:1) and separated from each other by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates. The major labeled lipid (Lipid 1) and a minor one (Lipid 2) were identified as N-actetylglucosaminyl phosphorylundecaprenol from several analytical criteria involving mass spectral data and from reversal of their formation by UDP. These two lipids appear to differ in geometry of their polyprenol moieties. The third labeled lipid (Lipid 3) was identified as N-acetylglucosaminyl pyrophosphorylundecaprenol. Antibiotic 24010, a tunicamycin-like antibiotic, at 1 microgram/ml was found to inhibit almost completely the formation of Lipid 3, whereas it inhibited the formation of Lipid 1 much more weakly and rather enhanced the formation of Lipid 2. Radioactivity was also incorporated into a polymer from UDP-GlcNAc and from Lipid 3. UDP-N-acetylmannosamine, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, and UDP-glucose supported the incorporation. Antibiotic 24010 strongly inhibited the incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-GlcNAc into polymer, whereas it did not affect the incorporation from Lipid 3. Thus, it is concluded that N-acetylglucosaminyl pyrophosphorylundecaprenol serves as a precursor in the synthesis of a polymer presumed as the cell wall polysaccharide of this bacterial strain."

https://openalex.org/W1597272008,"The aspartate transcarbamylase of Bacillus subtilis is stable in exponentially growing cells, but undergoes rapid, energy-dependent inactivation when growth is inhibited by nutrient depletion or addition of antibiotics or other inhibitors of metabolism. This inactivation has been analyzed by a variety of immunochemical techniques, including direct and indirect immunoprecipitation of extracts of cells labeled with 3H-amino-acids, microcomplement fixation, and neutralization of enzymatic activity. The ability of the antibody preparation to react with various denatured, chemically modified, and proteolytically degraded forms of aspartate transcarbamylase was demonstrated. All of the techniques showed that cross-reactive protein disappeared from the cells at the same rate as enzymatic activity, and that little or no immunoprecipitable material of lower than native molecular weight was detectable during inactivation. The disappearance of material cross-reactive with aspartate transcarbamylase occurred prior to the increase in protein degradation that normally occurs in stationary B. subtilis cells and proceeded at a rate at least 20 times greater than general protein degradation. The rate of disappearance was unaffected in mutant strains deficient in intracellular protease activity or in cells treated with inhibitors of protein turnover. Aspartate transcarbamylase was shown to be stable in growing cells. We conclude that the inactivation of aspartate transcarbamylase in vivo involves, or is rapidly followed by, selective, energy-dependent degradation of the protein by a system that appears to involve a previously undescribed protease of B. subtilis."
https://openalex.org/W2046320379,"The regulative behavior of cells from the imaginal wing disk of Drosophila melanogaster can be modified by interaction with cells from different disk types. Both thoracic and nonthoracic disks are able to interact, but there are major differences in the effectiveness of interaction. The finding lends experimental support to the idea that cells in different fields within the same organism use the same mechanism for specifying positional information. A similar conclusion has been reached by Wilcox and Smith based on studies of the mutation wingless."

https://openalex.org/W1512662481,"The coat protein of Bacillus subtilis spores comprises about 10% of the total dry weight of spores and 25% of the total spore protein. One protein with a molecular weight of 13,000 to 15,000 comprises a major portion of the spore coat. This mature spore coat protein has histidine at its NH2 terminus and is relatively rich in hydrophobic amino acids. Netropsin, and antibiotic which binds to A-T-rich regions of DNA and inhibits sporulation, but not growth, decreased the synthesis of this spore coat protein by 75%. A precursor spore coat protein with a molecular weight of 25,000 is made initially at t1 of sporulation and is converted to the mature spore coat protein with a molecular weight of 13,500 at t2 - t3. These data indicate that the spore coat protein gene is expressed very early in sporulation prior to the modifications of RNA polymerase which have been noted."

https://openalex.org/W1523443605,"The properties of the enzyme ribonuclease N were investigated. By comparing the distribution in the cell of RNase N with the bonafide intracellular beta-galactosidase, and the periplasmic alkaline phosphatase enzymes, we showed that RNase N is an intracellular enzyme. Since previous studies suggested that it is an endoribonuclease, it was compared to RNase III, the only other known intracellular endoribonuclease in Escherichia coli. Using homopolymers and co-polymers we found that, while RNase III could digest double-stranded RNA only, RNase N digested single-stranded and double-stranded RNA with similar efficiency. Furthermore, all RNAs used, natural as well as synthetic, were substrates for the enzyme. Using 5 S rRNA as a substrate it was confirmed that the enzyme is an endonuclease. The final products of the reaction of this enzyme are 5'-mononucleotides. The molecular weight of the enzyme is about 120,000 and it seems to contain two subunits which are similar in size. These properties thus differentiate this enzyme from all other known ribonucleases in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W1545024641,"The influence of cold exposure at 4 degrees C for different periods of time (from 12 h to 42 days) on the allosteric inhibition by F- of the rat erythrocyte membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase from rat fed a corn oil diet was studied. The cold exposure decreased the values of the Hill coefficient n from 1.6 to 1.0. When the cold-exposed rat was transferred from the cold environment to 23 degrees C, the values of n reached the control values. The factors that play in the allosteric desensitization phenomenon were characterized as L-triiodothyronine, L-thyroxine, and thyrotropin. The relationship betwen changes in the values of n and physiological concentrations of thyroid hormones and thyrotropin in cold-exposed rat is shown. Thyrotropin showed a facilitatory action on the blocking action of thyroxine on the triiodothyronine effect. The intravenous injection of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) yields confirmatory results for this regulatory mechanism since the values of n for acetylcholinesterase shifted as predicted."

https://openalex.org/W1487611454,"The precise alterations in the protein amino acid sequences of the immunoglobulin heavy chains of spontaneously arisen MOPC 21 mutant clones IF2 and IF1 have been determined. All the cyanogen bromide fra-ments of both heavy chains have been isolated and compared to the wild type CNBr fragments. For IF2, there is an internal deletion, from the wild type sequence, of 96 amino acids, from residues 121 to 215 inclusive. Moreover, in IF2, there are no disulfide bonds formed between heavy and light chains, presumably because of the deletion of the CH1 pseudosubunit. There are no other alterations in its covalent structure. For IF1, there is a deletion of the COOH-terminal 83 amino acids (residues 358 to 440, inclusive). Although IF1 heavy chain behaves on dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gels as if it were only 10 to 15 residues shorter than wild type, no other amino acid sequence differences from wild type are found. IF1 arose most likely by a nonsense mutation of a serine codon. For IF2, whose deletion is like that seen in some human heavy chain disease proteins, the most likely explanation is an error of recombination. The structure of IF2 suggests that the heavy chain variable region ends at a position homologous to residue 120 of the MOPC 21 heavy chain."
