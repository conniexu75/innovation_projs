https://openalex.org/W2014957672,"Using a multiround version of an economic exchange (trust game), we report that reciprocity expressed by one player strongly predicts future trust expressed by their partner—a behavioral finding mirrored by neural responses in the dorsal striatum. Here, analyses within and between brains revealed two signals—one encoded by response magnitude, and the other by response timing. Response magnitude correlated with the “intention to trust” on the next play of the game, and the peak of these “intention to trust” responses shifted its time of occurrence by 14 seconds as player reputations developed. This temporal transfer resembles a similar shift of reward prediction errors common to reinforcement learning models, but in the context of a social exchange. These data extend previous model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies into the social domain and broaden our view of the spectrum of functions implemented by the dorsal striatum."

To investigate the role of the classical Wnt signaling pathway in osteogenesis, we generated mice lacking the β-catenin or adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) genes in osteoblasts. Loss of β-catenin produced severe osteopenia with striking increases in osteoclasts, whereas constitutive activation of β-catenin in the conditional Apc mutants resulted in dramatically increased bone deposition and a disappearance of osteoclasts. In vitro, osteoblasts lacking the β-catenin gene exhibited impaired maturation and mineralization with elevated expression of the osteoclast differentiation factor, receptor activated by nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), and diminished expression of the RANKL decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin. By contrast, Apc-deficient osteoblasts matured normally but demonstrated decreased expression of RANKL and increased osteoprotegerin. These findings suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts coordinates postnatal bone acquisition by controlling the differentiation and activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

Activation of the “canonical” pathway involves the stabilization of cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin. The main function of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) 2The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; OPG, osteoprotegerin; μCT, microcomputed tomography; RANKL, receptor activated by nuclear factor-κB ligand; RT, reverse transcription; OC, osteocalcin.2The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; OPG, osteoprotegerin; μCT, microcomputed tomography; RANKL, receptor activated by nuclear factor-κB ligand; RT, reverse transcription; OC, osteocalcin. protein appears to be the normal degradation of β-catenin. In the absence of APC, β-catenin levels are elevated, which ultimately contributes to increased proliferation (11Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This pathway requires either LRP5 or LRP6 for activity (6He X. Semenov M. Tamai K. Zeng X. Development. 2004; 131: 1663-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), but LRP5 and LRP6 may have other cellular functions that are not directly related to regulation of Wnt signaling. For example, mice lacking LRP5 display defects in cholesterol and glucose metabolism (12Fujino T. Asaba H. Kang M.J. Ikeda Y. Sone H. Takada S. Kim D.H. Ioka R.X. Ono M. Tomoyori H. Okubo M.

A. 2003; 100: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the bone defects seen in humans and mice lacking the Lrp5 gene are due solely to defects in Wnt signaling or if other downstream signaling cascades are involved. In this work, we have shown that osteoblast-specific deletion of the β-catenin gene leads to early onset, severe osteoporosis and is associated with defective osteoblast differentiation in vitro. In contrast, loss of Apc leads to early onset, severe osteopetrosis leading to lethality early in life. Interestingly, we show that these osteoblast-specific deletions are associated with alterations in the regulation of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activated by nuclear factor-κ B ligand (RANKL) and with altered osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Thus, this work provides the first genetic evidence that dysregulation of β-catenin in osteoblasts leads to defects in bone development and supplies the first link between Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts and functional alterations of the osteoclast regulated by the OPG/RANKL signaling axis.

All experiments performed were in compliance with the guiding principles of the “Care and Use of Animals” available at www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html and approved prior to use by the Van Andel Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Genotype Analysis—DNA was prepared from tail biopsies using an AutoGenprep 960 automated DNA isolation system. PCR-based strategies were then used to genotype these mice (details available upon request). Demineralized Bone Histology—Tissue samples were fixed in formalin overnight, decalcified in Immunocal decalcifying agent (Decal, Baltimore, MD) overnight, and then dehydrated through a graded alcohol series in a Ventana Renaissance processor (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Tissues were paraffin-embedded, and 5-μm sections were adhered to glass slides. Slides were de-paraffinized and stained with hematoxylon and eosin or left unstained for immunohistochemistry. Mineralized Bone Histology—Femurs were fixed in ethanol at room temperature, dehydrated, and embedded in methylmethacrylate. 3-μm sections were cut with a Microm microtome and stained with modified Mason-Goldner trichrome stain. The number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts per bone perimeter were measured at standardized sites under the growth plate using a semiautomatic method (Osteoplan II; Kontron, Munich, Germany) at a magnification of ×200. These parameters comply with guidelines of the nomenclature committee of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (13Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar). Osteoblast Isolation and Culture—Osteoblasts were isolated from calvaria of newborn mice by serial digestion in α-minimal essential medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), 0.7 mg/ml collagenase type 2 (Worthington), and 1 mm CaCl2. Calvaria were digested for 15 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. The digestion solution was collected, washed with fresh medium, and digested an additional five times. Digestions 3–6 (containing the osteoblasts) were centrifuged, washed with α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% pen/strep, and plated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the cells were trypsinized and 1.1 × 105 cells were plated on 6-cm dishes. The medium was supplemented with 5 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma) (mineralization medium), which was replaced every other day. Immunohistochemistry—β-Catenin was detected in cells using a mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) at a 1:100 dilution. The signal was detected with the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Vector Labs). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Von Kossa Staining—Cultures were maintained in differentiation medium for the days indicated and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The cells were washed with water, dehydrated, and allowed to air dry. Silver nitrate (2%) was added to the cells for 20 min. The cells were washed with water and then incubated with 5% sodium carbonate for 3 min. Microcomputed Tomography (μCT)—High resolution images of the femur were acquired using a desktop microtomographic imaging system (MicroCT40; Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland). The femur was scanned at 45 keV with an isotropic voxel size of 6 μm, and the resulting two-dimensional cross-sectional images are shown in gray scale. Scanning was started in the mid-epiphysis and extended proximally for ∼3.6 mm (600 CT slices/specimen). OPG Serum Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Serum was collected from animals, and serum OPG levels were quantitated using the mouse OPG/TNFSRSF11B immunoassay according to the manufacturer's specifications (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—mRNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction protocol. Briefly, the cells were homogenized in TRIzol and mRNA was extracted using chloroform. The RNA was precipitated by isopropanol, and 5 μg of mRNA was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using an Invitrogen superscript cDNA synthesis kit. RNA controls and reverse transcription controls were used for all reactions. First strand cDNA was amplified using the sequence-specific primer sets listed below at the indicated annealing temperatures (30 cycles), and the products were resolved on 1–2% agarose gels. 1-kb or 100-bp ladders (Invitrogen) were used as markers. Primers used were: OPG, (5′-GTGAAGCAGGAGTGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCAAACTGTGTTTCGCTC-3′ at 54 °C annealing temperature); RANKL, (5′-TGTACTTTCGAGCGCAGATG-3′ and 5′-ACATCCAACCATGAGCCTTC-3′ at 59 °C); osteocalcin, (5′-CAAGTCCCACACAGCAGCTT-3′ and 5′-AAAGCCGAGCTGCCAGAGTT-3′ at 58 °C); Runx-2, (5′-CCAAATTTGCCTAACAGAATG-3′ and 5′-GAGGCTGTGGTTTCAAAGCA-3′ at 56 °C); and β-actin (5′-CTGAACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTG-3′ and 5′-GGCATACAGGGACAGCACAGCC-3′ at 56 °C).

Previous analysis of the OC-cre strain via crossing it to strains carrying cre reporter transgenes indicated that expression of cre recombinase was specific to cells of the osteoblast lineage with no detectable expression or function in other cell lineages (20Zhang M.

Consistent with its role in mediating β-catenin degradation (11Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), deletion of Apc was associated with significantly elevated levels of β-catenin as assessed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1, b and c). By 1 week of age mice homozygous for either mutation could be identified by their reduced size (Fig. 1, d–g). OC-cre;β-catenin-flox/flox (Δβ-catenin, or Δβ-cat) mice died within 5 weeks (Fig. 1h). Growth retardation was even more severe in the OC-cre;Apc-flox/flox (ΔAPC) mice (Fig. 1g), and these mice generally succumbed within 2 weeks (Fig. 1i). At weaning, only 75% of the expected number of Δβ-catenin mice and only 10% of the expected number of ΔAPC mice were identified (Fig. 1, h and i). No defects in the incisors were observed either grossly or histologically, and the teeth erupted normally in both mutants (data not shown). The cause of the postnatal lethality in these mutant mice is currently unclear but is certainly not because of aberrant expression of the osteocalcin promoter in extraosseous tissues (20Zhang M. Xuan S. Bouxsein M.L. von Stechow D. Akeno N. Faugere M.C. Malluche H. Zhao G. Rosen C.J. Efstratiadis A. Clemens T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44005-44012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Importantly, mice carrying osteoblast-specific deletions of both the Apc and β-catenin genes (ΔAPC/Δβ-catenin) display growth and survival characteristics similar to those lacking only the β-catenin gene (data not shown), suggesting that the severe phenotype induced by loss of Apc is due to dysregulation of β-catenin signaling. Δβ-Catenin and ΔAPC Mice Have Dramatic Defects in Bone Development—Analysis of femurs from Δβ-catenin mice by μCT revealed striking reductions in both the trabecular and cortical bone compartments (Fig. 2, a and b). In contrast, analysis of ΔAPC mice revealed a significant accumulation of bone matrix in the femur, to the point where the marrow space was almost completely filled (Fig. 2, d and e). Bone in the metaphyseal region was poorly mineralized, whereas osteoid in the diaphysis was more completely mineralized and entirely filled the marrow cavity. μCT images of femurs from ΔAPC/Δβ-catenin mice were similar to those seen in Δβ-catenin mice, again suggesting that loss of APC induced phenotypes in a β-catenin-dependent manner (Fig. 2c). Examination of undecalcified sections from tibia of the Δβ-catenin mice disclosed a dramatic reduction in mineralized cortical and trabecular bone (Fig. 3, a–d), consistent with changes observed by μCT. By contrast, the ΔAPC mice had dramatically increased bone deposition associated with disturbances in bone architecture and composition (Fig. 3, e–h). For example, the growth plate of ΔAPC mice lacked a secondary ossification center and was misshapen (Fig. 3g), possibly because of the rapid rate of bone formation and the lack of osteoclasts (see below) that would normally function to shape the ends of the bone. Further analysis of decalcified bone sections from 4-week-old Δβ-catenin and 2-week-old ΔAPC mice showed marked abnormalities in all bone examined, including vertebrae, long bones, and calvaria (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Histological analysis of decalcified bone from Δβ-catenin and ΔAPC mice. a, d, and g, femur; b, e, and h, vertebrae; c, f, and i, skull from 32-day-old Δβ-catenin (a–c) and ΔAPC (g–i) mice as compared with age-matched (d–f) control littermates.

Calibration marks are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Dysregulation of β-Catenin on Osteoblast Differentiation in Vitro—To examine the cellular mechanisms responsible for these disturbances in the mutant mice, we studied the effect of conditional deletion of the β-catenin and Apc genes in calvarial osteoblasts in vitro. Cells derived from mice carrying the floxed alleles were infected with adenovirus expressing the cre recombinase (Cre+) or a control adenovirus directing the expression of green fluorescent protein (Cre–) and then differentiated in the presence of β-glycerol phosphate and ascorbate (mineralizing medium). No obvious qualitative differences in proliferation rates or osteoblast density were observed in osteoblasts mutant for either gene (data not shown). However, consistent with the osteopenic phenotype of the Δβ-catenin mice, osteoblasts deficient in β-catenin showed delayed and diminished expression of osteocalcin as well as a marked reduction in calcified nodule formation (von Kossa staining). Interestingly, Runx-2 expression levels were similar in control and β-catenin osteoblasts (Fig. 5a), suggesting that early events in the osteoblast differentiation program (21Karsenty G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2731-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) do not depend on signaling through β-catenin. In contrast, ΔAPC osteoblasts appeared to mature and mineralize normally in vitro, although osteocalcin expression levels increased somewhat prematurely as compared with controls (Fig. 5b). It appears, therefore, that excess β-catenin signaling does not severely impact the ability of osteoblasts to differentiate, at least in vitro. Thus, the more dramatic effects of disruption of the β-catenin gene observed in vivo may be due to non-cell autonomous functions of APC in osteoblasts. Dysregulation of β-Catenin in Osteoblasts Is Associated with Abnormal Osteoclastogenesis—Initial histological analysis (Fig. 3) suggested a disturbance in osteoclastogenesis in both mutants. Indeed, quantitation of osteoclasts in representative long bone sections showed that osteoclast numbers were dramatically increased in the Δβ-catenin mutants but entirely absent in the ΔAPC mice (Fig. 6a). In addition, osteoblasts were dramatically decreased in Δβ-catenin mutants at 4 weeks of age and were absent in ΔAPC mice at 2 weeks of age (data not shown). However, the dramatic deposition of osteoid material in ΔAPC mice suggests they were present at an earlier age. These findings suggested that dysregulated β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts not only causes cell-autonomous osteoblast defects but can also impact bone resorption by altering the numbers of osteoclasts. To explore this possibility further, we measured the expression of RANKL, the major osteoclast differentiation factor, and the osteoclast inhibitory factor, OPG (22Hofbauer L.C. Schoppet M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2004; 292: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In Δβ-catenin osteoblasts, OPG mRNA expression was decreased compared with controls after 5 and 10 days of differentiation in mineralization medium, whereas RANKL expression was increased (Fig. 6b). The reverse pattern was observed in the ΔAPC osteoblasts (Fig. 6c). In addition, levels of serum OPG in the ΔAPC mice were 3-fold higher than controls (Fig. 6d). Serum OPG levels were similar to controls in both Δβ-catenin and ΔAPC/Δβ-catenin mice (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that alterations in β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts brought about by each mutation lead to marked disturbances in osteoclast differentiation. In this study we used conditional mutagenesis to disrupt selectively the genes encoding β-catenin and Apc in mouse osteoblasts. In both models, osteoblast-specific disruption of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway led to postnatal death. In the case of the ΔAPC mice, we speculate that deficiencies in hematopoiesis may be responsible. As shown, ΔAPC mice develop bone in which the vast majority of the marrow component is absent. In other situations where osteopetrosis is observed in humans and mice, it is often accompanied with hepatosplenomegaly associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis. Interestingly, despite severe osteopetrosis, we have not observed any evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis in these mice. Importantly, mice carrying osteoblast-specific deletions of both the Apc and the β-catenin genes are phenotypically similar to those lacking only the β-catenin gene (Fig. 2), suggesting that the majority of the phenotype induced by loss of APC is because of dysregulated β-catenin signaling. In the case of Δβ-catenin mice, we occasionally observe animals with paralysis, consistent with osteoporotic-related fractures, accounting for some portion of the lethality observed. However, we find that many of these animals die very suddenly between 26 and 30 days of age (Fig. 1) without prior evidence of paralysis. One explanation is that catastrophic fractures may occur leading to full paralysis and sudden death. Alternatively, defects in hematopoietic cell regulation or other systemic defects may play a role. The skeletal phenotypes observed in these mice allow two important conclusions regarding the role of Wnt signaling in skeletal development. First, Wnt signaling controls postnatal bone acquisition by determining β-catenin levels in osteoblasts, and the previously identified alterations in bone mass in humans carrying mutations in LRP5 (1Gong Y.

However, it is important to note that the bone phenotypes resulting from inactivation of osteoblast β-catenin signaling, although consistent with the alterations seen in patients carrying mutations in LRP5, were more severe. One explanation for this difference is the potential role of LRP6 in β-catenin regulation in osteoblasts. We speculate that the continued presence of LRP6 in the context of LRP5 deficiency allows residual Wnt signaling through β-catenin. In agreement with this idea, we (23Holmen S.L. Giambernardi T.A. Zylstra C.R. Buckner-Berghuis B.D. Resau J.H. Hess J.F. Glatt V. Bouxsein M.L. Ai M. Warman W.W. Williams B.O. J. Bone Min. Res. 2004; 19: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (24Kelly O.G. Pinson K.I. Skarnes W.C. Development. 2004; 131: 2803-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have shown that mice carrying mutations in both Lrp5 and Lrp6 show synergistic defects in bone development. In an alternative model, functions of β-catenin independent of Wnt signaling contribute to the observed phenotype. For example, β-catenin also plays a key role in mediating cell-cell adhesion through its interaction with E-cadherin (25Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is a single-pass transmembrane protein that forms homotypic dimers with E-cadherin proteins expressed on adjacent cells (25Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). The intracellular portion of E-cadherin binds directly to either β-catenin or the related plakoglobin protein, which then associates with α-catenin. The association of α-catenin with the actin cytoskeleton completes the coupling of cell-cell adhesion to the cytoskeleton. Although some studies have suggested that plakoglobin and β-catenin are interchangeable in mediating these cell adhesion complexes (26Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), it is possible that loss of β-catenin could also affect cell-cell adhesion in osteoblasts. However, the fact that ΔAPC mice exhibit the converse phenotype suggests that the functions of β-catenin in canonical Wnt signaling underlie the observed phenotypes. Also, our observations that mice carrying osteoblast-specific mutations in both Apc and β-catenin genes have phenotypes similar to those seen in mice mutant for only the β-catenin gene suggests that the osteopetrosis seen in ΔAPC animals is due to dysregulation of β-catenin signaling. A more definitive picture of the role of cadherin-mediated adhesion in osteoblast differentiation may be provided by creating mice carrying osteoblast-specific knockouts of the α-catenin gene. This will disrupt cadherin-based adhesion in osteoblasts without directly affecting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The second conclusion from our studies is that β-catenin signaling in the mature osteoblast controls postnatal bone acquisition through both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. Thus, β-catenin signaling may not be required for the initial commitment of cells to the osteoblast lineage, based on Runx2 expression (3Kato M. Patel M.S. Levasseur R. Lobov I. Chang B.H.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2731-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but appears to be essential for the performance of the more mature osteoblast (e.g. osteocalcin expression and mineralization) (27Aronow M.A. Gerstenfeld L.C.

Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). However, the marked alterations in osteoclast numbers and reciprocal patterns of expression of OPG and RANKL in the context of dysregulated β-catenin signaling suggest that non-cell autonomous effects on osteoclast progenitors also impact overall bone acquisition. Further support for this latter effect has come from a recent report indicating that the OPG gene may be a direct transcriptional target for complexes containing the β-catenin protein (10Jackson A. Vayssiere B. Garcia T. Newell W. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. Rawadi G. Bone. 2005; 36: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These combined effects of Wnt signaling through the canonical pathway in mature osteoblasts are therefore critical in the control of normal bone acquisition, and this pathway represents a plausible pharmaceutical target for treating osteoporosis and other bone disorders.

We identified a signaling complex where TK interacts with the zinc-finger protein nbr1 through a mechanically inducible conformation. Nbr1 targets the ubiquitin-associated p62/SQSTM1 to sarcomeres, and p62 in turn interacts with MuRF2, a muscle-specific RING-B-box E3 ligase and ligand of the transactivation domain of the serum response transcription factor (SRF). Nuclear translocation of MuRF2 was induced by mechanical inactivity and caused reduction of nuclear SRF and repression of transcription. A human mutation in the titin protein kinase domain causes hereditary muscle disease by disrupting this pathway."

This approach is potentially the basis of a simple low-cost system that can provide substantially higher fuel efficiency by using excess fuel-cell heat for the endothermic reforming reaction."

Each NtpK subunit has four transmembrane α helices, with a sodium ion bound between helices 2 and 4 at a site buried deeply in the membrane that includes the essential residue glutamate-139.

CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a cell surface receptor that has been shown to mediate the metastasis of many solid tumors including lung, breast, kidney, and prostate. In addition, overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with the majority of NSCLC and has been implicated in the process of malignant transformation by promoting cell proliferation, cell survival, and motility. Here we show for the first time that activation of the EGFR by EGF increases CXCR4 expression and the migratory capacity of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, many solid tumors are associated with low oxygen tension, and when NSCLC cells were cultured with EGF under hypoxic conditions, CXCR4 expression was dramatically enhanced. A molecular analysis of these events indicated that augmented CXCR4 expression was regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PTEN/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signal transduction pathway, activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α, and ultimately HIF-1-dependent transcription of the CXCR4 gene. Thus, a combination of low oxygen tension and overexpression of EGFR within the primary tumor of NSCLC may provide the microenvironmental signals necessary to upregulate CXCR4 expression and promote metastasis.

The virulence of this cancer is mediated in part by the specific and aggressive metastatic pattern of primary neoplastic cells to regional lymph nodes, liver, adrenal glands, contralateral lung, brain, and the bone marrow (1Fidler I.J.

In this respect, we and others have now demonstrated that the metastatic propensity of tumors from several different types of cancer including lung, breast, ovarian, renal, and prostate is related to the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (5Muller A.

In fact, in human NSCLC-SCID mouse chimera we have observed that the neoplastic cells present at the sites of the secondary metastases express dramatically up-regulated levels of this chemokine receptor in comparison with the cancerous cells present in the primary tumor (11Phillips R.J.

Furthermore, in both NSCLC and breast cancer it has been shown that the ligand for CXCR4, CXCL12, exhibited peak levels of expression in organs that were the preferred destination for their respective metastases (5Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A.

Moreover, when the CXCR4/CXCL12 biological axis was perturbed in these systems using either neutralizing anti-CXCR4 or neutralizing anti-CXCL12 antibodies, the host metastatic burden was significantly reduced, whereas the size of the primary tumor was unaffected (5Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A.

Thus, it appears that the normal physiology of CXCR4 and CXCL12 has been usurped by several different types of cancer to promote the specific metastasis of neoplastic cells to distant organs. Tumors such as NSCLC typically require neovascularization to mediate growth and promote metastasis, yet paradoxically the most malignant tumors have been found to prosper under conditions of low oxygen tension or hypoxia (13Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 14Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar, 15Semenza G.L.

This paradox occurs because the tumor vasculature is structurally and functionally abnormal, resulting in perfusion that is characterized by marked spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Thus tumor progression requires an increased adaptation to hypoxia, and the master switch that appears to regulate this phenomenon is the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (14Semenza G.L.

Indeed, an extensive body of work has already shown that HIF-1 regulates the transcription of several gene clusters that are crucial to tumor progression including angiogenesis, cell survival, glucose metabolism, and invasion/metastasis (14Semenza G.L.

HIF-1 is a heterodimer comprising a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit and a highly regulated HIF-1α subunit (14Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev.

Classically, ambient oxygen tension regulates the rate at which HIF-1α protein is degraded; under normoxic conditions specific proline residues in the HIF-1α protein are hydroxylated, facilitating the binding of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein (22Jaakkola P.

VHL is the recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and ubiquination of HIF-1α targets the protein for rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. By contrast, under hypoxic conditions the rates of proline hydroxylation decreases, thus preventing the binding of VHL to HIF-1α and promoting HIF-1-mediated transcription of target genes (13Vogelstein B.

Oxygen-independent regulation of HIF-1α has also been shown to occur, although this is thought to be cell type-specific.

Neckers L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2115-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jung Y. Isaacs J.S. Lee S. Trepel J. Liu Z.G. Neckers L. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In an effort to address the mechanisms governing the upregulation of CXCR4 in NSCLC we have used an in vitro model system to study this pivotal chemokine receptor. Our data indicate that exposure of NSCLC cells to hypoxia or EGF results in a significant up-regulation of CXCR4 expression and chemotactic behavior. In addition, both hypoxia and EGF activate HIF-1α, and this in turn increases transcription at the CXCR4 promoter. The PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 and the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, inhibit activation of HIF-1α and, hence, up-regulation of CXCR4 expression. Moreover, introduction of wild type PTEN into NSCLC cells also inhibits hypoxia-induced up-regulation of CXCR4 expression. Taken together, therefore, these data suggest that dys-regulated signal transduction through the PI 3-kinase pathway in NSCLC leads to activation of HIF-1α, up-regulation of CXCR4, and increased metastatic potential. Human NSCLC Cell Lines—The H157 and A549 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Whitaker Biomedical Products, Whitaker, CA) together with 1 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS (RPMI complete media). Before assay the cells were transferred to RPMI starvation media, which comprises 1 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, and 1% FCS or 0.25% human serum albumin. Where applicable the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 (20–50 mm), wortmannin (100–250 nm), and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (10 ng/ml) were preincubated with cells for 2 h before exposure to hypoxia and stimulation with EGF (20 ng/ml). RNA Isolation and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from both A549 and H157 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and by following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed in TRIzol and then mixed with chloroform. The lysate was then centrifuged to separate RNA, DNA, and protein. Total RNA was recovered, precipitated with isopropanol, washed in 75% ethanol to remove impurities and finally dissolved in water. Next, 1.5 μg of RNA was taken and DNase-treated to remove contaminating DNA before reverse transcription to cDNA using a ProSTAR first strand reverse transcription-PCR kit (Stratagene) and by following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the cDNA was assayed for changes in CXCR4 expression by real-time PCR using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector and SDS analysis software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (34Belperio J.A. Dy M. Burdick M.D. Xue Y.Y. Li K. Elias J.A. Keane M.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Antibody Staining and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis— Cells from each cell line were taken and resuspended in ice-cold staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% FCS plus 0.1% sodium azide) and incubated with Fc block for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CXCR4 antibodies or the appropriate isotype control at 4 °C for 20 min, after which time they were washed twice with staining buffer. Samples were finally analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cellquest 3.2.1f1 software. Hypoxia Treatment and Extract Preparation—Cells were cultured to a density of ∼80% in complete media and then transferred to starvation media. Next, A549 and H157 cells were exposed to either normoxia (ambient oxygen tension) or hypoxia (94% nitrogen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1% oxygen) in Modular Incubator Chambers (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA) for the times indicated. Subsequently, whole cell extracts or nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of A549 and H157 cells were prepared. Briefly, whole cell extract lysis buffer was composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA plus a panel of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, and NaF at 1 mm; aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and β-glycerophosphate at 10 μg/ml). Buffer A for extraction of cytoplasmic fractions was composed of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA (plus the above panel of protease and phosphatase inhibitors), and buffer C for extraction of the nuclear fraction was composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (plus the protease and phosphatase inhibitors described above). Western Blotting—Immunoblotting was performed on 40 μg of total protein from either whole cell or nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. After SDS-PAGE the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 100 V for 1 h at room temperature and then blocked in BLOTTO for 30 min. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either a mouse anti-human HIF1-α (1:500; BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-human CXCR4 (1:500; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), or rabbit anti-human phospho-AKT (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Subsequently, the blots were washed in Tween-Tris buffered saline and then incubated with either donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. After washing in Tween-Tris buffered saline (×3, 15 min each wash), the immunoreactive proteins were finally visualized using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and by following the manufacturer's instructions. To demonstrate equal loading of each lane, the membranes were then reprobed with a GAPDH antibody (1:500; Abcon) or total AKT antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Chemotaxis—A549 cells and H157 cells previously exposed to either hypoxia or normoxia for 24 h were harvested by trypsinization, counted, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FCS at a concentration of 106/ml. Neuroprobe filters (5-μm diameter) pretreated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin and 12-well chemotaxis chambers were used for these assays. CXCL12 (30 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added to the lower wells, and 105 cells were added to each of the upper wells. The chemotaxis chambers were then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. After fixing in methanol and staining in 2% toluidine blue, the number of cells that had migrated through to the underside of the filters was calculated by counting the total number of cells in 5 separate fields of view under 400× magnification. In similar experiments A549 cells were either left untreated or pretreated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm; Upstate Biotechnology) and LY294002 (20 μm; Cell Signal Technology) for 2 h before chemotactic analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A549 cells were either exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 6 h, and then nuclear extracts were prepared. Oligonucleotide probes for HIF-1α were generated by 5′ end labeling of the sense strand with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Subsequently, labeled wild type (WT; 5′-agcttGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCAg-3′) and mutant (M; 5′-agcttGCCCTAAAAGCTGTCTCAg-3′) probes (20Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) were purified using the MER-maid kit (Bio 101 Systems, Irvine, CA) and by following the manufacturer's instructions. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 μg of nuclear extract and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. Probe (5 × 104 cpm) was then added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before loading onto a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 175 volts in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA (TBE), pH 8.3 (1× TBE composed of 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 5 mm EDTA), at 4 °C for 3 h. Gels were then vacuum-dried and exposed to film with intensifying screens for 24 h. Excess (100 fold) unlabeled WT oligonucleotide was preincubated with the reaction mixture for 15 min before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP WT probe. Transient Transfections—A549 and H157 cells were cultured to a density of ∼80% in complete media in 6-well plates. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) and by following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2.5 μg of either WT- or C124S-PTEN constructs (35Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) were mixed with 4 μl of Lipofectamine and 1 ml of Opti-MEM media for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, this mixture was added to the NSCLC cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Finally, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS (H157 cells) or RPMI1640 plus 10% FCS (A549 cells). The cells were then cultured for 24 h and 37 °C before exposure to normoxia or hypoxia for a further 24 h. Upon exposure to normoxia or hypoxia, cultures were returned to media containing only 1% FCS. Subsequently, RNA was prepared and subjected to real-time PCR analysis of CXCR4 expression as described above. In similar experiments A549 and H157 cells were cotransfected with a 2.6-kilobase sequence of either the WT-CXCR4 promoter (36Schioppa T. Uranchimeg B. Saccani A. Biswas S.K. Doni A. Rapisarda A.

A GFP construct was used to equalize the DNA transfection load. The cells were then cultured for 48 h and 37 °C before analysis. After the 48-h incubation period, cell extracts were made using the luciferase reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Each lysate was subsequently assayed in the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions; luciferase activity was determined using a Monolight series 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and then normalized to the Renilla control. Statistical Analysis—Comparisons were evaluated by Student's unpaired t test. Results were considered statistically significant if p values were 0.05 or less. Hypoxia Promotes Up-regulation of CXCR4 Expression in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cells—We have previously shown that up-regulation of CXCR4 expression is a key component in the metastasis of NSCLC cells in vivo (11Phillips R.J. Burdick M.D. Lutz M. Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Strieter R.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms that regulate expression of this chemokine receptor are unclear. Initial evidence in other cancerous cells has indicated that hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation may be involved (10Staller P. Sulitkova J. Lisztwan J. Moch H. Oakeley E.J. Krek W. Nature. 2003; 425: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 36Schioppa T. Uranchimeg B. Saccani A. Biswas S.K. Doni A. Rapisarda A. Bernasconi S. Saccani S. Nebuloni M. Vago L. Mantovani A. Melillo G. Sica A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). To address this phenomenon in non-small cell lung cancer, therefore, we exposed tumor cells (cultured in RPMI starvation media) to a hypoxic environment (94% N2, 5% CO2, 1% O2) and performed a kinetic analysis to examine changes in CXCR4 expression and function (Fig. 1). Using real-time PCR, our data revealed that the expression of CXCR4 mRNA was strongly elevated in hypoxia-exposed A549 and H157 NSCLC cells by 6 h when compared with the normoxic control (Fig. 1A). This expression remained elevated until at least 24 h (Fig. 1A). Next, we wanted to determine whether the increase in CXCR4 mRNA correlated with an increase in protein levels of CXCR4. We examined this both at the level of intracellular expression (Fig. 1B) and cell surface expression (Fig. 1C). Our results indicated that NSCLC cells exposed to hypoxia showed a significant increase in intracellular CXCR4 protein levels when compared with the normoxic control by 6 h, and these levels remained elevated until at least 24 h (Fig. 1B). Indeed, by 24 h both A549 cells and H157 cells showed significantly greater expression of CXCR4 at the cell surface (Fig. 1C). To determine whether this increased expression of CXCR4 was functional, we performed chemotaxis assays (Fig. 1D). Here, NSCLC cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 24 h and then treated with CXCL12 for 6 h. Although both A549 and H157 cells demonstrated chemotactic behavior in response to CXCL12 under normoxic conditions, the magnitude of these responses was dramatically enhanced in those cells exposed to hypoxia for 24 h (Fig. 1D). Thus, we have demonstrated that hypoxia not only increases expression of CXCR4 on NSCLC cells but also enhances the migratory ability of these cells in response to CXCL12. Hypoxia Activates HIF-1α Expression in NSCLC Cells and Promotes HIF-1-mediated Transcription at the CXCR4 Promoter—Having established that a physiological event such as hypoxia is capable of up-regulating CXCR4 expression in NSCLC cells, we next wanted to examine the underlying biochemistry that mediates this phenomenon. It has been well established that hypoxia regulates the expression of HIF-1α, which is a key component of the transcription factor HIF-1 (14Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar, 15Semenza G.L. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). And HIF-1 itself is thought to regulate the transcription of several gene clusters crucial to tumor progression including angiogenesis, cell survival, glucose metabolism, and invasion/metastasis (13Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 14Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar, 18Hanahan D.

Thus, we exposed A549 cells and H157 cells to normoxia or hypoxia for the times indicated and then examined intranuclear HIF-1α expression by Western analysis (Fig. 2A). Under normoxic conditions little or no intranuclear expression of HIF-1α was observed. This is in keeping with known data, which has suggested that under normal ambient conditions the tumor suppressor gene, VHL, binds to HIF-1α and targets it for degradation (22Jaakkola P. Mole D.R.

Under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, household indoor air pollution will cause an estimated 9.8 million premature deaths by the year 2030. Gradual and rapid transitions to charcoal would delay 1.0 million and 2.8 million deaths, respectively; similar transitions to petroleum fuels would delay 1.3 million and 3.7 million deaths. Cumulative BAU GHG emissions will be 6.7 billion tons of carbon by 2050, which is 5.6% of Africa's total emissions. Large shifts to the use of fossil fuels would reduce GHG emissions by 1 to 10%. Charcoal-intensive future scenarios using current practices increase emissions by 140 to 190%; the increase can be reduced to 5 to 36% using currently available technologies for sustainable production or potentially reduced even more with investment in technological innovation."

https://openalex.org/W1999500196,"Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB after engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Recent reports have elucidated a signaling pathway that involves the protein kinase C (PKC), the scaffold protein CARD11 (also called CARMA-1), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein Bcl10, and the paracaspase (protease related to caspases) MALT1 as critical intermediates linking the TCR to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. However, the events proximal to the TCR that initiate the activation of this signaling pathway remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has an essential role in this pathway by regulating the activation of PKC and through signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC and CARD11 to lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC recruits the IKK complex, whereas PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex, thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit known as NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modifier). Hence, PDK1 plays a critical role by nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway in T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2165360974,"The phloem network is as essential for plants as the vascular system is for humans. This network, assembled by nucleus- and vacuole-free interconnected living cells, represents a long distance transport pathway for nutrients and information. According to the Münch hypothesis, osmolytes such as sucrose generate the hydrostatic pressure that drives nutrient and water flow between the source and the sink phloem (Münch, E. (1930) Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze, Gustav Fischer, Jena, Germany). Although proton-coupled sucrose carriers have been localized to the sieve tube and the companion cell plasma membrane of both source and sink tissues, knowledge of the molecular representatives and the mechanism of the sucrose phloem efflux is still scant. We expressed ZmSUT1, a maize sucrose/proton symporter, in Xenopus oocytes and studied the transport characteristics of the carrier by electrophysiological methods. Using the patch clamp techniques in the giant inside-out patch mode, we altered the chemical and electrochemical gradient across the sucrose carrier and analyzed the currents generated by the proton flux. Thereby we could show that ZmSUT1 is capable of mediating both the sucrose uptake into the phloem in mature leaves (source) as well as the desorption of sugar from the phloem vessels into heterotrophic tissues (sink). As predicted from a perfect molecular machine, the ZmSUT1-mediated sucrose-coupled proton current was reversible and depended on the direction of the sucrose and pH gradient as well as the membrane potential across the transporter.

As predicted from a perfect molecular machine, the ZmSUT1-mediated sucrose-coupled proton current was reversible and depended on the direction of the sucrose and pH gradient as well as the membrane potential across the transporter. To ensure adequate partitioning of sucrose throughout the plant body, sucrose has to be translocated from the mesophyll cells to the sieve element-companion cell complex. Because of the energy-dependent sucrose/H+ symporter in apoplasmic loading plant species, the transport sugar accumulates at concentrations of several hundred mm to >1 molar in the conducting vascular cells. The hydrostatic pressure difference between source and sink tissues drives the mass flow of water and nutrients in the phloem vessels (1Münch E. Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze. Gustav Fischer, Jena, Germany1930Google Scholar). In sink tissues, which are dependent on carbon supply via the phloem, a symplasmic unloading of sucrose along its concentration gradient has been shown for many plant species (2Lalonde S. Tegeder M. Throne-Holst M. Frommer W.B. Patrick J.W. Plant Cell Environ. 2003; 26: 37-56Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, sucrose/H+ symporter transcripts and proteins have also been localized in sink tissues, suggesting a role in sink loading/retrieval or unloading of sucrose via these transporters (see Ref. 2Lalonde S. Tegeder M. Throne-Holst M. Frommer W.B. Patrick J.W. Plant Cell Environ. 2003; 26: 37-56Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar for review). SUT1 from the potato, for example, has been detected in the sieve elements of mature source leaves as well as in developing sink leaves, roots (3Kühn C. Franceschi V.R. Schulz A. Lemoine R. Frommer W.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1298-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and tubers (4Kühn C. Hajirezaei M.R. Fernie A.R. Roessner-Tunali U. Czechowski T. Hirner B. Frommer W.B.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) could demonstrate the involvement of SUT1 in early tuber development and, thus, phloem unloading. Further evidence for a sucrose export system was added by the localization of sucrose/H+ symporters expressed in symplasmically isolated tissues such as developing embryos (6Tegeder M. Wang X.D. Frommer W.B. Offler C.E. Patrick J.W. Plant J. 1999; 18: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7Weber H. Borisjuk L. Heim U. Sauer N. Wobus U. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and growing pollen tubes (8Lemoine R. Burkle L. Barker L. Sakr S. Kuhn C. Regnacq M. Gaillard C. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore Evert and Russin (1993) could show, for example, that symplasmic unloading in maize is unlikely because of the lack of plasmodesmata in the protophloem and metaphloem of developing leaves (9Evert R.F. Russin W.A. Am. J. Bot. 1993; 80: 1310-1317Crossref Google Scholar). Although proton-coupled sucrose carriers have been localized to the sieve tubes and companion cell plasma membranes of both source and sink tissues, the molecular representatives and mechanism of the sucrose phloem efflux is still scant. In the present study we tested the biophysical properties and thermodynamics of ZmSUT1, a maize sucrose carrier expressed at a high level in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Specific sucrose transport inhibitors are not available, but Xenopus oocytes, like all other creatures apart from plants, do not transport sucrose. Therefore oocytes are well suited for sucrose transport studies. Using this sucrose-insensitive system we could demonstrate that this sugar carrier mediates both sucrose uptake and release. Upon a drop in membrane potential and/or pH gradient, ZmSUT1 would release sucrose from, for example, sink phloem and thus seem to represent the molecular equivalent for the sucrose efflux carrier. Based on our biophysical characterization of ZmSUT1, the “source and sink mode” of this transporter is discussed in respect to in planta phloem loading and unloading conditions. In principle, each individual transporter should be reversible. But, in contrast to the reversible transporters from the animal field and from bacteria that have been described to date, ZmSUT1 is the first that works in both directions under physiological conditions. Aphid Breeding—Aphids of the species Rhopalosiphum padi were bred on barley and maize grown in a climate chamber under a 14-h photoperiod. Experimental Setup—Plant aphid cages were applied to the mature leaves of a 4-week-old potted maize. Aphids feeding on a leaf were dissected from their stylets using a laser as described previously (10Wright J.P. Fisher D.B. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 845-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recording electrodes were brought in contact with the phloem exudate appearing at the cut end of the stylet. The leaf was cut 15 cm proximal to the tip, and the cut end was incubated with artificial pond water containing the reference electrode (silver/silver chloride) and 1 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm sorbitol, and 1 mm MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pHi, internal pH; TEVC, two-electrode voltage clamp. adjusted to pH 6.0 with Tris. Sucrose pulses were applied by perfusion of artificial pond water solution. Phloem potential measurements were recorded according to (10Wright J.P. Fisher D.B.

Two-electrode Voltage Clamp (TEVC) Analysis in Xenopus Oocytes— ZmSUT1 cRNA was prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ RNA transcription kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX).

In TEVC studies, oocytes were perfused with a standard solution containing 30 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 based on Tris/MES buffers for pH values from 5.6 to 8.0 or based on citrate/Tris buffers for the pH values 4.5 and 5.0. The sucrose concentrations and pH values are indicated in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6 (and the corresponding legends) and throughout the text where noted. All solutions were adjusted to 220 mosmol kg-1 using d-sorbitol. Steady state currents were obtained by stepping the membrane potential from the holding potential of 0 mV to a series of 500-ms test pulses from 60 to -130 mV in 10-mV decrements. Difference currents were calculated by subtracting the currents in the absence of sucrose from the currents in its presence. The sucrose-induced steady state currents were measured in respect to ligand concentrations and membrane potential. At each test potential the currents were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation shown in Equation 1, I=ImaxS[S]/([S]+KmS) Eq.1 where the substrate (S) is either [sucrose] or [H+]. These fits yielded in the maximal currents ImaxS for sucrose and ImaxH for H+ and the half-maximal ligand concentrations KmH for H+ and KmS for sucrose.Fig. 3Voltage-, sucrose-, and pH-dependence of ZmSUT1. A, steady-state, sugar-dependent, inward currents (mean ± S.D.; n = 4) at different potentials at pH 5.6 were plotted as a function of the external sucrose concentration. Steady-state currents (currents in the absence of sucrose were subtracted) were normalized to the current induced by 10 mm sucrose and a membrane potential of -100 mV. Curves were fitted with a Michaelis-Menten function. B, apparent affinity constants of ZmSUT1 KmS (deduced from panel A) as a function of the membrane potential. KmS decreases exponentially upon hyperpolarization. Data were fitted with a single exponential function ([S] = [S0] exp (V/τ0), where S is substrate) and extrapolated to more positive and more negative voltages. The fitting parameters at pH 5.6 were S0 = 16.1 mm± 0.7 mm and τ0 = 122 mV ± 8 mV, and at pH 6.5 S0 = 67 mm± 3 mm and τ0 = 108 mV ± 10 mV. C, the half-maximal proton concentration KmH, was determined from the Michaelis-Menten fit (not shown) and plotted against the membrane potential. Like KmS, KmH was voltage-dependent and could be fitted with a single exponential function as in panel B, with S0 = 15.4 μm± 0.3 μm and τ0 = 98 mV ± 5 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Changes in cytosolic sucrose feedback on the magnitude and direction of ZmSUT1 currents. A–C, ZmSUT1 currents recorded in inside-out giant patches in the presence of 50 mm (A), 5 mm (B), and 0.5 mm external sucrose (C). Schematic representations above each graph depict the proton and sucrose concentrations; cytosolic and external pH was 7.5 and 5.6, respectively, and cytosolic sucrose concentrations were elevated from 0 to 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm as indicated. The membrane potential was clamped to 0 mV. D–F, averaged currents gained from experiments shown in panels A–C were plotted versus the corresponding cytosolic sucrose concentrations. Data were fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation I = I1([Suc]cyt/[Suc]cyt + Km) - I0, where I1 = 11.0 pA, Km = 161 mm, and I0 = 10.3 pA (E); I1 = 4.83 pA, Km = 278 mm, and I0 = 2.56 pA (F); and I1 = 536 fA, Km = 362 mm, and I0 = 42.7 fA (G).

A, change in direction of ZmSUT1 currents upon changes in cytosolic sucrose concentration from 0 to 500 mm recorded in inside-out giant patches. Note that the pH was a symmetrical 5.6 on both sides of the membrane. External sucrose was 5 mm, and the membrane voltage was 0 mV. B, similar experiment as in panel A, but performed in the presence of 50 mm external sucrose. This recording was chosen because a fast rundown of the current was apparent. The decay of both positive and negative currents could be fitted by single exponentials with the same time constant (τ = 40 s). C, percentage of sucrose release from [14C]sucrose-injected, ZmSUT1-expressing, and control oocytes. The percentage of sucrose release was measured after 2 h of oocyte incubation in a 1 mm sucrose solution at pH 5.6 or pH 5.6 plus 5 mm acetate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intracellular pH Measurements—PH-sensitive microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillary (TW100F-3; WPI, Sarasota, FL) using a laser puller (P2000; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and silanized with dimethyldichlorosilane (Fulka, Steinheim, Germany) at 200 °C for 15 min. The tips of the pH microelectrodes were filled with hydrogen ionophore I mixture B (Fulka) and then back-filled with a buffer containing 40 mm KH2PO4, 23 mm NaOH, and 150 mm NaCl (pH 6.8). Only electrodes with a linear slope of 55–60 mV/pH unit over the calibration range before and after measurement were used. Signals were recorded with an electrometer (Model FD 223; WPI) in parallel to the currents in the voltage clamp mode of a TEVC amplifier (Turbo TEC 10CD; npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany). On the basis of the calibration curve for the pH microelectrodes, the internal pH (pHi) of the oocytes was calculated in consideration of the membrane potential. 14C Sucrose Uptake Experiments—In each experiment, 10 ZmSUT1-injected oocytes or 10 control oocytes were incubated in 0.05 μCi/ml 14C sucrose with a final sucrose concentration of 5 mm in the standard solution at pH 5.6. At defined time points the oocytes were rapidly washed three times in ice-cold standard solution and transferred to liquid scintillation vials containing scintillation mixture (Emulsifier-Safe™; Packard, Meriden, CT). The 14C radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation analyzer (Model 1900CA; Packard), and the sucrose uptake per oocyte was calculated from three independent experiments for each time point. [14C]Sucrose Release Experiments—Control oocytes and ZmSUT1-injected oocytes were loaded with 0.5 μCi of radiolabeled sucrose with a final sucrose concentration of ∼50 mm by injection (Picospritzer™ II; General Valve Co., Fairfield, NJ). After a 10-min washing period in ice-cold ND96, each single oocyte was transferred into 200 μl of the standard solution at pH 5.6 or pH 5.6 in the presence of 10 mm acetate. After 2 h the 14C radioactivity of the incubation-solution was measured in a scintillation counter. The oocytes were rapidly washed in ice-cold standard solution and transferred to the scintillation mixture for counting the 14C radioactivity in the liquid scintillation analyzer. The percentage of sucrose release was calculated. Patch Clamp Measurements—Giant patch recording (12Hilgemann D. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 307-328Crossref Google Scholar) was performed in inside-out configuration on ZmSUT1 expressing Xenopus oocytes. Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and fire-polished to have a final tip with a diameter between 25 and 30 μm. Oocytes were bathed in an external solution consisting of 30 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GdCl3, 145 mm sorbitol, and 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.6. After the seal was obtained, the external solution was changed (30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 145 mm (or 500 mm) sorbitol, and 10 mm Tris/MES, pH 7.5), and the patch was excised. The recording pipette was then placed in front of a polyethylene tube in connection with the desired ionic solutions that were driven by gravity. The standard cytosolic solution contained 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2. The cytosolic sucrose concentration ranged from 0 to 500 mm, as indicated in the remaining text where noted; sorbitol was appropriately added to each cytosolic solution to have a total sugar concentration of 500 mm. Cytosolic pH was 7.5 or 5.6 (with 10 mm Tris/MES or MES/Tris). The standard pipette solution was 30 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 145 mm sorbitol, and 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.6; sucrose was added at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 mm as indicated in the text where noted. Currents, filtered at 10 or 100 Hz and sampled at 200 or 400 Hz, were recorded with an EPC9 amplifier using Pulse 8.3 software (Heka Elektronic GmbH, Lembrecht, Germany). Data were analyzed by custommade programs using Igor (Wavemetrics; Lake Oswego, OR). ZmSUT1 was isolated from maize and expressed in source and sink tissues such as mature leave blades and sheaths as well as pedicels and seeds (13Aoki N. Hirose T. Takahashi S. Ono K. Ishimaru K. Ohsugi R. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). High sequence homologies to the rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1 (14Hirose T. Imaizumi N. Scofield G.N. Furbank R.T. Ohsugi R. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1389-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and to known sucrose transporters from the dicot species group ZmSUT1 into the SUT2 subfamily of sucrose transporters with high sucrose affinity (for review, see Ref. 15Kühn C. Plant Biol. 2003; 5: 215-232Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ZmSUT1 is a member of a large family of membrane proteins mediating the transport of sugars, amino acids, and osmolytes across membranes. These carriers share the typical 12-transmembrane-spanning α-helix structure (16Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 17Saier Jr., M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H. Huang S.C. Jack D.L. Jahn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar). In most eukaryotic cells these transporters couple the uptake of their substrates to electrochemical ion gradients generated by the H+- or Na+/K+-ATPase. Using the aphid stylet technique on maize leaf blades, it could be shown that the addition of sucrose reversibly depolarized the phloem potential (Fig. 1). To elucidate the transport characteristics of the underlying sucrose/H+ transporter activity with respect to sucrose affinity gradients and proton motive force, we heterologously expressed ZmSUT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Functional analysis was performed using both the TEVC technique and the patch clamp technique. Oocytes expressing ZmSUT1 efficiently imported radio-labeled sucrose with uptake rates of 6 nmol per hour and oocyte, whereas non-injected oocytes did not accumulate sucrose in detectable amounts (Fig. 2A). To monitor the movement of protons accompanying the sucrose transport, we simultaneously recorded sucrose-induced ionic currents and changes in cytoplasmic pHi by TEVC and proton-selective microelectrodes (18Zeuthen T. Hamann S. la Cour M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 3-17Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of sucrose to the external solution, large inward currents were elicited (Fig. 2B, upper trace). Inward currents were accompanied by a decrease in pHi by up to 0.5 units within 10 min (Fig. 2B, lower trace). After the removal of sucrose from the bath medium, the inward currents returned to the pre-sucrose level again, whereas the recovery of pHi was delayed. Control oocytes showed neither sucrose-induced currents nor sucrose-dependent changes in pHi. Stepwise increases in sucrose concentrations resulted in a gradual rise in ZmSUT1-mediated currents (Fig. 2C). In the current clamp mode, membrane depolarization in response to different sucrose concentrations could be recorded as well (Fig. 2D). Like the current response in Fig. 2C, the degree of membrane depolarization depended on the sucrose concentration applied (up to 50 mV with 10 mm sucrose). When the steady-state currents recorded in presence of extracellular sucrose concentrations between 0.5 and 50 mm were plotted against the membrane potential, ZmSUT1 currents increased upon hyperpolarization and were saturated at 30 mm sucrose (not shown). Plotting the currents as a function of the sucrose concentration a single Michaelis-Menten function could be fitted to the individual, voltage-dependent sucrose saturation curves (Fig. 3A). These current-concentration curves are hyperbolic in shape, suggesting that just one sucrose molecule binds to the transporter. The apparent affinity constant of ZmSUT1, KmS, exhibited pronounced voltage- and pH-dependence (Fig. 3B; compare also Ref. 19Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Frommer W.B. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25139-25144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hyperpolarizing voltages increased the apparent affinity to sucrose from 16 mm at 0 mV to 7.2 mm at -100 mV and pH 5.6. Upon a change to pH 6.5 the sucrose affinity was reduced. Both KmS voltage curves could be fitted with a single exponential function, allowing us to extrapolate KmS to measured phloem potentials of up to -180 mV (20Deeken R. Geiger D. Fromm J. Koroleva O. Ache P. Langenfeld-Heyser R. Sauer N. May S.T. Hedrich R. Planta. 2002; 216: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A KmS of 3.7 mm at pH 5.6 and a KmS of 12.4 mm at pH 6.5 were calculated. The maximal carrier current ImaxS values were found to be voltage-dependent also (not shown), decreasing linearly with negative-going membrane potentials. To study the proton coupling of ZmSUT1-mediated sucrose transport, the steady-state currents were measured as a function of voltage and pH in the presence of 5 mm sucrose (not shown). As predicted for a proton-coupled transport process, in the pH range between 6.5 and 4.5 ZmSUT1 currents increased with increasing proton concentration and hyperpolarization. At pH values >7.0 no significant inward currents could be detected. The currents at selected voltages were plotted against the H+ concentration (not shown) and fitted by a single Michaelis-Menten equation to calculate KmH and ImaxH (not shown). The proton affinity KmH of ZmSUT1 exponentially increased with hyperpolarizing membrane potentials (Fig. 3C). This behavior is in line with the results for the sucrose affinities KmS (compare Fig. 3B). Thus, both the apparent affinity constants and the Imax values for sucrose as well as for protons decrease upon hyperpolarization. To study the inverse transport mode of ZmSUT1 and its affinity toward cytosolic sucrose, we applied the giant patch clamp technique to ZmSUT1-expressing oocytes. In the inside-out configuration we varied the “cytosolic” sucrose concentration in the presence of either 0.5, 5, or 50 mm extracellular (pipette) sucrose. Upon a stepwise increase in cytosolic sucrose from 0 to 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm in the presence of 50 mm in the pipette, a progressive decrease in inward current was measured (Fig. 4A). This effect was completely reversible; inward currents reached their pre-stimulus levels after the removal of cytosolic sucrose. Non-injected oocytes, however, did not respond to variations in the cytosolic sucrose concentration. When plotting the average currents shown in Fig. 4A as a function of the cytosolic sucrose concentration, data could be fitted by a Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 4A, continuous line) characterized by an apparent Km of 160 mm (Fig. 4D). The inset of Fig. 4D depicts the extrapolation of the sucrose-induced currents from 2 to 3 m, a concentration range in which ZmSUT1 currents would reverse direction (I = 0 at 2.38 m sucrose). When the extracellular sucrose concentration was decreased to 5 mm or even 0.5 mm, the ZmSUT1-mediated currents reversed direction at physiological cytosolic sucrose levels (Fig. 4, B and C). In the presence of 5 mm external sucrose, a Km of 278 mm was calculated (Fig. 4E). A rise in cytosolic sucrose concentration above 314 mm even inverted the current direction. Upon a further decrease in extracellular sucrose concentration to 0.5 mm and the absence of cytosolic sucrose, only very small inward currents remained (Fig. 4C). Under these conditions, however, a rise in cytosolic sucrose concentration to just 50 mm inverted the ZmSUT1 current already. From the Michaelis-Menten fit a Km of 362 mm and a zero current value at 31 mm was obtained (Fig. 4F). When plotting the Km values versus the external sucrose concentration, a decrease in Km with the rise in external sucrose concentration became evident (not shown). Likewise, the cytosolic sucrose concentration causing the ZmSUT1 current to change direction was plotted as a function of external sucrose (Fig. 5). Under the equilibrium conditions depicted in Equation 2, nsucΔμsuc+nHΔμH+=0 Eq.2 where nsuc and nH are the number of moles of sucrose and protons transported through the membrane,(Δμ=μsuccyt−μsucext)is the difference between the cytosolic and external chemical potential (or molar free energy) of sucrose, and(ΔμH+=μH+cyt−μH+ext)is the difference between the cytosolic and external electro-chemical potential of protons. Therefore, Equation 3, shown here, [Suc]cyt=[Suc]ext10nHnsuc(pHcyt−pHext−FVm2.303RT) Eq.3 is another way in which Equation 2 can be written. The continuous lines in Fig. 5 are obtained by Equation 2 with V = 0 mV and using different values for nsuc and nH. This analysis revealed that the ZmSUT1 transporter has a 1 Suc/1 H+ stoichiometry (compare Refs. 19Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Frommer W.B. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25139-25144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and 21Zhou J.-J. Theodoulou F. Sauer N. Sanders D. Miller A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In agreement with a perfectly coupled thermodynamic machine, the positive current in Fig. 4 represents the sucrose gradient-driven efflux of protons against the proton gradient. To study the two transport modes of ZmSUT1 in the absence of the proton motive force, in Fig. 6A we stepped the cytosolic sucrose concentration from 0 to 500 mm (5 mm sucrose in the pipette) in the absence of a pH gradient. With [Suc]cyt = 0 mm and the absence of a membrane potential, we recorded an inward current as expected from the steep inward-directed sucrose gradient. Inverting the sucrose gradient by increasing [Suc]cyt to 500 mm, the carrier current reversed direction. In the presence of an inward-directed pH gradient, however, the magnitude of outward currents was smaller (compare Fig. 4). Inward currents could be re-established again upon removal of the disaccharide. Following a rise in the extracellular sucrose concentration from 5 to 50 mm and the absence of cytosolic sucrose, carrier currents remained inward (Fig. 6B). During bath perfusion to [Suc]cyt = 500 mm, currents changed direction. These experiments indicate that the sucrose gradient can drive the proton flux and vice versa. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 4B, the ZmSUT1 currents were subject of a fast “rundown,” most likely due to the loss of regulatory cytosolic factors. Interestingly, in Fig. 6B the decay of both inward and outward currents could be fitted by single exponential functions (dashed lines) with the same time constant. This indicates that both transport modes of ZmSUT1 are perfectly coupled via the sucrose gradient and proton motive force. Under the conditions of the sink phloem, the sucrose gradient drives the efflux of protons and sucrose. To mimic this situation in the oocyte system in Fig. 6C, ZmSUT1-expressing oocytes were injected with [14C]sucrose (final concentration of 50 mm), and the release of the radioactively labeled sucrose was measured. In ZmSUT1-oocytes, but not in water-injected control-oocytes, pronounced sucrose release was measured. As expected from our thermodynamic assumptions, the sucrose-release was enhanced when the cytosol was acidified by acetate treatment. Because of the localization of a sucrose/H+ transporter in sink tissues, it has previously been speculated that phloem unloading may be mediated by the same sucrose-H+ symporters that are responsible for phloem loading (for example, Ref. 22Truernit E. Sauer N. Planta. 1995; 196: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The direct demonstration that ZmSUT1, a member of the phloem sucrose carrier family, acts either in the source mode or sink mode for the life-maintaining uptake, and the adsorption of sucrose is underpinned by genetic evidence. Arabidopsis mutants, which lack the ZmSUT1 homologue AtSUC2, are strongly impaired in phloem loading and unloading of sucrose, which results in stunted growth, retarded development, and sterility (23Gottwald J.R. Krysan P.J. Young J.C. Evert R.F. Sussman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13979-13984Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Phloem unloading of sucrose is required for starch formation in storage tissues, such as the grains of cereals or potato tubers. When the copy number of StSUT1, a ZmSUT1 orthologue expressed in the phloem of developing tubers, is reduced by antisense repression, reduced fresh weight accumulation during tuber development was observed (4Kühn C. Hajirezaei M.R. Fernie A.R. Roessner-Tunali U. Czechowski T. Hirner B. Frommer W.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Viola R. Roberts A.G. Haupt S. Gazzani S. Hancock R.D. Marmiroli N. Machray G.C. Oparka K.J. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, indirect measurements with the proton-coupled monosaccharide transporter CkHUP1 from the green alga Chlorella and the SGLT1 Na+/glucose transporter from human and rabbit suggest that these sugar carriers from single-celled organisms can act in the inverse transport mode to release their substrates (24Komor E. Tanner W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 64: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Komor E. Tanner W. Nature. 1974; 248: 511-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Quick M. Tomasevic J. Wright E.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9147-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Sauer G.A. Nagel G. Koepsell H. Bamberg E. Hartung K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To study the inverse mode of ZmSUT1, we performed patch clamp experiments in the giant inside-out configuration. Varying the cytosolic sucrose concentration, we were for the first time able to determine the cytosolic affinity constant for sucrose. Upon variation of the sucrose gradient we could reverse the direction of the proton current, e.g. by increasing the cytosolic sucrose concentration. The direction of the transport of the ZmSUT1 symporter is therefore dependent on the sum of the free energies of both the sucrose and the proton gradient across the membrane. In agreement with the above considerations, we could demonstrate that sucrose could drive protons through ZmSUT1. Recently, the reversibility of the human and rabbit Na+/glucose co-transporters has been documented by measuring the reversion of the glucose-coupled Na+ current. Like the proton-coupled disaccharide carrier ZmSUT1, the sodium-coupled SGLT1 shows more than one order of magnitude difference between the sugar affinities of the two transport modes, indicating a functional asymmetry of both carrier types. Under physiological conditions the inverse transport mode of SGLT1 is highly improbable because of the low affinity of the sugar carrier. In the plant phloem, however, both transport modes of ZmSUT1 are probable (see model in Fig. 7). In maize source leaves, extracellular sucrose concentrations of 2.6 mm were measured (28Lohaus G. Hussmann M. Pennewiss K. Schneider H. Zhu J.J. Sattelmacher B. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 351: 1721-1732Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Assuming a pH gradient of ∼1.5 units and a phloem membrane potential of -150 mV (29van Bel A.J.E. Prog. Bot. 1993; 54: 134-150Google Scholar), a perfect proton-coupled ZmSUT1 would allow a theoretical phloem sucrose accumulation of up to 26 m (according to Equation 3, with nH/nsuc = 1). Directly measured sucrose concentrations of maize phloem sap revealed sucrose contents of ∼0.85 m (28Lohaus G. Hussmann M. Pennewiss K. Schneider H. Zhu J.J. Sattelmacher B. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 351: 1721-1732Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the sink phloem, however, the conditions are different. The external sucrose concentration is reduced to 1 mm or less because of the activity of cell wall-bound invertases (for example, Ref. 30Roitsch T. Balibrea M.E. Hofmann M. Proels R. Sinha A.K. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and the surrounding sucrose taking up (sucking) sink tissues with hyperpolarized membrane potentials negative to -180 mV. 2P. Ache, J. Fromm, and R. Hedrich, unpublished data. Symplasmic unloading is unlikely in maize because of the lack of plasmodesmata in the protophloem and metaphloem (9Evert R.F. Russin W.A. Am. J. Bot. 1993; 80: 1310-1317Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the region of the release phloem the proton motive force across the phloem membrane is less strong because of the reduced size (or even absence) of the energy-supplying companion cells (29van Bel A.J.E. Prog. Bot. 1993; 54: 134-150Google Scholar, 31van Bel A.J.E. Ehlers K. Savidge R. Barnett J.R. Napier R. Cambium: The Biology of Wood Formation. Bios, Oxford2000: 85-99Google Scholar). Therefore the phloem membrane potential mainly depends on the potassium conductance mediated by K+ channels (32Ache P. Becker D. Deeken R. Dreyer I. Weber H. Fromm J. Hedrich R. Plant J. 2001; 27: 571-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct measurements in these sink phloem cells revealed membrane potentials of only -60 mV. 3J. B. Hafke, unpublished data, and A. J. E. van Bel, personal communication. At an apoplasmic sucrose concentration of 1 mm, a phloem sap sucrose concentration of 0.85 m, and a pH gradient of 1 unit of sucrose release would occur at membrane potentials positive from -115 mV (according to Equation 3 with nH/nsuc = 1). This regime directs ZmSUT1 into the inverse transport mode, and sucrose is released. The present work revealed the functional asymmetry of the phloem sucrose carrier ZmSUT1. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate the “sink mode” of this pivotal carrier type, provide for the molecular mechanism of phloem sucrose release, and explain the severe phenotype of phloem H+/sucrose carrier loss-of-function mutants and antisense-repression plants. In contrast to symplasmic unloading, this sucrose/H+ symporter-based mechanism drives unloading of sucrose under the control of both the sucrose and the pH gradients as well as the membrane potential of the phloem and the surrounding tissues. We thank Dr. N. Aoki for the generous supply of ZmSUT1 cDNA."

https://openalex.org/W2052307676,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is the primary structural component of caveolae and is implicated in the processes of vesicular transport, cholesterol balance, transformation, and tumorigenesis. Despite an abundance of data suggesting that Cav-1 has transformation suppressor properties both in vitro and in vivo, Cav-1 is expressed at increased levels in human prostate cancer. To investigate the role of Cav-1 in prostate cancer onset and progression, we interbred Cav-1(-/-) null mice with a TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) model that spontaneously develops advanced prostate cancer and metastatic disease. We found that, although the loss of Cav-1 did not affect the appearance of minimally invasive prostate cancer, its absence significantly impeded progression to highly invasive and metastatic disease. Inactivation of one (+/-) or both (-/-) alleles of Cav-1 resulted in significant reductions in prostate tumor burden, as well as decreases in regional lymph node metastases. Moreover, further examination revealed decreased metastasis to distant organs, such as the lungs, in TRAMP/Cav-1(-/-) mice. Utilizing prostate carcinoma cell lines (C1, C2, and C3) derived from TRAMP tumors, we also showed a positive correlation between Cav-1 expression and the ability of these cells to form tumors in vivo. Furthermore, down-regulation of Cav-1 expression in these cells, using a small interfering RNA approach, significantly reduced their tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Mechanistically, we showed that loss or down-regulation of Cav-1 expression results in increased apoptosis, with increased prostate apoptosis response factor-4 and PTEN levels in Cav-1(-/-) null prostate tumors. Our current findings provide the first in vivo molecular genetic evidence that Cav-1 does indeed function as a tumor promoter during prostate carcinogenesis, rather than as a tumor suppressor. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is the primary structural component of caveolae and is implicated in the processes of vesicular transport, cholesterol balance, transformation, and tumorigenesis.

To investigate the role of Cav-1 in prostate cancer onset and progression, we interbred Cav-1(-/-) null mice with a TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) model that spontaneously develops advanced prostate cancer and metastatic disease. We found that, although the loss of Cav-1 did not affect the appearance of minimally invasive prostate cancer, its absence significantly impeded progression to highly invasive and metastatic disease. Inactivation of one (+/-) or both (-/-) alleles of Cav-1 resulted in significant reductions in prostate tumor burden, as well as decreases in regional lymph node metastases. Moreover, further examination revealed decreased metastasis to distant organs, such as the lungs, in TRAMP/Cav-1(-/-) mice. Utilizing prostate carcinoma cell lines (C1, C2, and C3) derived from TRAMP tumors, we also showed a positive correlation between Cav-1 expression and the ability of these cells to form tumors in vivo. Furthermore, down-regulation of Cav-1 expression in these cells, using a small interfering RNA approach, significantly reduced their tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Mechanistically, we showed that loss or down-regulation of Cav-1 expression results in increased apoptosis, with increased prostate apoptosis response factor-4 and PTEN levels in Cav-1(-/-) null prostate tumors. Our current findings provide the first in vivo molecular genetic evidence that Cav-1 does indeed function as a tumor promoter during prostate carcinogenesis, rather than as a tumor suppressor. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) 1The abbreviations used are: Cav-1, caveolin-1; TRAMP, transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; WT, wild-type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end label; KO, knock-out; HET, heterozygous; PIN, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Par4, prostate apoptosis response factor-4. is the principal structural component and marker protein of caveolae, 50-100-nm flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane. Cav-1 was first identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate when avian fibroblasts were transformed with the v-Src oncogene, suggesting that Cav-1 may have a critical role in modulating cellular transformation (1Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, three caveolin family members have been identified, with diverse tissue expression patterns in various organisms ranging from mammals and amphibians to the nematode. Such ubiquity in higher organisms insinuates the importance of the caveolin gene family for normal physiology (2Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 214.1-214.8Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The majority of caveolin-related research has focused on caveolin-1 as the prototypical member, and the past decade has brought considerable advances in our understanding of the functions of Cav-1. Thus far, Cav-1 has been implicated in many cellular processes, from signal transduction and vesicular transport to cholesterol homeostasis and lipid transport (reviewed in Ref. 3Cohen A.W. Hnasko R. Schubert W. Lisanti M.P. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1341-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Concurrently, a growing field of research is beginning to define the role of the caveolins in the development of human cancers. Identification of a novel function for Cav-1 in oncogenesis began with the demonstration that Cav-1 levels inversely correlated with soft agar growth in transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (4Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Subsequently, several groups have shown that recombinant expression of Cav-1 in certain human or mouse tumor-derived cell lines significantly inhibits their soft agar growth (5Lee S.W. Reimer C.L.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). More recently, we and others have reported that Cav-1 has in vivo tumor suppressor properties in certain tissues, such as the mammary gland and skin, utilizing various murine animal models (9Williams T.M. Cheung M.W. Park D.S. Razani B. Cohen A.W. Muller W.J. Di Vizio D. Chopra N.G. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Capozza F.

For example, using a mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis (MMTV-PyMT), we have shown that Cav-1 expression dramatically inhibits the progression of early mammary dysplastic lesions, as well as the development of primary mammary tumors and spontaneous metastases. In terms of human cancers, mutations in the CAV-1 gene have been identified in breast carcinomas, as well as oral squamous cell carcinomas (13Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar, 14Han S.E. Park K.H. Lee G. Huh Y.J. Min B.M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar), and CAV-1 gene localizes to a suspected tumor suppressor locus on chromosome 7q31.1, which is commonly deleted in a variety of human cancers (reviewed in Ref. 15Razani B. Lisanti M.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, Cav-1 protein levels are consistently down-regulated in a wide range of human cancers, including ovarian carcinomas, sarcomas, and mammary carcinomas (15Razani B. Lisanti M.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Despite this association between Cav-1 and tumor suppression, there is accumulating evidence that Cav-1 does not function similarly in all types of human cancers. In fact, several groups have now documented that Cav-1 protein expression levels are up-regulated in other human neoplasias, including bladder, esophageal, and prostate carcinomas (16Rajjayabun P.H.

Frolov A. Kuwao S. Timme T.L. Baba S. Thompson T.C. Cancer. 2003; 97: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Cav-1 does not have transformation suppressor effects in these tissues. In fact, further clinicopathologic analyses of human bladder, esophageal, and prostate carcinomas reveal that Cav-1 up-regulation correlates positively with increased tumor grade, invasive potential, regional metastasis, and decreased overall survival (16Rajjayabun P.H.

Therefore, these results argue that Cav-1 has tumor-promoting functions in certain tumor cell types, such as prostate epithelial cells. This notion has been substantiated by cell culture studies with human prostate tumor-derived cell lines. In these prostate carcinoma cell lines, Cav-1 up-regulation appears to be correlated with increased cell survival, androgen independence, and increased metastatic potential (23Nasu Y. Timme T.L. Yang G. Bangma C.H. Li L. Ren C. Park S.H. DeLeon M. Wang J. Thompson T.C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Li L. Yang G. Ebara S. Satoh T. Nasu Y. Timme T.L. Ren C. Wang J. Tahir S.A. Thompson T.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4386-4392PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Cav-1 has distinct cell type-specific tumor-modulating functions, either promoting or inhibiting tumor development, depending on its cellular context. However, it remains unknown whether Cav-1 expression can promote the development of prostate cancers in vivo. Previous studies have focused only on the oncogenic behavior of cultured prostate cancer-derived cell lines. Here, we employed a well established transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer, termed TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate), to study the potential role of Cav-1 in modulating prostate carcinogenesis in vivo. For this purpose, we interbred Cav-1(-/-) null mice, completely lacking Cav-1 expression, with the well characterized TRAMP mouse model (25Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F. Finegold M.J. Medina D. Tilley W.D. Aspinall J.O. Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Matusik R.J. Rosen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3439-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 26Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Morton R.A. Boyce B.F. DeMayo F.J. Finegold M.J. Angelopoulou R. Rosen J.M. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4096-4102PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kaplan-Lefko P.J. Chen T.M. Ittmann M.M. Barrios R.J. Ayala G.E. Huss W.J. Maddison L.A. Foster B.A. Greenberg N.M. Prostate. 2003; 55: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to directly assess whether genetic loss of one (+/-) or both alleles (-/-) of Cav-1 alters prostate tumor development in an in vivo setting. Use of this autochthonous TRAMP model has many advantages, because it allows prostate tumors to develop in their native environment (i.e. with exposure to the proper growth factors, hormonal, immunomodulatory, and angiogenic milieu). (See the end of the “Discussion” for further elaboration on the advantages and the validity of the TRAMP model). Here, we show that prostate tumors derived from TRAMP mice demonstrate an up-regulation of Cav-1 expression, analogous to human prostate cancers. More importantly, ablation of one or both Cav-1 alleles significantly attenuates the progression of prostate carcinoma with regard to primary tumor burden and more advanced metastatic disease. These findings are further corroborated with cell lines derived from TRAMP prostate tumors (C1, C2, and C3). Importantly, all three TRAMP cell lines express cytokeratins, E-cadherin, and the androgen receptor, confirming their epithelial and prostatic origin (28Foster B.A. Gingrich J.R. Kwon E.D. Madias C. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3325-3330PubMed Google Scholar). In these cell lines, Cav-1 expression directly correlates with tumor growth. Additionally, siRNA-mediated silencing of Cav-1 gene expression in the Cav-1-expressing TRAMP C1 cell line inhibits the processes of primary tumor growth and experimental metastasis. Analysis of both (i) transgenic prostate tumors and (ii) cell line-derived tumors indicates that loss of Cav-1 results in decreased cell survival, as well as the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic markers including PTEN and Par4. Therefore, our findings provide the first in vivo molecular genetic evidence that Cav-1 does indeed function as a tumor promoter during mouse prostate carcinogenesis, rather than as a tumor suppressor. As we previously reported that Cav-1 has a tumor suppressor role in the mouse mammary gland (12Williams T.M. Medina F. Badano I. Hazan R.B. Hutchinson J. Muller W.J. Chopra N.G. Scherer P.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51630-51646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), our current results conclusively demonstrated that Cav-1 has clear tissue-specific functions with regard to both tumorigenesis and metastasis. Materials and Expression Vectors—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to caveolin-1 (clones 2297 and 2234) and caveolin-2 were the generous gifts of Dr. Roberto Campos-Gonzalez (BD Biosciences). Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-Cav-1 (N-20) rabbit polyclonal antibody (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma), anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-phospho (p)-Akt (Ser-473) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Inc.), anti-Par4 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-PTEN polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), and anti-SV-40 large T-antigen (BD Biosciences). pBABE (empty vector) and pBABE-Cav-1 constructs were as we previously described (12Williams T.M. Medina F. Badano I. Hazan R.B. Hutchinson J. Muller W.J. Chopra N.G. Scherer P.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51630-51646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Transgenic Animal Studies—All animals were housed and maintained in a barrier facility at the Institute for Animal Studies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM). Mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to chow (Picolab 20, PMI Nutrition International) and water. Animal protocols used for this study were approved by the AECOM Institute for Animal Studies. Cav-1 null mice were generated as previously described (9Williams T.M. Cheung M.W. Park D.S. Razani B. Cohen A.W. Muller W.J. Di Vizio D. Chopra N.G. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TRAMP mice expressing the SV40 large T-antigen, under control of the minimal rat probasin promoter, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and screened for the presence of the SV40 large T-antigen by PCR, as detailed on The Jackson Laboratory website. All the mice used in this study were in the C57Bl/6 background. Cav-1(-/-) null mice were interbred with TRAMP mice to generate three male cohorts: (i) TRAMP/Cav-1(+/+) mice (WT), (ii) TRAMP/Cav-1(+/-) (heterozygous (HET)) mice, and (iii) TRAMP/Cav-1(-/-) (knock-out (KO)) mice. All TRAMP mice from this study were hemizygous for the TRAMP transgene. TRAMP transgenic mice were sacrificed at 28 weeks of age, and a full necropsy was performed on all animals, including microscopic examination of the thoracic, pelvic, and abdominal organs. Primary tumors were excised and weighed, cut into smaller portions, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24-48 h for paraffin embedding, and 5-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. In cases where there was no prostate tumor evident, the prostate tissue was isolated and likewise processed for microscopic analysis. Lymph nodes and other organs were similarly processed for histological analysis. For metastasis analysis, lymph nodes and lungs were sectioned at 50-μm intervals and either stained with hematoxylin and eosin or left unstained for immunohistochemistry. Lymph nodes were photographed with a Nikon Coolscope camera and areas with metastases scored with NIH Image J software. Lung metastases were scored as the total number of metastatic foci (defined as a cluster of 10 or more cells) per lung. Cell Culture—TRAMP cell lines (C1, C2, and C3) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). These cell lines were previously characterized and are derived from prostate adenocarcinomas isolated and cultured from TRAMP/Cav-1(+/+) mice (28Foster B.A. Gingrich J.R. Kwon E.D. Madias C. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3325-3330PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, these cell lines demonstrate androgen receptor, E-cadherin, and cytokeratin expression, confirming their prostate epithelial origin. In addition, all three cell lines no longer express detectable SV40 large T-antigen. C1 and C2 cell lines also form tumors in syngeneic (C57BL/6) or nude mice, but C1 is the only cell line that forms colonies in soft agar. C1 cells are the fastest growing in vitro and in vivo, whereas C3 cells are the slowest growing and do not form tumors in vivo (28Foster B.A. Gingrich J.R. Kwon E.D. Madias C. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3325-3330PubMed Google Scholar). All three cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose), without sodium pyruvate, with l-glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% Nu-Serum IV (BD Biosciences), 0.005 mg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 10 nm dehydroisoandrosterone (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The target region used for siRNA-mediated caveolin-1 down-regulation was designed with the aid of the Oligoengine sequence design software (Oligoengine, Inc., Seattle, WA). A 19-nt region of caveolin-1 (nucleotide sequence GCAAGTGTATGACGCGCAC) was chosen as a potential target and used to produce a 64-nt pair of oligos containing restriction enzyme cleavage sites and a short intervening hairpin sequence (sense: 5′-GATCCCCGCAAGTGTATGACGCGCACTTCAAGAGAGTGCGCGTCATACACTTGCTTTTTGGAAA-3′; antisense: 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGCAAGTGTATGACGCGCACTCTCTTGAAGTGCGCGTCATACACTTGCGGG-3′). These oligos were annealed and inserted into the pSUPER retroviral vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Production of stable cell lines by retroviral infection and puromycin selection was performed as we previously described (12Williams T.M. Medina F. Badano I. Hazan R.B. Hutchinson J. Muller W.J. Chopra N.G. Scherer P.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51630-51646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry—Western blot analysis and immunostaining were performed essentially as we previously described in detail (9Williams T.M. Cheung M.W. Park D.S. Razani B. Cohen A.W. Muller W.J. Di Vizio D. Chopra N.G. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Williams T.M. Medina F. Badano I. Hazan R.B. Hutchinson J. Muller W.J. Chopra N.G. Scherer P.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51630-51646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cell Injections—TRAMP cells were grown to confluency in 15-cm dishes, trypsinized, and counted with a hematocytometer. 2 × 106 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 2-month-old male C57Bl/6 mice, and tumors were isolated after 8 weeks. For the nude mouse experiments with stable cell lines, 5 × 105 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS were injected into the flanks of 2-month-old athymic nude male mice (Taconic Farms), and tumors were isolated after 6 weeks. Tumors were weighed and sized with calipers. Volumes were estimated using the formula (x2y)/2, where x is the length and y is width. For experimental metastasis, 106 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS of either cell line were injected via the tail vein. Lungs were isolated 3 weeks later, fixed in formalin, and analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining exactly as for the transgenic study. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick-end Label (TUNEL) Staining—Briefly, 5-μm sections of WT TRAMP and KO TRAMP prostate tumors or C1/pSUPER and C1/siRNA tumors were TUNEL-stained with a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (TACs 2 TdT in situ apoptosis detection kit; Trevigen, Inc., Gaithers-burg, MD). TUNEL-positive nuclei were scored under a microscope using a 40× objective. To determine whether Cav-1 plays an important role in prostate cancer progression, we interbred Cav-1(-/-) null mice with TRAMP mice (a mouse model of spontaneous prostate cancer) to produce three cohorts of TRAMP transgenic male mice: (i) TRAMP/Cav-1(+/+) wild-type, (ii) TRAMP/Cav-1(+/-) heterozygous, and (iii) TRAMP/Cav-1(-/-) null mice. All mice were heterozygous for the TRAMP transgene, which directs specific expression of the SV40 large T-antigen to the prostate via the rat probasin promoter. As previously reported by Greenberg and colleagues (26Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Morton R.A. Boyce B.F. DeMayo F.J. Finegold M.J. Angelopoulou R. Rosen J.M. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4096-4102PubMed Google Scholar), TRAMP mice develop metastases to the regional lymph nodes after 28 weeks of age, with 100% penetrance and to more distant sites, such as the lung, with less frequency (26Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Morton R.A. Boyce B.F. DeMayo F.J. Finegold M.J. Angelopoulou R. Rosen J.M. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4096-4102PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to study both prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis, we sacrificed mice from the three cohorts at 28 weeks of age and performed a full necropsy, including microscopic examination of the prostate. A total of 38 TRAMP animals were included in this study, including 18 Cav-1(+/+) WT, 8 Cav-1(+/-) HET, and 12 Cav-1(-/-) KO mice. TRAMP-expressing mice that died prior to the time point of sacrifice were excluded from the study. Of these, 7 of 25 (28%) WT mice died, 3 of 11 (27%) HET mice died, and 2 of 14 (14%) KO mice died. Necropsy of the WT and HET mice revealed that 100% of these mice possessed substantial tumor burden, indicating that advanced prostate cancer was the primary cause of mortality. However, the two KO mice that died did not demonstrate any significant prostate cancer development, suggesting that these mice died from other complications. Caveolin-1 Is Up-regulated in Advanced Prostate Tumors Derived from TRAMP Mice—To determine whether Cav-1 is normally up-regulated during the process of mouse prostate carcinogenesis, we first performed immunostaining on normal (non-TRAMP) wild-type prostate tissue and prostate tumors derived from TRAMP/Cav-1(+/+) mice at 28 weeks of age. These prostate tumors were harvested from mice with a large tumor burden and metastatic disease, indicating the advanced nature of these tumors. Histological examination of these tumors also revealed that they were poorly differentiated high grade prostate carcinomas. We first examined Cav-1 expression in normal prostate epithelium of the anterior, lateral, dorsal, and ventral lobes. Virtually no immunoreactivity was observed in the epithelium of all prostate lobes in wild-type mice, despite abundant staining for Cav-1 in the endothelium, a cell-type that normally expresses high levels of Cav-1 (Fig. 1, A-C). On the other hand, the majority of tumors isolated from TRAMP/Cav-1(+/+) mice showed strong Cav-1 immunostaining directly within the prostate tumor cells, in addition to the endothelium (Fig. 1, D and E). As controls, immunostaining was performed with prostate tissue from Cav-1(-/-) mice (not shown) and prostate tumors from TRAMP/Cav-1(-/-) mice (Fig. 1F). Importantly, no Cav-1 immunostaining was detected in these Cav-1(-/-) null control tissues. These results indicate that Cav-1 is expressed at very low levels in untransformed prostate epithelium but is significantly up-regulated during the acquisition of transformed properties, ultimately leading to the development of high grade prostate tumors. These findings parallel observations made for Cav-1 in human prostate and provide further validation for using this animal model to study the role of Cav-1 in prostate tumorigenesis. Loss of Cav-1 Significantly Impedes the Development of Primary Tumor Growth—Upon necropsy at 28 weeks of age, 56% of TRAMP/Cav-1(+/+) mice demonstrated a grossly evident prostate tumor. In comparison, the incidence of a grossly identifiable tumor in TRAMP/Cav-1(-/-) mice was only 33% (Fig. 2A). Next, to assess total tumor burden, prostate tumors were carefully excised and weighed. The mean tumor wet weight per mouse was 4.72 ± 1.53 g for the WT cohort and 1.96 ± 1.1 g for the KO cohort, indicating that the complete loss of Cav-1 markedly impacts prostate tumor burden in TRAMP mice. Interestingly, inactivation of one allele of CAV-1 in HET mice was also sufficient to result in substantial reductions in total tumor burden (1.28 ± 0.47 g). As a consequence, results obtained with HET and KO cohorts were combined. Combining the HET and KO cohorts resulted in a statistically significant 2.8-fold reduction in mean primary tumor burden/mouse (1.69 ± 0.38 g; p < 0.05, Student's t test; Fig. 2B). Furthermore, only 10% of HET and KO mice developed large tumors (defined as >4.0 g) as compared with 44% of the WT TRAMP mice (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that partial or complete loss of Cav-1 is sufficient to impede prostate carcinogenesis. Histological examination of the prostate tumors derived from WT, HET, or KO TRAMP mice revealed that all tumors were high grade, poorly differentiated carcinomas (not shown). Of those mice that did not develop visibly identifiable (gross) tumors, we isolated their prostates and evaluated them microscopically. Previous microscopic analysis of TRAMP mice at 6 months of age revealed numerous types of microscopically identifiable prostate cancer, including areas of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), phylloides-like lesions, and small areas of well differentiated or poorly differentiated neoplastic tissue in the dorsal, lateral, ventral, and anterior prostate (27Kaplan-Lefko P.J. Chen T.M. Ittmann M.M. Barrios R.J. Ayala G.E. Huss W.J. Maddison L.A. Foster B.A. Greenberg N.M. Prostate. 2003; 55: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Histologically, we found no significant differences among the prostates of WT (n = 8), HET (n = 3), or KO (n = 8) TRAMP mice at 28 weeks of age. All mice developed microscopic evidence of disease, ranging from early (low grade PIN) to late (poorly differentiated) transformed tissue in all lobes to approximately the same degree (not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2129335564,"In previous studies, we characterized five histidine kinases (Hiks) and the cognate response regulators (Rres) that control the expression of ∼70% of the hyperosmotic stress-inducible genes in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. In the present study, we screened a gene knock-out library of Rres by RNA slot-blot hybridization and with a genome-wide DNA microarray and identified three Hik-Rre systems, namely, Hik33-Rre31, Hik10-Rre3, and Hik16-Hik41-Rre17, as well as another system that included Rre1, that were involved in perception of salt stress and transduction of the signal. We found that these Hik-Rre systems were identical to those that were involved in perception and transduction of the hyperosmotic stress signal. We compared the induction factors of the salt stress- and hyperosmotic stress-inducible genes that are located downstream of each system and found that these genes responded to the two kinds of stress to different respective extents. In addition, the Hik33-Rre31 system regulated the expression of genes that were specifically induced by hyperosmotic stress, whereas the system that included Rre1 regulated the expression of one or two genes that were specifically induced either by salt stress or by hyperosmotic stress. Our observations suggest that the perception of salt and hyperosmotic stress by the Hik-Rre systems is complex and that salt stress and hyperosmotic stress are perceived as distinct signals by the Hik-Rre systems."
https://openalex.org/W2006188503,"The novel class Ib molecule MR1 is highly conserved in mammals, particularly in its α1/α2 domains. Recent studies demonstrated that MR1 expression is required for development and expansion of a small population of T cells expressing an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) α chain called mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Despite these intriguing properties it has been difficult to determine whether MR1 expression and MAIT cell recognition is ligand-dependent. To address these outstanding questions, monoclonal antibodies were produced in MR1 knock-out mice immunized with recombinant MR1 protein, and a series of MR1 mutations were generated at sites previously shown to disrupt the ability of class Ia molecules to bind peptide or TCR. Here we show that 1) MR1 molecules are detected by monoclonal antibodies in either an open or folded conformation that correlates precisely with peptide-induced conformational changes in class Ia molecules, 2) only the folded MR1 conformer activated 2/2 MAIT hybridoma cells tested, 3) the pattern of MAIT cell activation by the MR1 mutants implies the MR1/TCR orientation is strikingly similar to published major histocompatibility complex/αβTCR engagements, 4) all the MR1 mutations tested and found to severely reduce surface expression of folded molecules were located in the putative ligand binding groove, and 5) certain groove mutants of MR1 that are highly expressed on the cell surface disrupt MAIT cell activation.

Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). By comparison, non-classical class I (or class Ib) typically have more limited polymorphism, more restricted tissue expression, and more diverse functions (2Braud V.M. Allan D.S. McMichael A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, certain class Ib proteins have specialized antigen presentation functions such as human HLA-E and mouse Qa-1 that present signal peptides of other class I molecules to T cells or NK cells (2Braud V.M. Allan D.S. McMichael A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Alternatively, mouse and human CD1 present glycolipid ligands to T or NK-T cells (4Kronenberg M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 23: 877-900Crossref Scopus (864) Google Scholar). However, other class Ib molecules such as HFE and ZAG have non-immunological functions, and still others like MR1 have unknown functions. Despite these functional differences, sequence comparisons and recent crystallographic studies indicate that class Ib proteins are structurally very similar to class Ia proteins (5Burmeister W.P. Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Blum M.L. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Sanchez L.M. Chirino A.J. Bjorkman P.

Lymphocytes with restricted repertoires such as B1 B cells, some γδT cells, and NK-T cells that express autoreactive, invariant antigen receptors have been called innate lymphocytes (8Bendelac A. Bonneville M. Kearney J.F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The restricted repertoires of these cells may allow them to rapidly respond to phylogenetically conserved antigens (9Treiner E. Duban L. Moura I.C. Hansen T. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Microbes Infect. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, lymphocytes with restricted repertoires may have regulatory roles dependent upon the recognition of self-ligands. Until recently, NK-T cells were the only known T cell subset with an invariant TCRs conserved between mouse and man, perhaps reflecting an ancient and important physiological function (9Treiner E. Duban L. Moura I.C. Hansen T. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Microbes Infect. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bendelac A. Lantz O. Quimby M.E. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Brutkiewicz R.R. Science. 1995; 268: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). More specifically, most mouse NK-T cells express an invariant TCRα V-J junction (Vα14-Jα18) with a CDR3 of constant length paired with limited Vβ segments (11Bendelac A. Rivera M.N. Park S.H. Roark J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 535-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 12Kronenberg M. Gapin L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Unlike conventional T cells, their development is not altered in TAP–/– mice. Consistent with this, NK-T cells recognize glycolipids such as α-galactosyl ceramide presented by the MHC class Ib molecule CD1d. It is noteworthy, however, that the endogenous ligand presented physiologically by CD1d was difficult to identify (13Stanic A.K. De Silva A.D. Park J.J. Sriram V. Ichikawa S. Hirabyashi Y. Hayakawa K. Van Kaer L. Brutkiewicz R.R. Joyce S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1849-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Zhou D. Mattner J. Cantu III, C. Schrantz N.

Science. 2004; 306: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). NK-T cells are thought to bridge innate and adaptive immune responses by secreting large amounts of cytokines, particularly IL-4, upon stimulation, and NK-T cells have been implicated in T cell polarization, tumor rejection, and autoimmunity (15Stein-Streilein J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1779-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Taniguchi M. Harada M. Kojo S. Nakayama T. Wakao H. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A second type of T cell with an invariant TCR was recently defined and, because they preferentially home to the gut mucosa, were named MAIT (mucosal-associated invariant T) cells (18Tilloy F. Treiner E. Park S.H. Garcia C. Lemonnier F. de la Salle H. Bendelac A. Bonneville M. Lantz O. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1907-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 19Treiner E. Duban L. Bahram S. Radosavljevic M. Wanner V. Tilloy F. Affaticati P. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Nature. 2003; 422: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Like most NK-T cells, MAIT cells express a TCRα chain encoded by a specific Vα-Jα rearrangement with a CDR3 segment of constant length and minor sequence diversity that preferentially pairs with a limited number of Vβ segments (9Treiner E. Duban L. Moura I.C. Hansen T. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Microbes Infect. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, the canonical sequence of the MAIT cell TCR (iVα7.2/19) is encoded by hVα7.2-Jα33 in humans and the highly homologous mVα19-Jα33 in mouse and cattle. MAIT cells reside within the CD4–CD8– T population in human, mice, and cattle as well as the CD8αα+ subset in humans (18Tilloy F. Treiner E. Park S.H. Garcia C. Lemonnier F. de la Salle H. Bendelac A. Bonneville M. Lantz O. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1907-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Like NK-T cells, MAIT cells are selected on hematopoietic cells in a TAP-independent, β2m-dependent manner. Also similar to NK-T cells, MAIT cells are selected/activated by a class Ib molecule. As recently shown by Treiner et al. (19Treiner E. Duban L. Bahram S. Radosavljevic M. Wanner V. Tilloy F. Affaticati P. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Nature. 2003; 422: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), the development and activation of MAIT cells is dependent on the monomorphic class I-related molecule MR1, which is remarkably conserved among mammals (indeed more conserved than CD1d) (20Hashimoto K. Hirai M. Kurosawa Y. Science. 1995; 269: 693-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Riegert P. Wanner V. Bahram S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4066-4077PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yamaguchi H. Hirai M. Kurosawa Y. Hashimoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to MR1, MAIT cell development is dependent upon B cells and commensal flora, properties not shared with NK-T cells (19Treiner E. Duban L. Bahram S. Radosavljevic M. Wanner V. Tilloy F. Affaticati P. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Nature. 2003; 422: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 23Park S.H. Benlagha K. Lee D. Balish E. Bendelac A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In regard to tissue distribution, MAIT cells accumulate in the mucosal system, whereas NK-T cells are abundant in internal organs like the spleen and liver (9Treiner E. Duban L. Moura I.C. Hansen T. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Microbes Infect. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Properties of MAIT cells unique or shared with NK-T cells have led to speculation about MAIT cell function (9Treiner E. Duban L. Moura I.C. Hansen T. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Microbes Infect. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For example, based on their preferential accumulation in the gut mucosa, it was proposed that MAIT cells could contribute to the discrimination between pathogens and commensals or be involved in a negative feedback loop to regulate IgA secretion, which plays a critical role in controlling the gut microbial flora. MAIT cells might also interact with dendritic cells, which are abundant in the mucosal lamina propria and are critical for antigen presentation during bacterial infections (24Rescigno M. Urbano M. Valzasina B. Francolini M. Rotta G. Bonasio R. Granucci F. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Thus, resolving MAIT cell function could provide key insights into how the immune system maintains the balance between tolerance and immune responses in mucosal tissues. Formidable obstacles must be overcome to test the validity of any hypotheses regarding MAIT cell function. MAIT cells are rare and represent around 2% of CD4–CD8– lymph node T cells but are somewhat more abundant in the intestinal mucosa of B6 mice. So far attempts have failed to generate MAIT cell clones from primary cells, 2S. Gilfillan, O. Lantz, D. H. Fremont, and T. Hansen, unpublished observations.2S. Gilfillan, O. Lantz, D. H. Fremont, and T. Hansen, unpublished observations. but fortunately, MAIT T-T hybridomas were obtained for functional studies (9Treiner E. Duban L. Moura I.C. Hansen T. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Microbes Infect. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tilloy F. Treiner E. Park S.H. Garcia C. Lemonnier F. de la Salle H. Bendelac A. Bonneville M. Lantz O. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1907-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). A number of MAIT hybridomas were selected based on their expression of the TCRα canonical sequence, and some of these were shown to be specifically activated by cells expressing MR1 by transfection (9Treiner E. Duban L. Moura I.C. Hansen T. Gilfillan S. Lantz O. Microbes Infect. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tilloy F. Treiner E. Park S.H. Garcia C. Lemonnier F. de la Salle H. Bendelac A. Bonneville M. Lantz O. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1907-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In addition to difficulties in obtaining MAIT cells, MR1 poses its own challenges for investigation. Most notably, endogenous expression of MR1 has not been defined, and thus far there is no direct evidence that MR1 binds a ligand and, if so, what its chemical nature might be. Cells transfected or transduced with mMR1 cDNA were shown to express low levels of MR1 on the surface; however, most MR1 protein remained intracellular (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with, but not evidential of ligand limiting MR1 expression. Furthermore, the low level of MR1 protein detected on the cell surface after transfection/transduction was augmented by swapping the α3 domain of mMR1 with that of the classical class I molecule H-2Ld (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of insect cell expressed recombinant MR1 protein demonstrated stoichiometric association with β2m and provided evidence for N-linked glycosylation analogous to that found in all class Ia molecules (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These MR1 expression studies used either (i) anti-epitope tag mAb 64-3-7 that is specific for “open” (not associated with ligand) forms as shown with class Ia molecules and H2-M3 (25Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R. Virgin H.W. Hansen T.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Smith J.D. Myers N.B. Gorka J. Hansen T.H. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5656-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or (ii) mAb 4E3 generated in β2m-deficient mice immunized with a peptide derived from the α2 domain of mMR1. Given this, we questioned whether ligand associated or folded MR1 was missed in our detection system. Indeed, a soluble ectodomain of recombinant MR1 was secreted by insect cells, suggesting that it was folded. And this recombinant MR1 was detected by mAb 64-3-7 only after denaturation, consistent with MR1 folding into a 64-3-7 negative conformer, analogous to class Ia molecules when they undergo peptide-induced folding (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, we have thus far been unable to define a conventional peptide ligand bound to recombinant MR1. 2S. Gilfillan, O. Lantz, D. H. Fremont, and T. Hansen, unpublished observations. Related to this uncertainty regarding an MR1 ligand is the question of whether MAIT cell activation is ligand-dependent. To better characterize MR1 function in inducing MAIT activation and the possible requirement for a potential ligand, we generated new mAbs against MR1 by immunizing MR1 knockout mice with recombinant MR1 protein. Importantly these new mAbs to MR1 detected a folded conformer of MR1 missed in previous investigations. These new mAbs were used to show that only folded MR1 activated both MAIT cells tested. Furthermore, a panel of MR1 mutants were used to (i) indicate that the TCR of MAIT cells engages MR1 in a very similar orientation as that previously reported for αβTCR/MHC engagements and (ii) make predictions about how MR1 interacts with a putative ligand that controls its expression and MAIT cell activation.

All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM (Invitrogen) media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.25 mm HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin.

Packaging cells were transfected using Fu-GENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Virus-containing supernatants were collected 48–72 h post transfection, and 2–3 ml was added to target cells (≈106) per infection. Cells were selected and maintained under 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) or 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin (Sigma) post-transduction. These transduced cells were maintained as a single population with stable expression of the targeted protein for more than 6 months in culture. mAb—mAb 4E3 was produced in β2m-deficient mice immunized against a peptide corresponding to MR1 residues 130–153 (3Miley M.J.

Hybridomas were generated by fusing splenocytes with Sp2/0 cells, and supernatants were initially screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on plates coated with either hMR1/hβ2m or hβ2m alone. Those clones that recognized hMR1/β2m but not hβ2m were then screened by flow cytometry using transfectants expressing hMR1 or mMR1 (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H.

Sequential Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—For sequential immunoprecipitation, mMR1-transfected WT3 cells (107) were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 1.0% digitonin (Wako, Richmond, VA), 20 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h on ice. Non-transfected WT3 cells were used as a control. Saturating amounts of anti-MR1 mAbs 12.2, 26.5, 4E3, or epitope tag mAb 64-3-7 were incubated with protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. The anti-Kb mAb B8–24-3 was used as a negative control for pre-clearance. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline twice, antibody-bound protein G was incubated with post-nuclear lysates for 4 h. To assure complete removal of reactive MR1 molecules the supernatants were subjected to a second pre-clearance with protein G bound by the same antibodies. For the third incubation, the same or an alternative antibody was used to test for the remaining mMR1 proteins in each supernatant. mAb-coated beads were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% digitonin, and proteins were eluted by boiling in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen), and 2-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 1%. Samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described (34Yu Y.Y. Harris M.R. Lybarger L. Kimpler L.A. Myers N.B. Virgin H.W. Hansen T.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For Western blots, biotinylated 64-3-7 was used for MR1 detection. The staining signal was visualized by the chemiluminescence substrate using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mMR1/Ld site-mutation constructs in retroviral vector pMIN were generated using the QuikChange II XL site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each mutation eight clones of carbenicillin (100 μg/ml)-resistant bacteria were screened by DNA sequence analyses for the existence of the desired mutations only. Confirmed constructs were used for virus production and transduction of WT3 cells. Flow Cytometry—For surface staining, 106 cells per sample were incubated on ice in microtiter plates with a saturating concentration of mAb. After washing, phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BD Pharmingen) was used to visualize the primary antibody staining. Intracellular MR1 molecules were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate 64-3-7 as described (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). MAIT Cell Activation and mAb Blocking—Biological activity of IL-2 secreted by MAIT T-T hybridoma lines 8D12 and 6C2 was used to estimate the degree of MAIT cell activation. 105/ml mMR1/Ld-transduced WT3 cells were cultured with 106/ml hybridoma cells in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Purified anti-mMR1 mAbs were added at different concentrations. Supernatants were harvested and frozen at –80 °C for at least 1 h to lyse trace cells that may have carried-over. CTLL-2 cells were washed and added to supernatants at a final cell density of 5 × 103/200 μl/well in a 96-well plate. Triplicate wells were run for each sample. CTLL-2 cells in the absence of culture supernatant were used as the negative control, and the addition of serial IL-2 dilutions was used as positive control. After 18–24 h of incubation, Alamar blue (BioSource international, Carmarillo, CA) was added at 20 μl/well, and relative amounts of IL-2 in each supernatant were determined by fluorescence on a multi-detection microplate reader (Bio-Tek instruments, Winooski, VT). mAbs Detect Two Distinct MR1 Conformers, Analogous to the Ligand Empty (Open) and Ligand-associated (Folded) Class Ia Molecules—We previously reported low levels of surface expression of MR1 by transfection or transduction using the epitope tag mAb 64-3-7 that is specific for non-ligand associated class heavy chains, H2-M3 (25Lybarger L.

Furthermore, we produced anti-mouse MR1 mAb 4E3 by immunizing β2m-deficient mice with a peptide derived from mouse MR1 residues 130–153 (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As expected, both of these mAbs detect denatured mouse MR1 as determined by Western blotting. Thus, we questioned whether we might be missing a population of folded MR1 molecules not detected by either mAb 64-3-7 or 4E3. To purposefully generate mAb to folded MR1, MR1 knock-out mice were immunized with the secreted recombinant ectodomain of human MR1/β2m (3Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hybridoma clones reactive with MR1 were screened and subcloned. Of the eight new anti-MR1 mAbs isolated, five were specific for human MR1 (hMR1), and three (mAbs 12.2, 26.5, and 4) cross-reacted with mouse MR1 (mMR1) as determined by their staining profile on MR1 transfectants (Fig. 1A). The mAbs reactive with mMR1 were selected for characterization in this report. To test whether detection of mMR1 by mAbs 12.2, 26.5, and 4 was conformation-dependent, each mAb was used to precipitate MR1 protein from the WT3.mMR1 cells. These precipitates were then blotted with biotinylated mAb 64-3-7, demonstrating that each mAb precipitated mMR1 protein. However, it should be noted that the signal with 12.2 and 26.5 was consistently stronger than with 4, suggesting mAb 4 is of lower affinity (data not shown). Furthermore, none of these new"

In human primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), IRF-5 is transcribed into four distinct alternatively spliced isoforms (V1, V2, V3, and V4), whereas in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells two additional new isoforms (V5 and V6) were identified. The IRF-5 V1, V2, and V3 transcripts have different noncoding first exons and distinct insertion/deletion patterns in exon 6. Here we showed that V1 and V3 have distinct transcription start sites and are regulated by two discrete promoters. The V1 promoter (P-V1) is constitutively active, contains an IRF-E consensusbinding site, and is further stimulated in virus-infected cells by IRF family members. In contrast, endogenous V3 transcripts were up-regulated by type I Ifns, and the V3 promoter (P-V3) contains an Ifn-stimulated responsive element-binding site that confers responsiveness to Ifn through binding of the ISGF3 complex. In addition to V5 and V6, we have identified three more alternatively spliced IRF-5 isoforms (V7, V8, and V9); V5 and V6 were expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors and in immortalized B and T cell malignancies, whereas expression of V7, V8, and V9 transcripts were detected only in human cancers. The results of this study demonstrated the existence of multiple IRF-5 spliced isoforms with distinct cell type-specific expression, cellular localization, differential regulation, and dissimilar functions in virus-mediated type I Ifn gene induction.

Nature. 1995; 376: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Although IRF-5 participates in the virus-induced signaling cascade, its expression is also modulated by p53 (12Mori T. Anazawa Y. Iiizumi M. Fukuda S. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2914-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and it has a role in the apoptotic signaling pathway that is p53-independent (10Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IRF-5 modulates the expression of a number of factors involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, independent of viral infection (10Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of IRF-5 to induce expression of proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, and immunomodulation represents an important defense mechanism against extracellular stress, including viral infection. How significant is the overlapping cross-talk between Ifn and apoptotic signaling pathways is currently unknown, yet it has been suggested recently that type I Ifn can also induce p53 (6Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanai H. Stoiber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shibue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2003; 424: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Altogether, the current data suggest an important role for IRF-5 in both Ifn- and p53-mediated signaling pathways. To date, a large number of IRF-5 sequences have been deposited to GenBank™. Most interesting, the first complete coding sequence of human IRF-5, isolated from lymphocytes and deposited in 1996 to GenBank™ (accession number U51127), was not functionally characterized. Subsequently, we had cloned two new isoforms of IRF-5, here termed variants 3 (V3; GenBank™ accession number AY504946) and 4 (V4; GenBank™ accession number AY504947) from a dendritic cell library (7Barnes B.J. Moore P.M. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 26: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and we have characterized the identical polypeptide they encode (2Barnes B.

In the past 2 years, two additional isoforms, termed variant 1 (V1; isoform a; NM_002200; U51127) and variant 2 (V2; isoform b; NM_032643), have been deposited to GenBank™. These two cDNAs encode proteins distinct from the isoforms 3 and 4 that we have identified, and their functions have yet to be characterized. Sequence analyses of these four isoforms reveal that they differ in their first exon and in the pattern of deletion(s) in exon 6. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA has been described for other IRF family members, including IRF-1, -3, and -7, in which each isoform may be differentially expressed depending on the cell or tissue type (18Harada H.

However, differential isoform expression and regulation of these IRFs at the promoter levels have not been addressed yet, even though the promoters of each have been isolated and partially characterized (23Lowther W.J.

The transcription analyses demonstrate that two distinct promoter regions differentially regulate exon 1 of V1-associated transcripts and exon 1 of V3 transcripts, where the P-V1 promoter responds to viral infection and the P-V3 promoter responds to Ifn stimulation. However, the transcription pattern of the IRF-5 gene is more complex, and we have identified nine distinct alternatively spliced IRF-5 mRNAs (V1–V9). Here we describe the alternative splice patterns of the new IRF-5 isoforms, their cell type-specific expression, localization, inducibility, and function in virus-mediated type I Ifn gene induction. Human HeLa, 293T, A549, and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC). Human fibroblasts (2fTGH) were from G. Stark (Cleveland Clinic), and primary human fibroblasts were from G. Hayward (Johns Hopkins University). These adherent cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Daudi, Namalwa, and BJAB B cell lymphomas, THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia, U937 monocytic lymphoma, and BC-3 and BCBL-1 primary effusion lymphomas (PEL) were from ATCC and cultivated in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), monocytes (MO), natural killer (NK), and B and T cells were isolated and purified as described previously (26Izaguirre A.

PDC (Lin–, CD123+, CD11c–, and human leukocyte antigen-DR+ cells) were isolated by using BDCA-4 microbeads, MO by using CD14 beads, NK by using CD16 beads, T cells by using CD3 beads, and B cells by using CD19 beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cell purities were all greater than 95%, as determined by flow cytometry. The human studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the New Jersey Medical School. Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) was obtained from the ATCC (VR-699); vesicular stomatitis virus was from P. Marcus (University of Connecticut); recombinant Ifn-α2B was purchased from Schering Plough (Kenilworth, NJ), and Ifn-γ was from R&D Systems, Inc. Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) strain 2931 was originally obtained from Carlos Lopez then of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research (New York, NY); CpG (ODN 2336) was from the Coley Pharmaceutical Group (Wellesly, MA); Resiquimod (R848) was from GLSynthesis Inc. (Worcester, MA). The 5′ ends of the IRF-5 mRNAs were determined by using RNA from unstimulated or Ifnα2-stimulated (500 units/ml for 16 h) BJAB cells using the 5′/3′-RACE Kit, 2nd Generation (Roche Applied Science), as described by the manufacturer. For amplification from each first exon (Ex1), the RACEV1R primer was used for Ex1V1, RACEV2R for Ex1V2, and RACEV3R for Ex1V3 (primers 1–3, Table I). RNA was reverse-transcribed using these three primers that are specific for each first exon, with subsequent RNase I degradation of the RNA template. Following the addition of a homopolymeric A-tail to the antisense strand of the 5′ end of cDNAs, the tailed cDNA was amplified using a sense oligo(dT)-anchor primer and the same antisense primers specific for each first exon as named above. A second nested PCR was then performed using the oligo(dT)-anchor primer and a nested antisense primer specific for each first exon (primers 4–6, Table I). PCRs were carried out using Pfu proofreading polymerase for the generation of blunt-ended products, and an initial 2-min denaturation step at 94 °C followed by 10 cycles of successive incubations at 94 °C (15 s), 70 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min) and 15 cycles of successive incubations at 94 °C (15 s), 70 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (initially 40 s with an increase of 20 s in each successive cycle), and a final 7-min elongation at 72 °C. PCR products were either electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel or cloned in the pCR 4Blunt-TOPO vector using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen) and sequenced.Table IPrimers and oligonucleotidesNameSequence (5′ → 3′)1RACEV1RTGTCTGCGGTGCGCCTGCGTGG2RACEV2RCGAGCTCGCTTTCCAGGCGCAGCT3RACEV3RGGGGTTGCACCTGCCTAGTGCCG4RACEV1R-NCCAAGCTGAGCTCTGCCCAGGCT5RACEV2R-NCGCTTTCCAGGCGCAGCTGGAC6RACEV3R-NGCCTAGTGCCGCCTCTGAGCTGC7PIRF5-F14GGGGTACCCCGGGGAGGGAAGGTCAAAGTTC8PIRF5-R9CCGCTCGAGCCGGTGACATCAGCCAGTGAG9PIRF5-F7CGACGCGTCGCTCAGCCCGGATCTCCAGTTGC10PIRF5-R3CGACGCGTCGGTGCCACAGCAGTCCTAGTAAG11PRIF5-F2GGGGTACCCCCTTACTAGGACTGCTGTGGCAC12PIRF5-R4CCGCTCGAGCGGGAGAGGTAAGGCCGGCCCTTGCCTG13PIRF5-F1GGGGTACCCCCGACACATTCACTTCTGATGGG14PIRF5-R1CCGCTCGAGCGGCCTTGAAGATGGTGTTATCTCC15PIRF5-IRFE-MSGGAAATCAGACATCAAAATTGCCACCCGCTGAATTTTCC16PIRF5-IRFE-MASGGAAAATTCAGCGGGTGGCAATTTTGATGTCTGATTTCC17PIRF5-ISRE-MSGGCTGGGGCAGAAGCCGGAACTGAGCCC18PIRF5-ISRE-ASGGGCTCAGTTCCGGCTTCTGCCCCAGCC19IRF5 FA5′AGACCAAGCTTTTCAGCCTGG20IRF5 F3′AAGCGGCCGCGCCTTGTTATTGCATGCCAGC21PIRF5V1-F77CCTGGCGCAGCCACGCAGGCGCA22PIRF5V2-F13GCGCCTGGAAAGCGAGCTCG23PIRF5V3-F25CTAGGCAGGTGCAACCCCAAAA24PIRF5-R7CCAAAAGAGTAATCCTCAGGG25IRF5ex6 5′TTGCCAAGCCTGAGCCTCACA26IRF5 ex6 3′CTTGATCTCCAGGTCGGTCA27IRF5 FB3′AAGCGGCCGCGCCTTGTTATTGCATGCCAGC28ISRE-S-BGGAGGCTGGGGCAAGGAAATTGAAACTTGAGCCCGC29ISRE-AS-BGCGGGCTCAAGTTTCAATTTCCTTGCCCCAGCCTCC30IRF5-ISRE-S-BGGAGGCTGGGGCAGAAAGCGGAACTGAGCCCGC31IRF5-ISRE-AS-BGCGGGCTCAGTTCCGCTTTCTGCCCCAGCCTCC Open table in a new tab Genomic DNA was prepared from human BJAB cells. PCR was used to amplify the P-V1, P-V2, P-V3, and P-Ex2 5′-flanking regions (Fig. 1A) from the genomic BJAB DNA using, respectively, the following primers: PIRF5-F14 and PIRF5-R9, PIRF5-F7 and PIRF5-R3, PIRF5-F2 and PIRF5-R4, PIRF5-F1 and PIRF5-R1 (primers 7–14, Table I). All fragments were cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pGL-3 basic vector (Promega) with the exception of the P-V2 fragment, which was cloned into the MluI site of the same vector. Nucleotide sequences for P-V1 (AY519977) and P-V3 (AY519978) were deposited to GenBank™. The P-V1 and P-V3 constructs were used to generate the mutation constructs P-V1-IRFE-M and P-V3-ISRE-M (primers 15–18, Table I). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers' specifications. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using oligo(dT) primers. From this mixture of cDNAs, IRF-5, IRF-7, IfnA, IfnB, and β-actin cDNA were amplified by PCR as described (7Barnes B.J. Moore P.M. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 26: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (primers 19 and 20, Table I) used to detect all known IRF-5 isoforms bind to a region in the carboxyl terminus spanning exons 7–9. For screening of IRF-5 isoform expression associated with a specific exon 1, sense primers that were specific for each first exon and a common antisense primer that results in amplification through exon 4 were used (Fig. 1B). IRF-5 V1 cDNA was amplified with PIRF5V1-F77 (specific to Ex1V1), V2 cDNA with PIRF5-F13 (specific to Ex1V2), or V3 cDNA with PIRF5V3-F25 (specific to Ex1V3) and PIRF5-R7 (exon 4 specific) primers (primers 21–24, Table I). Optimal PCR cycling conditions for the V1, V2, and V3 transcripts were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C (4 min); 37 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 63.9 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min 30 s); and 1 cycle at 72 °C (5 min). For the determination of exon 6 patterning in various cell types, primers that amplify exon 5 (primer 25) through exon 7 (primer 26) were used. Optimal PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C (4 min); 40 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 63.9 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min 30 s); and 1 cycle 72 °C (5 min). In order to distinguish between V1- and V4-specific expression and to determine expression of new IRF-5 variants associated with their specific deletion/insertion pattern(s) in exons 5–7, exons 1–7 were amplified with each specific exon 1 sense primer (primers 21–23, Table I and Fig. 1B) and a common antisense primer (primer 26, Table I and Fig. 1B). Optimal PCR conditions were identical to the exon 1–4 PCR amplification, except 37 cycles were used. PCR products were either electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and/or cloned to the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-5 (V3 and V4), and IRF-7 expression vectors were described (7Barnes B.J. Moore P.M. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Full-length IRF-5 V2 was subcloned from the pOTB7 plasmid (Open Biosystems) to pCMV-tag2b (Stratagene Inc.) at EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. For the cloning of new IRF-5 isoforms, total RNA was isolated from PBMC or THP-1 cells. Superscript one-step PCR was performed using a Pfu proofreading polymerase with sense primers specific to each first exon (primers 21–23, Table I) and a common antisense primer that results in amplification through exon 9 (primer 27, Table I). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized at 45 °C (30 min) and 94 °C (2 min). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 35 cycles 94 °C (30 s), 57 °C (30 s), and 68 °C (2 min 30 s); 1 cycle 72 °C (10 min). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel, purified, and either cloned directly to the pCR 4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced or end conversion was performed, and the PCR product was cloned directly to the pSTBlue-1 vector (Novagen) and sequenced. Once full-length positive clones were identified through sequencing, each IRF-5 isoform cDNA was then subcloned to the pCMV-Tag2b mammalian FLAG-tagged expression vector (Stratagene). IRF-5 isoforms were also cloned to pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) at EcoRI and SalI sites. Nucleotide sequences (V5, accession number AY693665; V6, accession number AY693666; V7, accession number AY693667; V8, accession number AY693668; and V9, accession number AY693669) were deposited to GenBank™. Biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides were annealed with the corresponding sense oligonucleotides (primers 28–31, Table I). Briefly, 4 μg of biotinylated DNA was incubated with 100 μg of DynaBeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal Inc.) for 16 h in 200 μl of TEN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl), and unbound DNA was removed by extensive washing. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (29Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ISGF3γp48, STAT1, and STAT2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Signals were visualized using the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Purified PBMC, PDC, MO, NK, and B and T cells were stimulated with either Ifn-α2B (10,000 IU), HSV-1 (multiplicity of infection of 1), or CpG DNA (40 μg/ml) for 6 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. BJAB and Daudi were stimulated with Ifn-α2 (1000 units/ml) for 16 h; Daudi and THP-1 were infected with NDV (240 plaque-forming units) for 16 h; THP-1 was stimulated with VSV (multiplicity of infection of 2) or R848 (10 μm) for 16 h. 2fTGH cells were transiently transfected with gfp-IRF-5 variant expression plasmids using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 30 h and then examined by fluorescent microscopy using a Nikon TE-200 and DXM12000F at ×40 magnification. Dual Luciferase Assay—293T, 2fTGH, or HeLa cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes using SuperFect. 2 μg of the reporter plasmid DNA and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV (internal control; Promega) were used for each transfection. In co-transfection experiments a 1:1 ratio of the reporter and expression plasmid (2 μg each) were used. The final concentration of transfected DNA was kept constant in all co-transfection assays. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection unless additional treatments were performed. For further treatments, cells were split 12–16 h post-transfection into 6-well plates and incubated for another 8 h, after which medium was replaced either with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing recombinant Ifn-α2 (500 units/ml), Ifn-γ (1000 units/ml), or NDV (50 μl/ml). Treatments/infections were incubated an additional 16 h, and cells were then harvested and lysed with 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay according to manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were carried out using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). Experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. SAP Assay—2 × 105 2fTGH or 2fTGH/IRF-5 V3 (7Barnes B.J. Moore P.M. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Equal amounts of the indicated SAP reporter plasmids and IRF5-expressing plasmids were co-transfected with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid (50 ng). Transfected cells were split 16 h later, incubated for an additional 6 h, and either left uninfected or infected with NDV for another 16 h. The SAP was determined as described (29Yeow W.S. Au W.C.

Acute HE results in increased brain ammonia (up to 5 mm), astrocytic swelling, and altered glutamatergic function. In the present study, using fluorescence imaging techniques, acute exposure (10 min) of ammonia ((NH4+/NH3)) to cultured astrocytes resulted in a concentration-dependent, transient increase in [Ca2+]i.

A deregulation of glutamate release from astrocytes by ammonia could contribute to glutamate dysfunction consistently observed in acute HE. Hyperammonemia consequently leads to increased concentrations of ammonia, up to 5 mm, in the brain. This high level of brain ammonia is a key factor in the pathogenesis of central nervous system dysfunction in acute and chronic liver failure. The nature and severity of the central nervous system disorder mainly depend upon the degree and acuteness of the onset of hyperammonemia (1Felipo V. Butterworth R.F. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Acute liver failure (ALF) 1The abbreviations used are: ALF, acute liver failure; HE, hepatic encephalopathy; GPT, glutamate pyruvate transaminase; AM, acetoxymethylester; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-carboxyfluorescein; TBOA, dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TMA, trimethylamine; DHK, dihydrokainate. resulting from viral infections or toxic liver injury is a life-threatening condition where hepatic encephalopathy (HE) develops rapidly and mortality rates are high due to brain stem herniation caused by increased intracranial pressure, a fatal consequence of cytotoxic brain edema. Excess ammonia is toxic to the brain resulting in deleterious effects, by both direct and indirect mechanisms, on cerebral metabolism and neurotransmission. Over the past 10 years, there has been an increasing body of evidence demonstrating that ammonia toxicity is involved in alterations of glutamatergic synaptic regulation which is implicated in the pathophysiology of HE in ALF. Several reports have consistently described increased extracellular concentrations of brain glutamate in different models of experimental ALF (2Bosman D.K. Deutz N.E.P. Maas M.A.W. van Eijk H.M.H.

Res. 1999; 56: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, neither the cell type nor the underlying release mechanisms have been identified. One possible explanation for the increased extracellular glutamate may be ammonia's inhibitory effects on the glutamate transporter system in astrocytes. It has been shown that ammonia inhibits glutamate uptake into astrocytes in vitro (6Chan H. Hazell A.S. Desjardins P. Butterworth R.F. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and decreases protein and gene expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 (EAAT-2) in the frontal cortex of rats with ALF (7Knecht K. Michalak A. Rose C. Rothstein J.D. Butterworth R.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The role of ammonia in the glutamatergic dysfunction demonstrated in HE is supported with a positive correlation between extracellular brain concentrations of glutamate and arterial ammonia concentrations in ALF in rats (4Michalak A. Rose C. Butterworth J. Butterworth R.F. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 908-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, using mild hypothermia as a treatment in rats with ALF, extracellular brain glutamate concentrations were normalized concomitantly with a lowering of brain ammonia (8Rose C. Michalak A. Rambaldi A. Chatauret N. Pannunzio M. Butterworth R.F. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Glutamate has been demonstrated to be an important signaling molecule for neuron-glia communication. Astrocytes express receptors and transporters for glutamate and recently have also been demonstrated to contain the protein machinery necessary to release glutamate by exocytosis through vesicles (9Bezzi P. Gundersen V. Galbete J.L. Seifert G. Steinhauser C. Pilati E. Volterra A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and a fusion-related mechanism (10Zhang Q.

Glia. 2004; 46: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Overall, astrocytes have many characteristics that were previously considered exclusive for neurons and are therefore actively involved in cell signaling by releasing glutamate. Astrocytic glutamate release is calcium-dependent and can be triggered by any ligand that stimulates an increase in [Ca2+]i, such as bradykinins (12Parpura V. Basarsky T.A. Liu F. Jeftinija K. Jeftinija S. Haydon P.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar), prostaglandins (13Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D. Rizzini B.L. Pozzan T.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 664-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Even a spontaneous [Ca2+]i increase leads to glutamate release from astrocytes (16Pasti L. Zonta M. Pozzan T. Vicini S. Carmignoto G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 477-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A rapid increase in ammonia results in an increase in pHi (intracellular alkanization) in all cell types, including astrocytes (17Marcaggi P. Coles J.A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 157-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been also demonstrated that intracellular alkalinization is accompanied with an increase in [Ca2+]i in cultured acinar cells (18Speake T. Elliot A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 415-430Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in enthothelial cells (19Danthuluri N.R. Kim D. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19071-19076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in pituitary cells (20Shorte S.L. Collingridge G.L. Randall A.D. Chappell J.B. Schofield J.G. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and in neurons (21Mironov S.L. Lux H.D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ammonia-induced intracellular alkalinization has been demonstrated to increase [Ca2+]i in microglia initiating Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive stores (22Minelli A. Lyons S. Nolte C. Verkhratsky A. Kettenmann H. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 370-377PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of our study was to investigate whether ammonia-induced intracellular alkalinization could have an effect on [Ca2+]i signaling in astrocytes and furthermore study whether the effects of ammonia could play a pathophysiological role in glutamate release from astrocytes. Preparation of Cultured Astrocytes—Astrocytes were prepared from cortex of newborn NMRI mice as described previously (23Lyons S. Kettenmann H.K. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical tissue was carefully dissected from blood vessels and meninges, rinsed with basal medium eagle solution, and incubated with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution for 8 min at 37 °C, trypsinized, and gently triturated with a fire-polished pipette in the presence of 0.05% DNase (Worthington). After washing cells twice, cells were cultured in 75-cm2 plates on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips using cultured basal medium Eagle's/10% fetal calf serum. One day later, cultures were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove cellular debris and maintained for 4 days. After reaching subconfluent state, cellular debris, microglia cells, oligodendrocytes as well as their early precursor cells were dislodged by manual shaking and removed by washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The purity of the astrocytes was routinely determined by immunofluorescence using a polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), a specific astrocyte marker. The cultures showed more than 90% cells positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Measurements were made from cells between days 11 and 15. Solutions—All solutions were freshly prepared from refrigerated stock solutions. The standard bath solution was composed of 150 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 by NaOH. To obtain calcium-free solution, CaCl2 was omitted, replaced with equivalent amount of MgCl2 and 1 mm of EGTA (calcium chelator) was added. For ammonia and trimethylamine solutions, NH4Cl or TMACl were added to the solution by replacing an equivalent amount of NaCl. Fluorescence Imaging System—Cells were visualized under water immersion with a ×40 objective (numerical aperture 0.9) from a perfusion chamber mounted on a stage with an upright microscope (Axioskop FS, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cells were superfused with standard physiological bath solution, and cell stimulation was achieved by changing the perfusate with ammonia or trimethylamine solution. Excitation light was provided by a monochromator (TILL Photonics, Munich, Germany), and the fluorescence emission was captured by a cooled CCD camera (SensiCam; PCO, Kelheim, Germany) and digitized by an image processing system (TILLVision; TILL Photonics, Munich, Germany). The monochromator and CCD camera were controlled by TILLVision software, which was used for image analysis. Ratio images were collected at intervals every 1 s. Measurement of Extracellular Glutamate—Glutamate levels were detected using an enzymatic assay (13Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D. Rizzini B.L. Pozzan T. Volterra A. Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 24Ayoub G.S. Copenhagen D.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Nicholls D.G.

In the presence of glutamate, GDH reduces NAD+ to NADH (Fig. 6 (inset), Reaction 1), a product that fluoresces when excited by UV light (360 nm). Provided that GDH and NAD+ are present in the cell medium, any glutamate released from the astrocytes into the medium will be detected as an increase in NADH fluorescence. NADH production can be amplified by adding glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alanine (see Fig. 6 (inset), Reaction 2) to the medium. The newly formed α-ketoglutarate (from Reaction 1), driven by excess of supplied alanine, produces glutamate and pyruvate, forming a cycle and amplifying the NADH production (fluorescence). Cells were bathed in a solution containing GDH (∼70 units/ml), 1 mm NAD+, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, and 10 mm glucose, with a pH of 7.4. When GPT (∼23 units/ml) and alanine (1 mm) were added, adjustments with glucose were made to correct for osmolarity measured by a freezing point osmometer (model 5002; Precision Instruments, Natick, MA). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C) using confluent astrocytic cultures. To estimate the extracellular levels of glutamate, known concentrations of glutamate were applied by pipette using cell-free buffer in the presence of GDH (or GDH + GPT), NAD+, and alanine. The flow of the solution was stopped to allow NADH to accumulate in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. With GDH alone, the amplitude of the fluorescent signal reached a peak after 20–30 s and sustained. With GDH + GPT, the amplitude of the fluorescent signal never reached a plateau, and therefore to be able to compare both assays, fluorescence was measured after 10 min for all experiments. The approximate concentration of glutamate released from cells was estimated from the respective standard curves. Data are expressed as NADH formation (percentage of base line), where base line represents the fluorescence level of the optical field before cell stimulation, the sum of fluorescence emitted from GDH + NAD+ along with basal NADH (either as a contaminant or because of enzymatic activity). Data were collected from at least three different cultures. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—Cultured astrocytes on coverslips were incubated with 5 μm fura-2/acetoxymethylester (AM) for 20 min in physiological buffer in the dark at room temperature. Cells were then washed with physiological buffer and stored in the dark for an additional 20 min to ensure fura-2/AM hydrolysis. Coverslips with loaded cells were transferred to the perfusion chamber and visualized under the microscope. Fura-2, a ratiometric dye, was excited with UV light at 340 and 380 nm, and the emission was measured at 530 ± 10 nm. The [Ca2+]i was calculated from the ratio of fluorescence recorded at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths using the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i = Kdβ(R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R); where R = F340/F380, Rmin is the fluorescence ratio of calcium-free/fura-2 and Rmax is the ratio of calcium-bound/fura-2. The constant Kdβ was determined empirically. The system was calibrated in situ by employing an ionomycin-based intracellular calibration procedure as described previously (27Usachev Y. Schmigol A. Pronchuk N. Kostyuk P. Verkhratsky A. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The parameters Kdβ, Rmin, and Rmax characterizing the system were 1.6, 0.2, and 2.1 μm, respectively. Measurement of Intracellular pH—For measurements of pHi the H+-sensitive fluorophore 2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) was used. Cultured astrocytes on coverslips were incubated at room temperature in the dark with a 5 μm concentration of the membrane-permeant BCECF/AM in physiological buffer for 15 min and then washed and stored in the dark for an additional 15 min to ensure BCECF/AM hydrolysis; BCECF, a ratiometric dye was measured at excitation wavelengths 440 and 488 nm. Emission was measured at 530 ± 10 nm. An acid pH shift is demonstrated with a decrease in BCECF fluorescence. Calibrations of pHi with different pH solutions (6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0) were made in the presence of high K+ (105 mm) solution containing nigericin (10 μm) (28Boyarsky G. Ransom B. Schlue W-R. Davis M.B.E. Boron W.F. Glia. 1993; 8: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Each calibration was repeated three times with 20–30 cells from different cultures. Glutamate Transporter Inhibitors—To block glutamate release, cells were pretreated, for 5 and 10 min prior to the experiments, with dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), an EAAT-1 glutamate transporter inhibitor, and dihydrokainate (DHK), an EAAT-2 glutamate transporter inhibitor at a final concentration of 10 and 100 μm, respectively. TBOA and DHK are nonsubstrate glutamate transporter inhibitors. An important functional distinction between substrate and non-substrate inhibitors is that substrate inhibitors can induce release of excitatory amino acids by heteroexchange or exchange with an intracellular transporter substrate. Nonsubstrate inhibitors block uptake reversal through transporters by binding at the extracellular surface and therefore are not transported (29Anderson C.M. Bridges R.J. Chamberlin A.R. Shimamoto K. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), preventing glutamate from being transported into and out of the cell. Materials—Fura-2/AM, BCECF/AM, and BAPTA/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). NH4Cl, TMA/Cl, GDH (G2626), GPT (G7003), NAD+ (N7004), alanine, nigericin, ionomycin, thapsigargin, TBOA, and DHK were obtained from Sigma. (NH4+/NH3)Triggers a Transient Increase in [Ca2+]i—Extracellular application of ammonia chloride ((NH4+/NH3)) (5 mm) at pH 7.4 triggered a transient increase in [Ca2+]i in cultured mouse astrocytes measured with the cell permeant calcium-sensitive fluorophore fura-2/AM (Fig. 1). An increase in [Ca2+]i peaked within ∼1 min and returned to base line within 5–8 min in the continuous presence of(NH4+/NH3)(Fig. 2A). The absolute amplitude increase was, on average, 66.3 ± 4.4 nm (n = 217) (Fig. 2D). Higher concentrations of(NH4+/NH3)(10 and 20 mm) elicited a response with similar time course but with a higher amplitude, whereas(NH4+/NH3)at 1 mm did not stimulate a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2D). To test whether(NH4+/NH3)-stimulated [Ca2+]i transients could occur from an already elevated level of(NH4+/NH3), astrocytes were bathed in 1 mm(NH4+/NH3)and then stimulated with 6 mm(NH4+/NH3)(Fig. 2C); this resulted in a similar [Ca2+]i transient as observed when(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) was applied to a physiological bathing solution. (NH4+/NH3)-triggered Increase in [Ca2]i Is Due to Release from Internal Stores—To test for the source of calcium, we compared [Ca2+]i responses to applications of(NH4+/NH3)in physiological and calcium-free bathing solutions.(NH4+/NH3)triggered similar calcium responses in the calcium-free bathing solution as compared with physiological (control) solution with respect to amplitude and time course and was effective at 5, 10, and 20 mm (Fig. 2B) but not 1 mm (Fig. 2D). To support the view that(NH4+/NH3)triggered calcium release from internal calcium stores, we used a paradigm to deplete endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores; in the presence of thapsigargin (500 nm), a blocker for calcium transport into the ER stores, we applied ATP (100 μm) to further deplete ER stores. As shown before (30Salter M.W. Hicks J.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ATP triggered a large increase in [Ca2+]i, and typically all subsequent metabotropic responses were abolished in the continuous presence of thapsigargin. When(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) was applied following this paradigm and still in the presence of thapsigargin, it failed to elicit a calcium response (n = 91) (Fig. 3). We conclude that(NH4+/NH3)triggers calcium release from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores. TMA+/TMA, Another Weak Base, Mimics(NH4+/NH3)-triggered [Ca2+]i Increase and Alkaline Shift—An increase of(NH4+/NH3)has been described to result in an alkalinization of the cell plasma in most cells, including astrocytes (31Rose C.R. Ransom B.R. Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and Brain Function. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 253-275Google Scholar). We therefore used another weak base, trimethylamine chloride (TMA+/TMA), to mimic the alkaline shift and test the impact of this alkalinization on [Ca2+]i signaling. We measured intracellular pH using the cell-permeant pH-sensitive fluorophore BCECF/AM.(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) triggered an intracellular alkalinization by 0.44 ± 0.06 pH units (n = 173), and TMA+/TMA (5 mm) triggered one of 0.47 ± 0.05 pH units (n = 151) (Fig. 4, A and B). While in the continuous presence of(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm), pHi returned to basal level within 4–6 min (Fig. 4A), whereas pHi remained elevated for at least 10 min in the continuous presence of TMA+/TMA (5 mm) (Fig. 4B). Both(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) and TMA+/TMA (5 mm) triggered a similar alkaline shift in calcium-free bathing solution.(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) increased pHi by 0.41 ± 0.07 pH units (n = 146), and TMA+/TMA (5 mm) increased pHi by 0.43 ± 0.06 pH units (n = 138). In conclusion, both agents trigger a similar alkaline shift. TMA+/TMA (5 mm) triggered a transient increase in [Ca2+]i with a similar time course as recorded for(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) (Fig. 5A). The amplitude was comparable with that of the(NH4+/NH3)-triggered response, namely 69.9 ± 5.3 nm (n = 132) in physiological (control) and 65.9 ± 4.8 nm (n = 147) in calcium-free buffer (Fig. 5A). We then applied the above described paradigm to depleted ER stores, namely by adding thapsigargin to the bath (500 nm) and briefly applying ATP (100 μm). When TMA+/TMA (5 mm) was added (still in the presence of thapsigargin), it did not trigger a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data indicate that alkaline shifts trigger the release of calcium from cytoplasmic thapsigargin-sensitive stores. An Enzyme-linked Fluorescence Assay Can Record Low Levels of Glutamate in the Presence of(NH4+/NH3)—Glutamate released from cultured astrocytes has previously been recorded using an enzyme-linked fluorescence assay (13Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D. Rizzini B.L. Pozzan T. Volterra A. Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 24Ayoub G.S. Copenhagen D.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Sanchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). With the enzyme GDH and the substrate NAD+ in the extracellular medium, glutamate produces α-ketoglutarate, (NH4+), and NADH (Fig. 6 (inset), Reaction 1). Formation of NADH was recorded as a fluorescence signal when excited at 360 nm, and therefore changes in fluorescence reflect changes in glutamate levels in the bath. However, application of(NH4+/NH3)results in product inhibition, decreasing the formation of NADH. Testing the degree of inhibition, different concentrations of(NH4+/NH3)were applied with various concentrations of glutamate in a medium (without cells) containing NAD+ and GDH.(NH4+/NH3)inhibited the production of NADH in a concentration-dependent manner, at a given (known) concentration of glutamate (Fig. 6A). At 5 μm glutamate, NADH formation was barely detectable. To increase the sensitivity to detect NADH, an enzymatic loop was produced to amplify the NADH production. This was accomplished by adding a second enzyme GPT and alanine (Fig. 6 (inset), Reaction 2). To demonstrate the difference between a nonamplified (GDH only) and an amplified (GDH + GPT) response, typical traces are shown in Fig. 6B with 50 μm of glutamate given in the absence and presence of(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm). In the absence of(NH4+/NH3), a significant increase in NADH formation with GDH + GPT (102%) was found compared with GDH alone (33%).(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) inhibited NADH formation in both assays, GDH and GDH + GPT; however, a significant rise in NADH formation was demonstrated with GDH + GPT (58%) compared with GDH (10%) (Fig. 6B). In the presence of GDH alone, NADH formation reached a plateau within ∼3 min with or without(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm). Since NAD+ is present in excess, this plateau is most probably due to the limited amount of glutamate (i.e. all glutamate given has been converted to α-ketoglutarate). With GDH + GPT, a continuous increase in NADH formation is demonstrated within the observation time of up to 20 min. Eventually, a plateau will be reached when all NAD+ or alanine is converted, but this obviously did not occur within 20 min. This implies that NADH formation must be measured with respect to time, and we chose 10 min as our temporal end point.(NH4+/NH3)at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 20 mm again caused a dose-dependent inhibition; however, the increase in NADH fluorescence was clearly detectable (Fig. 6A). Thus, with the combined enzyme system, GDH + GPT, the level of NADH formation can be measured in response to application of glutamate as low as 500 nm in the presence of(NH4+/NH3)at 1 and 5 mm. A logarithmic standard curve with GDH + GPT demonstrating the inhibition of(NH4+/NH3)at 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mm at different glutamate concentrations is shown in Fig. 6C. Due to the strong inhibition of(NH4+/NH3)at 10 and 20 mm,(NH4+/NH3)at 5 mm was further used to study the effects of ammonia on glutamate release from cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, 5 mm(NH4+/NH3)is the pathophysiological concentration found in the brain in acute HE (32Swain M. Butterworth R.F. Blei A.T. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Application of(NH4+/NH3) and TMA+/TMA Triggers Glutamate Release from Cultured Astrocytes—With GDH + GPT, NAD+, and alanine present in the medium,(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) application to cultured astrocytes resulted in an increase in NADH formation as a measure of glutamate release. In physiological buffer, the basal NADH formation within the 10-min recording period was 9.3 ± 1.5% (n = 19 coverslips). In the presence of(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm), it was significantly higher (23.7 ± 2.5%, n = 26 coverslips, p < 0.01). NADH formation occurred with a small delay after application of(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm). We assume that, in the beginning, NADH levels are too low to be detected by our system, but with further amplification, NADH levels surpassed the threshold of our detection system (Fig. 7A). No significant increase in NADH was seen when a similar volume of physiological buffer (without(NH4+/NH3)) was applied as a control (n = 11 coverslips). Furthermore,(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) did not increase NADH production in the absence of an enzyme-linked fluorescence system (n = 5 coverslips) in the extracellular medium. In contrast to(NH4+/NH3), TMA /TMA is not a product of the enzymatic reaction and thus is not expected to inhibit NADH formation. Fig. 8A displays the relation between NADH formation and glutamate concentration in the presence and absence of TMA+/TMA (5 mm), and as expected, there is no difference. Therefore, TMA+/TMA (5 mm) stimulated a significantly higher increase in NADH formation (40.4 ± 3.8%, n = 28 coverslips, p < 0.01) as compared with control (TMA+/TMA (0 mm); 8.9 ± 1.1%, n = 18 coverslips). In conclusion, both weak bases,(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm) and TMA+/TMA (5 mm), trigger glutamate release from astrocytes. (NH4+/NH3) and TMA+/TMA Stimulate Similar NADH Responses in Calcium-free Buffer, Which Are Attenuated following Pretreatment with BAPTA—We have described above that the(NH4+/NH3)(5 mm)- and TMA+/TMA (5 mm)-triggered alkaline shift a"
https://openalex.org/W2005965349,"The existence of specialized molecular chaperones that interact directly with ribosomes is well established in microorganisms. Such proteins bind polypeptides exiting the ribosomal tunnel and provide a physical link between translation and protein folding. We report that ribosome-associated molecular chaperones have been maintained throughout eukaryotic evolution, as illustrated by Mpp11, the human ortholog of the yeast ribosome-associated J protein Zuo. When expressed in yeast, Mpp11 partially substituted for Zuo by partnering with the multipurpose Hsp70 Ssa, the homolog of mammalian Hsc70. We propose that in metazoans, ribosome-associated Mpp11 recruits the multifunctional soluble Hsc70 to nascent polypeptide chains as they exit the ribosome."

Hirsch D.S. Randazzo P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Arf1, the most studied and abundant isoform, acts mainly at the level of the Golgi complex where it controls the formation of both COPI- and clathrin-coated vesicles. Indeed, Arf1 is required for recruitment of COPI (coatomer) complex and the clathrin adaptors AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4 onto Golgi membranes (2McMahon H.T. Mills I.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Arf6, the most distant isoform, has been involved in plasma membrane/endosome trafficking and cortical actin reorganization (3Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated Arf6 in the regulation of both clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis (4Altschuler Y. Liu S. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J.

Despite a high degree of homology between Arf1 and Arf6 and a similar GTP-dependent membrane association, a direct demonstration of Arf6 involvement in coat recruitment has not yet been obtained. However, it has been recently shown that Arf6, by activation of PI4P5Kinase, could stimulate the membrane association of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 (11Krauss M. Kinuta M. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Takei K. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This Arf6-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) has also been involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis (12Aikawa Y. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, although it is well established that Arf6 participates in membrane trafficking, its precise role remains obscure. Recently, we have shown that the GDP/GTP cycle of Arf6 occurs mainly at the plasma membrane, suggesting that this is where Arf6 functions take place (13Macia E. Luton F. Partisani M. Cherfils J. Chardin P. Franco M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). AP complexes are heterotetrameric proteins that participate in the formation of coated vesicles as well as the selection of cargo molecules (14Kirchhausen T. Cell. 2002; 109: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol.

It is involved in clathrin-coated vesicle formation at the plasma membrane by directly linking the clathrin coat with cargo proteins (16Traub L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3033) Google Scholar). In this study, we looked for a possible interaction between Arf6 and the clathrin-adaptor AP-2 complex. We demonstrated that both in vitro and in vivo Arf6 interacts with AP-2 in a GTP-dependent manner but not with AP-1. We also found that phosphoinositides and Arf6GTP strongly cooperate to recruit AP-2 to the membrane. We then studied the role of Arf6 in clathrin-mediated transferrin receptor endocytosis. We demonstrated that Arf6 is involved in the early stages of clathrin-mediated receptor internalization. Our results suggest that Arf6 is involved in the clathrin-mediated receptor internalization by directly controlling AP-2 assembly onto the plasma membrane. Materials—Azolectin, egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), liver phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), brain phosphatidylserine (PS) were purchased from Sigma.

The following antibodies were used: rat and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for HA epitope (clone 3F10 and 12CA5, (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), mouse mAb against Myc epitope (clone 9E10 Roche Diagnostics), mouse mAb against the transferring receptor (Tfn-R) (clone H68.4 Zymed Laboratories Inc., CA), and mouse mAb against Arf6 (provided by S. Bourgoin, Sainte-Foy, Canada). Mouse mAb against α-adaptin and γ-adaptin (BD Biosciences,) fluorescein isothiocyanate, and Texas-Red-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—BHK cells plated on 11-mm round glass coverslips were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 HA-tagged Arf6 constructs using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (18Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy analysis was carried out with a Leica TCS-SP microscope equipped with a mixed gas argon/krypton laser (Leica Microsystems). Measurement of Tfn Uptake and Recycling—Iron-saturated human Tfn was iodinated to a specific activity of ∼10.106 cpm/μg using ICl as described previously (19Breitfeld P.P. Harris J.M. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For internalization, radiolabeled Tfn ([125I]Tfn) (2.106 cpm/sample) was bound to HeLa cells (0.5 × 106 cells/sample) on ice for 2 h in MEM containing 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH7.4, and 0.6% bovine serum albumin (MEM/BSA). The cells were washed twice in cold MEM/BSA to remove unbound [125I]Tfn and then incubated at 37 or 25 °C, as indicated, to allow internalization. At the indicated times, the cells were rapidly cooled on ice. [125I]Tfn was stripped from the cell surface by incubating the cells for 3 min at 4 °C with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.6, 150 mm NaCl. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) to determine the intracellular [125I]Tfn. The total [125I]Tfn initially bound to the cells includes the acid-stripped ligand from the cell surface and the cell-associated ligand not sensitive to acid treatment (endocytosed). The values are given as a percentage of the total [125I]Tfn. For recycling, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with [125I]Tfn (2.106 cpm/sample) in MEM/BSA and then cooled down on ice to stop endocytosis. The cells were washed, and surface-bound [125I]Tfn was removed by incubating the cells for 2 min at 4 °C with 100 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.6, and 150 mm NaCl. After three washes in ice-cold MEM/BSA, the cells were further incubated at 25 °C to allow for Tfn recycling. At the indicated times, the medium was collected and replaced by a fresh one. After the last time point, the cells were lysed to recover the intracellular [125I]Tfn. The total [125I]Tfn includes ligand recovered from the medium (recycled) and cell-associated ligand. Measurements were plotted as a percentage of the total [125I]Tfn. The percentage of the spontaneous release that occurred between 0 and 30 s of the non-efficiently stripped plasma membrane [125I]Tfn (∼10% of the total) was substracted from each time point. Error bars represent the range in duplicate experiments. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—BHK-21 cells (2 × 106cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes) were transfected with myc-Arf6Q67L or myc-Arf6T44N constructs. 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min; aliquots of each supernatant were kept for analysis. Thereafter, 5 μg of 9E10 antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL4B were added to the clarified lysates for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed in lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 12–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. GST Pull-down Experiments—GST, GST-Arf6, or GST-Arf1 (3 μm) loaded with 0.1 mm GDP or GTPγS at 1 μm free Mg2+ for 30 min at 37 °C were bound to glutathione beads and incubated with 3 mg/ml rat brain extract (in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH7,4, 160 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 4 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the beads were washed twice and eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and AP-2 was detected by Western blotting using anti-α adaptin antibody. Protein Purification—For production of myristoylated Arf6, Bl21(DE3) bacteria were cotransformed with pET-21b-Arf6 and pBB131 containing yeast myristoyl-transferase (20Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Recombinant myristoylated Arf6 with the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag was prepared as previously described (21Chavrier P. Franco M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) followed by adsorption to His-bind resin (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose; Qiagen). Thereafter, the protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) in 10% glycerol. After gel filtration on NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), proteins were conserved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6 μm GTP. We and others (11Krauss M. Kinuta M. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Takei K. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have observed that the addition of a hexa-His tag does not modify the biochemical properties of Arf6 (GTP-dependent membrane binding, spontaneous and guanine nucleotide exchange factor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange activity, GAP sensitivity and effector interaction). Amino-terminally truncated (Δ13)Arf6 mutant was purified as described previously (22Macia E. Chabre M. Franco M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24925-24930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant Arf6 or Arf1 GST fusion proteins were purified from bacteria according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of AP-1 and AP-2 complexes were performed essentially as described previously (23Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rat brain cytosol and P2′ fractions were prepared as described earlier (24Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Liposome Binding Assays—Large unilamellar vesicles of azolectin were prepared as previously described (25Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles of defined composition were prepared by extrusion through a 0.4-μm pore size polycarbonate filter as described previously (26Macia E. Paris S. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). (Isopore, Millipore). After extrusion, the sucrose-loaded vesicles were diluted five times in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4 and 100 mm NaCl, centrifuged for 20 min at 400,000 × g (in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor) and resuspended in the same buffer. We made a range of vesicles based on two neutral phospholipids, 40% PC and 30% PE, and as indicated in the figure legend, we added 30% PS or 30% PS + 2% (if no other indication) of phosphoinositides (PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2, or PI(3,4,5)P3). For the binding assays, rat brain cytosol (0.5 mg/ml) or purified AP-1 or AP-2 (0.4 μm) were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in a 70-μl final volume of HNM buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mg/ml phospholipid vesicles. To test the effect of Arf6 on the membrane recruitment of AP-2, recombinant myristoylated Arf6 or recombinant amino-terminally deleted (Δ13)Arf6 mutant (1.5 μm unless otherwise indicated) were added to the incubation. After centrifugation for 20 min at 40,000 revolutions/min (TLA 100.1 Beckman rotor) at 4 °C, the lipid pellet was resuspended in the same volume of HNM buffer. The proportion of proteins in the pellet and in the supernatant was analyzed by Sypro-Orange staining after SDS-PAGE using a fluorescence imaging system. (LAS 3000, Fujifilm). MyrArf6GTP Recruits Specifically the AP-2 Complex onto Phospholipid Liposomes—By analogy with Arf1, which interacts with AP-1, -3, and -4, we studied the possibility that Arf6 recruits AP-2 to the lipid membrane. To address this question, a rat brain cytosol was incubated with liposomes in the absence or presence of recombinant Arf6 proteins. We used the GTP-loaded Arf6 wild-type and the Arf6 mutants Q67L and T44N that are respectively locked in GTP- and GDP-bound conformations (8D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 13Macia E. Luton F. Partisani M. Cherfils J. Chardin P. Franco M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After incubation and sedimentation of the liposomes, the recruitment of AP-2 was monitored by Western blotting. Fig. 1A shows that AP-2 is associated to lipids only when Arf6GTP is present. This experiment indicates that Arf6GTP induces the membrane recruitment of AP-2. This could result from an Arf6-mediated increase in the synthesis of PIP2 that binds AP-2, or else from the formation of a protein complex between Arf6 and AP-2. Thus, we performed a GST pull-down experiment. We found that GST-Arf6GTP efficiently pulled down AP-2 from a detergent extract of rat brain, suggesting that the two molecules are part of the same complex (Fig. 1B). In contrast, neither the inactive form of Arf6 nor the two conformations of Arf1 were able to pull down the AP-2 complex (Fig. 1B). To look for an eventual direct interaction between Arf6 and AP-2, we performed the liposome binding experiments in presence of the purified proteins. In the absence of Arf6, purified AP-2 adaptors were almost entirely recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 1C). The addition of myristoylated Arf6 locked in the GDP conformation (mArf6T44N) had no effect on the membrane recruitment of AP-2. By contrast, in the presence of myristoylated GTP-loaded Arf6, a fraction of AP-2 complex was found associated with the liposomes. This membrane-bound fraction of AP-2 increased in an Arf6GTP dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). We observed that the addition of a soluble Arf6GTP, the amino-terminally deleted (Δ13)Arf6 mutant, did not recruit AP-2 onto liposomes (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the binding of Arf6 to the membrane is required for AP-2 translocation. Previous studies (27Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) have shown that Arf6 activates some lipid-modifying enzymes, such as the phospholipase D and the phosphatidylinositol-(4)-phosphate 5-kinase (11Krauss M. Kinuta M. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Takei K. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12Aikawa Y. Martin T.F. J.

Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar); the latter leading to the formation of phosphoinositides. Moreover, AP-2 has been shown to bind preferentially to polyphosphoinositides (31Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 32Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J.

Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the effect of different phosphoinositides on the association of AP-2 to liposomes (Fig. 2). In the absence of Arf6, we observed only a small binding of AP-2 to PI(3)P. In contrast, when PIP2 or PIP3 (2%) were incorporated into the liposomes, the binding of AP-2 was strongly increased, PI(4,5)P2 giving the highest binding (∼40% of the AP-2 was associated with PIP(4,5)P2-containing vesicles). Our result confirms that AP-2 specifically recognizes polyphosphoinositides and particularly PIP(4,5)P2. In the presence of Arf6GTP, a very strong binding of AP-2 (∼75%) was observed for the three types of vesicles, PI(3,4)P2 giving the lowest binding. Thus, these results show that Arf6GTP and polyphosphoinositides cooperate to recruit AP-2 to lipid membranes. To determine whether Arf6 could also induce the membrane recruitment of AP-1, purified AP-1 and AP-2 were mixed together and incubated with liposomes in the presence or absence of Arf6GTP. After sedimentation, we observed that the AP-1 tetramer was essentially recovered in the soluble fraction independently of the presence of Arf6 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Arf6 induced a strong association of AP-2 to the lipids. We tested different compositions of liposomes and did not observe any Arf6-stimulated membrane recruitment of AP-1 (Fig. 3B) These experiments suggest that the interaction between Arf6 and AP-2 is specific. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that Arf6 could regulate the specific membrane recruitment of AP-2 both directly by recruiting AP-2 and indirectly by activating the PI4P5K (11Krauss M. Kinuta M. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Takei K. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Arf6GTP Co-immunoprecipitates with the Clathrin Adaptor AP-2—Next, we proceeded by conducting co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cells expressing either inactive or active Arf6 mutants. We observed that AP-2, as probed by α-adaptin, was selectively co-immunoprecipitated with the GTP-locked mutant (Arf6Q67L) but not with the GDP-locked mutant (Arf6T44N) (Fig. 4A). In addition, no co-immunoprecipitation was observed between Arf6 mutants and the AP-1 complex (Fig. 4A). These results confirm that Arf6GTP interacts specifically with AP-2 in vivo. Expression of Arf6Q67L Leads to the Redistribution of AP-2 at the Plasma Membrane Where They Colocalize—We then analyzed the effect of the expression of the two mutants of Arf6 on the plasma membrane distribution of AP-2. Fig. 4B shows a redistribution of AP-2 toward GTP-locked Arf6Q67L-enriched regions of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). On the contrary, the AP-2 localization was not affected by the expression of the GDP-locked mutant (Arf6T44N). Although one cannot exclude that the redistribution of AP-2 was due to an increase in PIP2 level, our in vitro experiments, as well as immunoprecipitation data, argue in favor of a direct recruitment of AP-2 by Arf6. Expression of Arf6Q67L Strongly Inhibits the Internalization of the Tfn-R but Has No Effect on Its Recycling—Whether Arf6 regulates clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytosis is still a controversial question. Our findings shed new light on this question. Because Arf6GTP interacts with AP-2 both in vitro and in vivo and recruits the complex to the membrane, we proposed that Arf6 could control clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we examined the trafficking of the Tfn-R as a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To avoid artifacts associated with overexpression of the Tfn-R, as well as Arf6 proteins, we prepared stable HeLa cell lines expressing the GTPase-defective mutant of Arf6 under the tetracycline-regulated repressible system and monitored the trafficking of the endogenous Tfn-R by following iodinated Tfn. Fig. 5A shows that expression (-Dox) of Arf6Q67L strongly decreased Tfn internalization. To slow down and enhance characterization of the initial rate, the experiment was also conducted at 25 °C (Fig. 5A, inset). The initial rate was 9.5 ± 0.4%/min in control cells (+Dox) and 4.58 ± 0.04%/min in Arf6Q67L-expressing cells (-Dox). After 15 min, the plateau reached was reduced by 45.4 ± 1.5% in Arf6Q67L-expressing cells. These results demonstrated that overexpression of Arf6GTP interferes with endogenous Tfn-R endocytosis. This Arf6Q67L-induced inhibition of Tfn-R endocytosis was probably not a consequence of the overactivation of the Arf6 effector PI4P5Kinase. Indeed, it has been demonstrated recently that overexpressing the kinase leads to a stimulation of Tfn-R internalization (34Padron D. Wang Y.J. Yamamoto M. Yin H. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An explanation for this Arf6-induced inhibition could be that when Arf6 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis by recruiting AP-2, the expression of a constitutively activated Arf6 should compete with the endogenous Arf6 for AP-2 binding at the plasma membrane. Such a competition would lead to the inhibition of the AP-2-dependent internalization as observed. We next analyzed the role of Arf6 on Tfn recycling. [125I]Tfn was internalized for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then cooled down on ice and acid-stripped to remove the cell surface-associated Tfn. The cells were then incubated at 25 °C to allow [125I]Tfn recycling. The experiment was performed at 25 °C to slow down the reaction, because as observed for the internalization at 37 °C, the recycling was fast, and the initial rate was difficult to measure. As shown in Fig. 5B, we measured a slight inhibition when cells expressed the Arf6Q67L mutant. The initial rate of Tfn recycling was 2.99 ± 0.07%/min in control cells (+Dox) and 2.68 ± 0.08%/min in Arf6Q67L-expressing cells (-Dox). At the plateau, [125I]Tfn recycling was slightly inhibited (≤10%) in Arf6Q67L-expressing cells. These results demonstrate that Arf6 is primarily involved in the first steps of Tfn-R endocytosis and has only a slight, although reproducible, effect on its recycling. Taken altogether, our results suggest that Arf6 plays a role in endocytosis by controlling the assembly of the AP-2/clathrin coat. Thus, Arf family proteins appear to be widely used by the intracellular vesicular machinery to control membrane association of coat proteins. However, cellular depletion of Arf6, by small interfering RNA, has recently been shown to affect not only the clathrin-dependent but also clathrin-independent ligand-induced endocytosis of a set of G-protein-coupled receptors (35Houndolo T. Boulay P.L. Claing A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5598-5604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Arf6 may exert an additional role in endocytosis than just recruiting the AP-2 complex. This has been demonstrated at least in polarized cells where Arf6GTP was involved in the dynamin-mediated endocytosis of the E-cadherin by recruiting the nucleoside diphosphate-kinase Nm23 protein (6Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 11: 11Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that by regulating different effectors, Arf6 could control different endocytic pathways as well as different steps of the same pathway. Further experiments will now be necessary to define the molecular mechanism that couples the activation of Arf6 with the receptor to be internalized. We are indebted to W. Boll and I. Rapoport for help with adaptor protein purification. We thank Drs. K. Singer, M. Chabre, P. Chavrier, and B. Antonny for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1486264823,"In this study, we used double transgenic mice with inducible expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) to investigate the role of Ang2 in the retinal and choroidal circulations and in three models of ocular neovascularization (NV). Mice with induced expression of Ang2 ubiquitously, or specifically in the retina, survived and appeared grossly normal. They also had normal-appearing retinal and choroidal circulations, demonstrating that high levels of Ang2 did not induce regression of mature retinal or choroidal vessels. When Ang2 expression was induced soon after birth, there was increased density of the deep capillary bed on postnatal day (P) 11 that returned to normal by P18, the time that retinal vascular development is usually completed. In mice with ischemic retinopathy, induction of Ang2 during the ischemic period resulted in a significant increase in retinal NV, but induction of Ang2 at a later time point when ischemia (and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) was less, hastened regression of NV. In triple transgenic mice that coexpressed VEGF and Ang2, the increased expression of Ang2 inhibited VEGF-induced NV in the retina. Increased expression of Ang2 also resulted in regression of choroidal neovascularization. These data suggest that ocular neovascularization, but not mature retinal or choroidal vessels, is sensitive to Ang2; a high Ang2/VEGF ratio promotes regression, while high Ang2 in the setting of hypoxia and/or concomitantly high Ang2 and VEGF stimulate neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W1972039372,"Creep damage by void nucleation and growth limits the lifetime of components subjected to loading at high temperatures. We report a combined tomography and diffraction experiment using high-energy synchrotron radiation that permitted us to follow in situ void growth and microstructure development in bulk samples. The results reveal that void growth versus time follows an exponential growth law. The formation of large void volumes coincides with texture evolution and dislocation density, reaching a steady state. Creep damage during a large proportion of sample creep life is homogeneous before damage localization occurs, which leads to rapid failure. The in situ determination of void evolution in bulk samples should allow for the assessment of creep damage in metallic materials and subsequently for lifetime predictions about samples and components that are subject to high-temperature loading."

DNA damage is considered to be the main initiating event by which radiation damage to cells results in development of cancer and hereditary disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of chronic low-dose X-ray radiation exposure on somatic DNA damage of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratories. For this analysis, we used peripheral lymphocytes and the assay for micronuclei (MNs), which is considered to be a reliable biological dosimeter for radiation exposure. We obtained peripheral blood from 62 physicians (mean age+/-se = 40.6+/-1.5 years): 31 interventional cardiologists (group I, exposed) and 31 age- and sex-matched clinical cardiologists (group II, nonexposed). Interventional cardiologists showed higher MN values (group I=20.5+/-1.6 vs. group II=12.8+/-1.3, P=0.001), although some overlap was apparent in the individual subject analysis. A correlation between years of professional activity and MN frequency value was detectable for interventional cardiologists (r=0.428, P=0.02) but not for clinical cardiologists (r=0.253, P=0.17). The results indicated that, overall, interventional cardiologists working in a high-volume catheterization laboratory have higher levels of somatic DNA damage when compared with clinical cardiologists working outside the catheterization laboratory. The amount of this damage varies and is only weakly related to the duration of professional exposure, which suggests that a dominant modulation of the underlying genetic substrate by environmental factors has a role in determining the harm in individual physicians."
https://openalex.org/W1984274523,"The ribosome of Thermus thermophilus was cocrystallized with initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) and a structured messenger RNA (mRNA) carrying a translational operator. The path of the mRNA was defined at 5.5 angstroms resolution by comparing it with either the crystal structure of the same ribosomal complex lacking mRNA or with an unstructured mRNA. A precise ribosomal environment positions the operator stem-loop structure perpendicular to the surface of the ribosome on the platform of the 30S subunit. The binding of the operator and of the initiator tRNA occurs on the ribosome with an unoccupied tRNA exit site, which is expected for an initiation complex. The positioning of the regulatory domain of the operator relative to the ribosome elucidates the molecular mechanism by which the bound repressor switches off translation. Our data suggest a general way in which mRNA control elements must be placed on the ribosome to perform their regulatory task."

https://openalex.org/W2015893313,"The plasma membrane of Mycobacterium sp. is the site of synthesis of several distinct classes of lipids that are either retained in the membrane or exported to the overlying cell envelope. Here, we provide evidence that enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of two major lipid classes, the phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and aminophospholipids, are compartmentalized within the plasma membrane. Enzymes involved in the synthesis of early PIM intermediates were localized to a membrane subdomain termed PMf, that was clearly resolved from the cell wall by isopyknic density centrifugation and amplified in rapidly dividing Mycobacterium smegmatis. In contrast, the major pool of apolar PIMs and enzymes involved in polar PIM biosynthesis were localized to a denser fraction that contained both plasma membrane and cell wall markers (PM-CW). Based on the resistance of the PIMs to solvent extraction in live but not lysed cells, we propose that polar PIM biosynthesis occurs in the plasma membrane rather than the cell wall component of the PM-CW. Enzymes involved in phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis also displayed a highly polarized distribution between the PMf and PM-CW fractions. The PMf was greatly reduced in non-dividing cells, concomitant with a reduction in the synthesis and steady-state levels of PIMs and amino-phospholipids and the redistribution of PMf marker enzymes to non-PM-CW fractions. The formation of the PMf and recruitment of enzymes to this domain may thus play a role in regulating growth-specific changes in the biosynthesis of membrane and cell wall lipids."

During wound healing, there are different cell behaviors in different regions of the epithelium: cell proliferation in the peripheral epithelium and cell migration in the central epithelium. We found that Wnt-7a was rapidly induced in the wounded cornea, promoted the proliferation of corneal epithelial cells, and enhanced wound closure. Matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) was detected in the peripheral epithelium, where cell proliferation was enhanced, but was diminished in the migrating central epithelium. Wnt-7a induced the accumulation of β-catenin and the activation of Rac and β-catenin, and Rac synergistically induced the transcription of MMP-12. Blocking the function of MMP-12 delayed wound closure induced by Wnt-7a. Our results also suggest that, in addition to the β-catenin pathway, Wnt-7a might induce a β-catenin-independent pathway. By regulating the proliferation of corneal epithelial cells, Wnt-7a and MMP-12 appear to contribute to corneal wound healing.

By regulating the proliferation of corneal epithelial cells, Wnt-7a and MMP-12 appear to contribute to corneal wound healing. Wound repair involves the coordination of complex processes to cover the area of the defect and to quickly re-establish barrier function (1Singer A.J. Clark R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4515) Google Scholar). These processes include the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of epithelial cells. During corneal wound healing, epithelial cells migrate without proliferating until the wound closes. After wound closure, proliferation and upward movement of the cells from the basal layer act in concert to form a multilayered structure (2Hanna C. O'Brien J.E. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1996; 64: 536-539Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a wound enhances the rate of proliferation in the peripheral epithelium, whereas the more central cells that migrate to cover the wound do not progress through the cell cycle. This indicates that the migratory and proliferative responses are regulated separately (3Zieske J.D. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Sharma G.D. He J. Bazan H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21989-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Cell migration and proliferation are believed to be regulated by several cues, including epidermal growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor, and keratinocyte growth factor secreted from epithelial or stromal cells (4Sharma G.D. He J. Bazan H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21989-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 5Block E.R. Matela A.R. SundarRaj N. Iszkula E.R. Klarlund J.K. J. Biol.

However, the extracellular cues that induce the compartmentalized responses to these events during wound healing are poorly understood. Wnt genes encode secreted glycoproteins that control cell proliferation, motility, differentiation, and morphology by pathways that are termed “canonical” or “non-canonical” (6Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 7Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Binding of Wnt proteins to members of the Frizzled (Fz) family of receptors stimulates these different signaling pathways via a mediator called Disheveled (Dvl) (8Wodarz A. Nuss R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Bio. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). In the canonical pathway, β-catenin primarily regulates gene expression. Activation of this pathway causes β-catenin to be stabilized by the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Stabilized β-catenin binds and activates the TCF 1The abbreviations used are: TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HCE, human corneal epithelial; THCE, SV40-immortalized (transfected) human corneal epithelial; CM, conditioned medium; RT, reverse transcription; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; AP-1, activator protein-1; sFRP-1, secreted Frizzled-related protein-1; PAK1, p21-activated kinase-1; DN, dominant-negative.1The abbreviations used are: TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HCE, human corneal epithelial; THCE, SV40-immortalized (transfected) human corneal epithelial; CM, conditioned medium; RT, reverse transcription; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; AP-1, activator protein-1; sFRP-1, secreted Frizzled-related protein-1; PAK1, p21-activated kinase-1; DN, dominant-negative./LEF transcription factors, stimulating transcription of the target genes (8Wodarz A.

Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 regulate convergent extension movements during vertebrate gastrulation (9Kilian B. Mansukosiki H. Barbosa F.C. Ulrich F. Tada M. Heisenberg C.P. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) by activating Rho and Rac GTPases (10Yamanaka H. Moriguchi T. Masuyama N. Kusakabe M. Hanafusa H. Takada R. Takada S. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The Rho and Rac pathways regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell adhesion, and nuclear events through JNK (11Habas R.

Cell. 2004; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Wnt-1 also activates JNK via Rac during gastrulation (11Habas R. Dawid I.B. He X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a activate Rho kinase to induce neurite retraction in PC12 and N1E-115 cells (13Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4487-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A number of Wnt target genes have been identified, including c-myc, cyclin D1, MMP-7, and membrane type 1 MMP. These target genes have important implications in understanding the role of Wnt proteins in cell motility and proliferation. c-Myc and cyclin D1 are well known regulators of cell proliferation. MMPs are proteinases that can degrade almost all of the components of the extracellular matrix, including collagen, fibronectin, and elastin. They play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes, including angiogenesis, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases (14Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation and migration are key events in re-epithelialization during corneal wound healing. These processes may be mediated by the activation of MMPs because several MMPs are differentially expressed during corneal wound repair and wound closure delayed by MMP inhibitors (15Daniels J.T. Geerling G. Alexander R.A. Murphy G. Khaw P.T. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Xu K.P. Ding Y. Ling J. Dong Z. Yu F.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins have been implicated in cell proliferation in a variety of tissues during development and tumorigenesis. However, the role of Wnt signaling in re-epithelialization of corneal wounds has not been studied. Therefore, we asked whether Wnt signals might play roles in corneal epithelial wound repair process, including proliferation and migration. We demonstrate here that, during corneal wound healing, Wnt-7a activates Rac GTPase and β-catenin and may control cell proliferation via the induction of MMP-12. Antibodies—The polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of MMP-12 was from Chemicon International, Inc., and the monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of MMP-12 was from Sigma. The monoclonal antibodies against β-catenin and Rac were from Transduction Laboratories. The monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin (F-7), Dvl-2 (10B5), Dvl-3 (4D3), Myc (9E10), and phospho-c-Jun (KM-1) and the polyclonal antibody against c-Jun (H-79) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Cells and Cell Culture—Corneoscleral rims taken from human donors provided the source of primary human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Each scleral rim, with the endothelial layer removed, was treated with Dispase II for 15 min, and epithelial cells were then isolated. SV40-immortalized (transfected) human corneal epithelial (THCE) cells were kindly provided by Kaoru Araki-Sasaki (Osaka University, School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan). For the assays used in this study, the cells were plated on a diluted Matrigel matrix (Roche Applied Science), which is similar to the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium, and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. To generate control medium or conditioned medium (CM) that contained Wnt-7a or a Wnt antagonist, plasmid pcDNA3-EGFP, pcDNA3-Wnt-7a-Myc, or pcDNA3-sFRP-1-Myc, respectively, was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Rat Corneal Wounding and Organ Culture—The central regions of Sprague-Dawley rat corneas were demarcated with a 4-mm trephine, and the epithelium within the circle was removed using a small scalpel. For extraction of RNA, the central epithelium was first removed with a 2.5-mm trephine, and the peripheral epithelium was isolated. For organ culture, the wounded corneas were dissected from the eyes. The anterior chamber beneath the endothelium was filled with 1% agarose made up in minimal essential medium and 1 mg/ml rat tail collagen (Sigma). Minimal essential medium was then added to cover the periphery of the cornea. Fluorescein staining was used to monitor closure of the epithelial defect. The extent of healing was determined by the ratio of the difference between the original and the remaining wound areas after 48 h as described previously (16Xu K.P. Ding Y. Ling J. Dong Z. Yu F.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed using appropriate primer pairs. 2The primer sequences corresponding to each mRNA are available upon request. Real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Green I fluorescence (BD Biosciences). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript levels were used to normalize the samples. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Construction of Plasmids—The MMP-12 promoter (-1830/+39) was amplified from human genomic DNA using primers 5′-GTTAAGTTCAGTTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-TAAACTTCTAAACGGATCAAT-3′. The PCR products were inserted into the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). To generate the -1208/+39 (P2) and -631/+39 (P3) promoter plasmids, the pGL2/MMP-12 promoter (-1830/+39) plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme. Full-length human Wnt-7a was generated from human mRNA by RT-PCR. The cloned cDNA was inserted into the pcDNA3.1-His/Myc vector (Invitrogen) to tag the C terminus with Myc. To construct a retroviral plasmid expressing Wnt-7a, β-catenin, TCF4, ΔNTCF4, RacN17, RacG12, or enhanced green fluorescent protein, their fragments were restriction-digested and subcloned into pLNCXII, pQCXIH, or pQXCIP (BD Biosciences). The sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Retroviral Particle Production and Infection—The GP2-293 cell line (BD Biosciences) used to generate the retroviral supernatant was cotransfected with a retroviral plasmid and the pVSV-G plasmid. For infection, 1.5 × 105 THCE cells were mixed with supernatant containing the virions in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). The transduced cells were subcultured and selected with either 4 μg/ml puromycin or 60 μg/ml hygromycin. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as described (17Hussein S.M. Duff E.K. Sirard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48805-48814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, THCE cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, incubated with 125 mm glycine for 10 min, and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 5000 rpm, and nuclei were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). The lysates were sonicated to yield 200–1000-bp DNA fragments. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, the lysates were diluted 1:5 in chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (15 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors), and 0.1 volume of the lysate was used for input control. Antibody to TCF4, β-catenin, or c-Jun or rabbit IgG was added to the precleared samples and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, followed by the addition of protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. the beads were washed, and immune complexes were dissociated from the beads by heating at 65 °C for 15 min in elution buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). Formaldehyde-linked complexes were dissociated overnight at 65 °C, and DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc.). The sequences of the promoter-specific primers used to amplify the TCF/LEF-binding site were 5′-TACATAGATCAGGGTTTCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGCTACTCCATTAAGATGT-3′ (reverse). The sequences of the primers used to amplify the AP-1-binding site were 5′-GCTAATTGATCCATTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTAGCCTAAGTTCC-3′ (reverse). Purified DNA was amplified for 40 cycles at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were subjected to 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. Protein expression levels from infected cDNA plasmids were monitored by quantifying the anti-Myc or anti-hemagglutinin tag antibody. To detect cytoplasmic β-catenin, cells were lysed using a chilled Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (Wheaton) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cleared lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (cytoplasmic fraction) were collected, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-β-catenin antibody. Rac Activity Assays—The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h and then lysed in lysis buffer. Rac activity was measured using a Rac activation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proliferation Assays—A single cell suspension containing 2 × 102 cells was seeded in 96-well plates coated with diluted Matrigel, incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h, and further incubated under the indicated conditions for 36 h. The level of cell growth was determined using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science). For the colony-forming efficiency assay, the epithelial cells were isolated from the peripheral region, including the limbal conjunctiva, and cultivated as described previously (18Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3836) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—HCET cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with the reporter plasmid and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK. Luciferase assays were performed 24 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Expression of Wnt-7a in Corneal Epithelial Cells Increases Re-epithelialization—To determine the expression of Wnt proteins and their receptors during wound healing, transcripts isolated from the central and peripheral regions of the epithelium were analyzed by RT-PCR. mRNAs encoding several Wnt proteins (Wnt-2, Wnt-4, and Wnt-5a) and Fz receptors (Fz-1, Fz-3, and Fz-4) were strongly expressed in the corneal epithelium, but their levels were not altered during wound healing. No PCR product was obtained with primers for Wnt-1. As positive controls, these products were amplified from embryonic brain mRNA (data not shown). The levels of Wnt-7a transcripts increased significantly in the central and peripheral regions of the epithelium of the wounded cornea (Fig. 1A), returning to a basal level by 3 days (data not shown). We next tested the ability of Wnt-7a to promote wound healing (Fig. 1B). Injured corneas were cultured in control medium, Wnt-7a CM, sFRP-1 CM, or vehicle for 48 h. In control medium, 76% of the wound surface was covered. In wounded corneas cultured in Wnt-7a CM, the epithelial cells completely covered the wound. Incubation with sFRP-1 (a Wnt antagonist (19Hall A.C. Lucas F.R. Salinas P.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar)) CM delayed epithelial wound closure (Fig. 1B). Similarly, scratch-wounded THCE and HCE cells cultured in Wnt-7a CM migrated more rapidly compared with control cells. The increased migration induced by Wnt-7a was inhibited by sFRP-1 CM (Fig. 1C). Wnt-7a also increased the growth of primary HCE and THCE cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, the accumulation of primary HCE cells cultured in Wnt-7a CM increased significantly to ∼3 times that of the control cells, and Wnt-7a-promoted growth was decreased by sFRP-1. Similar results were also observed in THCE cells infected with retrovirus expressing the empty vector, Wnt-7a, or Wnt-7a and sFRP-1. These results suggest that Wnt-7a-induced proliferation can induce the wound closure of HCE cells. MMP-12 Expression and Wnt-7a Signaling in Corneal Epithelial Cells—The expression levels of the various MMPs are higher in tumors that overexpress Wnt-7a (20Calvo R. West J. Franklin W. Erickson P. Bemis L. Li E. Helfrich B. Bunn P. Roche J. Brambilla E. Rosell R. Gemmill R.M. Drabkin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12776-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or that show elevated β-catenin protein levels (21Poon R. Smits R. Li C. Jagmohan-Changur S. Kong M. Cheon S. Yu C. Fodde R. Alman B.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-7 have a putative TCF/LEF-binding site in their promoters (22Marchenko G.N. Marchenko N.D. Leng J. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For this reason, we hypothesized that Wnt signaling might induce some of the MMPs that are involved in re-epithelialization during corneal wound healing (15Daniels J.T. Geerling G. Alexander R.A. Murphy G. Khaw P.T. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Ye H.Q. Maeda M. Yu F.S. Azar D.T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2894-2899PubMed Google Scholar). In accord with this hypothesis, the expression of the mRNAs for several MMPs increased in primary HCE cells after treatment with Wnt-7a (Fig. 2A). MMP mRNA levels were similarly increased in HCE cells treated SB216763 (Fig. 2B), a drug that inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β. This suggests that the transcriptional activation of MMPs is mediated by β-catenin (24Lu D. Zhao Y. Tawatao R. Cottam H.B. Sen M. Leoni L.M. Kipps T.J. Corr M. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MMP-12 (macrophage elastase) mRNA and protein increased in primary HCE cells stimulated by Wnt-7a (Fig. 2) and in the peripheral epithelium of wounded corneas (Fig. 3A). Incubation with Wnt-7a CM also induced the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin (Fig. 3B), suggesting that MMP-12 expression might be regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. To test this possibility, we examined MMP-12 levels in THCE cells transduced with retrovirus expressing Wnt-7a, β-catenin, or TCF4. Cells that overexpressed β-catenin or that coexpressed β-catenin with TCF4 showed increased levels of MMP-12 mRNA and protein compared with cells that expressed the control vector (Fig. 3C). There was no significant difference between the levels of MMP-12 expression in cells transduced with β-catenin alone or with β-catenin and TCF4. Consistent with the increased MMP-12 mRNA levels, casein zymography assays showed that Wnt-7a increased the level of MMP-12 enzyme activity (data not shown). Based on the sequence data available from the Human Genome Project and the published DNA sequences, we found that the MMP-12 promoter contains two putative TCF/LEF-binding sequences (Fig. 4A). A 1.8-kb fragment of the MMP-12 promoter was cloned by genomic PCR with HCE cell DNA. When THCE cells were transduced with the β-catenin construct, luciferase activity increased by 7–10-fold (Fig. 4B). The region containing the TCF-binding sites was required for this stimulation, and mutation of both TCF-binding sites blocked stimulation by β-catenin. Stimulation was also inhibited by cotransfecting a dominant-negative form of TCF4 (ΔNTCF4) (Fig. 4B). These results show that the Wnt-7a/β-catenin signaling pathway increases the transcription of MMP-12. In THCE cells transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the MMP-12 promoter, Wnt-7a CM increased the levels of luciferase activity by 4.5-fold (Fig. 5A). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that the region containing the TCF/LEF-binding sites in the MMP-12 promoter is bound to the TCF·β-catenin complex in THCE cells expressing Wnt-7a (Fig. 5B). Although the portions of the MMP-12 promoter lacking TCF-binding sites (constructs P2 and P3) were not stimulated by β-catenin (Fig. 4B), these constructs were expressed at higher levels in cells exposed to Wnt-7a CM (Fig. 5C). In addition, coexpression of a dominant-negative form of TCF4 did not block this stimulation (Fig. 5D). In contrast, the increased expression of the MMP-12 promoter caused by treatment with SB216763 was blocked by ΔNTCF4. These results suggest that Wnt-7a induces MMP-12 expression via β-catenin-dependent and β-catenin-independent pathways. To identify how Wnt-7a activates MMP-12 expression using a β-catenin-independent pathway, we investigated the function of the small GTPase Rac and the transcription factor c-Jun in THCE cells infected with retrovirus expressing Wnt-7a. As shown by its ability to bind to PAK1, Rac was activated in THCE cells expressing Wnt-7a (Fig. 6A). Immunoprecipitation of the endogenous Rac protein showed that Wnt-7a promoted the association of Rac with the Dvl-2 protein. In contrast, no increased association between Rac and Dvl-3 was detected (Fig. 6B). c-Jun was also more active and more highly phosphorylated in THCE cells expressing Wnt-7a than in control cells (Fig. 7A). The activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun were inhibited by transduction of a dominant-negative form of Rac (DN RacN17). Because c-Jun binds to AP-1 sites (13Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4487-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Feinberg M.W. Jain M.K. Werner F. Sibinga N.E. Wiesel P. Wang H. Topper J.N. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25766-25773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we tested whether the transcriptional activation of MMP-12 is associated with increased binding of c-Jun to the AP-1 site in the MMP-12 promoter. THCE cells expressing Wnt-7a showed strong binding of c-Jun to the region of the MMP-12 promoter containing the AP-1 site. This binding was strongly inhibited by coexpression of DN RacN17 (Fig. 7B). To further assess the effect of Wnt-7a on AP-1 binding, AP-1 activity was determined using an AP-1-reporter plasmid. Wnt-7a or a constitutively active form of Rac (RacG12) significantly increased AP-1 activity. Conversely, DN RacN17 inhibited the ability of Wnt-7a to increase the activation of AP-1 (Fig. 7C). As expected, a dominant-negative form of TCF4 had no effect on AP-1 activity stimulated by Wnt-7a.Fig. 7Wnt-7a stimulates AP-1 activity through Rac activation. A, in THCE cells infected with retrovirus expressing the empty vector, Wnt-7a, or DN RacN17, c-Jun activation was determined by a c-Jun transreporting system (left panel) and by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody (α-p-c-jun; right panel). B, THCE cells expressing the control vector, Wnt-7a, or Wnt-7a and DN RacN17 were fixed and lysed. After immunoprecipitation (IP) of the cross-linked lysates with rabbit IgG or anti-c-Jun antibody, the DNA was subjected to PCR. Input DNA was used as a positive control. C, the AP-1-reporter plasmid was cotransfected with the empty vector or Wnt-7a, DN RacN17, active RacG12, or ΔNTCF4, and the luciferase activity was determined. The error bars represent the mean ± S.D. of five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then investigated the transcriptional activation of the MMP-12, MMP-1, and P0 promoter (a synthetic 1.8-kb fragment of the MMP-12 promoter) in cells that expressed Wnt-7a. All three promoter constructs contain TCF- and AP-1-binding sites (22Marchenko G.N. Marchenko N.D. Leng J. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Nawrocki-Raby B. Gilles C. Polette M. Martinella-Catusse C. Bonnet N. Puchelle E. Foidart J.M. Van Roy F. Birembaut P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 653-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR analysis revealed that either DN RacN17 or ΔNTCF4 reduced the transcriptional activity of the promoters. Inhibition was even greater when these constructs were coexpressed (Fig. 8, A and B). Taken together, these results indicate that either Rac activation or β-catenin accumulation can induce MMP-12 expression, but full induction of MMP-12 transcription by Wnt-7a requires both Rac and β-catenin. MMP-12 Is Required for Wnt-7a-mediated Cell Proliferation—Because the expression of Wnt-7a induces wound closure and MMP-12 expression, we tested the importance of MMP-12 expression in the behavior of THCE cells. THCE cells were infected with retrovirus expressing Wnt-7a-Myc or the control vector, and stable transfectants were isolated using hygromycin resistance. When monolayers of THCE cells overexpressing Wnt-7a were wounded artificially, cells incubated with a function-blocking antibody to MMP-12 (27Larsen P.H. Yong V.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7597-7603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were delayed in wound closure compared with cells incubated with IgG (Fig. 9A). Part of the effect on wound closure might be related to cell proliferation because Fig. 9B shows that antibody to MMP-12 antagonized the Wnt-7a-induced growth of HCE cells. Coexpression of ΔNTCF4 and DN RacN17 also inhibited the ability of Wnt-7a-expressing cells to close a scratch wound (Fig. 9C). Similarly, THCE cells expressing either DN RacN17 or ΔNTCF4 showed decreased Wnt-7a-promoted proliferation, which decreased further when the two constructs were co-infected (Fig. 9D). We next used colony-forming efficiency assays to evaluate the proliferation of HCE cells isolated from the peripheral region of human corneas. Epithelial cells were co-cultured with 3T3 feeder cells expressing the control vector, Wnt-7a, or Wnt-7a and sFRP-1 in the presence of IgG or neutralizing antibody to MMP-12. Proliferation was evaluated by colony size and colony-forming efficiency (Fig. 9, E and F) (28Kruse F.E. Tseng S.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2405-2420PubMed Google Scholar). The number of cells/colony was measured by counting 20 randomly selected colonies for each treatment, and the total number of colonies was counted. Wnt-7a CM increased the colony size by 8.1-fold (Fig. 9E) and the colony-forming efficiency by 2.5-fold compared with control medium (Fig. 9F). As expected, sFRP-1 antagonized the effects of Wnt-7a. Treatment of Wnt-7a-stimulated cells with antibody to MMP-12 also decreased the size and number of colonies compared with cells cultured with IgG (∼52 and 33% reduction, respectively). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the increase in MMP-12 expression stimulated by Wnt-7a increases the migration and proliferation of corneal epithelial cells. We have shown that both Wnt-7a and MMP-12 are expressed in the corneal epithelium during wound healing and that MMP-12 expression is significantly increased in Wnt-7a-expressing THCE cells. Reporter assays showed that the MMP-12 promoter is regulated by β-catenin-dependent and β-catenin-independent pathways. The β-catenin-independent pathway depends on the activation of Rac and c-Jun. Previous studies have shown that the Wnt-7a pathway signals through the canonical β-catenin pathway (29Shimizu H. Julius M.A. Giarre M. Zheng Z. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 1349-1358PubMed Google Scholar) and via a β-catenin-independent pathway in some tissues (30Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C. De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Wnt-1 and Fz-1, which activate β-catenin signaling, also activate Rac (7Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 11Habas R. Dawid I.B. He X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In this case, Wnt signals activate JNK through a Dvl·Rac complex. Consistent with this result, we have shown that Wnt-7a induced the formation of a complex between Dvl-2 and Rac and that Rac increased c-Jun activity. Interestingly, Wnt-7a activated an AP-1-reporter plasmid through Rac. It is known that AP-1 plays an important role in regulating MMP-12 expression. For example, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and insulin, which are known activators of AP-1, promote MMP-12 expression (31Jormsjo S. Ye S. Moritz J. Walter D.H. Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Henney A. Hamsten A. Eriksson P. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a reporter plasmid with a mutation in the AP-1 site has reduced ability to activate MMP-12 transcription (32Wu L. Tanimoto A. Murata Y. Sasaguri T. Fan J. Sasaguri Y. Watanabe T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results imply that Wnt-7a-mediated Rac activation might induce nuclear binding to the AP-1 site by c-Jun, thereby increasing the transcriptional activation of MMP-12 (33Hsia D.A. Mitra S.K. Hauck C.R. Streblow D.N. Nelson J.A. Ilic D. Huang S. Li E. Nemerow G.R. Leng J. Spencer K.S. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We have also shown that DN RacN19 inhibited the transcriptional activity of MMP-12 and that ΔNTCF4 enhanced the response to DN RacN19. These results suggest that both c-Jun and β-catenin contribute to the Wnt-7a-induced transcription of MMP-12. Similarly, binding of β-catenin and AP-1 increased the activity of the MMP-1 promoter as described previously (26Nawrocki-Raby B. Gilles C. Polette M. Martinella-Catusse C. Bonnet N. Puchelle E. Foidart J.M. Van Roy F. Birembaut P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 653-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Watanabe H. Shimizu T. Nishihira J. Abe R. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Sabe H. Ishibashi T. Shimizu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1676-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study reported that the β-catenin cofactor LEF-1 acts synergistically with c-Jun through the AP-1 motif via the formation of a physical complex, suggesting a role for the coordinated function of the β-catenin and AP-1 pathways in the transcription of several MMP genes (35Rivat C. Le Floch N. Sabbah M. Teyrol I. Redeuilh G. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Matrisian L.M. Crawford H.C. Gespach C. Attoub S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A key finding of this study is that Wnt-7a and MMP-12 can control the proliferation of corneal epithelial cells. Wnt-7a controls proliferation through temporal expression (36Viti J. Gulacsi A. Lillien L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5919-5927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rac activity is also important for cell growth, motility, and adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement. For example, dominant-negative Rac overexpression suppresses the growth of NIH 3T3 and PC3 cells (37Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7618-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that Wnt-7a signaling has additional targets, it is clear that Wnt-7a promotes the growth of corneal epithelial cells through β-catenin and the Rac pathway. MMP-12 has broad substrate specificity for extracellular matrix components such as elastin, fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagen type IV. Indeed, this enzyme was recently reported to play a role in cell motility and fate, including macrophage infiltration after emphysema (38Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and the morphological differentiation of oligodendrocytes (27Larsen P.H. Yong V.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7597-7603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although MMP-12 is expressed after injury in corneal tissue (23Ye H.Q. Maeda M. Yu F.S. Azar D.T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2894-2899PubMed Google Scholar), no study has yet addressed the functional importance of MMP-12 in corneal wound healing. In this study, blocking MMP-12 enzyme activity suppressed the increase in proliferation that was induced by Wnt-7a. Therefore, the effect of Wnt-7a on HCE cell proliferation requires MMP-12. Interestingly, the expression profile of MMP-12 during wound healing is consistent with the role of MMP-12 in the growth-promoting effects of Wnt-7a. MMP-12 expression was constant in the peripheral epithelium during wound healing, but was diminished in the central epithelium, showing a consistent expression pattern with the region of proliferation in the corneal epithelium in vivo (3Zieske J.D. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Sharma G.D. He J. Bazan H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21989-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Overall, these observations raise the possibility that MMP-12 may function in vivo to mediate Wnt-7a-induced proliferation to cover the defect area during corneal wound healing. These results also suggest the presence of a mechanism counteracting the Wnt-7a-induced effect on cell proliferation in the central epithelium. We speculate that this mechanism might be involved in the regulation of MMP-12 transcription. Transforming growth factor-β1 suppresses the proliferation of the epithelial cell types through the induction of p15 and p21 (39Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29244-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 40Hu P.P. Shen X. Huang D. Liu Y. Counter C. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35381-35387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It seems possible that transforming growth factor-β may interfere with MMP-12 expression through a Smad-dependent pathway (41Bonniaud P. Kolb M. Galt T. Robertson J. Robbins C. Stampfli M. Lavery C. Margetts P.J. Roberts A.B. Gauldie J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2099-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe a reduction of MMP-12 expression in corneal epithelial cells stimulated by transforming growth factor-β1 (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the suppression of cell proliferation through the deregulation of MMP-12 expression is mediated by signals other than transforming growth factor-β1. Further experiments will be required to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which MMP-12 expression is regulated in the central epithelium. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the importance of Wnt-7a signaling in the behavior of HCE cells during wound healing. Wnt-7a is expressed in the periphery of the wounded epithelium, where it contributes to the proliferation of HCE cells, at least partly through its effects on MMP-12 expression. Wnt-7a signaling appears to play a role in compartmentalized processes in the peripheral and central regions of the corneal epithelium by its effects on the regulation of MMP-12 expression. These findings identify the Wnt pathway as a potential target for therapy when corneal epithelial wounds are difficult to repair. We thank David C.

Here we provide evidence that Groucho is phosphorylated by the DHIPK2 protein kinase. Phosphorylation modulates Groucho corepressor activity by attenuating its protein-protein interaction with a DNA-bound transcription factor. During eye development, DHIPK2 modifies Groucho activity, and eye phenotypes generated by overexpression of Groucho differ depending on its phosphorylation state. Moreover, analysis of nuclear extracts fractionated by column chromatography further shows that phospho-Groucho associates poorly with the corepressor complex, whereas the unphosphorylated form binds tightly. We propose that Groucho phosphorylation by DHIPK2 and its subsequent dissociation from the corepressor complex play a key role in relieving the transcriptional repression of target genes regulated by Groucho, thereby controlling cell fate determination during development.

We propose that Groucho phosphorylation by DHIPK2 and its subsequent dissociation from the corepressor complex play a key role in relieving the transcriptional repression of target genes regulated by Groucho, thereby controlling cell fate determination during development.

Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In general, DNA-bound transcriptional repressors recruit corepressors to maintain the inactive state of target genes. The Drosophila Groucho protein is the founding member of a family of corepressors that includes the human transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) 1The abbreviations used are: TLE, transducin-like enhancer of split; HIPK2, homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2; aa, amino acid(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. proteins (3Chen G.

Groucho itself does not bind to DNA but is recruited by DNA-bound repressors via an inherent protein motif, thereby serving as a corepressor for such transcription factors as Hairy (5Jimenez G.

Groucho participates in a wide array of developmental processes including segmentation, neurogenesis, sex determination (10Goldstein R.E. Jimenez G. Cook O. Gur D. Paroush Z. Development. 1999; 126: 3747-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D.

Development. 1997; 124: 3287-3834Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, the interaction of Groucho with basic helix-loop-helix proteins of the E(spl) family is believed to mediate at least some of the functions of the Notch signaling pathway (13Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The loss-of-function mutation of groucho suppresses a wingless and armadillo mutant phenotype, and reduced levels of maternal Groucho severely impair the ability of dTCF to repress transcription (9Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Polevey G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A. Nature. 1998; 395: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), implicating Groucho in the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway (15Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Groucho also participates in terminal development by restricting the expression of tll and hkb to the embryonic termini (10Goldstein R.E. Jimenez G. Cook O. Gur D. Paroush Z. Development. 1999; 126: 3747-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Paroush Z. Wainwright S.M. Ish-Horowicz D. Development. 1997; 124: 3287-3834Crossref Google Scholar), and Torso receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling permits terminal gap gene expression by antagonizing Groucho-mediated repression (14Paroush Z. Wainwright S.M. Ish-Horowicz D. Development. 1997; 124: 3287-3834Crossref Google Scholar, 16Jimenez G. Guichet A. Ephrussi A. Casanova J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 224-231PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Groucho acts as a corepressor of the transcriptional repressor Brinker, which antagonizes Dpp-mediated gene activation (17Hasson P. Muller B. Basler K. Paroush Z. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5725-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Zhang H.L. Levine M. Ashe H.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These findings clearly illustrate the important role for Groucho in these signaling pathways. However, molecular mechanisms of how Groucho functions and how Groucho activity is regulated remain unclear. One obvious function of Groucho in these diverse developmental pathways is to act as a global long range corepressor to maintain the repression state of target gene expression (2Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levin M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Barolo S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Courey A.J. Jia S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, Groucho may function by recruiting histone deacetylases to produce a large transcriptionally silent chromosomal domain (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Courey A.J. Jia S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Upon the activation of these signaling pathways, however, Groucho-mediated transcriptional repression has to be relieved (2Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levin M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr, J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In addition, most transcription factors that recruit Groucho as a corepressor can also act as transcriptional activators (6Aronson B.D. Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 9Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Polevey G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6584-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that, depending on either target gene or developmental context, these transcription factors are able to interact with both coactivators and corepressors. In any case, it is conceivable that there may be critical on-off regulatory switches that involve Groucho and other coregulators (2Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levin M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a member of the protein kinase family that acts as a coregulator for various transcription factors (25Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S-J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have shown that HIPK2 is a component of the corepressor complex recruited by the NK-3 homeodomain transcription factor, which also includes Groucho and histone deacetylase HDAC1 (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Importantly, HIPK2 physically interacts with Groucho and appears to regulate the corepressor activity of the protein in cultured cells. Because Groucho is a phosphoprotein (27Husain J. Lo R. Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is also known to interact with histone deacetylase (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that its phosphorylation status, as determined by HIPK2, acts as a potential on-off switch to relieve transcriptional repression mediated by Groucho. In this study, we demonstrate that Groucho is an in vivo target for DHIPK2, a Drosophila homologue of the mammalian HIPK2. We further investigated the functional role of this protein modification in the regulation of the corepressor activity of Groucho both in vivo and in vitro. Our results show that the phosphorylation of Groucho modulates its corepressor activity by attenuating protein-protein interaction with a DNA-bound transcription factor. Analysis of nuclear extracts fractionated by column chromatography further shows that unphosphorylated Groucho associates tightly with a corepressor complex, whereas phospho-Groucho dissociates from the corepressor complex. Our results provide evidence that Groucho phosphorylation by DHIPK2 and its subsequent dissociation from the corepressor complex play key roles in relieving the transcriptional repression of target genes regulated by Groucho during development.

Cloning sites (EcoRI site before the start codon and XbaI site after the termination codon) were introduced by PCR with specific primers, and the DNA fragments were cloned into the corresponding sites of the pEGFP-C2 expression vector to construct the DHIPK2 plasmid. A mutation (lysine to arginine at aa position 219) was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis with specific primers to construct the kinase-inactive DHIPK2 expression vector, DHIPK2(KR). The DHIPK2(KD) plasmid encodes amino acids 1–629, including the kinase domain. The DHIPK2(KD) was constitutively active in catalytic activities as mouse HIPK2(KD) (25Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S-J.

Full-length eyeless cDNA was obtained by combining the EcoRI-StuI DNA fragment (336-bp DNA fragment containing exons 1 and 2) amplified from a Drosophila embryo cDNA library (Clontech) with the StuI-XhoI DNA fragment (2.6 kb containing exons 3–9) from expressed sequence tag clone (GH01157). The resulting full-length eyeless cDNA construct includes all exons encoding 898 amino acid residues (29Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and was inserted into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pCS3+MT (for Myc tagging and in vitro translation), pEGFP-C2 (for GFP tagging), and pM (for GAL4 fusion construct) vectors. Groucho expression plasmids were described previously (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Serine residues (aa position at 194/196, 285/287, and 297) were changed to either alanine (in the case of SA mutation) or glutamic acid (in the case of SE mutation) by PCR with specific primers. The DNA fragments containing each mutation were combined to generate full-length gro(SA) (pCI-gro(SA)) and gro(SE) (pCI-gro(SE)), respectively. The TK-Luc reporter, which contains a luciferase gene under the control of the basal thymidine kinase (TK), promoter was used for the generation of SOTK-Luc, CD19TK-Luc, and G5TK-Luc reporter plasmids by inserting the sine oculis (so) regulatory DNA fragment (30Niimi T. Seimiya M. Kloter U. Flister S. Gehring W.J. Development. 1999; 126: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), four copies of CD19 sequences (GGGCACTGAGGCGTGAC) (31Czerny T. Halder G. Souabni A. Gehring W.J. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and five copies of GAL4 DNA binding sites, respectively. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfections of CV-1 cells were performed with FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the case of Drosophila S2 cells, the calcium phosphate precipitation method was used. Luciferase assays were performed with a Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Cell transfections were performed at least three times, and transfection efficiency was normalized using β-galactosidase (0.5 μg/transfection). In Vitro Phosphorylation, Phosphoamino Acids, and Phosphopeptide Analysis—Equal amounts (0.2 μg) of various GST-GRO fusion proteins were mixed with a purified GST-HIPK2 and 0.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 m NaCl) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. CV-1 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]Pi and subjected to cell lysis, followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody. Samples were run on a 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to membranes. Proteins were eluted from membranes and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described previously (32Boyle W.J. Vandergeer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide mapping, the eluted proteins were digested with trypsin. Samples then were subjected to isoelectric focusing, followed by 16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Spots were detected by autoradiography. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Western blots were performed with the indicated antibodies as described previously (31Czerny T. Halder G. Souabni A. Gehring W.J. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, nuclear extracts (1 mg) from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen), and the precipitated proteins were electrophoresed, followed by Western blot analyses using either an anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) or an anti-GRO antibody as described previously (26Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For phosphatase treatment, samples (100 μg) from either Drosophila embryo extracts or transfected cell extracts were incubated with 1 or 2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase at 30 °C for 30 min. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—Pull-down assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST, GST-GRO, or GST-EY fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads with various in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Eyeless and Groucho proteins as described previously (11Choi C.Y. Lee Y.M. Kim Y.H. Park T. Jeon B.H. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31543-31552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In vitro translations were performed with the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). For constructions of plasmids for in vitro translation, corresponding regions of eyeless cDNA were amplified by PCR, and the DNA fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pSPUTK (see Fig. 3, EY-N, EY-M1, EY-M2, and EY-C) or pCS3+MT (full-length EY, EY-M3, and FYSPW). EY-M3 was generated by inserting the StuI/SmaI fragment from an expressed sequence tag clone (GH01157) into the pCS3+MT vector. FYSPWΔ was generated by deleting the SmaI fragment from FYSPW, and FASAA was generated by changing amino acids YSPW to ASAA using PCR-based mutagenesis with primers, ey531 (5′-GATGAATTCAAGCTGCGAAACCAGCGAAGA-3′) and eyASAA (5′-GATGTCGACCTAGACCGCCGCTGAGGCGAAACAGGA-3′). pSPUTK-GRO and pSPUTK-HDAC1 were described previously (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For the construction of the GST-GRO and GST-EY fusion protein expression vectors, DNA fragments from the corresponding regions were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 plasmid, and fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (33Lee Y.M. Park T.K. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Generation of Transgenic Fly Lines—DNA fragments encoding the wild type Groucho and mutant Groucho, GRO(SA), and GRO(SE) were excised from pCI-GRO, pCI-GRO(SA), and pCI-GRO(SE), respectively, and introduced into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the P-element vector pUAST (34Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the constructions of P-elements containing the wild type DHIPK2, the constitutively active HIPK2(KD), and the kinase-dead HIPK2(KR), the NheI/XbaI DNA fragments from the corresponding GFP-HIPK2 expression vectors were excised and cloned into the XbaI site of the pUAST. Transgenic lines harboring the UAS-cDNAs were established using standard procedures as described (35Gajewski K. Zhang Q. Choi C.Y. Fossett N. Dang A. Kim Y.H. Kim Y. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Five different transgenic lines each for wild type GRO and GRO(SA) and GRO(SE) mutants were established, and at least two different transgenic lines were crossed with the ey-GAL4 driver line to see the potential variations of phenotypes by each transgenic line. Fly growth and cross of transgenic lines were performed at 25 °C by standard procedures. ey-GAL4 (36Hauck B. Gehring W.J. Walldorf U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) driver lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. Antibodies and Immunohistochemistry—Anti-GRO and anti-DHIPK2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised with gel-purified GST-GRO (aa 1–333) and GST-DHIPK2 (aa 561–932) as described (37Kosman D. Small S. Reinitz J. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide, CKSSRSTPpSLKTKD (aa 291–302), was synthesized and used for immunization of rabbits after conjugation to KLH. Anti-phosphopeptide-specific Groucho antibodies were purified using a phosphopeptide affinity column after preabsorption of serum on a nonphosphopeptide column (BIOSOURCE International). Eye-antennal imaginal discs were dissected and stained as described previously (38Wolff T. Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 201-271Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-Elav (39Robinow S. White K. J. Neurobiol. 1991; 22: 443-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), anti-Eya (40Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and anti-Dac monoclonal antibodies (41Mardon G. Solomon N.M. Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 3473-3486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel Filtration—Three hundred μl of nuclear extracts (8 mg/ml) was run on a Superose 6 gel filtration column equilibrated with Buffer B, containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 as described previously (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After sample injection, fractions of 300 μl were collected. An aliquot (15 μl) of every other fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis. For detection of phosphorylated Groucho, an aliquot (150 μl) of every other fraction was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of Groucho by DHIPK2—We have previously shown that Groucho and HIPK2 are components of the corepressor complex recruited by NK-3 (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have observed that a kinase-inactive mutant of HIPK2, but not wild type HIPK2, can enhance Groucho corepressor activity (12Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the kinase activity is involved in this regulation and suggest that HIPK2 may regulate the corepressor activity of Groucho by direct phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected cells with Myc-Groucho and DHIPK2 expression vectors, and Groucho proteins were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, a slowly migrating band was detected in extracts of cells cotransfected with wild type DHIPK2 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This band (p-GRO) was not detected in extracts of cells either cotransfected with the kinase inactive mutant DHIPK2(KR) (lane 2) or treated with a phosphatase (lane 4), suggesting this slowly migrating band is a phosphorylated form of the Groucho protein. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that practically all of the phosphorylation was confined to serine residues (Fig. 1B). Using Groucho proteins and DHIPK2 expressed in E. coli we mapped potential phosphorylation sites of the protein in vitro (Fig. 1, C–E). Initially, we found that the middle portion of Groucho is strongly phosphorylated by DHIPK2 (Fig. 1C, lane 1). In contrast, the WD40 repeat region or the amino-terminal region of the protein was not phosphorylated (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 7). Further serial deletions lacking the serine residue at the aa 297 site greatly reduced in vitro phosphorylation of Groucho (Fig. 1C, lanes 4, 5, and 8–11), suggesting that the aa 297 site is one of major sites phosphorylated by DHIPK2. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analyses of each deletion mutants defined three potential major phosphorylation sites (serine residues at positions 194/196, 285/287, and 297) (see below). These phosphorylation sites reside within the CcN domain, which contains potential CDC2 kinase and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (42Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and the serine and proline-rich (SP) domain of Groucho (Fig. 1, C and D). These phosphorylation sites (Ser-196, Ser-287, and Ser-297) are well conserved among the mammalian TLE family proteins. Among them, the amino acids near Ser-297 were compared with the corresponding regions of human TLE proteins (Fig. 1D). To further confirm the phosphorylation sites, we generated mutant Groucho in which potential phosphorylation sites were replaced by alanine residues (gro(SA)). After phosphorylation with DHIPK2, Groucho proteins were subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis (Fig. 1E). At least seven spots were detected in wild type Groucho (Fig. 1E, left). Among them, four spots (spots 1, 3, 4, and 7) disappeared in mutant Groucho (Fig. 1E, middle panel). In cultured cells, the same spots were not detected (Fig. 1F, right panel), suggesting that these sites are indeed phosphorylated by DHIPK2. We detected phospho-Groucho in the embryo extracts (Fig. 1G, lane 4) using an antibody generated by a phosphopeptide containing phosphoserine at the conserved Ser-297 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1D). This band disappeared after phosphatase treatment (lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these results indicate that Groucho is phosphorylated by DHIPK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Effect of Groucho Phosphorylation during Eye Development—To test whether phosphorylation of Groucho is functionally relevant in vivo, we generated transgenic flies harboring either the wild type or mutant Groucho. In addition to the mutant Groucho containing serine to alanine substitutions (gro(SA)), we also generated transgenic flies harboring the mutant Groucho containing serine to glutamic acid substitutions (gro(SE)), which may mimic the phosphorylation status of Groucho. Because the Drosophila eye system is very useful for analysis of phenotypes and because phosphorylated Groucho was detected in the eye-antennal disc (data not shown), we ectopically expressed either the wild type or mutant Groucho in the eye-antennal disc using the GAL4-UAS binary system (34Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed the resulting eye phenotypes. Unexpectedly, transgenic flies harboring ey-GAL4 and UAS-groucho showed the eyeless phenotype (Fig. 2B). Mutant Groucho (gro(SA)), which is an unphosphorylated form of Groucho, also showed the eyeless phenotype (Fig. 2C). However, transgenic flies harboring mutant Groucho (gro(SE)) showed the small eye phenotype (Fig. 2D). Although both the wild type and the mutant Groucho (gro(SA)) showed similar eyeless phenotypes, the defect in the head capsule of transgenic flies harboring mutant Groucho (gro(SA)) was more severe (Fig. 2G) than that in the transgenic flies harboring wild type Groucho (Fig. 2F). The head morphology appeared normal in the ey-gro(SE)-expressing transgenic fly (Fig. 2H). In order to rule out the possibility that the different phenotypes were caused by different expression levels of wild type and mutant Groucho, the expression levels of Groucho were checked by crossing each groucho-transgenic line with a paired-GAL4 driver line and Western blotting using anti-GRO antibodies. There were no great differences in expression levels between wild type and mutant Groucho (data not shown). To confirm these eye phenotypes, eye-antennal discs were isolated from the third instar larvae and immunostained with an anti-Elav antibody, which detects photoreceptor cells in the eye disc. Consistent with the eye phenotypes, no staining was detected in the discs from both wild type and mutant gro(SA) transgenic flies (Fig. 2, J and K), whereas a small portion of the eye disc from the mutant gro(SE) transgenic fly showed reaction with an anti-Elav antibody (Fig. 2L, arrowhead). The size of the eye disc was also greatly reduced (Fig. 2, J and K, arrow). These results indicate that phosphorylation of Groucho is functionally relevant in vivo. In order to investigate the genetic interaction between groucho and dhipk2 in vivo, we also generated transgenic flies harboring P-elements encoding various GFP-DHIPK2 fusion proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2054620863,"This study examines the role of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) in cardioprotection. The beta2-AR couples to Gs and Gi proteins. Gs activates PKA, which phosphorylates the receptor and switches beta2-AR coupling from Gs to Gi. Prior to 20 min of global ischemia, mouse hearts were either perfused for 30 min without treatment (control), treated with 10 nmol/L of isoproterenol (ISO) for 5 min followed by 5 min washout, or preconditioned with 4 cycles of 5 min ischemia and 5 min reflow (PC). Recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and infarct size were measured. Intermittent ISO treatment improved post-ischemic recovery of LVDP (58.5+/-4.8% vs. 22.0+/-6.3% in control) and reduced infarct size (31.0+/-2.4% vs. 53.0+/-4.6% in control). The Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin blocked the ISO-induced improvement in postischemic LVDP and infarct size. To test the role of beta2-AR in PC, we studied mice lacking beta2-AR (beta2-AR-/-) and found that PC had no effect on postischemic LVDP or infarct size in beta2-AR-/-. To test whether PKA is required for the PC and ISO-induced protection, hearts were treated with the PKA inhibitors PKI and H-89. We found that PKI and H-89 blocked the PC- and ISO-induced improvement in postischemic LVDP and infarct size. These data show an important role for beta2-AR in cardioprotection and support the novel hypothesis that preconditioning involves switching of beta2-AR coupling from Gs to Gi."
https://openalex.org/W2038391327,"The three-dimensional structure in dodecyl phosphocholine micelles of the 26-mer membrane-permeabilizing bacteriocin-like pheromone plantaricin A (PlnA) has been determined by use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The peptide was unstructured in water but became partly structured upon exposure to micelles. An amphiphilic α-helix stretching from residue 12 to 21 (possibly also including residues 22 and 23) was then formed in the C-terminal part of the peptide, whereas the N-terminal part remained largely unstructured. PlnA exerted its membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial activity through a nonchiral interaction with the target cell membrane because the d-enantiomeric form had the same activity as the natural l-form. This nonchiral interaction involved the amphiphilic α-helical region in the C-terminal half of PlnA because a 17-mer fragment that contains the amphiphilic α-helical part of the peptide had antimicrobial potency that was similar to that of the l- and d-enantiomeric forms of PlnA. Also the pheromone activity of PlnA depended on this nonchiral interaction because both the l- and d-enantiomeric forms of the 17-mer fragment inhibited the pheromone activity. The pheromone activity also involved, however, a chiral interaction between the N-terminal part of PlnA and its receptor because high concentrations of the l-form (but not the d-form) of a 5-mer fragment derived from the N-terminal part of PlnA had pheromone activity. The results thus reveal a novel mechanism whereby peptide pheromones such as PlnA may function. An initial nonchiral interaction with membrane lipids induces α-helical structuring in a segment of the peptide pheromone. The peptide becomes thereby sufficiently structured and properly positioned in the membrane interface, thus enabling it to engage in a chiral interaction with its receptor in or near the membrane water interface.

Many lactic acid bacteria secrete ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, termed bacteriocins. These peptides are usually membrane-permeabilizing and cationic and contain between 25 and 60 residues (1Nissen-Meyer J. Nes I.F. Arch.

Their production is in some bacteria controlled by a three-component regulatory system consisting of a membrane-associated histidine protein kinase, response regulators, and a peptide pheromone with bacteriocin-like properties (3Nes I.F.

Microbiol. 1995; 18: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PlnA acts as a pheromone by interacting with the membrane-associated histidine protein kinase of a three-component regulatory system, thereby triggering the kinase to phosphorylate two response regulators, which then in turn activate the genes encoding the two two-peptide bacteriocins, plantaricin E/F and J/K (9Risøen P.A.

Three PlnA variants are produced by L. plantarum C11: a 26-residue full-length peptide (PlnA-26) and two N-terminally truncated forms containing 23 (PlnA-23) and 22 (PlnA-22) residues. The three variants are all derived from a 48-residue precursor encoded by the plnA gene (5Diep D.B. Håvarstein L.S. Nissen-Meyer J. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 160-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they display identical antimicrobial (i.e. bacteriocin) and pheromone activities (6Diep D.B. Håvarstein L.S. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Anderssen E.L. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2269-2272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The d-enantiomeric form (contains only d-amino acids) of PlnA-22, whose structure is the mirror image of the l-form, has the same antimicrobial activity as the l-form (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that the antimicrobial activity of PlnA does not depend on chiral interactions and thus appears to involve only interactions with the lipids of the target cell membrane. The d-enantiomeric form, however, has no pheromone activity, but it inhibits the pheromone activity of the l-form, indicating that the pheromone activity is dependent on both chiral and nonchiral interactions. To gain insight into how PlnA functions as a pheromone and antimicrobial peptide, the three-dimensional structure of PlnA-26 in the presence of lipid micelles was determined by use of NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, fragments of PlnA (both l- and d-enantiomeric forms) were used as probes to determine what parts of the peptide were involved in the antimicrobe-dependent nonchiral and the pheromone-dependent chiral and nonchiral interactions. The results of this structure-function analysis indicate that some peptide pheromones/hormones such as PlnA function through a novel membrane-interacting mechanism whereby they adopt a membrane-induced α-helical structure that subsequently enables the peptides to interact with their receptors. Synthesis, Purification, and Analysis of Peptides—The natural l-enantiomeric forms of PlnA-26 and -22 (PlnA-26-L and PlnA-22-L), the d-enantiomeric form of PlnA-22 (PlnA22-D), the 5-mer N-terminal fragment of PlnA-22-L (N-5-L), and the 17-mer C-terminal fragment of PlnA-22-L (PlnA-17-L) were all synthesized according to the sequence reported previously (Fig. 1) (5Diep D.B.

The d-enantiomeric forms of the 5-mer N-terminal fragment (N-5-D) and the 17-mer C-terminal fragment of PlnA-22 (PlnA-17-D) (Fig. 1) were obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage of PlnA-22-D as described previously (11Sletten K. Huseby G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For purification, the peptides were dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a 3-ml RESOURCE RPC reverse phase column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were eluted from the reverse phase column with a linear 0–60% (v/v) 2-propanol gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions containing peptides were collected, diluted five times with water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and rechromatographed on the reverse phase column. The primary structure and purity of the peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry using a Voyager-DE RP matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) and analytical reverse phase chromatography. Peptide concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using the molar extinction coefficients deduced from the amino acid composition. Assay for Antimicrobial/Bacteriocin Activity—Antimicrobial (bacteriocin) activity was determined essentially as described earlier (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), using the microtiter plate assay and Lactobacillus sake NCDO 2714 and L. plantarum 965 as indicator cells. Each well of the plate contained 200 μl of MRS broth (Oxoid), peptides at 2-fold dilutions, and the indicator cells at an A600 of about 0.01. The microtiter plate cultures were incubated for 12–15 h at 30 °C, after which growth inhibition of the indicator cells was measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm by use of a microplate reader. Determination of antimicrobial activity was reproducible to within a 2-fold dilution. Activities are presented as minimal inhibitory concentrations, the peptide concentrations that inhibited the growth of indicator cells by 50% under the described assay conditions. Assay for Pheromone Activity—The pheromone activity was determined essentially as described earlier (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J.

Microbiol. 1995; 18: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These cells will convert to a bacteriocin-positive phenotype (i.e. start producing the bacteriocins, plantaricin E/F and J/K) upon adding PlnA (6Diep D.B. Håvarstein L.S. Nes I.F. Mol.

An overnight stationary culture of L. plantarum C11 cells with a bacteriocin-negative phenotype was diluted 1/100 with MRS broth and grown for 1 h prior to the addition of peptides to be assayed for pheromone activity (the amount of peptide is indicated in Tables IV and V). The transformation of cells from the bacteriocin-negative to the bacteriocin-producing phenotype upon adding peptides was then determined by measuring the amount of bacteriocin produced after 6 h, using the assay for antimicrobial activity described above and the indicator strain L. plantarum 965. The amount of bacteriocin produced is presented as bacteriocin units/ml (BU/ml), where one BU is defined as the amount of bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of the indicator organism by 50%.Table IVInhibitory effect of PlnA-fragments on the pheromone activity of PlnA-22-LConcentration of PlnA-22-LBacteriocin production induced by PlnA-22-L (BU/ml)aPheromone activity is measured as the amount of bacteriocin that was produced as a result of PlnA-22-L-induced bacteriocin production.

All measurements were performed with a peptide concentration of 0.15 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and in the presence of 1.4 mm liposomes or various concentrations of TFE (0–50% (v/v); Sigma), SDS, or DPC (0–4 mm; CDN isotopes, Quebec Canada). Measurements were performed at 23 °C using a quartz cuvette (Starna, Essex England) with a path length of 0.1 cm. Samples were scanned eight times at 20 nm/min with a bandwidth of 2 nm and a response time of 2 s, over the wavelength range 190–260 nm. The data were averaged, and the spectrum of a sample-free control was subtracted. The α-helical content of the various peptides was calculated both by the use of full spectrum methods using CDpro (12Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar, 13Sreerama N. Woody R.W.

Hong Q. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). All measurements were conducted at least twice. Liposome Preparation—Single bilayer phospholipid vesicles were prepared essentially according to the procedure of Batzri and Korn (15Batzri S. Korn E.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). 24 μmol of dioleoyl-l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (DOPG, Sigma) or dioleoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC, Sigma) dissolved in chloroform were carefully dried under a stream of ultra pure nitrogen. The dried lipids were redissolved in 1 volume of absolute ethanol and dried again. Subsequently, the lipids were redissolved in 200 μl of absolute ethanol and slowly (about 100 μl/min), and at constant speed, injected into 4 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The ethanol was removed by dialysis against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). NMR Sample Preparation—For NMR structure elucidation, 6.1 mg of PlnA-26 was dissolved in 700 μl of 100 mm deuterated DPC (CDN Isotopes) and a water solution with 10% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). The final concentration of the sample was 2.9 mm. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR spectra of PlnA-26 were obtained at 25 °C on an 800 MHz Varian INOVA 800 NMR spectrometer with four channels, 5-mm 1H {13C,15N} pulsed field gradients probe. TOCSY (16Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar) and NOESY (17Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) experiments included in the biopack were performed to assign the molecule. Spectra with mixing times of 40 and 80 ms were acquired for the TOCSY pulse sequence, and 150 and 200 ms were acquired for the NOESY pulse sequence. Watergate water decoupling was applied in the TOCSY and NOESY experiments (19Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The natural abundance HSQC (19Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) spectrum was obtained with 128 increments in the t1 dimension and 1024 complex data points in the t2 dimension, and 128 scans. The data were multiplied with a sine bell window function and zero filled to 256X2k data points prior to the Fourier transformation. All postprocessing was obtained with the application of NMR Pipe (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar), and spectral assignments and integration were done with the application of SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). NOE restrictions were obtained from the structure assignment of the molecule. Restraints and Structure Calculation—Dihedral angle restraints were obtained by using the TALOS program (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and the chemical shifts assigned by the application of the HSQC (19Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) and TOCSY. From this program we obtained restrictions for the torsion angles of the molecule from residue 12 to residue 21. CYANA (22Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) and the CANDID (23Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) routine were applied in the NOE assignment and structure calculation. The NOESY assignments obtained by the CANDID (23Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) routine were then checked by manual assignment and correction of the NOESY restriction prior to the final calculation of the structure. A total of 244 NOE distance constrains were obtained after removal of those that could be violated or found several times, of which 92 were interresidue and 152 were intraresidue NOE restraints. No long range NOE restraint distances larger than 4 residues were observed in the spectrum. In the final structure calculated, hydrogen bond upper distance limitations for residue 12–21, between the O(n) and H(n+3) and O(n) and N(n+3) of 2 and 3 Å, respectively, were added to the list of restraints. A total of 100 structures were calculated of which the 20 best structures were selected for further evaluation. The target function gave an average of 0.081 ± 0.023. The structures were visualized with the MOLMOL program (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Structural Analysis by CD Spectroscopy: α-Helical Structuring of PlnA upon Exposure to Membrane-mimicking Environments—The amino acid sequences of the PlnA peptides and fragments used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. To determine helical contents from CD spectra, we applied three different full spectrum methods (CONTIN/LL, CDSSTR, and SELCON3) belonging to the CDpro package (12Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar, 13Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The three methods gave similar values for the percent perfect (αr) and distorted (αd) helix in the peptides, although CONTIN/LL gave generally the smallest standard deviations. The helical content obtained with the CONTIN/LL full spectrum method is given in Table I along with the helical content obtained with the single point method using the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm. The helical content obtained with the single point method is, with some exceptions, in fair agreement with the percent perfect helix (αr) obtained with CONTIN/LL full spectrum method (Table I).Table IHelicity of PlnA-26-L and -22-L in different membrane-mimicking environments determined by CD spectroscopyMembrane-mimicking environmentPlnA-26-LPlnA-22-LPercent helicity calculated byNo. of residues in helixaThe number of residues in helix was calculated from the percent helicity determined by the single point method using the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm.Percent helicity calculated byNo. of residues in helixaThe number of residues in helix was calculated from the percent helicity determined by the single point method using the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm.Full spectrum methodbThe values were obtained by application of the CONTIN/LL full spectrum method using the basis set of soluble and membrane proteins found in the CDpro package (12,13). αr and αd are, respectively, the percent perfect and distorted helix in the peptides.Single point methodcThe helicity determined by application of the single point method using the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm.Full spectrum methodbThe values were obtained by application of the CONTIN/LL full spectrum method using the basis set of soluble and membrane proteins found in the CDpro package (12,13). αr and αd are, respectively, the percent perfect and distorted helix in the peptides.Single point methodcThe helicity determined by application of the single point method using the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm.αrαdαrαdWater1620032025% TFE362239103924388-950% TFE40224612472446100.5 mm DPC175125512.0 mm DPC43234411-1256264810-114.0 mm DPC472344115927501110.0 mm DPC355751111.4 mm DOPC667286721.4 mm DOPG521842114920449-104.0 mm SDS3435461010.0 mm SDS40374810-11a The number of residues in helix was calculated from the percent helicity determined by the single point method using the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm.b The values were obtained by application of the CONTIN/LL full spectrum method using the basis set of soluble and membrane proteins found in the CDpro package (12Sreerama N.

Open table in a new tab Consistent with earlier studies on PlnA-22-L (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the CD data revealed that PlnA-26-L and -22-L are unstructured in water but become structured, with an α-helical content of between 40 and 50%, upon exposure to TFE, anionic DOPG liposomes, and DPC and SDS micelles (Table I). In contrast to the neutral DPC micelles, which induced as much structuring as the anionic SDS micelles, the neutral DOPC liposomes did not induce extensive structuring (less than 10% helicity; Table I), suggesting that electrostatic interactions are important for the binding of PlnA to liposomes. DPC induced extensive structuring only when the DPC concentration exceeded the critical micelle concentration of 1 mm (Table I). There was no substantial increase in the number of residues that participated in the helical structuring in going from PlnA-22-L to -26-L (i.e. upon adding four N-terminal residues to PlnA-22-L; Table I), indicating that the four N-terminal residues of PlnA-26-L did not participate in the structuring. The helical structuring thus appears to be located toward the C-terminal half of the peptide, in agreement with the NMR-based structure described below. Similar amounts of structuring were obtained with 50% TFE, anionic liposomes, and DPC and SDS micelles (Table I). DPC was chosen as the structure-inducing agent when determining the structure of PlnA-26 by NMR spectroscopy because DPC micelles are better membrane-mimicking entities than TFE, experimentally easier to propagate and handle than liposomes, and they have previously been used successfully for determining the NMR structures of several other membrane-interacting cationic peptides (25Uteng M.

Three-dimensional Structure of PlnA Determined by NMR Spectroscopy—The TOCSY and NOESY NMR spectra of PlnA-26-L were analyzed and assigned according to standard methods (18Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 28Cavanagh J. Faribrother W.J. Palmer A.G.I. Skeleton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practise. Academic Press, London1996Google Scholar). The reduced mobility of the PlnA-26-L micelle complex resulted, however, in relatively wide peaks, the TOCSY and NOESY peaks being on the average 17 ± 6 Hz wide (determined from nonoverlapping αH to HN peaks). Although several repeated experiments were performed at different temperatures and conditions, neither of the two N-terminal residues Lys1 and Ser2 could be observed in the TOCSY or NOESY spectra of PlnA-26-L. The chemical shift and NOEs between these residues and others could therefore not be determined from the spectra. One reason for this might be that the Ser2 residue was in close proximity to the remaining water ridges observed in the spectra. The width of the different lysine residues that partly overlapped in the aliphatic region might explain why the Lys1 residue was not observed in this region. The intraresidue NOEs and dihedral angles obtained by the application the TALOS program for PlnA-26-L in the presence of DPC are shown in Fig. 2. The existence of αH-HN (I,i+3), αH-HN (I,i+4) and αHβH(I,i+3) NOEs (Fig. 2) clearly indicates that there is an α-helix stretching from residue 12 to residue 21 (possibly also including residue 22 and 23) in PlnA-26-L (18Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The torsion angles obtained from TALOS analysis (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) of the chemical shift values and early structure calculations also clearly indicated that there was an α-helix in this region. H-bonds were consequently introduced in the final annealing of the structure. The final 20 best structures obtained after the annealing of the structure are shown in Fig. 3; the mean square deviation for the molecule is shown in Table II. Because of the lack of restrictions and chemical shift values for residues 1 and 2, these two residues were not used when averaging the structures in Fig. 3A. The lack of restrictions for this region is also evident from the decrease in the mean square deviation observed when these two residues are left out when averaging the structures (Table II).Table IIGlobal root mean square distances measured for the calculated ensemble of 20 PlnA-26-L structures by the application of the MOLMOL program (24Koradi R.

The root mean square deviations and the low number of interresidues NOEs found for this half of the peptide (Table II) are in good agreement with a flexible/unstructured N-terminal region. In Fig. 3A, the helical conformation of PlnA-26-L is only vaguely observable. However, if one superimposes the structures from residue 12 to residue 22 as done in Fig. 3C, the α-helix conformation of PlnA-26-L is well defined. This well defined helix is reflected in the low root mean square deviation of 0.33 (Table II) and the number of restrictions observed for this part of the peptide. The length of the α-helix is about the same as that observed for other antimicrobial peptides, as is also the mean square deviation. Fig. 3D shows the same helix looking down into the helix from the C-terminal end of PlnA-26-L. Fig. 3C indicates that there is restricted structural freedom for the residues closest to the helix. The helix stretching from Thr12 to Lys23 is amphiphilic, with the polar residues Thr12, Lys15, Gln16, Lys18, Lys19, Lys22, and Lys23 along one side of the helix and the nonpolar residues Ala13, Ile14, Val17, Leu20, and Phe21 along the other side (Fig. 4). The amphiphilic stretch would have extended all the way to residue 7 if the helical structuring had continued to this residue. Residues Gly10, Met9, and Leu7 would then be along the hydrophobic side of the helix and Ala11 and Gln8 along the polar side. The amphiphilic stretch would also have extended to residue Gly25 if the helical structuring had continued toward the C-terminal end. The last residue (Trp26), however, could not have been included because it would have become positioned on the hydrophilic side of the helix near Lys23. The large number of lysine residues along the helix going from residue 12 to 22 indicates that electrostatic interactions may play an important role in the binding of this peptide to the membrane surface and/or histidine kinase receptor. The reduced helicity observed with neutral DOPC liposomes compared with anionic DOPG liposomes (Table I) highlights the importance of the charged residues and electrostatic interactions for binding of the peptide to membranes. Antimicrobial Activity Depends on Nonchiral Interactions between Target Cells and the Amphiphilic α-Helix in the C-terminal Half of PlnA—The naturally produced l-enantiomeric PlnA-26 and -22 peptides and the d-enantiomeric form of PlnA-22 have similar antimicrobial activities (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Anderssen E.L. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2269-2272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table III). Moreover, the l- and d-enantiomeric forms permeabilize target cell membranes to the same extent as judged by their ability to dissipate the transmembrane electrical potential and pH gradient of the cell (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PlnA peptides thus apparently exert their membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial activity through nonchiral interactions with the target cell membrane. This interaction involves the amphiphilic α-helical region in the C-terminal half of PlnA-26 because a 17-mer fragment (PlnA-17-L) that contains this amphiphilic α-helical part of the peptide had antimicrobial potency that was similar to that of the l- and d-enantiomeric forms of PlnA-22 (Table III). In contrast, the 5-residue fragment (N-5-L) derived from the nonhelical N-terminal part had little antimicrobial activity (Table III).Table IIIAntimicrobial activity (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC) of PlnA-22 and PlnA fragmentsPeptideaAll peptides were obtained by peptide synthesis.Indicator strain MICL. sake NCDO 2714L. plantarum 965nmnmPlnA-22-L40300PlnA-22-D30500PlnA-17-L15400N-5-L≥1,000≥10,000a All peptides were obtained by peptide synthesis. Open table in a new tab Pheromone Activity Depends on Both a Chiral Interaction Involving the Nonstructured N-terminal Half and a Nonchiral Interaction Involving the Membrane-interacting Amphiphilic α-Helical C-terminal Half—Both PlnA-26-L and -22-L display pheromone activity (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This activity, in contrast to the antimicrobial activity, depends on both chiral and nonchiral interactions because the d-enantiomeric form (PlnA-22-D) has no pheromone activity but nevertheless inhibits the pheromone activity of the l-form (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Table IV). The membrane-interacting amphiphilic α-helical C-terminal half of PlnA-26-L appears to be involved in the nonchiral interaction because both the l- and d-enantiomeric forms of the 17-mer fragment (PlnA-17-L and -D) which contains the α-helical part of PlnA-26-L inhibited the pheromone activity (Table IV). The structuring of C-terminal half of PlnA induced by nonchiral interactions with membranes (Figs. 3 and 4) thus appears to be relevant not only for the PlnA membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial activity, but also for its pheromone activity. As reported earlier (7Hauge H.H. Mantzilas D. Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16026-16032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the d-enantiomeric form of the PlnA-22 (i.e. PlnA-22-D) also inhibited the pheromone activity of the l-form, in fact somewhat more efficiently than PlnA-17-L and -D (Table IV). In all cases, a large excess of these peptides (compared with the concentration of PlnA-22-L) was necessary to obtain complete inhibition of the pheromone activity. This is as expected if the inhibitory peptides compete with PlnA-22-L for binding to a cellular target site. Moreover, PlnA-22-L induces production of PlnA-26-L, -23-L, and -22-L (in addition to the plantaricin E/F and J/K) (6Diep D.B. Håvarstein L.S. Nes I.F. Mol.

In contrast to the C-terminal 17-mer fragments (PlnA-17-L and -D), neither the l-nor d-enantiomeric form of the five-residue fragment (N-5-L) derived from the nonhelical N-terminal part inhibited the pheromone activity of PlnA-22-L (results not shown). High concentrations of the l-form of this fragment (but not the d-form) had, however, pheromone activity, and this activity was inhibited by PlnA-17-L (Table V). This indicates that the unstructured N-terminal residues of PlnA-22-L (see Figs. 3 and 4) are involved in a chiral interaction with the histidine kinase near to or in the membrane interface. Taken together, the results indicate that the PlnA action as a pheromone involves an initial nonchiral interaction with membrane lipids, which induces α-helical structuring of the C-terminal part of the peptide (Figs. 3 and 4). Peptide membrane studies indicate that the amphiphilic α-helix thus formed does not penetrate deeply into the membrane lipids2 but presumably orients parallel to the membrane with the hydrophobic residues penetrating into the hydrophobic part of the membrane and the hydrophilic residue into and partly through the membrane-water interface (see Fig. 4B). The peptide thereby becomes sufficiently structured and properly positioned in the membrane water interface, thus enabling its N-terminal residues to engage in a chiral interaction with its histidine kinase receptor in and/or near the water-membrane interface. It has been postulated that activation of the histidine kinase involves PlnA-triggered dimerization of the kinase (29Håvarstein L.S. Inouye E. Dutta R. Histidine Kinases in Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York2002: 341-363Google Scholar) and that the kinase contains six or seven transmembrane segments (30Johnsborg O. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6913-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, six negatively charged aspartate residues are localized near or in the (negatively charged) membrane-water interface on the extracellular side of four of the transmembrane segments of the kinase (30Johnsborg O. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6913-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At least two of these residues (Asp54 and Asp55) have been shown by mutational analysis to be important for PlnA-induced activation of the histidine kinase (31Johnsborg O. Godager L.H. Nes I.F. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). An aspartate to alanine mutation at position 55 in fact completely prevented PlnA-induced activation of the histidine kinase. 3O. Johnsborg, personal communication. The membrane-interacting amphiphilic helix in PlnA will have positively charged lysine residues in positions 15, 18, and 19 (and possibly also in positions 22 and 23 because these residues are probably also part of the helical segment) which will point obliquely up through the interface on each side of the helix (Fig. 4B). The initial binding of PlnA with the kinase might then involve electrostatic interactions between one or more of these lysine residues and the interphase-positioned aspartate residues in the histidine kinase, thus enabling chiral interactions between the PlnA N-terminal residues and the histidine kinase, and possibly also dimerization of two kinase monomers. This mechanism may explain why peptide pheromones that are part of three-component regulatory systems are often cationic with a potential to form an amphiphilic helix upon interacting with membranes (4Kleerebezem M. Quadri L.E. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1579-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Their membrane-interacting mode of action explains why some of these peptides, such as PlnA, may display antimicrobial activity in addition to their pheromone activity. Some eukaryotic amphiphilic cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity, such as hepcidin (8Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. McVey Ward D. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3637) Google Scholar, 32Ganz T. Blood. 2003; 102: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) have also been shown to function as ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. The membrane-interacting mode of action postulated here for PlnA might possibly also be used by some eukaryotic peptide hormones with antimicrobial activity.

A functional receptor for the vasodilatory ligand, adrenomedullin (AM), is comprised of RAMP2 or RAMP3 and calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR). It is now known that RAMP3 protein-protein interactions regulate the recycling of the AM2 receptor. The major aim of this study was to identify other interaction partners of RAMP3 and determine their role in CRLR-RAMP3 trafficking. Trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors has been shown to be regulated by the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1), an adaptor protein containing two tandem PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domains. In HEK 293T cells expressing the AM2 receptor, the complex undergoes agonist-induced desensitization and internalization. However, in the presence of NHERF-1, although the AM receptor (CRLR/RAMP3) undergoes desensitization, the internalization of the receptor complex is blocked. Overlay assays and mutational analysis indicated that RAMP3 and NHERF-1 interact via a PDZ type I domain on NHERF-1. The internalization of the CRLR-RAMP complex was not affected by NHERF-1 when CRLR was co-expressed with RAMP1 or RAMP2. Mutation of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) domain on NHERF-1 indicated that NHERF-1 inhibits CRLR/RAMP3 complex internalization by tethering the complex to the actin cytoskeleton. When examined in a primary culture of human proximal tubule cells endogenously expressing the CRLR-RAMP3 complex and NHERF-1, the CRLR-RAMP complex desensitizes but is unable to internalize upon agonist stimulation. Knock-down of either RAMP3 or NHERF-1 by RNA interference technology enabled agonist-induced internalization of the CRLR-RAMP complex. These results, using both endogenous and overexpressed cellular models, indicate a novel function for NHERF-1 and RAMP3 in the internalization of the AM receptor and suggest additional regulatory mechanisms for receptor trafficking.

RAMPs were discovered as required accessory proteins to an orphan GPCR, now termed the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N.

RAMPs are required for the plasma membrane expression and determination of receptor phenotype for CRLR (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G.

RAMPs have recently been found to associate with additional members of the Class II family of GPCRs (3Christopoulos A. Christopoulos G. Morfis M. Udawela M. Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Kuwasako K.

Co-expression of RAMP1 with CRLR yields a functional calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, whereas co-expression of RAMP2 or RAMP3 with CRLR produces a receptor responsive to adrenomedullin (AM) (AM1-R and AM2-R, respectively) (4Kamitani S.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). AM and CGRP are multifunctional peptides with many overlapping functions, ranging from potent vasodilation to proliferation to regulation of salt and water balance (6Hinson J.P. Kapas S. Smith D.M. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 138-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The RAMP isoforms have shown differential expression patterns in different organ systems and in different pathophysiological states, suggesting a regulatory role for RAMPs in both physiological and pathophysiological situations. Furthermore, the identification of RAMP interactions with additional members of the Class II GPCR family and RAMP expression in cell lines lacking CRLR have raised the possibility of novel functions for RAMPs in GPCR regulation. It has been shown in other GPCR systems that interactions with PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domain proteins are responsible for altering the receptor trafficking after agonist stimulation (7Xia Z.

In particular, a protein called Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) has been shown to regulate the trafficking of the β2-adrenergic receptor, κ-opioid receptor, and parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH-R) after agonist activation (2Kuwasako K.

NHERF-1 is an adapter protein that is thought to tether membrane receptors to cytoskeletal proteins through PDZ interactions and interactions with merlin and the ezrin/radixin/moesin (MERM) family of cytoskeletal proteins (12Voltz J.W. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6309-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Comparable with the C terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor, PTH-R, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, human RAMP3 C terminus contains a type-I PDZ recognition motif, whereas CRLR, RAMP1, and RAMP2 do not contain any PDZ recognition sequences (8Li J.G.

We show here that although CRLR-RAMP1 and CRLR-RAMP2 complexes do not interact with NHERF-1, CRLR-RAMP3 complex interacts with NHERF-1 via the PDZ domain of NHERF-1. Moreover, we show here that overexpression of NHERF-1 in HEK 293T cells alters the trafficking pattern of the receptor complex to block the internalization of the receptor by tethering the receptor complex to the actin cytoskeleton via interactions between RAMP3 and NHERF-1 through a type I PDZ domain. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that in primary human proximal tubule cells (which express endogenous NHERF-1 and CRLR-RAMP3), the CRLR-RAMP3 complex does not internalize upon agonist stimulation. Knocking down NHERF-1 or RAMP3 expression with RNA interference causes the receptor to undergo internalization upon agonist treatment, suggesting critical roles for both NHERF-1 and RAMP3 in receptor internalization. Adrenomedullin was purchased from Bachem Bioscience, Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). 125I-labeled adrenomedullin was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Invitrogen. RAMP3 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and NHERF-1 (EBP50) antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-mouse Cy3 and anti-rabbit Cy5 secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were of the highest quality available. HEK 293T cells were obtained from ATCC and are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium low glucose medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Transfection of HEK 293T cells was performed using Lipofectamine Plus protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with the DNA and Lipofectamine Plus as per manufacturer's protocol. Cells were collected for assays after 48 h of transfection. Human proximal tubule epithelial (hPTE) cells were acquired from Mediatech and maintained in the appropriate media. Transfection of d-siRNA into hPTE cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated for 48 h before assaying. Full-length cDNA of human RAMP1-3 and bovine CRLR were described before (17Aiyar N. Disa J. Ao Z. Xu D. Surya A. Pillarisetti K. Parameswaran N. Gupta S.K. Douglas S.A. Nambi P. Biochem.

CRLR, cloned into N1-EGFP and also in pcDNA3.1 expression vectors, was used for transfection in HEK 293T cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were pretreated with or without 10 nm AM in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for the indicated time periods (up to 4 h). After agonist exposure, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and either frozen for membrane preparation for adenylate cyclase/cAMP accumulation assays or used immediately for intact-cell radioligand binding. Agonist pretreatment was carried out in the presence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide. Homologous competition radioligand binding assays were performed as described by Aiyar et al. (19Aiyar N. Nambi P. Whitman M. Stassen F.L. Crooke S.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 180-184PubMed Google Scholar) and as established in our laboratory. HEK 293T cells were transfected, and ~200,000 cells/well were seeded in poly-d-lysine precoated 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). 48 h after transfection, cells were treated for desensitization assays as described above. After agonist exposure, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with increasing concentrations (1 pm to 100 nm) of competing ligand and 175-250 pm125I-rAM for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, plates were washed three times with ice-cold assay buffer, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 m NaOH. Cells were then harvested, and associated radioligand activity was counted on a γ-counter. All binding assays were performed in duplicate, with each experiment repeated at least three times. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 nm unlabeled rAM. Analysis of all binding data were performed by computer-assisted nonlinear least square fitting using GraphPad PRIZM (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Cyclase activity was done as described before with slight modifications (18Nowak W. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Sparks H.V. Spielman W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from P100 or P60 plates and homogenized in Tris-HCl (10 mm)/EDTA (10 mm) buffer. Membranes were prepared by homogenization and centrifugation in Tris-HCl (50 mm)/MgCl (10 mm) buffer. A final concentration of 20 μg of protein/assay tube was obtained. Membranes were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with appropriate concentrations of agonists (100 nm AM, 10 μm forskolin) and assay mix containing ATP regeneration system and [α-32P]ATP. After the reaction was stopped (with stop solution containing [3H]cAMP), the contents of the assay tubes were passed through Dowex and subsequently through alumina columns to separate the degradation products of ATP by washing the Dowex with water and washing the alumina with imidazole. Elution profile was done to determine the amount of water and imidazole needed to wash and elute the products. Product eluted from alumina column was counted for the presence of [3H]cAMP and [α-32P]cAMP in a β-counter. Each experiment was done in triplicates and repeated at least three times. Data is expressed as the percentage of maximal response, percentage of forskolin. Human proximal tubule cells were seeded on a 24-well plate until reaching 80-90% confluency and then incubated in serum-free medium overnight before the experiment. hPTE cells were treated for a desensitization assay and then rechallenged with AM (100 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Determination of cAMP level was measured using the Biotrak cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cAMP levels in human proximal tubule cells were calculated using a standard curve ranging from 10 to 104 fmol of cAMP. Each experiment was done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Data is expressed as the percentage of maximal response, percentage of forskolin. Gene-specific d-siRNA for lacZ (control), NHERF-1, and RAMP3 were generated and purified using the BLOCK-iT Dicer RNA interference kit from Invitrogen. hPTE cells were transfected with d-siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were frozen for mRNA analysis or used for cAMP accumulation assays or for immunofluorescence microscopy. RT-PCR analysis performed as described before (18Nowak W. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Sparks H.V. Spielman W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from hPTEs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation and several ethanol washes, RNA was used as a template in a reverse transcriptase PCR amplification procedure. The RT-PCR reaction was carried out using Superscript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. Reactions were carried out with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 9600 thermal cycler in 50 μl of total reaction volumes subjected to the following conditions: 1) 94 °C for 2 min (1 cycle); 2) 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s (30 cycles); and 3) 68 °C for 7 min (1 cycle). Products were separated by gel electrophoresis and subsequently visualized by ethidium bromide staining and ultraviolet illumination. Photographs of the gels were taken and digitalized with a UMAX Astra 2000P flat-bed scanner. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based strategy that employs the Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A pair of complementary oligonucleotides containing the appropriate point mutations in the sequence of RAMP/CRLR or a premature stop codon at position 145 or 147 codon of RAMP3 for deletion mutants were synthesized (Michigan State University Macromolecular Structure Facility). The PCR for the mutation was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 8 min; final cycle of 68 °C for 8 min. The PCR product was digested for 4 h with DpnI enzyme (Invitrogen) and transformed in to DH5α cells. Mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing (Michigan State University Genomic Technology Support Facility). HEK 293T and hPTE cells were transfected as described above and seeded at 24 h after transfection onto collagen type I-coated coverslips. Desensitization assays were performed as described, and reactions were stopped by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were permeabilized with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked overnight in 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline + 10% goat serum. Samples were incubated in primary antibody in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature (NHERF-1 at 1:250 and RAMP3 at 1:200). Appropriate secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature (goat anti-mouse Cy3 at 1:500 and goat anti-rabbit Cy5 at 1:400). Cytoskeletal staining was carried out using Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin antibody at 1:75 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted in Shandon mounting medium, and slides were stored at 2-8 °C until analysis. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss 210 laser confocal microscope at a zoom of 2. Images presented are representative single optical sections of a z-series taken from at least 20 fields/experiment and at least three individual experiments. Overlay assays and Western blotting were performed as described before (15Bomberger J.M. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Spielman W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9297-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 10 μg of GST-fusion proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked with 5% w/v fat-free milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TTBS: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in lysates of HEK 293T cells with or without overexpression of NHERF-1. Blots were then washed three times with TTBS buffer and incubated with anti-EBP50 (NHERF-1) polyclonal antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with TTBS, filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen), washed again with TTBS, soaked in Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and exposed to x-ray film. The same protocol, with the exception of the overnight incubation with cell lysate, was followed for immunoblot analysis of RAMP3. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Single group comparisons exercised a paired Student's t test method. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We and others have previously shown that the AM2 receptor (CRLR + RAMP3 complex) undergoes agonist-stimulated desensitization, internalization, and degradation (2Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M.

Furthermore, we have recently shown that in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), the AM2 receptor complex undergoes recycling, instead of following a degradation pathway, after agonist-stimulated internalization in HEK 293T cells (15Bomberger J.M. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Spielman W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9297-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the role of another protein, namely NHERF-1, on agonist-induced trafficking of the CRLR/RAMP3 complex. Pretreatment of HEK 293T cells expressing CRLR and RAMP3 with 10 nm AM for 1 h resulted in desensitization of the adenylate cyclase response from 50% (of forskolin stimulation) in untreated cells to 28% in AM-treated cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, as shown in Figs. 1B and 2, CRLR-RAMP3 complex underwent agonist-induced internalization as determined by receptor binding and immunofluorescence microscopy. These findings are in agreement with those of Kuwasako et al. (2Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and those reported by us recently (15Bomberger J.M. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Spielman W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9297-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of NHERF-1 with CRLR-RAMP3 resulted in a remarkable change in the agonist-induced receptor complex trafficking in HEK 293T cells.Fig. 2Localization of CRLR, RAMP3, and NHERF-1 in HEK 293T cells during an internalization experiment. After 1 h of AM pretreatment, CRLR and RAMP3 are internalized in the absence of NHERF-1 co-expression. In cells co-expressing NHERF-1 with CRLR/RAMP3 complex, the internalization of receptor complex is blocked after AM pretreatment. HEK 293T cells transfected with CRLR-GFP, RAMP3, and NHERF-1 were pretreated with 10 nm AM for 1 h. Note: No pretreat represents samples at maximal cell surface receptor expression that were not preincubated with agonist, and AM pretreat indicates the time just after AM pretreatment and wash steps. Cells were fixed, and components were visualized using anti-RAMP3 antibody (1:200) and anti-NHERF-1 antibody (1:250) with Cy5 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400, in blue) and Cy3 anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500, in red), respectively. CRLR-GFP is detected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag and shown in green; overlays of staining patterns are shown in the far right panels.

Bar scales on all images represent 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HEK 293T cells transfected with CRLR-RAMP3 and NHERF-1 showed similar levels of adenylate cyclase activity and desensitization patterns as compared with CRLR-RAMP3 alone (Fig. 1A). However, in the presence of NHERF-1, the receptor complex failed to internalize with agonist pretreatment (Figs. 1B and 2). To determine whether NHERF-1 co-expression had changed the kinetics of internalization, agonist pretreatment was carried out for a time course extending to 4 h. 4 h of agonist pretreatment still yielded a complete inhibition of receptor complex internalization in HEK 293T cells co-expressing NHERF-1 and the CRLR-RAMP3 complex, as compared with a continued internalization of the receptor complex in HEK 293T cells lacking NHERF-1 overexpression (Fig. 1C). Co-expression of NHERF-1 with the CRLR-RAMP3 receptor complex did not significantly change the receptor expression levels. These results indicate that overexpression of NHERF-1 alters the trafficking of the CRLR-RAMP3 receptor complex after AM-stimulated desensitization. To determine whether this effect of NHERF-1 was specific for RAMP3, the additional RAMPs (RAMP1 or RAMP2) were tested for their ability to act with NHERF-1 to alter the receptor complex trafficking. Interestingly, in contrast to RAMP3, the presence of NHERF-1 did not alter the internalization pattern of the CRLR-RAMP1 or -RAMP2 receptor complexes. No significant differences were seen in the receptor expression levels from whole cell binding when CRLR was co-expressed with RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3 (with and without NHERF-1). Desensitization patterns in cells transfected with CRLR+RAMP1 or CRLR+RAMP2 also remained unchanged in the absence or presence of NHERF-1 (Fig. 3, A-D). These results indicate that RAMP3 must contain a molecular feature distinct from the other RAMPs that allowed its interaction and action with NHERF-1. We have observed before that NSF regulated the CRLR-RAMP3 complex recycling by interacting specifically with the PDZ recognition motif present at the extreme C terminus of RAMP3. Neither CRLR nor the other two RAMP isoforms (RAMP1 or RAMP2) contain PDZ recognition motifs. To test the hypothesis that this domain is critical for interaction of the CRLR-RAMP3 complex with NHERF-1, the PDZ motif (-DTLL) on RAMP3 was deleted (RAMP3Δ145-8), and an internalization assay was performed. Deletion of this domain did not affect basal adenylate cyclase activity or the desensitization response of the CRLR-RAMP3 complex in response to AM, even in the presence of NHERF-1. In addition, the RAMP3 PDZ motif mutant (RAMP3Δ145-8) showed no difference in receptor expression levels at the plasma membrane (as measured with whole cell binding), as compared with wild-type CRLR/RAMP3 complex (in the presence/absence of NHERF-1). Unlike CRLR-RAMP3 complex, the CRLR-RAMP3Δ145-8 receptor complex was now capable of AM-induced internalization, as measured by whole cell receptor binding and immunofluorescence microscopy (Figs. 4A and 5).Fig. 5Localization of CRLR, RAMP3Δ145-8, and NHERF-1 in HEK 293T cells during an internalization experiment. CRLR and RAMP3Δ145-8 co-expressed with NHERF-1 after 1 h of AM (10 nm) pretreatment internalize similarly to the wild-type CRLR-RAMP3 complex in the absence of NHERF-1. Experiments performed as described in the legend for Fig. 2.

https://openalex.org/W1978679800,"The eye lens is dependent upon a network of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication to facilitate its homeostasis and development. Three gap junction-forming proteins are expressed in the lens of which two are in lens fibers, namely connexin (Cx) 45.6 and 56. Major intrinsic protein (MIP), also known as aquaporin-0 (AQP0), is the most abundant membrane protein in lens fibers. However, its role in the lens is not clear. Our previous studies show that MIP(AQP0) associates with gap junction plaques formed by Cx45.6 and Cx56 during the early stages of embryonic chick lens development but not in late embryonic and adult lenses. We report here that MIP(AQP0) directly interacts with Cx45.6 but not with Cx56. We further identified the intracellular loop of Cx45.6 as the interacting domain for the MIP(AQP0) C terminus. Surface plasmon resonance experiments indicated that the C-terminal domain of MIP(AQP0) interacts with two binding sites within the intracellular loop region of Cx45.6 with a KD(app) of 7.5 and 10.3 μm, respectively. The KD(app) for the full-length loop region is 7.7 μm. The cleavage at the intracellular loop of Cx45.6 was observed during lens development, and the C terminus of MIP(AQP0) did not interact with the loop-cleaved form of Cx45.6. Thus, the dissociation between these two proteins that occurs in the mature fibers of late lens development is likely caused by this cleavage. Finally this interaction had no impact on Cx45.6-mediated intercellular communication, suggesting that the Cx45.6-MIP(AQP0) interaction plays a novel unidentified role in lens fibers.

The vertebrate eye lens is a valuable model system in the study of the function and regulation of gap junctions. The lens is an avascular organ formed by an anterior epithelial cell layer with highly differentiated fiber cells constituting the remaining lenticular mass. Mitotically active epithelial cells at the lens equator differentiate to give rise to the lens fibers, which lose intracellular organelles and accumulate high concentrations of soluble proteins known as crystallins (1Beebe D.C. Piatigorsky J. Dev. Biol. 1981; 84: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). With the loss of cellular organelles, lens fibers lose the ability to support an active metabolism. In addition, there is no blood supply inside the lens. To maintain their metabolic activities and homeostasis, cells inside the lens depend fully on extensive networks of gap junction-mediated intercellular communications with the cells on the lens surface (2Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Gap junctions are channels connecting neighboring cells and allowing passage of small molecules (molecular mass, ≤1,000 Da) such as small metabolites, ions, and second messengers between the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells (3Kumar N. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). The structural components of gap junctions are membrane proteins of a multigene family called connexins. All connexins have four conserved transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, whereas their intracellular loops and C termini are the most variable regions (2Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Three types of connexins are expressed in lens. Junctions between lens epithelial cells contain predominately Cx43 1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; AQP0, aquaporin-0; CEF, chick embryonic fibroblast; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LY, Lucifer yellow; MIP, major intrinsic protein; RD, rhodamine dextran; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. in most of the animal species (4Beyer E.C. Kistler J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), whereas in human and rodent Cx50 and Cx46 are co-expressed predominately in differentiated fiber cells (5White T.W. Bruzzone R. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Paul D.L. Ebihara L. Takemoto L.J. Swenson K.I. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1077-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Distinctly different physiological properties of gap junction channels formed by individual types of connexins confer unique functions in maintaining normal lens physiology (7Donaldson P.J. Dong Y.M. Roos M. Green C. Goodenough D.A. Kistler J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 38: C590-C600Crossref Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of Cx46 results in nuclear cataracts (8Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q. Wu Y. Lei H. Kumar N.M. Horwitz J. Gilua N.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) while deletion of Cx50 causes microphthalmia and pulverulent cataracts (9White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This implies that Cx46 and Cx50 are likely to be differentially regulated by post-translational modifications and interaction with protein partners for the fulfillment of their unique roles in lens (10Thomas M.A. Huang S. Cokoja A. Riccio O. Staub O. Suter S. Chanson M. Biol. Cell. 2002; 94: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another major fiber membrane protein, MIP, also known as aquaporin-0 (AQP0), belongs to a family of water transporter proteins including aquaporin-1 in kidney (11Fischbard J. Investig. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 758-763PubMed Google Scholar). MIP(AQP0) is the most abundant membrane protein in lens fibers, yet its function is still not clear. MIP(AQP0) does not form gap junction-like channels in the Xenopus oocyte pairing assay and baby hamster kidney cell transfection assay (12Kushmerick C. Rice S.J. Baldo G.J. Haspel H.C. Mathias R.T. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Miller A.G. Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 128: 91-102PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MIP(AQP0) has a very limited ability to transport water compared with other members of the family (14Nemeth-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Virkki L.V. Cooper G.J. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R1994-R2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the protein may have novel functions in lens. Previous reports have shown that MIP(AQP0) appears to transiently associate with differentiating fiber gap junction plaques in the adult lens (16Yancey S.B. Koh K. Chung J. Revel J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), localizing predominantly at the periphery of junctional domains when large junctional plaques are assembled. Association of non-connexin proteins with lens gap junctions has been reported in limited cases. The interaction has been documented between lens connexins and zonula occludens-1 (17Nielsen P.A. Baruch A. Shestopalov V.I. Giepmans B.N.G. Dunia I. Benedetti E.L. Kumar N.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2470-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our previous work has provided evidence that MIP(AQP0) associates with fiber gap junctions formed by Cx45.6 and Cx56, chick orthologs of Cx50 and Cx46, in early embryonic lenses and that these interactions involve the C terminus of MIP(AQP0) (18Yu X.S. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The chick lens was chosen as our experimental system as it is very accessible for manipulation, allowing intervention and study at all stages of lens development (19Ostrer H. Beebe D.C. Piatigorsky J. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Schuetze S.M. Goodenough D.A. J.

In the current report, we demonstrate for the first time that the C terminus of MIP(AQP0) directly interacts with the intracellular loop domain of Cx45.6. We found that the dissociation of these two proteins in later lens development was modulated by the cleavage at the intracellular loop domain of Cx45.6. In addition, the specific interaction between MIP(AQP0) and Cx45.6 was not observed to be involved in the function of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication, suggesting that the intervention of these two proteins plays a yet unidentified, novel role in lens fibers. Materials—Fertilized, unincubated chick eggs were obtained from Ideal Poultry (Cameron, TX) and were incubated for the desired times in a humidified 37 °C incubator. pET-15b bacterial expression vector was from Novagen (Madison, WI).

Paraformaldehyde (16% stock solution) was from Electron Microscopy Science (Fort Washington, PA). All other chemicals were obtained from either Sigma or Fisher. Preparation of His6- and GST-tagged Fusion Proteins—Fusion proteins containing a His6-tagged intracellular loop domain of Cx45.6, intracellular loop domain of Cx56, or C terminus of MIP(AQP0) were prepared as follows. A DNA fragment encoding the intracellular loop of Cx45.6 (amino acids 98–148), intracellular loop of Cx56 (amino acids 95–171), or C terminus of MIP(AQP0) (amino acids 223–262) was generated by PCR using chick Cx45.6, Cx56, or MIP(AQP0) cDNA clone as a template and the following pair of primers: Cx45.6: sense, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCACCATGTCCGCATG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGTCCCCTCCAGGCG-3′; Cx56: sense, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCACGTGCTGCACATTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTAGGTACGGAGCAG-3′; or MIP(AQP0): sense, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCTGTGTCCGCGGGCG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCAGCCCCTGCGTCTTC-3′. Each fragment was cloned into the expression vector pET-15b. The recombinant fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (18Yu X.S. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), induced with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside, and then isolated and purified with Ni-NTA beads, which bind the His6 epitope. GST fusion proteins containing the C terminus of Cx45.6 (amino acids 227–399) or C terminus of MIP(AQP0) (amino acids 223–262) were prepared as described previously (22Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34567-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For SPR experiments, a mutant His6-tagged fusion protein containing the intracellular loop of Cx45.6 was generated by mutating the last amino acid (threonine) at the C-terminal end of Cx45.6 loop domain to cysteine (Thr → Cys) to facilitate the immobilization of the protein onto a CM5 chip through thiol coupling (see Fig. 3A). To ensure the correct sequences all constructs generated above were sequenced at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio DNA Core Facility. Culture of CEF Cells, Retroviral Expression, and Preparation of Cell Membranes from Lens or CEF Cells—CEF cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, 2% chick serum, and 5% CO2. CEF cells were infected on the 2nd day with high titer retroviruses (titer, >1 × 108 colony-forming units/μl, 5 μl/dish) (24Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jiang J.X. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 159-174Google Scholar). For protein pull-down assays, CEF cells were infected with recombinant retrovirus containing either Cx45.6 or Cx56 cDNA. For immunoprecipitation experiments, CEF cells were co-infected with two recombinant retroviruses containing Cx45.6 and MIP(AQP0) cDNA. When CEF cells reached confluence, they were digested with 0.05% trypsin and reseeded into 60-mm culture plates. At confluence, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mm EDTA/EGTA) plus 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 100 μm leupeptin. Crude membranes were pelleted at 35,000 rpm for 30 min (Beckman SW60Ti rotor) and were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 20 mm Na2B4O7, and 0.5% Triton-X-100, pH 8.5). Similarly lens crude membrane was obtained from day 8, 10, 13, and 18 chick embryos as well as from 1- and 5-month-old adult chicks. Preparation and Immunoaffinity Purification of Polyclonal Antibodies and Generation of Monoclonal Antibody from Hybridoma Cells— Preparation and immunoaffinity purification of anti-Cx45.6 antisera against either the intracellular loop or C terminus domains and anti-Cx56 antiserum against the C terminus were performed as described previously (22Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34567-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hybridoma cell lines used for generation of the monoclonal anti-chick MIP(AQP0) antibody were the generous gift of Drs. Erica Tenbroke and Ross Johnson at the University of Minnesota. Hybridoma cells were cultured according to the protocols of Harlow and Lane (26Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 245-282Google Scholar). Briefly culture medium was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the desired monoclonal antibody was obtained. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot analysis to detect MIP(AQP0) protein in chick lens membrane lysate as described previously (27Sas D.F. Sas M.J. Johnson R.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1985; 4: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein Pull-down and Immunoprecipitation—Crude membranes obtained from either embryonic chick lenses or CEF cells were first preincubated with Ni-NTA-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C to eliminate any nonspecific binding to the beads. The supernatant fraction of the mixture was then saved and incubated with the corresponding His6-tagged fusion protein overnight at 4 °C. Ni-NTA beads were then added to retain the fusion protein and its interacting protein(s). After a 1-h incubation the mixture was applied to a chromatography column, and the flow-through fraction was collected. The beads were then washed with 20 mm imidazole solution containing 300 mm NaCl and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and the binding proteins were eluted using 200 mm imidazole solution containing 300 mm NaCl and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). Protein components of both the eluted and flow-through fractions were then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, silver staining, or Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-Cx45.6 and anti-FLAG antibodies covalently conjugated to beads through a chemical cross-linker, dimethyl pimelimidate, as described previously (26Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 245-282Google Scholar). Specifically affinity-purified polyclonal anti-Cx45.6 antibody was conjugated to Protein A-Sepharose beads to capture Cx45.6 protein from the cell lysate. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was conjugated to anti-mouse IgG1-agarose beads to capture recombinant MIP(AQP0) protein, which contains a short FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) at its C-terminal end. No FLAG sequence was attached to Cx45.6, which excludes any possible cross-contamination. The detergent-solubilized CEF membrane lysates were then immunoprecipitated with these antibody-conjugated beads in the presence of 20 mm Na2B4O7 (pH 8.5) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed five times with wash solution (20 mm Na2B4O7, pH 8.5, 0.5% Triton-X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 200 mm sucrose). The immunoprecipitated samples were isolated from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE, Western Blots, and Silver Staining—Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 12% SDS gels. Western blots of various lysates or immunoprecipitated samples were performed by probing with either monoclonal anti-MIP(AQP0) antibody (1:1 dilution) or affinity-purified anti-Cx45.6 or anti-Cx56 antibodies (1:500 dilution). Primary antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution) for anti-connexin antibodies and with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 dilution) for anti-MIP(AQP0) antibody. The silver staining of proteins on SDS gels was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Peptide Synthesis and SPR—Three peptides (each ∼25 amino acids in length; >95% purity) were synthesized to cover the entire intracellular loop domain of Cx45.6 with some overlapping sequences at the end of each peptide (see Fig. 3A) by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Protein Core Facility. A single cysteine was added to the N terminus of each peptide to facilitate the immobilization of the peptide on a CM5 sensor chip (28McDonnell J.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The SPR response is measured in resonance units. One resonance unit equals the change in concentration of ∼1 pg/mm2 on the sensor surface. Peptides or the full-length intracellular loop domain was coupled at a density of ∼1,000 resonance units through the formation of disulfide bonds between the cysteine residue and a derivatized carboxymethyl dextran-coated chip in a Biacore® 3000 system utilizing a thiol coupling kit (Biacore). GST or His6 fusion proteins containing the C terminus of MIP(AQP0) at the indicated concentrations were injected over the sensor surface, and the SPR signals were recorded in real time utilizing Biacore Control software. A running buffer, HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P-20 with pH at either 7.4 or 6.5, was used at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Surfaces were regenerated with the injection of 10 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in the buffer. For the competition studies, GST-MIP(AQP0) fusion protein was preincubated with the indicated concentration of peptides at room temperature for 5 min prior to injection. The affinity-purified Cx45.6 antibody against the intracellular loop domain was used as a positive control to demonstrate that the peptides had been successfully coupled to the chip. A scrambled peptide, referred to as the Random peptide, was immobilized at the same density to create a reference surface to reveal bulk flow changes that are caused by differences in the refractive index of the buffer and protein-containing solutions. SPR data were analyzed using BIAevaluation® software (Biacore) (29Salamon Z. Brown M.F. Tollin G. Trends Biochem.

Immunocytochemistry—CEF cells cultured on glass coverslips were co-infected with retroviruses expressing Cx45.6 and MIP(AQP0) as described above. For dual immunostaining of MIP(AQP0) and Cx45.6, cells were first fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (from 16% stock) for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes for 5 min each in PBS, fixed cells were incubated in blocking solution containing 2% normal goat serum, 2% fish skin gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Mixed antibodies of monoclonal anti-MIP(AQP0) antibody (1:2 dilution of hybridoma supernatant) and affinity-purified anti-Cx45.6 antibody against its intracellular loop domain (1:500 dilution) in blocking solution were then added into culture plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed four times for 5 min each in PBS and then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG against anti-MIP(AQP0) antibody (1:500 dilution in blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature. After four washes for 5 min each in PBS, cells were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG against anti-Cx45.6 antibody (1:500 dilution in blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature. After four washes in PBS for 5 min each, a coverslip was mounted onto a glass slide with a drop of mounting medium. The specimens were analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was excited at 488 nm by an argon laser, and rhodamine was excited at 543 nm with a HeNe-Green laser. The emission filters used were BA505–525 for fluorescein isothiocyanate and BA610 for rhodamine fluorescence. Scrape-loading Dye Transfer Assay for Gap Junction-mediated Intercellular Communication—The scrape-loading dye transfer assay was based on a published procedure (31El-Fouly M.H. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were scratched in the presence of two types of fluorescence dyes: RD (molecular mass, ∼10 kDa) and either LY (molecular mass, 457 Da) or Alexa-488 (molecular mass, 570 Da). RD is too large to pass through gap junction channels and therefore serves as a tracer molecule for the cells originally receiving dyes. CEF cells with either Cx45.6 alone or Cx45.6 plus MIP(AQP0) retroviral infections were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min each. One percent RD and either 1% LY or 1% Alexa-488 dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution were applied to the cells that were then scratched lightly with a surgical blade. After incubation for 10 min, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution three times and finally fixed in freshly made 2% paraformaldehyde (from 16% stock) for 30 min. The dye transfer results were examined with an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) in which LY and Alexa-488 could be detected with the filter set for fluorescein, and RD could be detected with the filter set for rhodamine. MIP(AQP0) Interacts with Cx45.6 but Not with Cx56—We have previously shown that MIP(AQP0), Cx45.6, and Cx56 form a complex on the plasma membrane of chick lens fiber cells in vivo and that the C terminus of MIP(AQP0) pulls down both Cx45.6 and Cx56 from embryonic day 10 lens membrane lysate (18Yu X.S. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because Cx45.6 and Cx56 always co-associate together in the lens (18Yu X.S. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), it is experimentally unfeasible to utilize this system to determine which type(s) of these two fiber connexins interacts with MIP(AQP0). To address this issue, exogenous Cx45.6 or Cx56 was individually expressed in a connexin-deficient cell line, CEF cells. High expression was achieved by using recombinant retroviruses expressing either Cx45.6 or Cx56 (24Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jiang J.X. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 159-174Google Scholar). A His6-tagged fusion protein containing the C terminus of MIP(AQP0) was used in pull-down experiments with membrane lysates obtained from retrovirally infected cells either expressing Cx45.6 (Fig. 1A, lane 1) or Cx56 (Fig. 1A, lane 6). A single protein band observed in the retained fraction of the MIP(AQP0) C terminus pull-down from Cx45.6-expressing CEF cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2) was confirmed to be Cx45.6 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, lane 3). No protein was pulled down by MIP(AQP0) C terminus from Cx56-expressing cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8), resulting in a majority of Cx56 retained in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 9). Comparable levels of exogenous expression of Cx45.6 and Cx56 in CEF cell cultures were observed by Western blot analyses using specific antibodies (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 10). In addition to the binding of the C terminus, other cytoplasmic domains of MIP(AQP0), such as the N terminus and/or two intracellular loops, may potentially interact with Cx56. However, all three cytoplasmic domains have very limited lengths (10–20 amino acids in length), which renders such potential interactions sterically unfeasible (18Yu X.S. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Thus our results suggest that MIP(AQP0) does not directly interact with Cx56 and that the existence of Cx56 in co-immunoprecipitates of lens lysates is because of its association with Cx45.6 (18Yu X.S. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation was then performed to confirm the interaction between MIP(AQP0) and Cx45.6. Retroviruses containing either MIP(AQP0) cDNA (plus a short FLAG epitope at its C terminus) or Cx45.6 cDNA (without FLAG epitope) were co-infected into CEF cells. Bidirectional co-immunoprecipitation was conducted by subjecting membrane lysates to either anti-Cx45.6 antibody (Fig. 1B) or anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C). When co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Cx45.6 antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 4, and 6), another protein with a molecular mass of ∼ 28 kDa was also retained (Fig. 1B, lane 2) and confirmed to be MIP(AQP0) by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Similarly Cx45.6 was detected in co-immunoprecipitates of anti-FLAG antibody that was used to immunoprecipitate MIP(AQP0) (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Comparable expression levels of MIP(AQP0) and Cx45.6 were indicated by Western blot analyses of cell membrane lysates (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 5 and 7). In addition to MIP(AQP0) and Cx45.6, two more unknown proteins were also co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C, marked by asterisks) but not by the anti-Cx45.6 antibody. This may be explained by the possibility that MIP(AQP0) is able to bind to some endogenous proteins in CEF cells or that these proteins contain sequence(s) similar to that of FLAG epitope that may be recognized by the anti-FLAG antibody. Together our results establish a direct interaction between MIP(AQP0) and Cx45.6 both in vitro and in vivo. Intracellular Loop Domain of Cx45.6 Pulls Down MIP(AQP0) from Embryonic Lens Lysate—To determine which portion(s) of Cx45.6 protein interacts with MIP(AQP0), fusion proteins containing cytoplasmic domains of Cx45.6 were prepared. We observed that when a His6-tagged fusion protein containing the intracellular loop of Cx45.6 was incubated with lens membranes (total protein profile shown in Fig. 2, lane 1), a single protein with molecular mass of ∼28 kDa was pulled down (Fig. 2, lane 3, arrow) and confirmed as MIP(AQP0) by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, lane 4). Very limited amounts of MIP(AQP0) were detected in"

To better understand the molecular basis of this sensitive recognition process, we studied dimeric pMHC complexes containing linkers of different lengths. Although dimers containing short (10–30-Å) linkers efficiently bound to and triggered intracellular calcium mobilization and phosphorylation in cloned CTL, dimers containing long linkers (≥80 Å) did not. Based on this and on fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, we describe a dimeric binding mode in which two T cell receptors engage in an anti-parallel fashion two pMHC complexes facing each other with their constant domains. This binding mode allows integration of diverse low affinity interactions, which increases the overall binding and, hence, the sensitivity of antigen recognition. In proof of this, we demonstrated that pMHC dimers containing one agonist and one null ligand efficiently activate CTL, corroborating the importance of endogenous pMHC complexes in antigen recognition.

Although soluble TCR and CD8 have been shown to bind pMHC complexes typically with low affinities, fast dissociation kinetics, and in an independent manner (3Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Bakker T. Jordan M.

For several hormone, cytokine, and chemokine receptors, it has been shown that receptor dimerization is a means to strengthen receptor ligand binding and to promote receptor signaling (5Frank S.J.

In addition, none of these studies provided a plausible structural explanation for TCR dimerization. In view of the wealth of structural information on pMHC, TCR, CD8, pMHC-TCR, and pMHC-CD8 complexes, there should be a structural explanation for TCR dimerization, if it indeed exists. The crystal structure of TCR has uncovered three features that are unique to TCR, i.e. are not found in other immunoglobulin (Ig) super-family members. 1) In the Vα domain, the C′ strand forms hydrogen bonds with the D strand and not with the C″ strand (14Fields B.A. Ober B. Malchiodi E.L. Lebedeva M.I. Braden B.C. Ysern X. Kim J.K. Shao X. Ward E.S. Mariuzza R.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). 2) Cα has only 12–18% sequence homology with other Ig-constant domains, and 12–15 residues are missing, resulting in a less ordered structure and a flatter outer surface as compared with Cβ (15Garcia K.C. Degano M. Stanfield R.L. Brunmark A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 274: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). 3) Cβ has a prominent, surface-exposed FG loop (15Garcia K.C. Degano M. Stanfield R.L. Brunmark A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 274: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Because of these structural features, TCRα chains are more likely to dimerize than TCRβ chains (14Fields B.A. Ober B. Malchiodi E.L. Lebedeva M.I. Braden B.C. Ysern X. Kim J.K. Shao X. Ward E.S. Mariuzza R.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because TCR are naturally membrane-integrated and associated with CD3 units, studies on TCR dimerization/aggregation should be performed on cells (11Baker B.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 2001; 14: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CD3εγδ chains each contain an extracellular Ig domain and a cytoplasmic tail harboring one immunotyrosine-based activation motive (12Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wucherpfennig K.W. EMBO J. 2004; 16: 2348-2357Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The ζ chain forms a disulfide-linked homodimer, has only a nine-amino-acid-long extracellular portion, and its cytoplasmic tail contains three immunotyrosine-based activation motives. CD3εδ and ζζ are associated with the TCRα chain, whereas CD3εγ associates with the TCRβ chain (12Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W.

Mutations in the highly conserved TCRα chain connecting the peptide motif (CPMα) and the transmembrane domain have profound effects on TCR association with CD3δ and the ζ chain and severely impair positive selection of thymocytes and TCR signaling (16Backstrom B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Bhatnagar A. Gulland S. Bascand M. Palmer E.

It seems therefore that the TCRα chain plays a more important role in TCR signaling than the β chain. There are indications that TCR engagement elicits rearrangement of CD3 units and structural changes in their cytoplasmic portions and that this is important for TCR signaling (3Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Bakker T. Jordan M. Goffin L. Boucheron N. Wurm F. van der Merwe A. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19La Gruta N.L. Liu H.

These studies concur that activation of CD8+ (and CD4+) T cells by soluble pMHC requires that these are at least dimeric and co-engage the co-receptor (21Boniface J.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Wülfing C.J.

Boucheron N. Cerottini J-C. Bron C. Luescher I.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The co-receptor CD8 is associated with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase p56lck (Lck), which is activated by cross-linking-mediated autophosphorylation (23Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In addition, CD8 strengthens the interaction of pMHC with TCR by binding to TCR-associated pMHC (24Luescher I.F. Vivier E. Layer A. Mahiou J. Godeau F. Malissen B. Romero P. Nature. 1995; 373: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because Lck mediates the initial phosphorylation of immunotyrosine-based activation motive, resulting in the recruitment and activation of ZAP-70, cross-linking of pMHC co-engaged TCR, and CD8 is a key mechanism of CTL activation (22Doucey M.A. Legler D.F.

Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether CTL activation relies on structurally defined pMHC-driven TCR aggregation, we studied dimeric pMHC complexes containing linkers of different lengths. Such complexes were prepared by alkylation of a free cysteine at the C terminus of the MHC heavy chain (position 275) (26Guillaume P. Legler D.F. Boucheron N. Doucey M.A. Cerottini J.C. Luescher I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4500-4509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with bis-maleimides containing linkers of different lengths. To know the actual length of the longer linkers, we incorporated polyprolines, which in aqueous media, assume a proline II helix in which one residue spans 3.1 Å (27Streyer L. Haugland R.P. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 719-726Google Scholar, 28Schweizer-Stenner R. Licht A. Luescher I. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because when in excess of 5–9 residues, polyproline II helices form stable rigid structures containing only trans amide bonds, polyprolines have been used as “ruler” molecules to assess distances, e.g. within large DNA molecules or between the combining sites of immunoglobulin binding sites (27Streyer L.

As cells, we used cloned CD8+ S14 CTLs, which recognize the PbCS(ABA) peptide 252–260 (SYIPSAEKI) containing photoreactive 4-azido-benzoic acid on Lys-259 (PbCS(ABA)) in the context of H-2Kd (Kd) (30Luescher I.F.

These CTL are amenable to pMHC-TCR photo cross-linking, which when using fluorescent-labeled pMHC, allows detailed binding studies with monomeric or dimeric pMHC complexes as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, a powerful means to gauge the proximity of suitably fluorescent-labeled molecules (31Erickson M.G.

Synthesis of Maleimide-containing Linkers—All peptides were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc for transient N-terminal protection. For the synthesis of the linker type Mal-εAhx-Pn-NH-(CH2)2-O-(CH2)2-NH-Mal, bis(2-aminoethyl)-ether trityl resin was used, and for the others, proline-2-chlorotrityl resin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. Sequential couplings were performed with 2.5 molar excess of Fmoc-P5-OH or the respective amino acids and were monitored with the Kaiser or chloranil color test. After each coupling, end-capping was performed with a 20-fold molar excess of acetic anhydride and diisoprolyethylamine. Peptides were cleaved from the resin with 5% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane containing 5% triisopropylsilane and purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with H2O/CH3CN/trifluoroacetic acid 70/30/0.1 (v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Further purification was on a semipreparative C4 column (Vydac, Hisperia, CA), which was eluted with a linear gradient of CH3CN rising from 0 to 75% in 60 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The purified peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Purified peptides were then reacted at their free amino groups with a 10-fold molar excess of N-(α-maleimidoacetoxy)succinimide ester (Pierce) in 1/1 (v/v) dimethylformamide/chloroform and 2,4,6-collidine for 4 h at room temperature. The fluorescent PbCS(ABA)peptides were prepared by reacting Fmoc-Dap-YISAEK(ABA)I with Cy3- and Cy5-hydroxysuccinimide esters, respectively, Cy5 hydroxysuccinimide esters in N,N-dimethylformamide/Me2SO/diisopopylethylamine (2/1/0.1), followed by removal of Fmoc in 50% piperidine. The products were purified by precipitation with ether, followed by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column and then chromatography on a C4 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography column and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as described above. Preparation of Soluble Kd-PbCS(ABA) Complexes—Monomeric Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes containing a free cysteine in position 275, with or without charge inversion in position 227 (D227K), were prepared by refolding of the heavy chain and human β2-microglubin in the presence of PbCS (ABA) or Cw3 170–179 peptide (RYLKNGKETL) as described previously (26Guillaume P.

To increase the pMHC binding to S14 TCR, these were prepared with the SYIASAEK(ABA)I variant, which is a strong agonist for S14 CTL (34Kessler B. Bassanini P. Cerottini J-C. Luescher I.F. J. Exp.

The complexes were reduced with 15 mm glutathione and reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of the respective bismaleimide linkers or with Cy5-maleimide (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at room temperature under argon. The alkylated Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Dimeric Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes were obtained by reacting the monomeric complexes with a 3-fold molar excess of reduced Kd-PbCS(ABA)-Cys and purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column (26Guillaume P.

To manufacture soluble dimeric Kd complexes containing one agonist peptide (SYIASAEK(ABA)I) and one null peptide (SIYPSAEKI or SYFPEITHI), monomeric Kd complexes containing the null peptide were first alkylated with DapS bismaleimide linker and the resulting monomers purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column. The alkylated Kd-null peptide complexes were then reacted with reduced Kd-PbCS(ABA)-Cys, and the mixed dimeric Kd complexes were purified likewise. This procedure precludes contamination of the mixed dimers with disulfide-linked homodimers containing two PbCS(ABA) peptides. Ca2+ Mobilization and Binding Studies—Calcium mobilization experiments were performed using the calcium-sensitive dye Indo-1 and flow cytometry as described previously (26Guillaume P. Legler D.F.

For binding studies, S14 CTL (1 × 107 cells/ml) in Hanks' buffered salt solution supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 μg/ml human β2-microglobulin, 10 μm PbCS peptide (FACS buffer) were incubated in the absence or presence of the inhibitors with the indicated concentrations of fluorescent Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes for 5 min at 37 °C. In all experiments, the cells were pre-incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 100 μm Brefeldin A to inhibit the transfer of peptide from soluble to cell-associated pMHC (36Ge Q. Stone J.D. Thompson M.T.

After UV irradiation (35 s with 90 W of power at 312 ± 40 nm), the cells were washed twice in cold FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The nonspecific binding was assessed using the corresponding irrelevant Kd-Cw3 170–179 peptide complexes. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—S14 CTL (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated in Opti-MEM I containing 2 μg/ml human β2-microglobulin and 10 μm PbCS peptide in the presence or absence of Kd-PbCS(ABA) monomers or dimers at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were lysed on ice for 40 min in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.2, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma), 50 nm sodium fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Aliquots of the detergent-soluble fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-pY mAb 4G10 as described previously (22Doucey M.A. Legler D.F. Boucheron N. Cerottini J-C. Bron C.

For identification of individual phosphorylated proteins, these were immunoprecipitated with a mixture (1:1) of anti-pY mAbs (P-TYR-01 and P-TYR-02), and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies (Lck, ZAP-70, PLCγ1, and Vav-1) or, after Western blotting of post-nuclear detergent-soluble fractions, using phosphospecific antibodies (Fyn, Erk1, and Erk2). For LAT, anti-LAT immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted using anti-pY antibody, 4G10. FRET Measurements—S14 CTL (5 × 106/ml) were labeled with Kd-PbCS(ABA) DapS dimer (500 nm) containing the peptides (Dap(Cy3)-YIASAEK(ABA)I) and (Dap(Cy5)-YIASAEK(ABA)I), as described above, and fixed with paraformaldehyde (3%, 8 min at room temperature). FRET measurements on single cells and for comparison on DapS dimers in solution were performed on a modified epiluminescence wide field microscope (Axiovert 100 TV, Zeiss). Spectra were recorded by integrating the fluorescence of the whole cell during 1 s on a charge-coupled device camera (LN/CCD-576 EUV, Spectroscopy Instruments GmbH) coupled to a spectrometer (CP-140, Spectroscopy Instruments GmbH). Donor and acceptor spectra were recorded after excitation at 514.5 nm using an Ar+ laser (Innova Sabre, Coherent) and at 637 nm using a diode laser (Radius 635, Coherent), respectively. FRET efficiencies (EFRET) were calculated from the ratio of the total acceptor emission and the emission due to direct acceptor excitation as described previously (31Erickson M.G.

The correction for direct excitation of the acceptor was determined using DapS dimer containing only Dap(Cy5)-YIASAEK-(ABA)I peptides. Molecular Modeling—The docked conformation of the 2C TCR-Kb-dEV8 peptide dimer was obtained by an ab initio Monte Carlo search using a soft-core van der Waals potential with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. All calculations were performed using the CHARMM program (38Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13868) Google Scholar). The complex was refined using molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K. Toward defining the molecular basis of TCR-mediated antigen recognition by CTL, we prepared well defined soluble dimeric pMHC complexes containing linkers of 10–148-Å lengths, connecting the C termini of their constant domains (α3) (Fig. 1). The short linkers are flexible, and the indicated spacer lengths refer to their fully extended conformation; i.e. the maximal distance. To define the length of the longer linkers, we incorporated polyproline spacers, which, in aqueous media in excess of 5–9 residues, assume a rigid proline II helix, in which one residue spans 3.1 Å (27Streyer L.

For the polyproline-containing dimers, full freedom of mobility of the pMHC entities was assured by short flexible spacers added at either end of the proline helix, as well as the flexible thioether linkage with the protein (Fig. 1B). The integrity of the complexes was verified by protein electrophoresis and gel filtration (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Characterization of the Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes.A, Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE (12%, non-reducing) of the indicated Kd-PbCS(ABA) dimers.

Incubation of cloned S14 CTL with graded concentrations of dimers showed that those containing 10–30-Å-long linkers efficiently induced Ca2+ flux (Fig. 3A). This is in accordance with the finding that short (but not long) dimeric pMHC class II complexes efficiently activate CD4+ T cells (39Cochran J.R. Cameron T.O. Stern L.J.

The ability of the dimers to elicit calcium mobilization rapidly decreased as the length of their linker increased. The P10 dimer induced an ~3-fold lower maximal Ca2+ flux than the DapS dimer. The P20 dimer elicited a Ca2+ mobilization that was slightly above background, and the P30 and the P40 dimers were essentially inactive. Titration of the DapS dimer showed that half-maximal calcium mobilization required ~1 nm and maximal response ~10 nm pMHC (Fig. 3B). The same titrations performed with the other dimers indicated that the maximal calcium response was highest for the DapS dimer. However, the shorter dihydroxybutane (10.2 Å) and Dap (12.3 Å) as well as the longer Dap(SG) (28.7 Å) dimers were only modestly less active (Fig. 3C). No Ca2+ mobilization was observed for monomeric complexes or for the DapS dimer, when co-engagement of CD8 was prevented by anti-Kdα3 SF1–1.1.1 Fab or by charge inversion of KdD227 (Fig. 3C and data not shown) (22Doucey M.A. Legler D.F.

By contrast, the P30 dimer elicited only faint or no phosphorylation of these molecules. For Lck and Fyn, a high level of tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in untreated cells. DapS (but not P30) dimer increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck and Fyn (Fig. 4B). Striking differences were also observed when distal signaling events were analyzed.

Whereas βig-h3 is known to mediate keratinocyte adhesion and migration, its effects on keratinocyte differentiation remain unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that expression of both βig-h3 and TGF-β1 was enhanced during keratinocyte differentiation and that expression of the former was strongly induced by that of the latter. This study also asked whether changes in β-h3 expression would affect keratinocyte differentiation. Indeed, down-regulation of βig-h3 by transfection with antisense βig-h3 cDNA constructs effectively inhibited keratinocyte differentiation by decreasing the promoter activities and thus expression of involucrin and transglutaminase. The result was a ∼2-fold increase in mitotic capacity of the cells. Conversely, overexpression of βig-h3, either by transfection with βig-h3 expression plasmids or by exposure to recombinant βig-h3, enhanced keratinocyte differentiation by inhibiting cell proliferation and concomitantly increasing involucrin and transglutaminase expression. Recombinant βig-h3 also promoted keratinocyte adhesion through interaction with integrin α3β1. Changes in βig-h3 expression did not affect intracellular calcium levels. Subsequent analysis revealed not only induction of Akt phosphorylation by recombinant βig-h3 but also blockage of Akt phosphorylation by LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Taken together, these findings indicate that enhanced βig-h3, induced by enhanced TGF-β during keratinocyte differentiation, provoked cell differentiation by enhancing involucrin and transglutaminase expression through the integrin α3β1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Lastly, it was observed that βig-h3-mediated keratinocyte differentiation was caused by promotion of cell adhesion and not by calcium regulation. βig-h3 is an extracellular matrix protein whose expression is highly induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1.

Sci. 1991; 301: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and both cell types display a limited number of divisions in vitro. Serial subculture-induced keratinocyte differentiation mimics the physiological maturation process observed in the intact epidermis in vivo (19Min B.-M. Woo K.M. Lee G. Park N.-H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is more similar in some ways with this in vivo process than with calcium-induced differentiation (22Lee G. Park B.S. Han S.E. Oh J.-E. You Y.-O. Baek J.-H. Kim G.-S. Min B.-M. Arch. Oral Biol. 2000; 45: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The in vitro differentiation system is thus useful for investigating the mechanisms of keratinocyte differentiation. Many proteins are known or suspected to be associated with the overall process of keratinocyte differentiation. In particular, the roles of involucrin and transglutaminase have been identified as the substrate and enzyme, respectively, required for cornified envelope formation. Much evidence suggests that TGF-β plays important roles during wound healing and keratinocyte differentiation. Indeed, previous work by the present authors has shown that TGF-β and phospholipase C-γ1 promote keratinocyte differentiation (19Min B.-M. Woo K.M. Lee G. Park N.-H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Oh J.-E. Kook J.-K. Park K.-H. Lee G. Seo B.-M. Min B.-M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 11: 491-498PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of TGF-β suggests a possible role for βig-h3 as well in the mediation of keratinocyte differentiation and in cell adhesion and spreading. This study sought to examine whether changes in βig-h3 expression would affect keratinocyte differentiation, and to determine the molecular mechanism by which this occurred, in an effort to elucidate the role of βig-h3 in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. The findings herein demonstrate that enhanced TGF-β during keratinocyte differentiation induced βig-h3 expression and thus provoked cell differentiation by enhancing involucrin and transglutaminase expression through the integrin α3β1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Finally, the present study demonstrates that βig-h3-mediated keratinocyte differentiation was caused by promotion of cell adhesion and not by calcium regulation. Cell Culture—Normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs) were prepared and maintained as previously reported (19Min B.-M. Woo K.M. Lee G. Park N.-H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, NHOKs were isolated from human gingival tissue specimens obtained from healthy volunteers (age range 20 to 30 years) who were undergoing oral surgery. Oral keratinocytes were isolated from separated epithelial tissue by trypsinization, and primary cultures were established in keratinocyte growth medium containing 0.15 mm calcium and a supplementary growth factor bullet kit (keratinocyte growth medium; Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Primary NHEKs were prepared in a manner similar to the NHOKs from human foreskins obtained from patients (1 to 3 years of age) undergoing surgery. Approximately 70% confluent primary NHOKs and NHEKs were plated at 1 × 105 cells per 60-mm culture dish and cultured until the cells reached 70% confluence. Cells were then subcultured at every 70% confluence until they reached the post-mitotic stage of proliferation, at which time the culture was maintained for 12 days without further passage. Determination of NHOK and NHEK Culture Population Doublings— Individual keratinocytes isolated from gingival epithelial specimens and foreskins were plated in 60-mm culture dishes. Three days after seeding, the number of cells that had been originally plated was determined by colony counting. Cells were cultured until they reached 70% confluence and then the cell numbers in the various dishes were counted in a hemocytometer. This count allowed determination of the number of population doublings (PDs) of the primary cultures. Harvested primary cultures were subcultured until they reached the post-mitotic stage of proliferation. The PD was calculated at the end of each passage according to the formula 2N = (Cf/Ci), where N denotes the number of PDs; Cf, the total number of cells harvested at the end of a passage; and Ci, the total number of attached cells at seeding. Construction of Vectors Expressing Antisense RNA and Wild-type βig-h3 and Cloning of the Promoter Regions of Involucrin and Transglutaminase 1—Antisense βig-h3 constructs were made by inserting 375-bp human βig-h3 cDNA fragments (nucleotides 879 to 1253) containing the ATG start codon, in an antisense orientation, into the EcoRI sites of a pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which expresses a neomycin (G418) resistance gene. βig-h3 expression plasmids were made by inserting 2204-bp human βig-h3 cDNA fragments (nucleotides -5 to 2199) containing the ATG start codon, in a sense orientation, into the NotI sites of the same pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The human βig-h3 cDNA encompassing nucleotides -5 to 2199 was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using sense (5′-GCACCATGGCGCTCTTCGTGC-3′) and antisense (5′-TGCACAAGGCTCACATCTCATTA-3′) primers. Similarly, the human involucrin promoter region (nucleotides -2063 to 1325) was amplified with sense (5′-GAAGCTTAGACCGGTGTGCTTCCTTGACTTGA-3′) and antisense primers (5′-GGTCGACCTGATGGGTATTGACTGGAGGAGGAAC-3′), and the human transglutaminase-1 promoter region (nucleotides -2269 to 70) with sense (5′-TGCATGCTCCTTCTTTCTGCGCCATCCTATTGTTT-3′) and antisense primers (5′-TGTCGACGCAGTACTGAGTCCTGGGGCTGAGATGG-3′). Amplification was performed with an ABI Prism™ 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The resulting sequences were compared with published sequences of the promoter regions of involucrin (24Lopez-Bayghen E. Vega A. Cadena A. Granados S.E. Jave L.F. Gariglio P. Alvarez-Salas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 512-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and transglutaminase-1 (25Yamanishi K. Inazawa J. Liew F.M. Nonomura K. Ariyama T. Yasuno H. Abe T. Doi H. Hirano J. Fukushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17858-17863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified 3.4-kb fragment of human involucrin promoter and the 2.3-kb fragment of human transglutaminase-1 promoter were subcloned into a pCAT-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), linking them to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The correct orientation of the inserts with respect to the CAT sequence was verified by restriction enzyme analysis. Transfection, Selection, and CAT Assay—NHOKs were transfected in suspension with antisense βig-h3 or pcDNA3.1(+) vector using a Polybrene/glycerol method (26Jiang C.K. Connolly D. Blumenberg M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and then incubated in keratinocyte growth medium. Beginning 2 days after transfection, cells were incubated for 4 days in 70 μm G418 (Invitrogen). Selected cells were serially subcultured until they reached the post-mitotic stage of proliferation and then harvested. The intracellular levels of βig-h3, involucrin, transglutaminase, Akt, phospho-Akt, and calcium were quantitated by Western blotting and dual-wavelength fluorescence imaging, as described elsewhere. In other experiments of the present study, exponentially proliferating keratinocytes, plated in 35-mm culture dishes, were co-transfected with antisense βig-h3 or pcDNA3.1(+) vector, involucrin- or transglutaminase-1-CAT chimeric plasmid promoter constructs, and 1.0 μg of pZeoSVLacZ using the Polybrene/glycerol method (26Jiang C.K. Connolly D. Blumenberg M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). pZeoSVLacZ is a β-galactosidase expression vector that contains a β-galactosidase gene driven by a SV40 promoter and enhancer; this was used as an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency. The cells were lysed 48 h after co-transfection and the cell extracts assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activities. Detailed conditions for the enzyme activity assay are described elsewhere (27Kook J.-K. Kim J.H. Min B.-M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 765-771PubMed Google Scholar). A pCAT-control vector (Promega) containing a SV40 promoter and enhancer, shown to be unresponsive, was included as a control in each transfection experiment. Antibodies and Recombinant βig-h3 Proteins—Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the human integrin α2 (P1E6), α3 (P1B5), α5 (P1D6), α6 (GoH3), β1 (P4C10), and β4 (3E1) subunits were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The function-blocking mAbs against the human integrin α2 (P1E6), α3 (P1B5), α5 (P1D6), α6 (GoH3), αv (AV1), β1 (6S6), and β4 (3E1) subunits were also purchased from Chemicon. Recombinant βig-h3 protein and polyclonal anti-βig-h3 antiserum against recombinant βig-h3 protein were generously provided by Dr. E. Bae (REGEN Biotech, Korea). The expression plasmid for recombinant βig-h3 protein has been described in detail in previous reports (11Kim J.-E. Kim S.-J. Lee B.-H. Park R.-W. Kim K.-S. Kim I.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometric analysis of the cell surface integrin expression level was performed as described previously (28Rodeck U. Jost M. Kari C. Shih D.T. Lavker R.M. Ewert D.L. Jensen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NHOKs were detached by gentle treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed, and incubated with anti-integrin mAbs (anti-α2, α3, α5, α6, β1, and β4) for 45 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies for 45 min at 4 °C. Finally, cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Adhesion Inhibition Assay—To identify the βig-h3 receptor on NHOKs, 5 μg/ml of mAbs to different types of integrins were incubated with exponentially proliferating (PD 13) or terminally differentiated (PD 20) NHOKs in 0.5 ml of incubation solution (2 × 105 cells/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. These preincubated cells were transferred onto plates coated with 10 μg/ml of recombinant βig-h3 protein (plates had been protein-coated and stored overnight at 4 °C) and then incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, unattached cells were removed by two rinses with PBS. Attached cells were fixed with 10% formalin in PBS for 15 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and stained with 0.005% crystal violet for 1 h. The plates were gently rinsed with double distilled water three times. To ensure a representative count, each plate was divided into quarters and two fields per quarter were photographed using an Olympus BX51 microscope at ×100 magnification. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion was assayed as described previously (29Okazaki I. Suzuki N. Nishi N. Utani A. Matsuura H. Shinkai H. Yamashita H. Kitagawa Y. Nomizu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37070-37078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 10 μg/ml recombinant βig-h3 protein and held overnight at 4 °C before being blocked with PBS containing 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached by treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA in PBS, resuspended in the culture media (1 × 105 cells/500 μl), added to each plate, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Removal of unattached cells and fixing, staining, and imaging of attached cells was identical as in the adhesion inhibition assay. Effects of Exogenous TGF-β1 and Recombinant βig-h3 Protein on Keratinocyte Differentiation—To determine the effects of TGF-β1 and recombinant βig-h3 protein on keratinocyte differentiation and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, the expression of involucrin, transglutaminase, and βig-h3; the promoter activities of involucrin and transglutaminase; the intracellular calcium level; and the phosphorylation status of Akt were determined in exponentially proliferating NHOKs, which were cultured for 4 days in the presence of 10 or 20 ng/ml TGF-β1 or 10 μg/ml recombinant βig-h3 protein. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—After cells were transfected with either the antisense βig-h3 cDNA constructs or βig-h3 expression plasmids and exposed to recombinant βig-h3 protein, the intracellular calcium level was measured by digital video microfluorimetry using an intensified CCD camera coupled to a microscope (Olympus 1X71S8F-2, Japan) supported by Metafluor software on a Pentium computer (Shutter Instrument, Novato, CA). This procedure has been described previously (23Oh J.-E. Kook J.-K. Park K.-H. Lee G. Seo B.-M. Min B.-M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 11: 491-498PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as in previous reports (19Min B.-M. Woo K.M. Lee G. Park N.-H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using anti-human involucrin (SY5) mAb (Sigma), anti-human TGF-β1 (sc-146) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-human transglutaminase (Ab-1) polyclonal antibody (Oncogene, Uniondale, NY), polyclonal anti-βig-h3 antiserum against recombinant βig-h3 protein (REGEN Biotech, Korea), and anti-β-actin (20Fuchs E.

After probing with each antibody, the membrane was stained with 1× Ponceau S stain for 10 min or subjected to immunoblot analysis using a specific antibody to β-actin for determination of the total protein loaded per lane. The relative protein levels were determined as follows. First, the densitometric intensities of the target protein or β-actin from the Western blots and the constitutive protein from the Ponceau S stain were measured with a LAS-1000 Plus (Fuji Photo film, Japan). The ratio of target protein to constitutive protein or β-actin for each sample was then calculated to correct for differences in protein loading. This ratio was normalized to the target protein/constitutive protein or β-actin ratio of the negative controls to obtain the relative levels of protein. Akt Phosphorylation Assay—To determine the effects of TGF-β1, recombinant βig-h3 protein, and changes in βig-h3 expression on the phosphorylation status of Akt, exponentially proliferating NHOKs were cultured for 4 days in the presence of 10 or 20 ng/ml TGF-β1 or 10 μg/ml recombinant βig-h3 proteins. Exponentially proliferating keratinocytes were also transfected with either the antisense βig-h3 cDNA constructs or βig-h3 expression plasmids. The phosphorylation status of Akt was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473, 9271) and anti-Akt (9272) (Cell signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Expression of βig-h3 and TGF-β1 Is Enhanced during Keratinocyte Differentiation—Primary NHOKs were subcultured at every 70% confluence until they reached the post-mitotic stage of proliferation, at which time the culture was maintained for 12 days without further passage. Primary NHOKs (PD 13.4) and cells with lower PDs (PD 15.8) displayed the typical keratinocyte morphology and retained an undifferentiated phenotype. Some cells with PD 16.9, meanwhile, maintained their squamous"

According to both fluorescence binding and kinetic assays, the E636A variant behaved according to half-of-the-sites mechanism with respect to ThDP. In contrast, with the E636Q variant a <i>K<sub>d,</sub></i><sub>ThDP</sub> = 4.34 μm and <i>K<sub>m</sub></i><sub>,ThDP</sub> = 11 μm were obtained with behavior more reminiscent of the parental enzyme. The CD spectra of both variants gave evidence for formation of the 1′,4′-iminopyrimidine tautomer on binding of phosphonolactylthiamine diphosphate, a stable analog of the substrate-ThDP covalent complex. Rapid formation of optically active (<i>R</i>)-acetolactate by both variants, but not by the parental enzyme, was observed by CD and NMR spectroscopy. The acetolactate configuration produced by the Glu<sup>636</sup> variants is opposite that produced by the enzyme acetolactate synthase and the Asp<sup>28</sup>-substituted variants of yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, suggesting that the active centers of the two sets of enzymes exhibit different facial selectivity (<i>re</i> or <i>si</i>) <i>vis à vis</i> pyruvate. The tryptic peptide map (mass spectral analysis) revealed that the Glu<sup>636</sup> substitution changed the mobility of a loop comprising amino acid residues from the ThDP binding fold.

https://openalex.org/W1998229125,"Changes in the function of type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) are associated with neuronal development and tolerance to the sedative-hypnotic effects of GABAAR positive modulators. Persistent activation of GABAARs by millimolar concentrations of GABA occurs under physiological conditions as GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in neocortex and cerebellum exhibit basal firing rates of 5 to 50 Hz and intermittent rates up to 250 Hz, leaving a substantial fraction of synaptic receptors occupied persistently by GABA. Persistent exposure of neurons to GABA has been shown to cause a down-regulation of receptor number and an uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine (BZD) site interactions with a half-life of ∼24 h. Here, we report that a single brief exposure of neocortical neurons in primary culture to GABA for 5–10 min (t½ = 3.2 ± 0.2 min) initiates a process that results in uncoupling hours later (t½ = 12.1 ± 2.2 h). Initiation of delayed-onset uncoupling is blocked by co-incubation with picrotoxin or α-amanitin but is insensitive to nifedipine, indicating that uncoupling is contingent upon receptor activation and transcription but is not dependent on voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. Delayed-onset uncoupling occurs without a change in receptor number or a change in the proportion of α1 subunit pharmacology, as zolpidem binding affinity is unaltered. Such activity dependent latent modulation of GABAAR function that manifests as delayed-onset uncoupling may be relevant to physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological conditions where synaptic receptors are transiently exposed to GABA agonists for several minutes.

Sci. 1988; 9: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Attempts to uncover the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie tolerance to chronic in vivo administration of BZDs began 21 years ago with the discovery that a subsensitivity of allosteric interactions between the GABA and BZD recognition sites occurs after chronic in vivo administration of diazepam to rats (4Gallager D.W. Lakoski J.M. Gonsalves S.F. Rauch S.L. Nature. 1984; 308: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This was subsequently referred to as uncoupling of allosteric interactions based on experiments in primary cultures of chick brain (5Roca D.J. Schiller G.D. Friedman L. Rozenberg I. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 710-719PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a single dose of diazepam results in subsensitivity after only 12 h (6Holt R.A. Bateson A.N. Martin I.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2219-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GABAAR subsensitivity is produced via an interaction of diazepam with GABA-mediated synaptic transmission because BZDs potentiate the GABAAR-mediated response (7Choi D.W. Farb D.H. Fischbach G.D. Nature. 1977; 269: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, a single convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole causes a reduction in the GABA potentiation of BZD binding in vivo and this is accompanied by selective decreases in subunit-subtype mRNA levels without down-regulation of receptor number (8Walsh L.A. Li M. Zhao T.J. Chiu T.H. Rosenberg H.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1626-1633PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that uncoupling between GABA and BZD binding sites can occur in vivo under pharmacologically relevant conditions and without alteration receptor number. Chronic treatment with flurazepam induces tolerance and yields subunit-specific changes in the levels of region-specific GABAAR subunit mRNAs and proteins (9Tietz E.I. Zeng X.J. Chen S. Lilly S.M. Rosenberg H.C. Kometiani P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 932-942PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tietz E.I. Huang X. Chen S. Ferencak 3rd, W.F.

Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), consistent with the hypothesis that persistent GABAAR activation can regulate GABAAR subunit gene expression. Whether such changes in gene expression underlie tolerance to drug administration remains unknown. Insight into the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying adaptive changes of receptor function can be derived from studies using primary neuronal cultures expressing native GABAARs. Such results have demonstrated that persistent exposure of cultured neurons to positive modulators of the GABA response, such as BZDs, produces uncoupling of allosteric interactions (5Roca D.J.

In contrast to BZD treatment, occupancy of GABAARs by GABA induces a down-regulation in receptor number (15Friedman L.K. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H.

Because exposure to BZDs, steroids, and barbiturates can cause uncoupling of allosteric modulatory sites on the GABAAR without producing down-regulation, it has been postulated that down-regulation and uncoupling are controlled by different mechanisms of action. Down-regulation is most likely the product of a transcriptional repression of GABAAR subunit genes (20Lyons H.R. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Russek S.J. Bandyopadhyay S. Farb D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrate that chronic exposure of neurons to GABA induces down-regulation of receptor number with a t½ of 25 h and uncoupling occurs with a similar time course (t½ = 24 h) (18Roca D.J. Rozenberg I. Farrant M. Farb D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar). Uncoupling is unlike down-regulation in that it is independent of voltage-gated calcium channel activation (22Lyons H.R. Land M.B. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our initial reports using neurons in primary culture revealed a t½ of 18 h for BZD-induced uncoupling but no uncoupling was detected for exposures of 6 h or less (5Roca D.J. Schiller G.D. Friedman L. Rozenberg I. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 710-719PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to this result in neurons, BZD-induced uncoupling in transfected cell lines occurs more rapidly and appears to be independent of transcription. The results from stably transfected Ltk– fibroblast (uncoupling a t½ = 32 min) and WSS-1 kidney (uncoupling t½ = 3 h) cell lines expressing recombinant GABAARs argue against a mechanism involving transcriptional regulation (23Klein R.L. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2349-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Wong G. Lyon T. Skolnick P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1056-1062PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the results obtained using the transiently transfected Sf9 insect cell line support internalization as a mechanism for uncoupling (25Ali N.J. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results appear to demonstrate that BZD-induced uncoupling is the result of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Here we have examined the relationship between GABAAR activation and the subsequent establishment of uncoupling in neocortical neurons. Delayed-onset uncoupling was found to be a transcription-dependent form of receptor regulation that occurs through a two-step mechanism: a rapid initiation process taking several minutes and requiring GABAAR activation, followed by a delayed-onset transduction process independent of the presence of agonist. Cell Cultures—Primary cultures were prepared from 18-day-old rat embryos (Sprague-Dawley). Whole brains were quickly removed and placed in ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free buffer. Cerebral cortexes were dissected under a microscope and placed in 5 ml of ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free buffer. Tissue was finely minced, triturated with a serological pipette, and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of plating medium (Neurobasal™ medium plus B27 serum-free supplement, Invitrogen; 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine) and triturated again with a serological pipette. This cell suspension was added to a final volume of plating medium and plated at a density of 3/4 cortex per 100-mm tissue culture dish coated with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and after 1 h, the medium was aspirated and replaced with serum-free medium. Drug Treatment—Cultures, 2–3 × 100-mm dishes/treatment group, containing 14 ml of medium were treated on day 7 as follow: 7 ml of medium (conditioned medium) was removed and kept in the incubator, a small volume (70 μl) of concentrated drug stock or vehicle was added. Drug stocks were prepared in medium, except for nifedipine, which was dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of Me2SO in the medium was 0.1%. Dishes were returned to the incubator, and after 1 to 20 min, the medium was aspirated. Cultures were washed twice with 7 ml of Neurobasal™ medium, and the 7 ml of the conditioned medium was added back. Picrotoxin (100 μm) was added to this conditioned medium in the experiments that are shown in Table II. After 0–48 h of incubation, cells were collected. For experiments studying α-amanitin effects, cultures were preincubated for 50 min with the transcriptional inhibitor alone (5 μg/ml), and then GABA was added and co-incubated for 10 min. The cells were washed twice and harvested 0–96 h later.Table IIDelayed-onset uncoupling is not a consequence of residual GABATreatmentGABA stimulated [3H]fnZ bindingPotentiationCoupling%Mock, PICRO45 ± 4100GABA, PICRO27 ± 1aSignificantly different from mock: p < 0.02 (Student's t test).62 ± 5a Significantly different from mock: p < 0.02 (Student's t test). Open table in a new tab Binding Assays—Cultures were rinsed with 7 ml of ice-cold PBSS (123 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 11 mm NaH2PO4, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 22.2 mm glucose, pH 7.4), and the cells were scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. For osmotic shock studies, the pellet was homogenized in 10 volumes of double-distilled H2O by 12 strokes using a glass Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The final pellet was homogenized in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialyzed against 4× 4 liter of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) overnight at 4 °C. For the rest of the experiments, the first pellet (after centrifugation at 500 × g) was directly homogenized in EDTA/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer before dialysis. Aliquots of homogenates (75–100 μg of protein) were incubated in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 60 min at 4 °C with [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]fnZ, 0.01–10 nm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [3H]muscimol (1 to 200 nm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in saturation binding experiments. To measure GABA potentiation of BZD binding, 0.5 nm [3H]fnZ was used alone or in the presence of 1 mm GABA. Competition binding assays were performed using 0.5 nm [3H]Ro15 1788 with 1 nm to 0.1 mm zolpidem. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm flurazepam, muscimol, or Ro15 1788 in [3H]fnZ, [3H]muscimol, and [3H]Ro15 1788 binding experiments, respectively, and subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold PBSS, immediately filtered under vacuum through glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B), and washed 3 times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBSS. Radioactivity retained on the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 5 ml of Ecolite(+) scintillation fluid (ICN). Real-time PCR Experiments—Total RNA was extracted from rat cortical neuronal cultures using a RNeasy® midi kit (Qiagen). Primers (Oligos Etc) were designed to amplify segments of rat GABAA receptor subunit cDNAs encoding amino acids located in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains M3 and M4 (an area with amino acid sequences divergent for the different subunits) using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystem). Rat GABAA receptor subunit probes were synthesized by Applied Biosystems (TaqMan probes). Ribosomal RNA probe and primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The sequence of primers and probes were: α1 primers, 5′-CCCCGGCTTGGCAACTA-3′ and 5′-CGGTTTTGTCTCAGGCTTGAC-3′; α1 probe, 5′-TGCTAAAAGTGCGACCATAGAACCGAAAGA-3′; α2 primers, 5′-GCATTACTGAAGTCTTCACCAACATC-3′ and 5′-CGAAAGAAAACATCTATTGTATATTCCATATC-3′; α2 probe, 5′-ATGTGACCAGTTTTGGCCCTGTCTCAGA-3′; α3 primers, 5′-CGCGACGGCCATGG-3′ and 5′-CAAATTCAATCAGTGCAGAAAATACAA-3′; α3 probe, 5′-CTGGTTCATGGCCGTCTGTTATGCC-3′; α4 primers, 5′-TGAAATCCTGAGGTTGAACAATATG-3′ and 5′-AGACAGATTTCTTTCCATTCCTGAAG-3′; α4 probe, 5′-TGGTCACCAAAGTTTGGACCCCTGAT-3′; α5 primers, 5′-GGCTCTTGGATGGCTATGACA-3′ and 5′-CACCTGCGTGATTCGCTCT-3′; α5 probe, 5′-CAGACTGCGGCCTGGGCTGG-3′; β1 primers, 5′-CCGGCAAGGGTCGCA-3′ and 5′-TCAGTCAAGTCAGGGATCTTCACT3′; β1 probe, 5′-CCGCAGACGTGCCTCTCAGCTCA-3′; β2 primers, 5′-ACCCCAGGAGCACAATGC-3′ and 5′-AGGCAACCCAGCTTTCCG-3′; β2 probe, 5′-TGCCTATGATGCCTCCAGCATCCAGTA-3′; β3 primers, 5′-AGAGCATGCCCAAGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-AGGTGCGTCTTCTTGTGCG-3′; β3 probe, 5′-CTTCTGTCTCCCATGTACCGCCCATG-3′; γ1 primers, 5′-CCCAGGTCTCCATGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TTCCCCTTGAGGCATAGAAATG-3′; γ1 probe, 5′-TACTCTGATTCCCATGAACA-3′; γ2S primers, 5′-AAACCCTGCCCCTACCATTG-3′ and 5′-GGCATTGTTCATTTGGATCGT-3′; γ2S probe, 5′-TCCGTCCCAGATCAG-3′. Quantitative one-step real-time PCR was performed in an ABI prism Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System using a QuantiTect™ Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Standard curves for relative quantification were generated with 1 to 500 ng of total RNA isolated from control cultures (treated with vehicle). Total RNA (10–40 ng) from cultures treated with GABA was tested. Reactions were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 50 μl containing QuantiTect RT mixture, QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR master mixture, 250 μm receptor probe, 900 nm receptor primers, 1 μm rRNA probe, and 250 nm rRNA primers. Two aliquots of 20 μl/reaction were loaded in a 384-well plate. Incubation conditions were 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. The relative amount of each GABAA receptor subunit RNA was normalized to the relative amount of rRNA (internal control). Data Analysis—Coupling represents the potentiation of [3H]fnZ binding by GABA and was estimated as: (% potentiationtreated/% potentiationcontrol) × 100. Uncoupling was defined as the decrease in GABA-potentiated [3H]fnZ binding and calculated as: [1 – (% potentiationtreated/% potentiationcontrol)] × 100. Concentration effect, time course, and saturation binding data were analyzed by computer-aided nonlinear regression. We have previously reported that 48-h exposure of primary neuronal cultures to 1 mm GABA results in down-regulation of the number of BZD binding sites (t½ = 25 h) and an uncoupling between binding sites for GABA and BZDs (t½ = 24 h (15Friedman L.K.

To investigate whether the continuous presence of GABA during the 48-h period is required to induce GABAAR regulation, we studied the effect of brief incubations of rat cerebral cortical neurons with GABA. Neurons were exposed to 1 mm GABA for 0–20 min, whereupon GABA was removed, cells returned to the incubator for 48 h and then harvested. Such brief exposures to GABA (t½ = 3.2 min) are sufficient to induce a decrease in the potentiation of [3H]fnZ binding by GABA (46 ± 6% maximal uncoupling, Fig. 1) without producing a change in the affinity and number of [3H]muscimol and [3H]fnZ binding sites (Table I).Table IExposure of cortical neurons to 1 mm GABA for 10 min has no effect on [3H]muscimol and [3H]fnZ binding[3H]Muscimol binding[3H]fnZ bindingKdBmaxKdBmaxnmpmol / mg proteinnmpmol / mg proteinMock0.37 ± 0.0437.51 ± 3.881.42 ± 0.100.38 ± 0.03GABA0.55 ± 0.0748.10 ± 4.661.62 ± 0.080.37 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Blockade of uncoupling by inclusion of picrotoxin (100 μm) during incubation demonstrates that uncoupling depends on GABAAR activation (Fig. 2).

The points represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the incubation period after exposure to GABA is required to produce uncoupling, cultures were incubated with 1 mm GABA for 10 min, washed, and then incubated for different times (0 to 96 h) in the absence of GABA (Fig. 4). We did not detect uncoupling when cells were harvested immediately after GABA exposure; however, uncoupling increased with incubation time, reaching a maximum at 24 to 48 h. These results suggest that an incubation period of at least 24 h is necessary to produce uncoupling. A reversion phase followed the peak of uncoupling, and uncoupling was lost after a 72-h incubation period. In contrast, uncoupling produced by continuous exposure to GABA persisted for at least 84 h in GABA (18Roca D.J. Rozenberg I. Farrant M. Farb D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that activation of the GABAAR did not occur from residual GABA that may not have been removed by the washing procedure, we added picrotoxin to the medium after brief GABA exposure (Table II) and uncoupling (38 ± 5%) was not significantly different from control (p < 0.05). This demonstrates that initiation of delayed-onset uncoupling is because of the presence of the agonist exclusively during the initial 10 min of incubation. We have previously demonstrated that GABA induces Ca2+ influx in embryonic brain neurons kept in culture. Moreover, blockade of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by nifedipine inhibits down-regulation of GABAAR number (22Lyons H.R. Land M.B. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, nifedipine does not prevent uncoupling induced by the 48-h treatment with GABA (22Lyons H.R. Land M.B. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To ask whether Ca2+ influx mediates fast GABA-induced initiation of delayed-onset uncoupling, we co-incubated cultures with nifedipine during the initiation phase (Fig. 2). Application of nifedipine failed to inhibit delayed-onset uncoupling, suggesting that the uncoupling mechanism induced by either a pulse application of GABA or persistent exposure to GABA is independent of L-type Ca2+ channel activation. Results from Ali and Olsen (25Ali N.J. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) performed in an insect cell line suggest that uncoupling involves a receptor internalization process induced by the acidic environment inside intracellular compartments. To investigate whether an internalization mechanism is responsible for GABA-induced uncoupling in neurons, a similar procedure was performed as described by Ali and Olsen (25Ali N.J. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) where intracellular compartments that persisted in membrane homogenates were lysed by osmotic shock. Results from these experiments indicate that such treatment does not inhibit uncoupling (Table III), suggesting that a receptor internalization process seen in insect cell lines may not be related to uncoupling in neurons.Table IIIEffects of osmotic shock and inhibition of transcription on delayed-onset GABA-induced uncouplingTreatmentGABA stimulated [3H]fnZ bindingPotentiationCoupling%Mock44 ± 3100GABA23 ± 3aSignificantly different from mock: p < 0.05 (Student's t test).53 ± 6Mock, osmotic shock39 ± 688 ± 10GABA, osmotic shock17 ± 4aSignificantly different from mock: p < 0.05 (Student's t test).39 ± 6α-Amanitin36 ± 682 ± 9GABA + α-amanitin50 ± 5112 ± 7a Significantly different from mock: p < 0.05 (Student's t test). Open table in a new tab Studies from cell lines suggest that uncoupling is the result of a post-transcriptional regulatory process (23Klein R.L. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. J.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To ask whether a transcriptional event is part of the uncoupling mechanism in neurons, we studied the effect of α-amanitin, a potent inhibitor of transcription, on the initiation phase of GABA exposure. Delayed-onset uncoupling was completely prevented when α-amanitin was added to the cultures 50 min before the addition of GABA and left in the medium during the 10-min GABA exposure period (Table III). Incubation of neurons with α-amanitin alone did not produce a significant effect on the potentiation of [3H]fnZ binding by GABA. These results show that uncoupling is contingent upon transcription. Brief exposure to GABA does not produce a change in the number of BZD binding sites (Table I) consistent with the fact that subunit mRNA levels specific to the γ2 subunit do not change. Uncoupling in the absence of down-regulation, however, could be because of altered expression of GABAARs that display different strengths in the coupling between their GABA and BZD modulatory binding sites (α3 > α1 (26Puia G. Vicini S. Seeburg P.H. Costa E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 691-696PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 240-244PubMed Google Scholar, 28Smith A.J.

As a first step to determine whether brief exposure to GABA produces a change in the expression of receptors with different coupling efficiencies, we used a ligand binding assay to detect whether there was an increase in the proportion of zolpidem-sensitive receptors, based on the fact that zolpidem shows selectivity for GABAARs containing the α1 subunit. Competition binding experiments were performed using [3H]Ro15 1788 as radioligand in the presence of different concentrations of zolpidem (Fig. 5). The IC50 for zolpidem did not change significantly after delayed-onset uncoupling, strongly indicating that an increase in the proportion of α1-containing receptors is not responsible for uncoupling in neurons. This result is consistent with the fact that α1 mRNA levels do not increase in response to delayed-onset uncoupling. In contrast, although the receptor number remains unchanged there is a selective decrease (p < 0.05) in α1 (–29.6 ± 2.38%), α3 (–32.5 ± 6.4%), β1 (–24.5 ± 3.9%), β2 (–27.5 ± 6.6%), and β3 (–18.3 ± 3.4%) mRNA levels with no change in α2(–2.3 ± 2.0%), α4(–8.2 ± 4.5%), α5 (3.3 ± 5.7%), γ1(–7.4 ± 1.9%), and γ2 (2.0 ± 6.5%) mRNAs. It remains to be determined whether decreased expression of α3 subunit mRNAs contributes functionally to delayed-onset uncoupling or whether altered transcription of regulatory factors such as protein kinases, phosphatases, or GABAAR-associated proteins play a major role in the uncoupling process. GABAAR activation-dependent plasticity of GABAergic synapses has been described both in neonatal and adult brain and has been suggested to play a role in the development and function of neuronal networks (29Caillard O.

Studies with Tie2 null mice indicate that the angiopoietin/Tie2 signaling system plays a role in the later steps of angiogenesis (9Dumont D.J. Gradwohl G. Fong G.H. Puri M.C. Gertsenstein M.

Consistent with a central role for Tie2 in angiogenesis, germ line-activating mutations in humans are associated with vascular dysmorphogenesis (10Vikkula M. Boon L.M. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Calvert J.T.

Additionally, the naturally occurring Tie2 antagonist, Ang-2, disrupts angiogenesis in vivo (11Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J.

Blocking Tie2 activation with recombinant Ang-2 significantly inhibits tumor growth (12Lin P. Buxton J.A. Acheson A. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Channon K.M. Hale L.P.

Hence, studies aimed at better defining the regulation of Tie2 expression are important in assessing anti-angiogenic therapeutic avenues. In addition to profound transcriptional effects (6Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S62-S67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), exposure of cells to hypoxia attenuates protein synthesis by decreasing translation initiation (15Koumenis C.

Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29655-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Two main steps of initiation are targets for regulation, either 43 S ribosomal complex formation (by affecting eIF2 phosphorylation status (17Clemens M.J. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2001; 5: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)) or the mRNA/ribosome binding step (18Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Ribosome recruitment in eukaryotes can occur by two mechanisms, a cap-dependent process and by internal ribosome recruitment. Cap-dependent recruitment occurs through eIF4F-mediated recognition of the m7G-cap structure and involves binding of the 43 S preinitiation complex near the mRNA 5′-end, followed by scanning to the appropriate AUG start codon (18Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Barriers to the scanning process, such as mRNA secondary structure and uORFs, impinge in a negative fashion on the translational efficiency of a mRNA species. The cap dependence of an mRNA is thought to be a function of 5′-cap-proximal secondary structure; hence mRNAs with reduced secondary structure will have reduced dependence on eIF4F for initiation, whereas those with increased secondary structure are more dependent on eIF4F for initiation (19Gehrke L. Auron P.E. Quigley G.J. Rich A. Sonenberg N. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5157-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Haghighat A. Pyronnet S. Witherell G. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Internal ribosome recruitment allows an mRNA to bypass the cap-dependent initiation requirement for eIF4F. These different mechanisms of initiation provide a layer of gene regulation by which expression of specific mRNAs can be maintained or altered independent of others. Although hypoxia exerts inhibitory effects on cap dependent ribosome binding (16Arsham A.M. Howell J.J. Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29655-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), several mRNAs implicated in angiogenesis remain efficiently translated, including VEGF (21Huez I.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and Tie2 (this report). Whereas VEGF and HIF-1α achieve this by recruiting ribosomes internally to an IRES, the issue of how Tie2 is able to circumvent this translational block has not been addressed previously. Herein, we present functional studies that identify the presence of an IRES element within the Tie2 5′-UTR, highlighting the complexities of Tie2 expression at the level of translation. Cell Lines, Transfections, and Hypoxia Treatment—Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in endothelial growth medium-2 supplemented with growth factors, 2% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 50 μg/ml amphotericin according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA transfections into primary HUVECs were performed using Lipofectin (Invitrogen), as specified by the manufacturer. Briefly, 1.5–1.8 × 105 cells were seeded per 10-cm2 plate and grown in endothelial growth medium-2 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and luciferase activities measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Transient RNA transfections were performed using the cationic lipid reagent, DMRIE-C (Invitrogen). Approximately 1.8 × 106 HUVECs were seeded per 10-cm2 plate 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were then transfected with 20 μg of capped and polyadenylated mRNA and harvested 8 h post-transfection. Transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated three times. For polysome analysis and RNA isolation, extracts prepared from HUVECs grown under hypoxia (>0.01% O2) and normoxia (20% O2) for 16 h were fractionated by velocity sedimentation on 10–50% sucrose gradients. All experiments with HUVECs were performed between passages two and five. Primer Extension—Human placental poly(A)+ or total RNA was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA from HUVECs was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified after separation on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. A mixture of 2.5 μg of mRNA or 25 μg of total RNA and 2 × 105 cpm of the primer was annealed at 65 °C for 15 min. The extension reaction was performed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extension products were separated on an 8% denaturing gel and the products visualized by autoradiography. RNase Protection Assay—Templates for riboprobe synthesis were prepared by subcloning a 244-bp fragment containing the hTie2 5′-flanking sequence (–467 to –224) into the pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create hTie2UP-Ribo15/pKSII. [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) was used with the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) to generate riboprobes from the XhoI-linearized hTie2UP-Ribo15/pKSII. The radiolabeled cRNA was purified by 8% denaturing gel electrophoresis, followed by elution for 12 h at 37 °C in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS. The efficiency of labeling was determined by scintillation counting, and 1 × 105 cpm of each labeled riboprobe were used per reaction. RNase protection assays were performed using the RPAIII system (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the labeled riboprobe was hybridized to 5 μg of human placental poly(A)+ for 16 h at 42 °C. Following hybridization, unprotected single-stranded RNA was digested with a mixture of RNase A (2.5 units/ml) plus RNase T1 (100 units/ml). The resulting protected products were separated on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Sucrose Gradients and Polysome Analysis—Polysome analyses were performed on HUVECs at 70% confluence. Cells were treated with 0.1 mg/ml cyclohexamide for 3 min and harvested in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml cyclohexamide, 333.3 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Ambion)) at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the extract was layered on 10–50% sucrose gradients in buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2). Gradients were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 °C, and fractions were collected across the gradient and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA or RNA from the indicated pooled fractions following sucrose gradient centrifugation was isolated using TRIzol. Generation of Monocistronic and Bicistronic Constructs—The generation of bicistronic constructs was based on pRΔDEF (26Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). First, a fragment corresponding to the hTie2 5′-UTR was generated by PCR amplification of the hTie2 5′-UTR cDNA and subcloned into pGL3-BASIC (Promega). In the second step, the fragments containing hTie2 5′-UTR and amino-terminal coding region of firefly luciferase were introduced into pRΔDEF by replacing the ΔEMCV 5′-UTR and the first 121-bp of firefly luciferase. Bicistronic constructs containing a stable stem-loop structure (TAR(+III) element (27Parkin N.T. Cohen E.A. Darveau A. Rosen C. Haseltine W. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2831-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) were generated by inserting the stem-loop element 232 bp upstream of the Renilla coding region of the above-mentioned bicistronic constructs. For all of the recombinant constructs generated in this study in which a reporter was placed downstream of uORF5, its AUG codon was placed in-frame with the predicted Tie2 AUG codon embedded in uORF5. The accuracy of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—Relative expression levels were assessed using a 200–300-ng RNA sample by real-time, one-step RT-PCR using the Roche Diagnostics LightCycler instrument and the Roche Diagnostics LightCycler RNA master SYBR green I kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. The level of 28 S rRNA was used as a reference value for quantitation within samples to determine the relative amounts of specific mRNA. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR are available on request. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated following transfection with bicistronic reporters. Following extraction of RNA with TRIzol, 21 μg of total RNA was loaded onto a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridization was in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (BD Biosciences) at 68 °C with a ∼400-nt firefly luciferase-specific 32P-labeled probe. Autoradiography of the membrane was performed at –80 °C with film (Kodak X-Omat) to visualize the radioactive signal. Metabolic Labeling with [35S]Methionine—HUVECs were plated at 2.7 × 105 cells per 150-mm plate and incubated for 24 h, followed by a further 12–36-h incubation under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 4 h prior to harvesting. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cell lysates (500 μg of total protein) were precleared with protein G-Sepharose and immunoprecipitations performed with anti-Tie2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-β-actin antibodies (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), and anti-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (Sigma) antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography. Experiments were performed twice at least in triplicate. Tie2 mRNA Is Translated under Hypoxic Conditions—To assess the translational behavior of Tie2 mRNA under hypoxic conditions, we monitored its distribution across polysomes from normoxic and hypoxic treated primary HUVECs (Fig. 1). Under hypoxic conditions, there is a reduction in polysomes accompanied by an apparent increase in amount of free ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1A), as reported previously (23Stein I. Itin A. Einat P. Skaliter R. Grossman Z. Keshet E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 25Lang K.J. Kappel A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and consistent with a reduction in protein synthesis associated with this physiological treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR from fractions collected from the bottom or top half of the polysomes (N/H-4 and N/H-3, respectively), as well as from the top of the gradient (N/H-1) and the region containing the ribosomal subunits (N/H-2), revealed that the distribution of Tie2 and VEGR mRNAs remain unchanged when cells are transferred from normoxic to hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the vast majority of β-actin mRNA appears in heavy polysomes under normoxic conditions (N-4) and redistributes to lighter fractions (H-3, H-2, H-1) when HUVECs are transferred to hypoxia (Fig. 1B). This is similar to what has been reported previously for β-actin mRNA redistribution when cells are exposed to hypoxia (25Lang K.J. Kappel A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 28Gorlach A. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Vogt L. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also assessed the change in polysome distribution of a second mRNA encoding ODC. Translation of this transcript is generally cap-dependent (29Rousseau D. Kaspar R. Rosenwald I. Gehrke L. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 30Seidel E.R. Ragan V.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), except during mitosis (31Pyronnet S. Pradayrol L. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As the majority of cells in our experiment were not in mitosis (<5%), we expect ODC to behave as a cap-dependent transcript. The majority of ODC mRNA from HUVECs under normoxic growth conditions was in N-2 or heavy polysomes (N-4). Upon exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia, the majority of the mRNA in the N-4 fraction shifted to lighter polysomes (H-3). These results are consistent with a reduction in cap-dependent protein synthesis associated with hypoxia (23Stein I. Itin A. Einat P. Skaliter R. Grossman Z. Keshet E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 25Lang K.J. Kappel A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Like other reports documenting mRNA redistribution among polysomes during hypoxia, we do not observe a complete disaggregation of β-actin (25Lang K.J. Kappel A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 28Gorlach A. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Vogt L. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or ODC mRNA into free mRNA (Fig. 1B), despite an apparent flattening of the polysome peak (Fig. 1A). We attribute this to the relative insensitivity of using spectrophotometry to monitor polysomes and suspect that there is some residual polysomes in the hypoxia-treated samples. To assess Tie2 protein levels under hypoxic conditions, we performed Western blot analysis on total protein isolated from HUVECs (Fig. 2A). HIF-2α protein was detected only in extracts prepared from hypoxic cells confirming activation of the hypoxic response (Fig. 2A). In this Western blot analysis, anti-H3 histone was used as a loading control for HIF-2α (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the polysome profiling results (Fig. 1), Tie2 protein was present in both normoxic and hypoxic treated cells (Fig. 2A). (In this experiment, a nonspecific band labeled with an asterisk is used as a loading control for Tie2.) Tie2 protein was actively translated under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions as assessed by metabolic labeling of HUVECs followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Tie2 antibodies (Fig. 2B). In contrast, synthesis of β-actin and ODC was significantly decreased after exposure of HUVECs to hypoxic stress (Fig. 2B). To gauge the extent to which translation in HUVECs is suppressed by hypoxia, we measured the rate of [35S]methionine incorporation into newly synthesized proteins in HUVECs under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2C). Under hypoxic conditions, protein synthesis is reduced by 85% in HUVECs, in comparison with HUVECs under normoxic or reoxygenated conditions following hypoxic stress (Fig. 2C). Taken together these results indicate that translation of Tie2 mRNA is resistant to the reduction in protein synthesis accompanied by hypoxic treatement of HUVECs. The levels of Tie2, VEGF, and β-actin mRNAs in total RNA isolated from HUVECs were also measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2D). VEGF mRNA levels increased 70-fold in response to hypoxia, whereas those of β-actin decreased ∼4-fold (Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with previously reported effects of hypoxia on VEGF and β-actin gene expressions (32Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar, 33Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar, 34Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, Tie2 mRNA levels decreased ∼4-fold, consistent with the results reported by Mandriota and Pepper (35Mandriota S.J. Pepper M.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Mapping the Human Tie2 5′-Untranslated Region—In an attempt to understand how Tie2 translation is maintained under hypoxic stress, during a time when overall cap-dependent protein synthesis is attenuated, we undertook a structure/function approach to mapping of the Tie2 5′-UTR. The transcription start sites of the human Tie2 mRNA have been previously defined using 5′-RACE and primer extension (36Hewett P.W. Daft E.L. Murray J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The results suggested the presence of 10 transcription initiation sites situated from 269 to 414 nucleotides upstream of the initiator AUG codon (37Fadel B.M. Boutet S.C. Quertermous T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However from this report, it is not possible to assess which sites were detected by primer extension versus those identified by 5′-RACE. We re-mapped the transcription initiation sites in the human Tie2 mRNA to identify transcription start sites. Primer extension analysis was performed with three oligonucleotides (hTie2-UP-6, hTie2-UP-7, hTie2-UP-1), which together span the entire length of the Tie2 5′-UTR (Fig. 3A). No specific products were visualized with hTie2-UP-6 or hTie2-UP-7, indicating that these likely reside too far downstream of the transcription start site(s). However, two distinct extension products were obtained with hTie2-UP-1 (Fig. 3B). These fragments map to nts –372 and –377 of the Tie2 5′-UTR (Fig. 3D, encased within gray boxes). To complement the primer extension results and determine whether we could detect the same start sites, we performed RNase protection experiments. The probe used extended from –467 to –224 (Fig. 3D, generated by primers hTie2-UP-4 and hTie2-UP-5). Two major protected fragments of 127 and 149 nucleotides were observed (Fig. 3C). These mapped to positions –372 and –350 of the Tie2 5′-UTR (Fig. 3D). We note that the start site at nucleotide –350 may have been missed in the primer extension analysis, due to high background in this size range of the gel (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the RNase protection and primer extension results indicate that a major Tie2 transcription site lies at nucleotide –372. This site also lies within 2 nucleotides of the identified murine Tie2 transcription initiation site (37Fadel B.M. Boutet S.C. Quertermous T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of over 300 5′-RACE PCR products demonstrated sequence contiguity with the Tie2 genomic DNA sequence, indicating the absence of a frequent splicing event within the Tie2 5′-UTR. 2E.-H. Park and J. Pelletier, unpublished data. Hence, the Tie2 mRNA isoforms identified here contain several features predicted to be inhibitory to a cap-dependent initiation mechanism, notably a lengthy 5′-UTR (372 nts), five uORFs, and an AUG codon embedded with the last uORF (Fig. 3D). In this report, we further characterize the translational properties of the –372 isoform. The Tie2 5′-UTR Mediates Internal Initiation—One mechanism by which Tie2 could be efficiently translated under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2B), a situation that reduces cap-dependent translation initiation (16Arsham A.M. Howell J.J. Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29655-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 26Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), would be if Tie2 translation proceeded by internal ribosome recruitment to the 5′-UTR. To test this, the Tie2 5′-UTR was positioned within the intercistronic spacer between the firefly and Renilla luciferase coding regions (Fig. 4A). We also generated a construct in which all uAUGs had been removed by mutating AUG to UUG, to assess their potential contribution to IRES activity (Fig. 4A). As a negative control for these experiments, we utilized a deletion mutant of the EMCV 5′-UTR that does not support internal ribosome binding (Fig. 4A, construct Ren/ΔEMC/FF). The length of the ΔEMC sequence is ∼440 bp, similar to the size of the Tie2 5′-UTR used in these experiments (372 bp). In addition, we generated constructs in which the human immunodeficiency virus TAR element (TAR(+III)) was positioned upstream of Renilla luciferase. This allowed us to probe whether firefly luciferase expression was independent of Renilla expression and not a consequence of ribosome reinitation (Fig. 4A). The stable secondary structure of this element (ΔG = –49.9 kcal/mol) is expected to act as a physical barrier to 5′-end-mediated initiation and decrease expression of the Renilla luciferase protein (27Parkin N.T. Cohen E.A. Darveau A. Rosen C. Haseltine W. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2831-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments with HUVECs revealed that expression vectors containing the TAR(+III) element upstream of the Renilla luciferase initiation codon displayed a ∼5-fold reduction in Renilla luciferase activity relative to the constructs lacking this stem-loop barrier (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1–3 to lanes 4–6). Very low levels of firefly luciferase activity were detectable from cells transfected with Ren/ΔEMC/FF or TAR(+III)/Ren/ΔEMC/FF, since the ΔEMC 5′-UTR does not allow for efficient reinitiation or for internal ribosome recruitment (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 4). However, significant and comparable firefly luciferase activities were detected in extracts from cells transfected with Ren/Tie2/FF and TAR(+III)/Ren/Tie2/FF (Fig. 4B, compare lane 2 with lane 5) or with Ren/Tie2ΔuAUG/FF and TAR(+III)/Ren/Tie2ΔuAUG/FF (Fig. 4B, compare lane 3 with lane 6). These results indicate that the Tie2 5′-UTR mediates the production of firefly luciferase independent of Renilla luciferase, as would be expected if an IRES was present. IRES Activity Is Maintained during Hypoxia—One function of the Tie2 IRES might be to maintain efficient translation during hypo"
https://openalex.org/W2084699541,"p73 is a member of the p53 gene family, which also includes p53 and p63. These proteins share sequence similarity and target genes but also have divergent roles in cancer and development. Unlike p53, transcription of the p73 gene yields multiple full-length (transactivation (TA) domain) and amino terminus-truncated (ΔN) isoforms. ΔNp73 acts in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit the actions of TAp73 and p53 on their target genes, promoting cell survival and proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. The balance between TAp73 and its negative regulator, ΔNp73, may therefore represent an important determinant of developmental cell fate. There is little if anything known regarding the developmental regulation of the p73 gene. In this study, we showed that TAp73 and ΔNp73 exhibit reciprocal spatiotemporal expression and functions during nephrogenesis. TAp73 was predominantly expressed in the differentiation domain of the renal cortex in an overlapping manner with the vasopressin-sensitive water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP-2). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the endogenous AQP-2 promoter was occupied by TAp73 in a developmentally regulated manner. Furthermore TAp73 stimulated AQP-2 promoter-driven reporter expression. TAp73 also activated the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) promoter, a developmentally regulated gene involved in regulation of sodium excretion. The transcriptional effects of TAp73 on AQP-2 and B2R were independent of p53. In marked contrast to TAp73, ΔNp73 isoforms were induced early in development and were preferentially expressed in proliferating nephron precursors. Moreover ΔNp73 was a potent repressor of B2R gene transcription. We conclude that the p73 gene is developmentally regulated during kidney organogenesis. The spatiotemporal switch from ΔNp73 to TAp73 may play an important role in the terminal differentiation program of the developing nephron."
https://openalex.org/W2014869052,"The dbl oncogene product is the defining member of a family of onco-proteins known as Dbl guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that facilitate the activation of the small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42, Rac, and Rho. Oncogenic activation of proto-Dbl occurs through loss of the amino-terminal 497 residues, rendering the protein constitutively active. Because both onco- and proto-Dbl contain the structural elements required for GEF activity (i.e. the Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains), it is thought that the amino terminus of proto-Dbl somehow inhibits the biochemical activity of the protein. To better understand the molecular basis of this regulation, we set forth to identify cellular proteins that preferentially bind the proto-oncogenic form of Dbl. We identified the molecular chaperone heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70) as a binding partner that preferentially interacts with the proto-oncogenic form of Dbl. Dbl is complexed with Hsc70 in transfected cells, as well as in native mouse brain extracts. The interaction between Hsc70 and proto-Dbl is mediated by at least two regions in Dbl, the aminoterminal spectrin homology domain (residues 224–417) and the pleckstrin homology domain (residues 711–808). Overexpression of a dominant negative Hsc70 mutant leads to activation of proto-Dbl GEF activity, indicating that the chaperone negatively regulates proto-Dbl function in vivo. We propose that Hsc70 attenuates Dbl activity by maintaining an inactive conformation in which the amino terminus is “folded over” the catalytic DH-PH domain.

The dbl oncogene was first identified in 1985 by transfection of fibroblasts with DNA from a human diffuse B-cell lymphoma (1Eva A. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1985; 316: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Since then, multiple other gene products have been described that bear strong sequence homology to the original Dbl protein (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin.

Operationally, Dbl family members have been defined as proteins that contain the tandem arrangement of a pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, Dbl homology; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; Hsc70, heat shock cognate protein 70.1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, Dbl homology; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; Hsc70, heat shock cognate protein 70. domain adjacent to a unique domain termed the Dbl homology (DH) domain. Many of these proteins possess high oncogenic potential and were found in gene transfer experiments to be potent fibroblast-transforming genes (3Zheng Y. Trends Biochem.

Wen M. Wu D. Wu M. Xia A. Zandieh A. Zhu X. Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). To date, most Dbl-family members have been documented to function as activators or guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho-like GTP-binding proteins (i.e. Cdc42, Rac, and Rho; reviewed in Refs. 2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 3Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 4Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Like all GTPases, Rho proteins function as binary molecular switches that are “on” in the GTP-bound state and “off” in the GDP-bound state. Deactivation is achieved by the intrinsic GTP hydrolytic capability of these proteins that is further stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins. GTPase activation, occurring in response to a variety of events (such as growth factor stimulation), is the reaction facilitated by GEFs that promotes dissociation of the bound GDP. GTP then re-binds to the GTPase, thus forming the active state of the molecule. Oncogenic activation of Dbl-like proto-oncogenes often occurs by a specific mutation or a chromosomal rearrangement event that leads to a truncation, resulting in unregulated GEF activity.Current understanding of the chain of upstream events that lead to Dbl activation is extremely limited. One mode of regulation is provided by the PH domain, as it was shown to bind phosphoinositides (7Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and because its deletion abolishes transformation by onco-Dbl (8Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, the fact that the amino terminus of proto-Dbl is lost during oncogenic activation suggests that this region exerts negative regulation on the DH-PH module. Indeed, Bi et al. demonstrated that co-expression of the amino terminus of Dbl leads to attenuation of onco-Dbl GEF activity, suggesting an auto-inhibitory regulatory mechanism (9Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of this interaction is unknown, and it is unclear how proliferative signals affect it.To better understand the molecular basis of Dbl regulation, we set forth to identify cellular proteins that preferentially bind the proto-oncogenic form of Dbl. Here we report the identification of the molecular chaperone heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) as a novel regulator of Dbl function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Constructs—The proto-Dbl (residues 1–925), onco-Dbl (residues 498–925), DH-PH-Dbl (residues 498–825) (8Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and T1-Dbl (residues 1–825) (9Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) genes were excised from pCMV6 or pZIP-Neo vectors with BamHI and ligated into the pEBG mammalian expression vector in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. To generate N-Dbl (residues 1–498), spectrin-Dbl (residues 224–417), and PH-Dbl (residues 711–808), the appropriate sequences were amplified from proto-Dbl and ligated into pEBG or pKH3. Amino-terminal truncations were constructed by amplifying residues 71–925 (ΔN1-Dbl) or 349–925 (ΔN2-Dbl) from proto-Dbl and inserting them into pCMV6. Hsc70 cDNA (generous gift of D. McKay, Stanford University) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pCDNA3.1-Hygro(+) vector (Invitrogen) with a 5′-Myc or HA tag. Hsc70(K71M) was generated from wild-type Hsc70 cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by restriction mapping and sequencing.Antibodies—Anti-HA (HA11), anti-Myc (9E10), and GST antibodies were from Covance Inc. Anti-Dbl antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals, and anti-Hsc70 antibodies (SPA 815 and SPA 820) were from StressGen Biotechnologies.Identification of Hsc70 as a Proto-Dbl-binding Protein—Forty-eight hours post-transfection with pEBG-GST-T1-Dbl or pEBG-GST-DH-PH-Dbl, COS7 cells were lysed by rocking with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm activated sodium vanadate, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin. Cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione agarose (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, incubated with NIH 3T3 lysates (∼30 mg protein) at 4 °C for 1.5 h, and washed three times. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized with silver stain. A protein band at ∼70 kDa that is selectively associated with the GST-T1-Dbl (but not with DH-PH-Dbl) was excised and sent for micro-sequencing analysis by tandem mass spectrometry at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility.GTPase Activation Assays—To assess the level of activated (GTP-bound) Dbl substrates in cells, we utilized the “Rho binding assay” (10Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) as modified by Ren et al. (11Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells were transfected with RhoA (HA-tagged in the pKH3 vector) together with the indicated Hsc70 (Myc- or HA-tagged in pCDNA3.1 vector) and Dbl (in pCMV6 vector) constructs. Thirty-six hours post-transfection the cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin. Lysates were incubated with ∼20 μg of the purified, GST-fused CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain of rhotekin immobilized on glutathione agarose. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed and resolved on SDS-PAGE, and bound Rho protein was visualized by anti-HA immunoblotting.Immunoprecipitations from Tissue—Frozen mouse brains were obtained from Pel-Freeze Inc. Thawed brains (1.4 g) were homogenized in an Eppendorf tube with minimal volume (<1 ml) of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immobilized on either protein A/G-Sepharose (Pierce), washed three times with lysis buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting.Estimation of Complex Stoichiometry—COS7 cells were transfected with proto-Dbl cDNA (in pCMV vector), and lysates were prepared as described above. Anti-Dbl immunoprecipitates from three 100-mm plates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and the amount of endogenous Hsc70 that associated with proto-Dbl was determined after staining.RESULTSIdentification of Hsc70 as a Proto-Dbl-associated Protein— Our major goal in this study was to identify proteins that regulate the biological activity of proto-Dbl. Because the proto-oncogenic form of Dbl exhibits attenuated GEF activity (9Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and diminished transformation potential (12Ron D. Graziani G. Aaronson S.A. Eva A. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1067-1072PubMed Google Scholar) relative to the oncogenic form, we hypothesized the existence of regulatory proteins that preferentially bind to proto-Dbl. We utilized a differential affinity precipitation approach to identify such interactors. DH-PH-Dbl (residues 498–825) (8Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and T1-Dbl (residues 1–825, functionally equivalent to proto-Dbl) (9Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pEBG vector fused to GST. To obtain a sufficient amount of these proteins, the constructs were first transfected into COS7 cells, and the affinity “bait” was then captured on glutathione agarose. The immobilized Dbl constructs were then used to precipitate interacting proteins from lysates prepared from NIH3T3 fibroblasts (where the two constructs exhibit markedly different transforming activities). We consistently observed an ∼70-kDa protein band on SDS-PAGE that associated with T1-Dbl but only weakly associated with the oncogenic (DH-PH-Dbl) protein. Mass spectrometry analysis of this band revealed 20 tryptic peptide sequences, each of which perfectly matched the murine Hsc70 amino acid sequence (NCBI accession number NM_031165).Hsc70 is a member of the Hsp70 protein family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that bind proteins in their non-native state and assist in their proper folding (13Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar). Unlike the stress-induced (and highly homologous) Hsp70, Hsc70 is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in virtually all cell types. Hsc70 activity is regulated by an ATPase cycle that governs substrate binding, release, and conformational changes. In addition to its “conventional” role in assisting in the proper folding of nascent and misfolded peptides, Hsc70 has recently been implicated in multiple other cellular functions. Thus, Hsc70 appears to regulate the activity of a number of proteins, including transcription factors (14Pinhasi-Kimhi O. Michalovitz D. Ben-Zeev A. Oren M. Nature. 1986; 320: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 15Niyaz Y. Frenz I. Petersen G. Gehring U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and nuclear receptors (16Schneikert J. Hubner S. Langer G. Petri T. Jaattela M. Reed J. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Arbeitman M.N. Hogness D.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22597-22604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hsc70 binding can also direct a substrate to proteasomal degradation (19Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 20Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Finally, Hsc70 was demonstrated to function as a clathrin-uncoating ATPase, a key regulator of receptor-mediated endocytosis (21Honing S. Kreimer G. Robenek H. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hannan L.A. Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2217-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Chang H.C. Newmyer S.L. Hull M.J. Ebersold M. Schmid S.L. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Verification of the Preferential Association between Proto-Dbl and Hsc70—To verify the specificity and selectivity of the interaction between Dbl and Hsc70, we asked whether a stable complex can be isolated from cells that express both proteins. We transfected GST-proto-Dbl or GST-onco-Dbl into COS7 cells that express Hsc70 and asked whether the proteins co-precipitate. As can be seen in Fig. 1A (left lane), when proto-Dbl and Hsc70 are co-expressed in cells the chaperone is associated with precipitated proto-Dbl. The interaction is specific, as no Hsc70 is found in control (GST alone) precipitates. More importantly, Hsc70 selectively binds to the proto-oncogenic form of Dbl, because little or no Hsc70 associates with the oncogenic form of Dbl (Fig. 1A, center lane). In a reverse experiment, proto-Dbl was found to co-precipitate with ectopically expressed Hsc70 (Fig. 1B, middle lane), whereas onco-Dbl did not (Fig. 1B, left lane). To better characterize the interaction between Dbl and Hsc70, we evaluated relative amounts of the two proteins in complexes immunoprecipitated from transfected cells. We found that the complex contains the two proteins at a mole ratio of ∼1:1 (data not shown). This observation suggests that in this context Hsc70 functions as an “escort” protein and not as a catalytic component. The selectivity and specificity of this interaction suggest the possibility that Hsc70 may function as a cellular regulator of Dbl activity.Hsc70 and Proto-Dbl Associate in Vivo—Our next goal was to determine whether an Hsc70·Dbl complex exists in native tissue where the two proteins are expressed endogenously. Because expression of proto-Dbl is limited to tissues of neuroectodermal origin (4Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we used mouse brain as source material for these studies. As can be seen in Figs. 2, A and B (left lanes), both proto-Dbl and Hsc70 proteins are present in the soluble fraction of mouse brain. When the extract is immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-Hsc70 antibody, proto-Dbl can be found in the precipitate (Fig. 2A, center lane). Similarly, when an anti-Dbl antibody is used for immunoprecipitation, Hsc70 co-precipitates with Dbl (Fig. 2B, center lane). Thus, we conclude that the proto-oncogenic form of Dbl exists in a stable complex with the Hsc70 chaperone in native brain extracts. To test whether the Hsc70·Dbl interaction is direct, we tried to reconstitute the complex using purified components. We could not detect significant binding using in vitro translated Hsc70 and insect cell-expressed proto-Dbl, suggesting that interaction between Hsc70 and Dbl involves additional cellular components. It should be noted in this regard that most Hsc70·substrate complexes contain a number of additional proteins that regulate the chaperone function (e.g. see Refs. 17Arbeitman M.N. Hogness D.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C.

Also, truncation of the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70 is often required for its association with substrates in vitro (26Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Proto-Dbl and Hsc70 associate in vivo. Cytosolic fraction prepared from mouse brains was precipitated (IP) using anti-Hsc70 (Hsc70, panel A) or anti-Dbl (Dbl, panel B) antibodies. Precipitates were washed and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. In the control lanes no primary antibodies were used during the precipitation.

As Hsc70 preferentially associates with the proto-oncogenic form of Dbl and because the proto- and onco-versions of Dbl differ only by the amino terminus of proto-Dbl, we hypothesized that the primary Hsc70 binding site resides in residues 1–498. Indeed, the isolated amino terminus of proto-Dbl (N-Dbl, residues 1–498) associates tightly with Hsc70 (Fig. 4A). We also tested the ability of two amino-terminal truncations, ΔN1-Dbl (residues 71–925) and ΔN2-Dbl (residues 349–925), to associate with Hsc70. We found that whereas deletion of residues 1–70 did not affect the interaction, removal of residues 1–348 from proto-Dbl amino terminus abolished the association between Dbl and Hsc70 (Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that an important interaction domain between Dbl and Hsc70 resides between residues 71–348 of the proto-oncogene. Taking into account the primary structure of that region (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that the interaction is mediated by the spectrin homology domain of Dbl (residues 224–417). As shown in Fig. 4C, we find that the isolated spectrin domain exhibits robust association with Hsc70. We conclude that the aminoterminal spectrin domain of proto-Dbl serves as a major binding “handle” for the complex with Hsc70. Interestingly, a construct encoding the PH domain (residues 711–808; Fig. 3) also exhibited tight association with Hsc70 (Fig. 4C). This observation was surprising, because onco-Dbl (which contains the PH domain) displays only weak affinity to Hsc70 (Figs. 1 and 4). We do not know the basis for the different affinities of Hsc70 toward the PH domain when the latter is in isolation versus when it is in the context of onco-Dbl. It is possible that this difference arises from different intracellular localization of the protein, a property that is known to be greatly affected by the PH domain (8Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bi et al. demonstrated binding between an amino-terminal fragment (residues 286–482) and the PH domain of Dbl previously (9Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that this intramolecular association leads to masking of the catalytic (DH) domain, thus inhibiting the GEF activity of Dbl. The data presented here suggest that this interaction is indirect and is mediated by Hsc70.Fig. 4Spectrin and PH domains of proto-Dbl mediate association with Hsc70. A, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs in the pEBG vector. Endogenous Hsc70 was immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysates using an anti-Hsc70 antibody (αHsc70), and associated Dbl proteins were visualized by anti-GST immunoblotting. Asterisk denotes a nonspecific band. B, the indicated Dbl constructs were immunoprecipitated from transfected cells, and association with endogenous Hsc70 was assessed by anti-Hsc70 immunoblotting. C, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated Dbl constructs in the pEBG vector. GST-Dbl proteins were precipitated with glutathione-agarose, and associated endogenous Hsc70 was visualized with an anti-Hsc70 antibody.

To address this question, we made use of a known loss-of-function mutant of Hsc70 in which lysine 71 in the ATP binding pocket is substituted by a methionine (K71M). This mutation was shown to impair Hsc70 function by inhibiting its ability to hydrolyze ATP (26Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27O'Brien M.C. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15874-15878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Importantly, ectopic expression of the K71M construct in cultured cells was shown to interfere with endogenous Hsc70 function in a dominant negative fashion (28Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 29Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Newmyer S.L. Gregers T.F. Bakke O. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To test the impact of Hsc70 on Dbl function, we co-transfected proto-Dbl and Hsc70 (wild-type or K71M mutant) into COS7 cells and measured the GEF activity of Dbl in vivo (see “Experimental Procedures”). As can be seen in Fig. 5A, overexpression of wild-type Hsc70 leads to a marked reduction in cellular levels of GTP-bound RhoA, confirming that, in vivo, Hsc70 functions as a negative regulator of Dbl activity (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, overexpression of the dominant negative Hsc70(K71M) mutant leads to a significant increase in proto-Dbl activity (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 4). The lack of effect on RhoA·GTP levels in the absence of proto-Dbl expression (Fig. 5A, lanes 6 and 7) suggests that Hsc70 specifically impacts RhoA by attenuating proto-Dbl activity. To address the possibility that the chaperone modulates Rho·GTP levels through other mechanisms (i.e. by stimulating an endogenous GTPase-activating protein), we assessed the effect of Hsc70 overexpression on the GE"

This hormone has been purified from porcine parotid glands and partially sequenced in our previous study (Tieche, J. M., Leonora, J., and Steinman, R. R. (1980) Endocrinology 106, 1994–2005). We now report the cloning and functional study of porcine cDNAs that code for this hormone and its complete amino acid sequence. Three cDNA clones were isolated from a porcine parotid cDNA library. The last 30 amino acids encoded by two of the cDNAs agreed with the amino acid sequence of the isolated parotid hormone. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the acinar cells of the parotid glands were the primary location for both the parotid hormone-related mRNAs and the translation products. A 216-bp fragment of the cDNA that contains the coding sequence for the porcine hormone was subcloned into an expression vector, and the protein expression was detected by immunoblot analysis and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, the 30-amino acid parotid hormone was synthesized. Both the expressed and the synthetic proteins were biologically active in that they enhanced intradentinal fluid movement as measured by intradentinal dye penetration. A parotid gland hormone that stimulates intradentinal fluid movement is believed to play a significant role in maintaining the vitality of dentin. This hormone has been purified from porcine parotid glands and partially sequenced in our previous study (Tieche, J. M., Leonora, J., and Steinman, R. R. (1980) Endocrinology 106, 1994–2005).

In addition, the 30-amino acid parotid hormone was synthesized. Both the expressed and the synthetic proteins were biologically active in that they enhanced intradentinal fluid movement as measured by intradentinal dye penetration. A new insight into the fundamental basis of resistance to cariogenesis is provided by research in dentinal ultrastructure and internal dynamics. Odontoblastic cells at the pulpdentin junction have cytoplasmic extensions extending within canaliculi that stretch from the pulp-predentin area to the dentin-enamel junction. These canaliculi are filled with dentinal fluid (1Katchburian K. Holt S.J. Symons N.B.B. Dentin and Pulp: Their Structure and Reactions. Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, MD1968: 43-48Google Scholar, 2Weinstock M. Leblond C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 92-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Accordingly, dentin can be regarded as a barrier to bi-directional diffusive and convective fluid movement between the oral environment and the underlying pulp (3Pashley D.H. Proc. Finn. Dent. Soc. 1992; 88: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pashley D.H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: S73-S80Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The inward diffusive passage of bacterial cytotoxic products is opposed by a continuous outward flow of dentinal fluid that normally is maintained by an elevated hydrostatic pressure within the tooth. This movement may represent a physiological means by which the integrity of avascular dental tissues is maintained despite the potential for ingressive diffusion of exogenous substances (5Pashley D.H. Matthews W.G. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Matthews B. Vongsavan N. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: S87-S95Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Gerzina T.M. Hume W.R. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, natural resistance of teeth to decay may involve maintaining adequate endogenous centrifugal dentinal fluid movement (DFM). 1The abbreviations used are: DFM, dentinal fluid movement; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IDDP, intradentinal dye penetration; PH, parotid hormone; PH-Ab, polyclonal antibody against porcine PH; PRP, proline-rich protein. 1The abbreviations used are: DFM, dentinal fluid movement; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IDDP, intradentinal dye penetration; PH, parotid hormone; PH-Ab, polyclonal antibody against porcine PH; PRP, proline-rich protein. DFM can be visualized with an intradentinal dye penetration (IDDP) assay in which a fluorescent dye, acriflavine hydrochloride, is injected intraperitoneally into rats, and the magnitude of dye penetration into the dentinal tubules is evaluated in sectioned molar teeth.The significance of DFM in relation to dental health is suggested by caries studies done in rats that show an inverse relationship between the cariogenicity of a high sucrose diet and certain dietary supplements that stimulate DFM (8Steinman R.R. Leonora J. J. Dent. Res. 1975; 54: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The observation that the supplements are ineffective in stimulating DFM in parotidectomized animals (8Steinman R.R. Leonora J. J. Dent. Res. 1975; 54: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Steinman R.R. Leonora J. Singh R.J. J. Dent. Res. 1980; 59: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) implies that they exercise their cariostatic effect through mechanism(s) involving the parotid glands. A factor in parotid glands that stimulates DFM when infused into rats has been purified from porcine parotid tissue, and its partial amino acid sequence was determined (10Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Steinman R.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This factor, designated the parotid hormone (PH), is a moderately basic, small glycoprotein. Its amino acid composition and partial sequence indicate a molecule particularly rich in proline and glycine (10Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Steinman R.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Parotid glands secrete a number of salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs) that represent a unique family of molecules. More than 20 PRPs have been described in humans. They are classified as either acidic or basic on the basis of their charge, and some are modified by glycosylation or phosphorylation (11Kauffman D.L. Bennick A. Blum M. Keller P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3351-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Typically, these proteins contain 25–45% proline, 18–22% glutamine, and 18–22% glycine, with acidic PRPs containing 9–11% aspartate and basic PRPs containing 7–10% lysine plus arginine (12Clements S. Mehansho H. Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of human, rat, and mouse PRP genes exhibit a high degree of similarity (12Clements S. Mehansho H. Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ziemer M.A. Mason A. Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11176-11180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This high conservation of sequence and structure of PRP genes and PRPs argues for specific biological functions for these unusual proteins. For example, the proline residues in the PRPs appear to bind tannins that are potentially harmful compounds present in food (14Bennick A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2002; 13: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Other functions, such as calcium binding, hydroxyapatite binding, and formation of the dental acquired pellicle, have been attributed to acidic PRPs (15Hay D.I. Arch. Oral Biol. 1973; 18: 1517-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Bennick A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 45: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), whereas antiviral activity has been demonstrated with basic PRPs (17Gu M. Haraszthy G.G. Collins A.R. Bergey E.J. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 10: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Robinovitch M.R. Ashley R.L. Iversen J.M. Vigoren E.M. Oppenheim F.G. Lamkin M. Oral Dis. 2001; 7: 86-93PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there are reports of a decrease in PRPs, including basic PRPs, under several conditions (19Alvares O.F. Johnson D.A. J. Oral Pathol. 1981; 10: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 20Johnson D.A. Etzel K.R. Alvares O.F. Cortez J.E. J. Dent. Res. 1987; 66: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Johnson D.A. Kalu D.N. J. Dent. Res. 1988; 67: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), each of which is associated with increased caries susceptibility (22Fang M.M. Lei K.Y. Kilgore L.T. J. Nutr. 1980; 110: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Huumonen S. Larmas M. Acta Odontol. Scand. 1998; 56: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 24Schneider L.C. Pharmacol. Ther. Dent. 1975; 2: 43-46PubMed Google Scholar).A comparison with reported PRPs suggests that porcine PH is unique in its amino acid sequence and that its amino acid composition hints at a possible linkage with basic PRPs. To better understand the relationship between PH and PRPs and the functional aspects of PH, further characterization of porcine PH is needed. We now report the isolation and sequence of several full-length cDNAs related to porcine PH, the tissue distribution of the PH mRNA and proteins, and the expression of the PH-encoding cDNAs in transfected COS-7 cells. PH was also commercially synthesized. The functions of the expressed proteins and the synthetic protein were assessed with the IDDP assay, and the degree of stimulation was compared with that induced by feeding, a potent physiological stimulus for endogenous PH secretion (25Leonora J. Tieche J.M. Steinman R.R. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSTissue Collection—Three-month-old male pigs were sacrificed with an overdose of Nembutal. Tissue samples of salivary glands, pancreas, liver, small intestine, kidney, trachea, lung, skeletal muscle, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland were quickly dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Some tissues were directly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies. Rat salivary glands were removed from Sprague-Dawley rats under Nembutal anesthesia. The tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until processed.The experimental animal protocols were approved by the Loma Linda University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the animal treatments conformed at all times to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.Amino Acid Sequence Determination of Porcine PH—The partial amino acid sequence for porcine PH had been published earlier along with the isolation methodology (10Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Steinman R.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); we now determined the complete sequence of PH.PH was purified from porcine parotid tissue by following essentially the published methodology (10Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Steinman R.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with the exception that the final purification step (preparative electrophoresis) was replaced with preparative high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18 column (The Separation Group, Hesperia, CA). The 250 × 10-mm column was equilibrated with 0.08% redistilled trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (solution A). Two hundred μg in 40 μl of the G-50-active fraction (10Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Steinman R.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were injected and developed in the column at a flow rate of 5 ml/min using a gradient of acetonitrile (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile; solution B) into solution A (3% increase of solution B per minute for the first 5 min and then 0.5% increase of solution B per minute for the next 5 min). The column eluate was monitored at 214 nm. PH was eluted at 8.8 min. Elution of PH was confirmed and calibrated using the original PH preparation, PH-Aβ (10Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Steinman R.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Ten μg of PH were added to a Polybrene-loaded glass fiber membrane and sequenced with a model 470A Applied Biosystems sequencer using a standard single-coupling, single-cleavage program. The phenyl-thiohydantoin (PTH) amino acids were identified by automated high performance liquid chromatography using a model 120A Applied Biosystems PTH amino acid analyzer. A second determination was carried out to confirm the sequence.Construction and Screening of the cDNA Library—The porcine parotid cDNA library was constructed using the SuperScript plasmid system (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Because feeding and isoproterenol treatment increase porcine PH release (26Leonora J. Tieche J.M. Celestin J. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: E477-E484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2J.-M. Tieche, Q. Zhang, and J. Leonora, unpublished data. parotid samples were collected from two young male pigs, one stimulated by feeding and the other treated with daily injections of isoproterenol (0.6 mg/kg) for 4 days. Total RNA was isolated with RNAzol B solution (Tel-Test, Inc.), and the poly(A)+ messenger RNA was purified from total RNA with the Oligotex spin column (Qiagen). About 3 μg of mRNA were used to construct the cDNA library. The library was probed with a 20-base oligonucleotide, PHiA (5′-GCICCICCIGGIGCIMGICC-3′), corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the isolated porcine PH. Deoxyinosine was incorporated into positions where the degeneracy was >2.DNA Sequencing of Positive cDNA Clones—The cDNA inserts of positive clones were sequenced from both directions, and the partial sequences were analyzed for the location of the site complementary to PHiA. Three full-length cDNAs, D2A, TP23, and SL44-1, were taken through the process of progressive unidirectional deletions with the Erase-a-Base System (Promega) to obtain a series of overlapping clones (each overlap was at least 50–100 nucleotides long). The representative clones containing appropriate truncations were sequenced, and the sequences were compiled to obtain the complete sequence of the original clone.In Situ Hybridization—The various porcine tissue samples, harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. Adjacent sections were obtained for in situ hybridization, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry.The in situ hybridization procedures of Albrecht et al. (27Albrecht U. Eichele G. Helms J.A. Lu H.C. Daston G.P. Molecular and Cellular Methods in Developmental Toxicology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996Google Scholar) were used with few modifications. Adjacent tissue sections were hybridized with either the antisense probe or the sense probe, the latter serving as a negative control. A plasmid containing a partial sequence of TP23, ∼300 bp in size, was used to generate the sense and antisense single-strand RNA probes. The slides were hybridized at 60 °C with the riboprobe (2 × 106 cpm/ml), and the post-hybridization wash was carried out at 65 °C. The images of in situ hybridization specimens were captured with a video camera linked to a computer. The image revealed by blue Hoechst (a nuclear dye) fluorescence was digitally superimposed with a darkfield image. The silver grains were pseudo-colored to yellow to enhance the contrast using the Adobe Photoshop program.Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical studies for the presence of PH were performed by indirect immunoperoxidase staining on 5-μm paraformaldehyde-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Adjacent sections were reacted with the polyclonal antibody made against the isolated porcine PH (PH-Ab) (28Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Berk L.S. Steinman R.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), with normal rabbit serum serving as the control. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections at room temperature for 15 min in 2 n HCl. A Dako LSAB+ kit was used for immunoreactions. Peroxidase blocking reagent was first applied to the sections for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxide activity. Tissue sections were then taken through the incubation steps of blocking in 5% nonfat milk for 10 min, PH-Ab (1:50) for 1 h at 35 °C, biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at 35 °C, and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min. For color development, 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) chromogen plus the H2O2 substrate (BioGenex Super Sensitive detection kit) was applied to the tissue sections. Hematoxylin was used for histological counterstaining.Southern Blot Analysis of Genomic DNAs—Genomic DNAs were extracted from porcine and rat parotid tissues, and human genomic DNA was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Porcine genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested in separate reactions with the restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, SacI, and XbaI. Human and rat genomic DNAs were digested with EcoRI. The restriction products were separated through a 0.7% agarose gel and transferred to a Duralose-UV membrane (Stratagene). The membrane was hybridized at 68 °C in the QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) with a 300-bp, [α-32P]dCTP random-primed cDNA fragment of TP23. The post-hybridization wash was carried out first in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min each at room temperature. For a high stringency wash, the membrane was washed once for 60 min at 60 °C, with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed using Kodak Biomax MR film.PCR Cloning of the cDNA for Porcine PH—A deletion clone of TP23 was used as the PCR template, which was obtained earlier during the process of generating progressive unidirectional deletions with the Erase-a-Base system. This truncated clone (DT11-18) contains the coding capacity of the last 72 amino acids from clone TP23 and includes the 30 amino acids of PH and two of the repeats upstream. The 5′-forward primer PHC-5 was designed to correspond to the cDNA sequence of DT11-18 encoding the first five amino acids of the first 21-amino acid repeat (APPGA) and a 5′ addition of an NdeI site (5′-CATATGGCCCCACCTGGTGC-3′). The 3′-primer was the M13 reverse sequencing primer complementary to the sequence present in the cloning vector pSPORT 1. The PCR products were purified and ligated with the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) and introduced into DH5α cells. The presence of the PH cDNA insert in plasmid pCR-D15 was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Coupled in Vitro Transcription/Translation of the PH-encoding cDNAs— The cDNA insert of TP23 was subcloned into the vector pET-28a(+) (Novagen), which features an N-terminal His tag sequence downstream from a T7 promoter. The fusion was confirmed to be in-frame with the His tag by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pET-28a(+)-TP23 was then subjected to the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), and the biotinylated lysine-tRNA complex was included in the translation procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions. The translation products were analyzed using electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotting. The biotinylated proteins were visualized using the Transcend colorimetric detection system (Promega).The cDNA insert of pCR-D15 was released by digestion with NdeI and NotI and subcloned into the corresponding sites in vector pET-28a(+). The fusion construct pET-28a(+)-D15 was in-frame as confirmed by DNA sequencing, which was then subjected to the TnT system. The translated products were separated in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a NitroBind nitrocellulose membrane. The detection was performed using a 1:5000 PH-Ab, a 1:3000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Promega), and an Immun-Star substrate with enhancer (Bio-Rad) as the detection reagents. The membrane was exposed to an x-ray film for 30 s to 1 min followed by processing the exposed film through a Kodak M35A processor.Expression of the PH-encoding cDNAs in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were cultured under 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cDNA insert of TP23 was subcloned into vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmid, pCEP4-TP23, was introduced into COS-7 cells by lipofection using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were harvested after 24, 48, and 72 h. Both the culture medium and the cell lysate were collected for analysis. About 10 μg of the total proteins (quantified with Bio-Rad Bradford protein determination reaction) obtained at each collection time were separated in a NuPAGE 4–12% gradient gel (Novagen) and transferred to a NitroBind nitrocellulose membrane. Immunostaining was performed using a 1:5000 PH-Ab, a 1:3000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody, and an Opti-4CN substrate (Bio-Rad) as detection reagents. The membrane was photographed after the color developed to the desired intensity.The His tag-fused PH cDNA from pET-28a(+)-D15 was subcloned into pCEP4, and the resulting plasmid DNA, pCEP4-His-D15, was then subjected to expression in COS-7 cells. Ten μl of either cell lysate (∼1% of total lysate) or culture medium (equivalent to 0.1% of total medium) sample taken at each time point was separated in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a NitroBind nitrocellulose membrane. Detection of the expressed proteins was performed by Western blot analysis using an Immun-Star substrate with enhancer as described above.Quantifying Porcine PH Expression in the Cell Lysate with ELISA— A direct competitive ELISA was developed with a polyclonal antibody, PH-Ab, which had been characterized previously (28Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Berk L.S. Steinman R.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and used routinely in the PH radioimmunoassay (26Leonora J. Tieche J.M. Celestin J. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: E477-E484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1995; 40: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Porcine PH that was used for amino acid sequence determination served as immobilized tracer and standard. Immulon 4 HBX flat bottom microtiter plates (Dynex Technologies) were coated with 1.3 ng of PH per 50 μl. The primary rabbit PH-Ab was used at a dilution of 1:30,000. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad), 1:2,000 dilution, was the secondary antibody. Color development was accomplished with the enzyme substrate o-phenylenediamine (product P-9187; Sigma), and the optical density of each well was read at 450 nm.Nonspecific values were subtracted from all readings. Displacement curves were obtained by plotting the logit-transformed ratio B/B0 (sample binding value/maximum binding) versus the log of the PH standard doses. A least squares regression of the log-logit data was performed, and the resulting equation of the standard curve was used to calculate the titers of the cell lysate samples.Functional Determination of the Expressed and Synthetic PH with an IDDP Assay in Rats—The intradentinal dye penetration assay was used to determine the presence of porcine PH in the cell extracts and its function in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 21 days old, were obtained from Harlan (San Diego, CA), and fed for 1 week on pelleted Purina rat chow. The rats were kept in wire bottom cages to prevent coprophagy and ingestion of wood chips, particularly during fasting. The rats were divided into four groups with at least six animals in each group as follows: group 1, fasting only (negative control); group 2, fed only (positive control); group 3, fasting plus intravenous infusion with the cell lysate obtained from pCEP4 transfected COS-7 cells; and group 4, fasting plus intravenous infusion of the cell lysate obtained from pCEP4-His-D15-transfected COS-7 cells. All of the experiments were conducted on the rats' 28th day after 1 week of adaptation to their environment. Pentobarbital sodium (4 mg per 100 g of body weight) was administered intraperitoneally to anesthetize the animals.After fasting, the rats in group 1 were anesthetized and injected intraperitoneally with the fluorescent dye acriflavine hydrochloride dissolved in saline (5 mg per ml per 100 g of body weight). Thirty minutes after dye injection the rats were decapitated, and their upper and lower jaws were quickly removed and frozen on dry ice. The frozen jaws from each animal were wrapped, coded, and kept at –80 °C until sectioned. The rats in group 2 were fed pellets of Purina rat chow for exactly 15 min before the above procedure. The rats in groups 3 and 4 were infused with 10 μl of cell lysate in 0.1 ml of saline administered as a bolus infusion into the left subclavian-external jugular vein junction after dye injection. Their jaws were collected 30 min later.In a separate study, the activity of synthetic PH was also assessed. The 30-amino acid peptide of PH was commercially synthesized by Biopeptide Co. LLC. (San Diego, CA). The synthetic PH was purified by high performance liquid chromatography using the Phenomenex Proteo C18 column with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O as solvent A and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as solvent B. The gradient was 15–45% solvent B in 30 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. It was found that the retention time for the synthetic PH peaked at 10.82 min, and the molecular weight by electrospray mass spectrometry analysis was 2,858.The synthetic PH was tested at the dose of 0.5 ng, because this dose falls in the upper range of the dose-response curve tested in the original PH isolation study (10Tieche J.M. Leonora J. Steinman R.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed similarly as described above, and after fasting overnight the rats in group 5 were anesthetized and injected with acriflavine and infused with 0.1 ml of saline as described previously, whereas the rats in group 6 were infused with 0.5 ng of synthetic PH dissolved in 0.1 ml of saline. Thirty minutes after the infusion, the rats were killed and their jaws were collected.Dye penetration within dentinal tubules was measured by fluorescence microscopy in thin slices of the molar teeth following the procedure described by Leonora et al. (30Leonora J. Tieche J.M. Steinman R.R. Arch. Oral Biol. 1992; 37: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The positive response was defined as the presence of fluorescent dye in the dentinal tubules within a strictly defined area beneath the bottom of the occlusal groove. Each occlusal groove area was photographed using a digital camera, and evaluation of dye penetration into dentinal tubules was calculated from these pictures. Scoring was done without knowledge of treatment.Data Analysis—The intradentinal dye penetration score was calculated as an IDDP ratio expressing the number of occlusal grooves under which fluorescence was observed divided by the total number of occlusal grooves examined for a given animal. Results were presented as the means ± S.E. of the IDDP ratios. Statistical comparisons among several treatment groups were made by analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple comparisons were performed with Bonferroni test when the ANOVA showed an overall significance. Values of p less than 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSThe complete amino acid sequence for parotid hormone isolated and purified from porcine parotid glands was found to be 30 amino acids in length and consisted of NH2-Ala-Pro-Pro-Gly-Ala-Arg-Pro-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ser-Pro-Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro-Gln-COOH.To identify the cDNA sequence encoding PH, a porcine parotid cDNA library was constructed and screened with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe PHiA, which corresponded to the N-terminal sequence of the isolated porcine PH. Twenty positive clones were randomly selected with the insert size ranging from 400 to 2,300 bp. Three of the full-length cDNA clones, TP23, SL44-1, and D2A, were chosen for complete sequence analysis.The nucleotide sequences of D2A and TP23 contained open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 511 (48.5 kDa) and 566 amino acids (53.2 kDa), respectively. The complete nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences for these two cDNAs are presented in Fig. 1, A and B. The sequence of the D2A cDNA was identical to that of the TP23 cDNA, with the exception that D2A cDNA had a 243-bp “deletion” in the 3′-region of the sequence.Fig. 1Alignment of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of D2A, TP23, and SL44-1 cDNAs. The alignments were generated using the ClustalW program. A, the nucleotide sequences are numbered beginning with the first nucleotide of each cDNA, and the nucleotide position numbers are given to the left of the sequences. The putative coding sequences are in capital letters, and the start and stop"
https://openalex.org/W1590553823,"The ability to identify genetic signs of diseases is advancing faster than the ability to treat those diseases. For Mayana Zatz, a professor of genetics at SA£o Paulo University in Brazil, this mismatch is a compelling call to conduct basic laboratory research into such diseases and to do what she can to improve the lives of those afflicted by them. In the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other types of muscular dystrophy, Zatz has helped uncover the biomolecular bases of some of these diseases, counseled thousands of affected individuals and families about how to manage their condition, and established an association and clinic to help improve the lives of her country9s poorest victims of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Zatz chronicles the research, ethical conundrums, and legal challenges that she confronts in her molecules-to-society attack on Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular disorders.
