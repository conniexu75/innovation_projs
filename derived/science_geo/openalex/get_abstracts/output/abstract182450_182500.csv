https://openalex.org/W2139959086,"The ubiquitous NF-κB transcription factor has been reported to inhibit apoptosis and to induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Drug resistance is the major reason for cancer therapy failure and neoplastic cells often develop multiple mechanisms of drug resistance during tumor progression. We observed that NF-κB or P-glycoprotein inhibition in the HCT15 colon cancer cells led to increased apoptotic cell death in response to daunomycin treatment. Interestingly, NF-κB inhibition through transfection of a plasmid coding for a mutated IκB-α inhibitor increased daunomycin cell uptake. Indeed, the inhibition of NF-κB reduced mdr1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein expression in HCT15 cells. We identified a consensus NF-κB binding site in the first intron of the human mdr1 gene and demonstrated that NF-κB complexes could bind with this intronic site. Moreover, NF-κB transactivates an mdr1 promoter luciferase construct. Our data thus demonstrate a role for NF-κB in the regulation of the mdr1 gene expression in cancer cells and in drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2058553011,"Ectopic expression of telomerase in telomerase-silent cells is sufficient to overcome senescence and to extend cellular lifespan. We show here that the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) crosslinks telomeres. This interaction is blocked by the telomere repeat binding factor 1, but not by a dominant negative form of this protein. It is also abolished by destruction of the RNA component of telomerase as well as by mutations in the hTERT protein. Ectopic expression of hTERT leads to transcriptional alterations of a subset of genes and changes in the interaction of the telomeres with the nuclear matrix. This is associated with reduction of spontaneous chromosome damage in G(1) cells, enhancement of the kinetics of DNA repair and an increase in NTP levels. The effect on DNA repair is likely indirect as TERT does not directly affect DNA end rejoining in vitro or meiotic recombination in vivo. The observed effects of hTERT occurred rapidly before any significant lengthening of telomeres was observed. Our findings establish an intimate relationship between hTERT-telomere interactions and alteration in transcription of a subset of genes that may lead to increased genomic stability and enhanced repair of genetic damage. These novel functions of telomerase are distinct from its known effect on telomere length and have potentially important biological consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2096441034,"The myc proto-oncogenes encode transcriptional regulators whose inappropriate expression is correlated with a wide array of human malignancies. Up-regulation of Myc enforces growth, antagonizes cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation, and in some situations promotes apoptosis. How these phenotypes are elicited is not well understood, largely because we lack a clear picture of the biologically relevant downstream effectors. We created a new biological system for the optimal profiling of Myc target genes based on a set of isogenic c-myc knockout and conditional cell lines. The ability to modulate Myc activity from essentially null to supraphysiological resulted in a significantly increased and reproducible yield of targets and revealed a large subset of genes that respond optimally to Myc in its physiological range of expression. The total extent of transcriptional changes that can be triggered by Myc is remarkable and involves thousands of genes. Although the majority of these effects are not direct, many of the indirect targets are likely to have important roles in mediating the elicited cellular phenotypes. Myc-activated functions are indicative of a physiological state geared toward the rapid utilization of carbon sources, the biosynthesis of precursors for macromolecular synthesis, and the accumulation of cellular mass. In contrast, the majority of Myc-repressed genes are involved in the interaction and communication of cells with their external environment, and several are known to possess antiproliferative or antimetastatic properties.

Ho C.S. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 81-154Google Scholar, 2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar). Transactivation is mediated by binding as an obligate heterodimer with the b/HLH/Zip factor Max to the consensus sequence CA(C/T)GTG (the E box) (3Luscher B. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2955-2966Google Scholar). Transrepression is less well understood (4Claassen G. Hann S.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2925-2933Google Scholar, 5Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunsky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Google Scholar). In either mode Myc is a weak transcriptional regulator, exerting most of its effects within the 2–5-fold range. In a general sense, the up-regulation of Myc strongly enforces proliferation and growth, antagonizes cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation, and in some situations promotes apoptosis (6Obaya A.J. Mateyak M.K. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2934-2941Google Scholar, 7Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2967-2987Google Scholar, 8Schmidt E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2988-2996Google Scholar). In agreement, the down-regulation of Myc results in the attenuation of both cell division and cell growth as well as protection against some apoptotic processes (9Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048Google Scholar, 10Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Google Scholar, 11Johnston L.A. Prober D.A.

Despite extensive research, the specific mechanisms by which these highly evident biological end points are achieved are not well understood. This is largely because a comprehensive list of biologically relevant Myc target genes has not yet been defined. A wide variety of techniques have been employed in the hunt for Myc targets, ranging from differential expression screens, promoter analysis, and informed guesswork (14Cole M.D. McMahon S.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2916-2924Google Scholar, 15Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Google Scholar, 16Greasley P.J. Bonnard C. Amati B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 446-453Google Scholar) to the modern methods of microarray profiling, serial analysis of gene expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (17Coller H.A. Grandori C.

First, the weak transcriptional effects of Myc present significant experimental challenges. Second, by all recent indications the total set of Myc targets may be very large. Third, not all E boxes are bound by Myc, and transient transfection studies do not adequately reflect regulation in a chromosomal context. Fourth, comparing tumor cells expressing amplified Myc with nonderegulated counterparts is complicated by the nonisogenic nature of the cells. A widely used approach has been to compare cell lines engineered to overexpress ectopic Myc with parental cells (17Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P. Colbert T. Lander E.S. Eisenman R.N. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3260-3265Google Scholar, 19Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Choi H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Google Scholar, 21Schuhmacher M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6274-6279Google Scholar). However, it is questionable to what extent this approach can detect genes that respond optimally to physiological changes in Myc expression. In an attempt to circumvent the latter problem, some time ago we generated c-myc null cells that were derived by gene targeting from an immortalized but otherwise nontransformed rat fibroblast cell line (9Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048Google Scholar). To date, the c-myc−/− cells have been used in two limited profiling experiments that examined the expression of 4,400 rat (18Guo Q.M. Malek R.L. Kim S. Chiao C. He M. Ruffy M. Sanka K. Lee N.H. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5922-5928Google Scholar) and 6,355 mouse (24Watson J.D. Oster S.K. Shago M. Khosravi F. Penn L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36921-36930Google Scholar) cDNAs and expressed sequence tags in spotted glass slide microarray formats. To create a new biological system for the optimal profiling of Myc target genes, we have reconstituted c-myc−/− cells with the conditionally active, tamoxifen-specific c-Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein (MycER)1 (25Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Google Scholar). These new cell lines allow the modulation of Myc activity from essentially null to supraphysiological. To achieve maximum consistency in expression profiling we sought a simple experimental regimen in which the only changing parameter was the expression of c-Myc and in which a change in c-Myc status elicited and clear and significant change in phenotype. We chose to use randomly cycling, exponential phase cultures, and we developed conditions such that cells experienced a constant environment and were in a balanced, steady state of growth for significant periods of time. Under these conditions c-myc null cells displayed a pronounced phenotype, a 2–3-fold reduction in macromolecular synthesis accompanied by a commensurate slowing of the cell cycle (9Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048Google Scholar). Most importantly, we showed that under these conditions both c-myc+/+ and c-myc−/−cultures cycled uniformly, namely, that there were no cohorts of differentially cycling or noncycling cells within a given culture (26Obaya A.J. Kotenko I. Cole M.D. Sedivy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31263-31269Google Scholar). Expression profiling using a total of 81 Affymetrix GeneChip arrays was performed in three experiments (Fig. 1). First, we compared c-myc+/+ (TGR), c-myc−/− (HO), and c-myc−/− cells reconstituted with a constitutive c-myc transgene (HOmyc3). This revealed the total number of genes that respond to a sustained loss of c-Myc under exponential growth conditions. Second, c-myc−/− cells reconstituted with the conditional c-mycER transgene (HOmycER) were stimulated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), and data were collected during a 16-h time course. This revealed the kinetics of the responses to Myc activation. Finally, the time course of induction with OHT was performed in the presence of cycloheximide, revealing a subset of direct transcriptional targets of c-Myc. All experiments, including the growth of cells and preparation of RNA, were performed on three separate occasions (independent biological replicates), and all data were subjected to a statistical analysis of significance. TGR-1 is a hprt– subclone of the Rat-1 cell line (27Prouty S.M. Hanson K.D. Boyle A.L. Brown J.R. Shichiri M. Follansbee M.R. Kang W. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 899-907Google Scholar). HO15.19 (referred to as HO) is a homozygous c-myc null derivative of TGR-1 generated by gene targeting (9Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048Google Scholar). HOmyc3 was derived from HO15.19 by constitutively expressing murine c-myccDNA using a retroviral vector (10Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Google Scholar). HOmyc3 cells express c-Myc protein at three to four times the level seen in TGR cells. HOMycER12 and HOMycER104 were derived in the same fashion to express MycER (25Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Google Scholar). MycER is a hybrid protein consisting of the entire c-Myc polypeptide at its N terminus and the ligand (estrogen) binding domain of the human estrogen receptor at the C terminus. In the MycER construct used here the estrogen binding domain has been mutated to be specific for the agonist OHT. Retroviral vectors were packaged in BOSC cells (28Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Google Scholar), and supernatants were used to infect HO15.19 cells. Colonies were selected with 120 ॖg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem), ring cloned, and expanded into clonal cell lines. The mRNA encoding the MycER protein is thus expressed constitutively from the viral long terminal repeat promoter, and the activity of this promoter is not affected by OHT. OHT is instead believed to elicit a conformational change in MycER which allows the protein to become biologically active. All cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 calf serum (Hyclone) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 57 CO2, except BOSC cells, which were supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Great care was taken that cultures were cycling asynchronously and were in rapid and exponential phase of growth (26Obaya A.J. Kotenko I. Cole M.D. Sedivy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31263-31269Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were always split at subconfluent densities (<507) and at relatively low dilution (1:10 for c-myc+/+ and 1:4 for c-myc−/− cells). Cultures can thus be maintained continuously at densities of 10–507 confluence (to avoid any contact inhibition), and the relatively frequent passaging (every 3–4 days) and medium changes maintain a rapid growth rate. This regimen was followed for a minimum of two passages before cells were harvested for other experiments. MycER was activated with 200 nm OHT (Sigma). Dose-response studies showed that 200 nm OHT is saturating for the activation of MycER. OHT was dissolved in absolute ethanol at 1 mm and stored at −80 °C. Mock-treated cultures received vehicle (ethanol) at a final concentration of 0.027. Protein synthesis was inhibited with 20 ॖg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) which was added 30 min before the addition of OHT. BrdUrd labeling and flow cytometry were performed as described previously (9Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048Google Scholar), except that the Vectastain Elite ABC™ and Novared™ kits (Vector Laboratories) were used for histochemical staining. The c-myc, full-length MycER (25Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Google Scholar), and a deletion mutant of MycER missing amino acids 106–143 (29Marhin W.W. Chen S. Facchini L.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Penn L.Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2825-2834Google Scholar) cDNAs were cloned into the HpaI site of the pLXSH retroviral vector (30Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 581-599Google Scholar) using standard procedures (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Total RNA for Northern hybridization and microarray analysis was isolated using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA for quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was isolated using the RNaqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion). Northern hybridization was performed using the formaldehyde gel method, and 32P-labeled probes were synthesized using the random oligonucleotide labeling method from gel-purified restriction or PCR fragment templates as described previously (32Wei W. Hemmer R.M. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6748-6757Google Scholar). qPCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7700 Sequence Detector and software. Primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) for amplification of 100-bp fragments. cDNA was generated using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit and amplified using the SYBR green PCR and reverse transcription PCR kits (Applied Biosystems). Amplification efficiencies were determined by serial dilution of template cDNA for each gene. All samples were run in triplicate. Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the internal standard. GAPDH was used because microarray profiling showed that the signals for six distinct GAPDH probe sets were equivalent between TGR, HO, and HOmyc3 cell lines under our exponential phase culture conditions. Protein samples were prepared by lysing whole cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (10Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Google Scholar, 34Hanson K.D. Shichiri M. Follansbee M.R. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5748-5755Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: c-Myc (Upstate Biotechnology, cat. 06-340), neomycin phosphotransferase II, (5 Prime – 3 Prime, Inc., cat. 7-511721), and actin (Sigma, cat. A5316). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch. Signals were visualized using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Target cRNA was prepared and hybridized (45 °C, 16 h) to GeneChip rat U34 arrays according to the manufacturer's directions (Affymetrix). Hybridized arrays were washed and stained using the GeneChip fluidics station 400 and scanned using the Agilent GeneArray scanner. Signals were analyzed using Microarray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Data were normalized using a set target intensity of 1,500, published to a data base using MicroDB 3.0, and analyzed in Data Mining Tool 3.0 software (Affymetrix). Analysis of each cell line and/or condition was based on three biological replicates (RNAs prepared from independent experiments performed at different times). The replicates were used to calculate the means and standard deviations for the expression values of all probe sets for each cell line and/or condition. Probe sets were considered present if they received a present call in two of the three biological replicates. Pairwise comparisons between cell lines and/or conditions were made using Student's t test (p < 0.05). Myc-influenced expression patterns were assigned to four categories: 1) activated by Myc; 2) repressed by Myc; 3) activated by overexpression of Myc; and 4) repressed by overexpression of Myc (for examples, see Fig. 4). Probe sets were categorized based on the following criteria. The ratio of the average signal intensity between HOmyc3 and HO and/or between TGR and HO was ≥2.0. The ratio of the average signal intensity between HOmyc3 and HO and/or between TGR and HO was ≤0.50. HO/Myc3 average intensity values were significantly greater than those of TGR and those of HO (p < 0.05), TGR and HO average intensity values were not statistically different (p < 0.05), and the ratio of average intensity values between TGR and HO was less than 1.4. 14 probe sets were moved from category 1 to category 3 based on visual inspection (in these cases, the ratio of the average intensity values between HO and HOmyc3 was greater than or equal to twice the ratio of average intensity values between HO and TGR. The HOMyc3 average intensity values were significantly less than those of TGR and those of HO (p < 0.05), TGR and HO average intensity values were not statistically different (p < 0.05), and the ratio of average intensity values between TGR and HO was greater than 0.7. Nine probe sets were moved from category 2 to category 4 based on visual inspection (in these cases, the ratio of average intensity values between HO and HOmyc3 was less than or equal to half the ratio of average intensity values between HO and TGR). Probe sets were considered responsive to OHT if, at any given time point, they displayed statistically significant (p< 0.05) differences between OHT and vehicle-treated replicates, and the fold change between the means was ≥1.5. Of the 535 probe sets on the U34A chip which were identified in the initial comparison of TGR, HO and HOmyc3 cell lines (experiment 1), 142 probe sets were OHT-responsive by the above criteria. An additional 460 probe sets satisfied the OHT inducibility test (experiment 2, Fig. 1) but failed the 2-fold induction limit set in the comparison of TGR, HO, and HOmyc3 cells (experiment 1). 76 probe sets were recovered from this list and designated as c-Myc targets if the inducibility in the TGR, HO, and HOmyc3 comparison (experiment 1) was ≥1.5. The resultant 218 (142 + 76) MycER-responsive probe sets out of the total 611 (535 + 76) probe sets represent 180 nonredundant genes. 75 of the 180 genes (417) identified in HO/mycER12 cells satisfied the same statistical criteria in HOmycER104 cells. Of the remaining 105 genes, 49 (277) were already deregulated by the high basal Myc activity in HOmycER104 cells, 36 (207) behaved qualitatively similarly in HOmycER104 cells but failed the t test, and 20 (117) failed the fold change test or behaved anomalously. Because the MycER protein is capable of eliciting low Myc activity even in the absence of OHT, we also asked whether this 舠leakiness舡 could mask potential responses to Myc activation if, for example, probe sets were already maximally induced/repressed before the addition of OHT. Probe sets were considered leaky if the average intensity values in HOmycER12 cells were statistically different (p < 0.05) and greater (for Myc-activated genes) or smaller (for Myc-repressed genes) than the average intensity values in HO cells. Probe sets that were leaky, nonresponsive to OHT, unable to respond to elevated levels of Myc (nonresponsive to OHT in HOmycER104 cells and/or not overexpressed in HOmyc3 versus TGR cells), and expressed above a threshold intensity value of 500 in TGR cells comprised less than 107 of the probe sets identified in experiment 2. Probe sets were considered to be direct Myc targets if differences in expression between samples treated with cycloheximide plus OHT and those treated with cycloheximide alone at any time point were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and had a magnitude of ≥1.5. Probe sets were classified as indirect targets of Myc if differences in expression between samples treated with cycloheximide alone were not statistically different (p< 0.05) from the untreated control and if differences in expression at any time point between samples treated with cycloheximide plus OHT and cycloheximide alone were not statistically significant (p < 0.05). To assess the effect of OHT alone on RNA expression (in the absence of the MycER transgene) TGR and HO cells were treated with OHT for 16 h (or vehicle for the same time period), and RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis. 288 of the total 8,799 probe sets on the U94A chip were affected by OHT by a factor of ≥2 in either TGR or HO cells. 2 of the OHT-affected probe sets are on the list of 180 genes reported in Table I. However, these probe sets were affected by OHT only in HO cells and not in TGR cells. The genes affected by OHT alone in HO cells are α-mannosidase II (M24353) and cytosolic Na/K-transporting ATPase, B subunit (AA859920). The expression of these genes was clearly affected in a comparison of TGR, HO, and HOmyc3 cells in the absence of OHT; however, because part of their response in HOmycER cells may be the result the effect of OHT alone, further examination may reveal them to be indirect Myc targets.Table IGenes responsive to Myc expression AccessionEncoded gene productFunctionE/M/L1-aKinetics of response to MycER activation: early (E), middle (M), or late (L) if the change in expression was first evident at 2–4 h, 8 h, or 16 h after the addition of OHT, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2006208922,"We demonstrate, for the first time, that the transcription factor NF-kappaB is constitutively activated during human cervical cancer progression. Immunohistochemical analysis was done using 106 paraffin-embedded cervical tissue specimens of different histological grades. In normal cervical tissue and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, p50, RelA and IkappaB-alpha were mainly localized in the cytosol, whereas in high-grade lesions and squamous cell carcinomas, p50-RelA heterodimers translocated into the nucleus with a concurrent decrease in IkappaB-alpha protein. By Western blot analysis, p50 and RelA were detectable mainly in the cytosolic and nuclear extracts in normal and cancer tissues, respectively, and cytosolic IkappaB-alpha expression was detectable in normal but not in cancer cervical tissues. NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity increased during cervical cancer progression and the binding complex was mainly composed of the p50-RelA heterodimers as revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, however, showed increased levels of IkappaB-alpha mRNA in cancer samples presumably because of feedback regulation as a result of enhanced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and a consequent functional activation of NF-kappaB. Further immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody to phospho IkappaB-alpha revealed that phosphorylation occurs mainly in squamous intraepithelial lesions, suggesting that the IkappaB-alpha gets phosphorylated initially and degraded as the tumor progressed."
https://openalex.org/W2056650214,"NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) has been proposed to stabilize p53 via a redox mechanism involving oxidation of NAD(P)H as a consequence of the catalytic activity of NQO1. We report that treatment of HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells with the NQO1 inhibitor ES936 had no effect on the levels of p53 protein. ES936 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of NQO1 that irreversibly blocks the catalytic function of the enzyme. This suggests that a redox mechanism involving NQO1-mediated NAD(P)H oxidation is not responsible for the stabilization of p53. We also examined the ability of the NQO1 protein to associate with p53 using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Results from these experiments demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of NQO1 with p53 and vice versa. The association between p53 and NQO1 was not affected by treatment of HCT-116 cells with ES936, demonstrating that the association was not dependent on the catalytic activity of NQO1. A comparison of isogenic HCT-116 p53+/+ and HCT-116 p53−/− cells demonstrated an interaction of NQO1 and p53 only in the p53+/+ cells. Experiments performed in an in vitrotranscription/translation system utilizing rabbit reticulocyte lysates confirmed the interaction of NQO1 and p53. In these experiments a full-length p53 coding region was used to express p53 in the presence of recombinant NQO1 protein. An association of p53 and NQO1 was also observed in primary human keratinocytes and mammary epithelial cells. In studies where mdm-2 co-immunoprecipitated with p53, no association of mdm-2 with NQO1 was observed. These data demonstrate an association between p53 and NQO1 that may represent an alternate mechanism of p53 stabilization by NQO1 in a wide variety of human cell types.

Nature. 1998; 394: 616-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and p53 mutations are one of the most common genetic events that occur in human cancers (3Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When normal cells are subjected to stress signals, such as DNA damage or oxidative stress, p53 is activated, resulting in transcription of downstream genes that coordinate either growth arrest of the cell or apoptosis (4Stewart Z.A. Pietenpol J.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 243-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) preventing proliferation and clonal expansion of damaged cells. Mutations or deletions in p53 and a consequent loss of p53-dependent function leads to increased susceptibility to neoplasia (1Steele R.J. Thompson A.M. Hall P.A. Lane D.P. Br. J. Surg. 1998; 85: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The identification of small molecules and proteins that increase p53 stability and, as a result, protect cells against cancer progression is an active area of current research (3Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem.

Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 309-317Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). NQO1 is an obligate two-electron reductase and is classified as a detoxification enzyme primarily because of its ability to reduce quinone substrates directly to their less toxic hydroquinone derivatives bypassing the redox-cycling semiquinone radical (6Lind C. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 7Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol.

NQO1 can also function as an antioxidant enzyme reducing ubiquinone and vitamin E quinone to their antioxidant forms (8Beyer R.E. Segura-Aguilar J. Di Bernardo S. Cavazzoni M. Fato R. Fiorentini D.

Cancer. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that individuals homozygous for the NQO1*2 polymorphism (NQO1*2/*2) have no measurable NQO1 activity (12Siegel D. McGuinness S.M. Winski S. Ross D. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The null phenotype of individuals carrying the homozygous NQO1*2 polymorphism is due to rapid proteasomal degradation of the mutant NQO1*2 protein (13Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A lack of NQO1 protein due to the homozygous NQO1*2 polymorphism has been associated with an increased risk of various cancers including renal, urothelial, and cutaneous basal cell carcinomas (14Schulz W.A.

Prochaska H.J. Chemica Scripta. 1987; 27A: 61-66Google Scholar, 24Huggins C. Fukunishi R. J. Exp. Med. 1964; 119: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Recently Asher et al. (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) proposed that NQO1, which is activated by many of the same stresses that activate p53, stabilized wild type p53 protein (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed by examining p53 stability and function in cells transfected with human NQO1. Transfected wild type NQO1*1 protein, but not the mutant NQO1*2 protein, stabilized wild type p53 in HCT-116 cells (26Asher G. Lotem J. Kama R. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Experiments were also performed in the presence and absence of the competitive and relatively nonspecific NQO1 inhibitor dicumarol (27Ross D. Siegel D. Beall H. Prakash A.S. Mulcahy R.T. Gibson N.W. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which was found to increase proteasomal degradation of p53 and modulate p53-dependent apoptosis (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Very recent work by the same group has demonstrated that transfected wild type NQO1, but not the mutant NQO1*2 protein, stabilizes wild type p53 in HCT-116 cells (26Asher G. Lotem J. Kama R. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A redox mechanism was proposed for p53 stabilization that relied upon NQO1-dependent NAD(P)H oxidation (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), although these authors have commented that physical interaction of p53 and NQO1 represents an attractive possibility as a mechanism of stabilization (26Asher G. Lotem J. Kama R. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).NQO1 is known to bind other proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp40 (28Anwar A. Siegel D. Kepa J.K. Ross D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14060-14067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined whether NQO1 could interact with p53 via a protein-protein interaction. In this work, we demonstrate that a novel suicide inhibitor of NQO1 developed in our laboratory, which irreversibly blocks the catalytic function of NQO1, has no effect on p53 stability. This suggests that a redox mechanism of stabilization is unlikely. However, for the first time, we demonstrate that NQO1 is able to physically associate with p53 suggesting that a protein-protein interaction may be responsible for the stabilization of p53 by NQO1. In addition to the roles of NQO1 in direct detoxification of quinones and in antioxidant defense, the interaction of NQO1 with p53 may represent an additional mechanism that contributes to the chemoprotective activity of NQO1.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we demonstrate that wild type p53 associates with NQO1 in a variety of human tumor cells, in primary human cell types, and in cell-free systems. Experiments were performed using a co-immunoprecipitation approach employing an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-human NQO1 antibody. Reverse immunoprecipitations were also performed employing either an NQO1 antibody directly coupled to agarose beads or an anti-NQO1 monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with a p53 antibody directly coupled to HRP. Both of these techniques avoided any co-migration of IgG heavy chain with p53. Initially, HCT-116 cells were used to demonstrate the protein-protein interaction of NQO1 and p53 using both forward and reverse immunopreceipitations. We also utilized an isogenic pair of HCT-116 cell lines differing only in their p53 status to explore the association of NQO1 and p53. NQO1 could be detected by immunoblotting in a p53 immunoprecipitate in HCT-116 p53+/+ cells but not in HCT-116 p53−/− cells. An interaction of p53 and NQO1 was confirmed in a cell-free system where p53 was expressed in a coupled transcription/translation system containing recombinant hNQO1 protein. Importantly the interaction of NQO1 and p53 could also be detected in two primary human cell types, human epidermal keratinocytes and human mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that this protein-protein association occurs in a wide variety of human cell types. The interaction of NQO1 and p53 in HMECs was less efficient than in other cell types with similar levels of p53 and NQO1. This suggests that interaction of NQO1 and p53 may be cell type-specific and may reflect the predominance of other p53 interacting proteins in certain cell types. Previous work performed on the stabilization of p53 by NQO1 had suggested a redox mechanism of stabilization dependent on the catalytic function of NQO1 (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In our experiments ES936, a specific suicide inactivator of NQO1, had no effect on the stability of p53. These data suggest that the physical association of NQO1 with p53 should be considered as an alternate mechanism of NQO1-mediated stabilization of p53 ( Scheme 1).One of the major mechanisms of degradation of p53 involves association with mdm-2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation (36Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar, 37Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). A p53-mdm-2 interaction could be observed after treating cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, but no interaction of NQO1 with mdm-2 could be observed either in the presence or absence of proteasomal inhibitors. The NQO1*1 wild type protein is not subject to proteasomal degradation (13Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and as expected, pretreatment of HCT-116 cells with MG132 did not result in any detectable interaction of NQO1 with mdm-2. These data suggest that NQO1 does not interact with mdm-2; therefore, the potential exists for competition of mdm-2 and NQO1 for p53. In addition to interacting with p53, we have previously demonstrated that wild type NQO1 is able to associate with Hsp70 and Hsp40 but not Hsp90 (28Anwar A. Siegel D. Kepa J.K. Ross D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14060-14067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). p53 also interacts with proteins of the Hsp70 and Hsp40 families (38King F.W. Wawrzynow A. Hohfeld J. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and therefore, one possibility to consider is that p53, Hsp70/40, and NQO1 co-exist in a multiprotein complex. However, data obtained in the present study demonstrate that recombinant exogenous NQO1 when added to RRLs can interact with p53 transcribed and translated using a plasmid expression system. In previous work, we have shown that Hsp70 interacts with early, immature forms of NQO1 and does not interact with the mature protein (28Anwar A. Siegel D. Kepa J.K. Ross D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14060-14067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since Hsp70 does not interact with the mature recombinant form of NQO1 (28Anwar A. Siegel D. Kepa J.K. Ross D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14060-14067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the participation of Hsp70 in the protein complex of p53 and the mature form of recombinant NQO1 added to the RRL system can be ruled out. Whether other proteins participate in the complex containing NQO1 and p53 remains to be elucidated (Scheme 1).Proteins other than mdm2 are known to interact with p53 (39Alarcon-Vargas D. Ronai Z. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), so NQO1 is certainly not unique in its propensity to associate with p53. Such proteins include CBP/p300 (41Kawai H. Nie L.

Protein-protein interactions may lead to either stabilization or degradation of p53 (39Alarcon-Vargas D. Ronai Z. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and our data taken together with the previous work of Asher et al. (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl.

A. 2002; 99: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) suggests that NQO1 may be another important protein involved in stabilization of p53. Different stress signals utilize multiple pathways to stabilize p53 such as down-regulation of mdm2, modification of mdm2 activity by ARF binding, phosphorylation, or regulation of the localization of p53 and/or mdm-2 (50Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The growing list of proteins that interact with p53 may well reflect multiple mechanisms of p53 regulation that differ depending on the particular stress response.An important question that arises is whether the known metabolic functions of NQO1, the ability to detoxify quinones and protection against oxidative stress because of its role in ubiquinone and vitamin E metabolism, could be responsible for the protective effects of NQO1 against such a wide range of human solid tumors and leukemias (16Larson R.A. Wang Y. Banerjee M. Wiemels J. Hartford C. Beau M.M. Smith M.T. Blood. 1999; 94: 803-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wiemels J.L. Pagnamenta A. Taylor G.M. Eden O.B. Alexander F.E. Greaves M.F.

Cancer. 2002; 97: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly in recent work, disruption of the NQO1 gene in mice led to the development of myelogenous hyperplasia, and NQO1 null mice were found to have markedly decreased bone marrow p53 content relative to wild type animals (51Long D.J. Gaikwad A. Multani A. Pathak S. Montgomery C.A. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3030-3036PubMed Google Scholar). Given the wide range of cancers that have been associated with a lack of NQO1 due to the NQO1*2 polymorphism, it is conceivable that NQO1 is functioning via a non-catalytic mechanism to protect against neoplasia. There is precedent for proteins normally considered as metabolic enzymes playing other roles in the cell. For example, glutathione S-transferase has recently been demonstrated to physically associate with the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK1) leading to inhibition of kinase activity (52Wang T. Arifoglu P. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20999-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and modulation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase signaling and cellular proliferation (53Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar,54Ruscoe J.E.

Ther. 2001; 298: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, we report a physical association of p53 and NQO1, which we propose as a non-catalytic mechanism influencing p53 stability. This may provide a mechanism for the increased susceptibility of individuals lacking NQO1 due to the NQO1*2 polymorphism to various forms of cancer. The p53 gene is one of the major tumor suppressor genes in humans (1Steele R.J. Thompson A.M. Hall P.A. Lane D.P. Br. J. Surg. 1998; 85: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Lane D. Nature. 1998; 394: 616-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and p53 mutations are one of the most common genetic events that occur in human cancers (3Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When normal cells are subjected to stress signals, such as DNA damage or oxidative stress, p53 is activated, resulting in transcription of downstream genes that coordinate either growth arrest of the cell or apoptosis (4Stewart Z.A. Pietenpol J.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 243-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) preventing proliferation and clonal expansion of damaged cells. Mutations or deletions in p53 and a consequent loss of p53-dependent function leads to increased susceptibility to neoplasia (1Steele R.J. Thompson A.M. Hall P.A. Lane D.P. Br. J. Surg. 1998; 85: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The identification of small molecules and proteins that increase p53 stability and, as a result, protect cells against cancer progression is an active area of current research (3Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1, DT-diaphorase, EC1.6.99.2)1 is a cytosolic flavoenzyme that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (5Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 309-317Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). NQO1 is an obligate two-electron reductase and is classified as a detoxification enzyme primarily because of its ability to reduce quinone substrates directly to their less toxic hydroquinone derivatives bypassing the redox-cycling semiquinone radical (6Lind C. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 7Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12419-12425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NQO1 can also function as an antioxidant enzyme reducing ubiquinone and vitamin E quinone to their antioxidant forms (8Beyer R.E. Segura-Aguilar J. Di Bernardo S. Cavazzoni M. Fato R. Fiorentini D. Galli M. Setti M. Landi L. Lenaz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 9Siegel D. Bolton E.M. Burr J.A. Liebler D.C. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have characterized a polymorphism in NQO1 (NQO1*2) (10Traver R.D. Horikoshi T. Danenberg K.D. Stadlbauer T.H.W. Danenberg P.V. Ross D. Gibson N.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar, 11Traver R.D. Siegel D. Beall H.D. Phillips R.M. Gibson N.W. Franklin W.A. Ross D. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that individuals homozygous for the NQO1*2 polymorphism (NQO1*2/*2) have no measurable NQO1 activity (12Siegel D. McGuinness S.M. Winski S. Ross D. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The null phenotype of individuals carrying the homozygous NQO1*2 polymorphism is due to rapid proteasomal degradation of the mutant NQO1*2 protein (13Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A lack of NQO1 protein due to the homozygous NQO1*2 polymorphism has been associated with an increased risk of various cancers including renal, urothelial, and cutaneous basal cell carcinomas (14Schulz W.A. Krummeck A. Rosinger I. Eickelmann P. Neuhas C. Ebert T. Schmitz-Dräger B. Sies H. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Clairmont A. Sies H.

Of particular interest are five separate epidemiological studies that have identified the NQO1*2 polymorphism as a significant risk factor for development of leukemias of diverse origin (16Larson R.A.

Cancer. 2002; 97: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NQO1-knock-out mice have been shown to be more susceptible to chemical-induced skin cancer (21Long D.J. Waikel R.L. Wang X.J. Perlaky L. Roop D.R. Jaiswal A.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5913-5915PubMed Google Scholar, 22Long D.J. Waikel R.L. Wang X.J. Roop D.R. Jaiswal A.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and inducers of NQO1 have long been recognized as chemoprotective agents against a range of animal tumors (23Talalay P. Prochaska H.J. Chemica Scripta. 1987; 27A: 61-66Google Scholar, 24Huggins C. Fukunishi R. J. Exp. Med. 1964; 119: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently Asher et al. (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) proposed that NQO1, which is activated by many of the same stresses that activate p53, stabilized wild type p53 protein (25Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed by examining p53 stability and function in cells transfected with human NQO1. Transfected wild type NQO1*1 protein, but not the mutant NQO1*2 protein, stabilized wild type p53 in HCT-116 cells (26Asher G. Lotem J. Kama R. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2070914122,"SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) conjugation regulates the subcellular localization, stability, and activity of a variety of proteins. We show here that SUMO-1 overexpression markedly enhances progesterone receptor (PR)-mediated gene transcription. PR undergoes a sumoylation at lysine 388 located in its N-terminal domain. However, sumoylation of the receptor is not responsible for enhanced transcription because substitution of its target lysine did not abolish the effect of SUMO-1 and even converted the receptor into a slightly more active transactivator. Furthermore estrogen receptor α (ERα)-driven transcription is also enhanced by SUMO-1 overexpression contrasting with the absence of sumoylation of this receptor. We thus analyzed SUMO-1 conjugation to the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-1. We showed that this protein contains two major sites of conjugation at Lys-732 and Lys-774. Sumoylation was shown to increase PR-SRC-1 interaction and to prolong SRC-1 retention in the nucleus. It did not prevent SRC-1 ubiquitinylation and did not exert a clear effect on the stability of the protein. Overexpression of SUMO-1 enhanced PR-mediated gene transcription even in the presence of non-sumoylated mutants of SRC-1. This observation suggests that among the many protein partners involved in steroid hormone-mediated gene regulation several are probably targets of SUMO-1 modification.

To activate transcription, steroid hormone receptors recruit coactivators among which the p160 family seems to be of special importance. This family comprises SRC-1/NCoA-1 (steroid receptor coactivactor-1), SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP1 and SRC-3/TRAM-1/ACTR/AIB1/RAC3/pCIP (for reviews, see Refs. 10McKenna N.J. Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M-J.

CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 interact with both the nuclear receptors and the coactivators. Recruitment of histone acetylases allows local decondensation of chromatin thus facilitating transcription (for reviews, see Refs.12Jenster G. Mol. Cell.

Modification by SUMO-1 (sumoylation) has a marked similarity with ubiquitin conjugation reactions (for reviews, see Refs. 36Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Google Scholar, 37Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Google Scholar). It requires an E1-activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2 in mammals, Aos1/Uba2 in yeast) and the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. E3 enzymes have been recently identified in yeast (38Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

Whereas mono-ubiquitinylation has been described as specifically involved in membrane receptor endocytosis (for review, see Refs. 42Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Google Scholar), polyubiquitinylation addresses proteins to proteasomes where they are degraded. In contrast, there is addition of a single SUMO-1 molecule to target lysine(s). Whereas ubiquitinylation usually targets proteins to degradation, sumoylation modifies their functional properties: subcellular localization, stability, or ability to regulate gene transcription. In this manuscript, we describe SUMO-1 conjugation to the progesterone receptor and to its coactivator SRC-1. We also analyze the effect of this modification on the subcellular localization and the transcription-activating properties of these proteins. The plasmids encoding the full-length HA-tagged SRC-1 and the deletion mutants pSG5-HA-SRC-1 Δ1–567, pSG5-HA-SRC-1 Δ1–782, and pSG5-HA-SRC-1 Δ1209–1440 have been previously described (43Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Google Scholar). PCR was used to generate the expression vector for the SRC-1 mutant pSG5-HA-SRC-1 Δ785–1038, by inserting aBamH1 site in position 2343 corresponding to the amino acid 782. The deletion was generated by replacing the wild-typeBamH1/Msc1 fragment with the PCR fragment digested by BamH1/MscI. All point mutation mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR strategy. The generated fragments containing Lys/Arg substitution were cloned into the pSG5-HA-SRC-1 vector by restriction digestions. The multiple substituted mutants were obtained by consecutive fragment exchanges using the restrictions sitesEcoRV, BamH1, BstEII, MscI, and BglII. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing on an automatic sequencer (ABI-Perkin 373A). The expression vectors encoding the full-length progesterone receptor, the human estrogen receptor α (pKSV-ERα), and their respective reporter plasmids PRE2-TATA-CAT and ERE2-TATA-CAT have been previously described (43Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Google Scholar). The point mutation K388R was generated by PCR. The mutated fragment was introduced into pSG5-hPR using MluI/MscI sites. The construct was verified by sequencing. The expression vectors encoding the ADVP16-SRC-1, PM-PR fusion proteins have been described (43Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Google Scholar). For the ADVP16-SRC-1 2R and 5R mutants, theSmaI/BglII fragments of pSG5-HA-SRC-1 2R and pSG5-SRC-1 5R have been cloned, respectively, into the bluntedEcoRI/BamHI empty ADVP16 vector. The His6-tagged SUMO-1 (pSG5-His6-SUMO-1) and the His6-tagged ubiquitin (pSG5-His6-Ub) expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. S. Müller and Dr. D. Bohmann, respectively (35Müller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J-S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Google Scholar, 44Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Google Scholar). CV-1 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum (Seromed). For CAT assays and Western blotting analysis, transfections were performed by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method on CV-1 cells as previously described in detail (43Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Google Scholar). Briefly, transfections were performed on 6-well dishes with 330 ॖl of calcium phosphate precipitate per well containing the reporter gene and expression vectors as indicated for each experiment. Total DNA was normalized to 20 ॖg/ml of precipitate using salmon sperm DNA. The CAT activity was measured with the CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and the CAT activity was corrected for protein content. CV-1 cells seeded on 10-cm diameter Petri dishes were transfected with the indicated expression vectors. For the preparation of whole cell extracts (WCE), 40 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 50 mm sodium fluoride (34Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Google Scholar). Alternatively, for the nickel-affinity purification procedure (Ni-NTA), the transfected cells were lysed in parallel in 1 ml of buffer A (6m guanidinium-HCl, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). After sonication to reduce viscosity, the clarified lysates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 50 ॖl of Ni-NTA-coupled agarose beads (Qiagen) prewashed in buffer A. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer B (8m urea, pH 8, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and once with 1 ml of buffer C (8m urea pH 8, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3). After a final wash with PBS, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli loading buffer and subjected to a 6.47 SDS-PAGE. The proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using primary anti-PR monoclonal antibody Let126 (45Lorenzo F. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Vu Hai M.T. Brailly S. Perrot- Applanat M. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 53-60Google Scholar) or anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a concentration of 2 ॖg/ml. The ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for band detection. COS-7 cells were grown on 35-mm dishes and were transfected with the expression vectors using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After different times, cells were fixed as previously described (46Guiochon-Mantel A. Loosfelt H. Lescop P. Sar S. Atger M. Perrot- Applanat M. Milgrom E. Cell. 1989; 57: 1147-1154Google Scholar). Incubations with the primary antibodies were performed overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 17 goat serum. In single labeling experiments, SRC-1 was detected with the rat monoclonal anti-HA 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1 ॖg/ml. The secondary antibody was the goat anti-rat Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) (1/400). For double labeling, SRC-1 was detected with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (1 ॖg/ml) and endogenous SUMO-1 was detected with the rabbit polyclonal anti-SUMO-1 FL-101 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (2 ॖg/ml). The secondary antibodies sheep anti-mouse CY3-conjugated antibody (Sigma) and Alexa 594 IgG (1/400) were incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature. Confocal images were acquired using the LSM410 system on an Axiovert 135 mZeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using excitation wavelengths of 488 nm (for Alexa, green) and 543 nm (for CY3, red). To examine if the progesterone receptor undergoes sumoylation, CV-1 cells were transfected with a PR expression vector in the presence or absence of a vector encoding His-tagged SUMO-1. Western blotting with an anti-PR monoclonal antibody detected in cells expressing only PR and not incubated with a ligand, a single protein band of ∼115 kDa (Fig.1A, WCE). Treatment by the progesterone agonist R5020 provoked a decrease in receptor migration previously shown to be due to its phosphorylation (47Chauchereau A. Loosfelt H. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18280-18286Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells expressing both PR and SUMO-1, an additional band of ∼155 kDa was detected in both hormone- or antiprogestin (RU486)-treated and untreated cells. To confirm that this band corresponded indeed to the sumoylated receptor the His-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography on nickel-charged agarose beads (Ni-NTA). The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-PR antibody. The same band of ∼155 kDa was observed in this experiment (Fig. 1A,Ni-NTA). Besides the sumoylated receptor minor bands corresponding to the non-modified receptor species were also observed. They were probably retained on the beads because of a low affinity of receptor zinc fingers toward Ni-NTA. To examine the effect of SUMO-1 on receptor-driven transcription activation, CV-1 cells were cotransfected with an expression vector encoding PR, the reporter gene PRE2-TATA-CAT and increasing amounts of an expression vector for SUMO-1. As shown in Fig 1B, SUMO-1 expression markedly increased hormone-induced transcription. There was no significant effect of SUMO-1 on transcription in the absence of hormone or in the presence of the antagonists RU486 and ZK98299. The effect of SUMO-1 was thus strictly hormone-dependent. We examined the possibility that receptor sumoylation was responsible for the enhancement by SUMO-1 of hormone-induced transactivation. Examination of the sequence of the progesterone receptor showed a single sumoylation consensus at lysine 388 in the N-terminal domain of the protein. Indeed, compared with the wild-type receptor, the mutant K388R was not sumoylated (Fig.2A). (It should however be noted that a very faint sumoylated band was still present in mutant K388R. It may correspond to a second site of very weak affinity, and which does not fit the target consensus). However the enhancement of transcription of the reporter gene in the presence of hormone and of SUMO-1 was also observed with the K388R mutant (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the non-sumoylated mutant was more active than the wild-type receptor, in agreement with the recent data of Abdel-Hafizet al. (48Abdel-Hafiz H. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33950-33956Google Scholar). These observations suggested that sumoylation of PR could not explain the overall effect of SUMO-1 on receptor-mediated gene transcription. It should also be noted that antiprogestin-complexed receptor, which does not provoke enhanced transcription of target genes, is sumoylated in a manner similar to that of hormone-complexed PR. To further investigate the role of receptor sumoylation, we analyzed SUMO-1 effect on ERα-stimulated gene transcription. Although ERα has previously been shown to be devoid of SUMO-1 conjugation consensus site and to not undergo sumoylation in vitro (49Poukka H. Karvonen O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Google Scholar), cotransfection with SUMO-1 did markedly enhance estradiol-driven reporter gene transcription (Fig. 2C). Enhancement of transcription by SUMO-1 thus involves modification of proteins other than the receptor. The hormone-induced transcriptional activation mediated by nuclear receptors involves a multistep recruitment of several coactivators leading to the final chromatin remodeling necessary for gene transcription. SRC-1 was the first coactivator identified by its ligand-induced binding to the AF-2 region of the progesterone receptor (50Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Google Scholar). It has also been shown to be a closely related partner of PR in vivo (51McKenna N.J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11697-11702Google Scholar). We thus examined the possibility that SRC-1 could be a target for SUMO-1 conjugation. CV-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the full-length HA-tagged SRC-1 in the presence or absence of an expression vector encoding His6-SUMO-1. Total cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.3A). In the absence of SUMO-1, the anti-HA antibody detected a major band of ∼175 kDa. In the cells cotransfected with SUMO-1 expression vector three other bands were observed (apparent molecular sizes of ∼220, 245, and 260 kDa). These bands probably corresponded to conjugation of SUMO-1 on one, two, or three lysines of SRC-1, because SUMO-1 unlike ubiquitin is not able to self-conjugate. The intensity of the bands decreased from the mono- to the tri-conjugated forms. The latter was barely visible in several experiments. Examination of the sequence of SRC-1 showed the presence of five consensus motifs ((I/L/V)KXE) for SUMO-1 conjugation (52Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Google Scholar, 53Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Google Scholar). Interestingly, all the potential target lysines were localized in protein-protein interaction domains close to LXXLL motifs (Fig.3B). The lysines 732 and 774 were localized in the first nuclear receptor interaction domain (NR1). The lysines 800 and 846 resided in the CBP/p300 interaction domain. Lysine 1378 was located in the C-terminal extremity of the protein corresponding to the second receptor-interacting domain (NR2). Interestingly only one of the consensus sequences (Lys-732) is conserved in all the three members of the p160 family including SRC2/TIF2/GRIP1 and SRC-3/TRAM1/ACTR/AIB1/RAC3. Two other motifs (Lys-800 and Lys-1378) are conserved in two of these proteins; the remaining two motifs are present only in SRC-1 (Fig. 3C). Mutagenesis studies were undertaken to verify these predictions. CV-1 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding various deletion mutants of SRC-1 and His6-SUMO-1 (Fig.4A). Total cell extracts and Ni-NTA precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody. Removal of the nuclear interaction domain 1 (NR1) in mutant Δ1–781 completely abolished SUMO-1 conjugation (Fig. 4B). The mutants Δ785–1038 and Δ1209–1440, which retain this domain, were sumoylated. This result suggested that lysines 732 and 774 could be the major sumoylation sites. Point mutations were used to verify this hypothesis. When all five putative target lysines (Lys-732, Lys-774, Lys-800, Lys-846, and Lys-1378) were substituted by arginines (5R SRC-1), the sumoylation reaction was suppressed. Individual substitutions of Lys-800, Lys-846, and Lys-1378 did not affect SRC-1 overall modification by SUMO-1. In contrast, the double substitution on Lys-732R and Lys-774R abolished sumoylation (Fig. 4C). We thus concluded that lysines 732 and 774 were the main sites of SUMO-1 conjugation in SRC-1 whereas the other lysine(s) may serve as weak affinity target sites. The two major sites of SUMO-1 conjugation (Lys-732 and Lys-774) are located in the first nuclear receptor interaction domain of SRC-1. This domain contains three LXXLL motifs (named NR boxes), which are involved in receptor-SRC-1 interaction (54McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T-M. Krones A. Inostroza J.

Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar). Residues flanking NR boxes on both sides make significant contacts with the ligand binding domain of receptors (58Needham M. Raines S. McPheat J. Stacey C. Ellston J. Hoare S. Parker M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 35-46Google Scholar). These residues have also been shown to be important for the preferential binding of various NR boxes to different nuclear receptors and thus to determine a preference of the various receptors for specific p160 coactivators (58Needham M. Raines S. McPheat J. Stacey C. Ellston J. Hoare S. Parker M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 35-46Google Scholar). The sumoylation sites perfectly flank NR box 3. This suggested that covalent binding of SUMO-1 molecule(s) could alter SRC-1-receptor interaction. Few methods are available to study interactions between sumoylated proteins since cell extracts must contain protein denaturing and SH-blocking agents to prevent desumoylation (34Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Google Scholar). We thus used a mammalian two-hybrid system to analyze the effect of sumoylationin vivo. CV-1 cells were cotransfected with a Gal4 UAS-driven reporter gene, a vector encoding the full-length PR fused to the Gal4 DBD (DBDGal4-PR) and a vector encoding the SRC-1 sequence fused to the VP16 activation domain (ADVP16-SRC-1). The transfected cells were incubated with hormone (Fig. 5). The hormone-driven transcription observed in the presence of the DBDGal4-PR construct was increased by SUMO-1 coexpression. However when ADVP16-SRC-1 was added, SUMO-1 determined a markedly stronger enhancement of transcription, showing that it increased DBDGal4-PR interaction with ADVP16-SRC-1. Mutation of lysines 732 and 734 (ADVP16-SRC-1 2R) hardly modified the interaction between PR and SRC-1 but this interaction was markedly affected in the non-sumoylated SRC-1 (ADVP16-SRC-1 5R), suggesting that the extent of sumoylation of SRC-1 plays a role in receptor-coactivator interaction. In previous studies, we have observed that the intracellular localization of SRC-1 corresponds to a dynamic process, the protein being initially addressed to the nucleus and thereafter exported into the cytoplasm. 2L. Amazit, Y. Alj, R. K. Tyagi, A. Chauchereau, H. Loosfelt, C. Pichon, J. Pantel, E. Foulon-Guinchard, P. Leclerc, E. Milgrom, and A. Guiochon-Mantel, manuscript in preparation.In both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, SRC-1 is present in dot-like structures. To analyze the effect of sumoylation, we transfected cells with expression vectors encoding the wild-type SRC-1 or the mutant with five substituted arginines (5R-SRC-1), which cannot be sumoylated. 24 h after transfection the wild-type SRC-1 was predominantly present in the nucleus (Fig.6A) where it colocalized with endogenous SUMO-1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, SRC-1 was mainly present in the cytoplasm, and only the few remaining nuclear dots colocalized with endogenous SUMO-1 (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the non-sumoylated 5R-SRC-1 mutant was mainly localized in the cytoplasm already 24 h after transfection (only the few remaining intranuclear SRC-1 stained dots colocalized with endogenous SUMO-1) (Fig. 6A). The pattern observed with this mutant 24 h after transfection was very similar to that observed 48 h after transfection with wild-type receptor (Fig. 6B). If sumoylation retards SRC-1 export from the nucleus, overexpression of SUMO-1 should increase the nuclear residency time of SRC-1. This was indeed observed in cells cotransfected with SUMO-1 where SRC-1 remained in the nucleus even 48 h after transfection (Fig.7A). No such nuclear retention could be observed with the non-sumoylated 5R-SRC-1. Finally, as previously observed by us in the case of SRC-12 and others, proteasome inhibitors have been reported to provoke the nuclear sequestration of various transcription factors (59Chilov D. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Ziegler U. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1203-1212Google Scholar, 60Chen F. Chang D. Goh M. Klibanov S.A. Ljungman M.

Stephen C.W. Lane P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 66-77Google Scholar). Indeed in the presence of proteasome inhibitor clasto-lactacystin, and 48 h after transfection, SRC-1 was still present mainly in the nucleus presenting a hyperspeckled pattern. In this case, there was a perfect colocalization between these speckles and endogenous SUMO-1 (Fig. 7B). To obtain further insight into the transcriptional role of SUMO-1 conjugation to SRC-1, we studied the impact of mutations of SUMO-1 acceptor sites. Expression vectors encoding PR and a reporter gene (PRE2-TATA-CAT) were transfected into cells. Various amounts of an expression vector encoding wild-type SRC-1 we"

In the denitrifierRalstonia eutropha, the tripartite transcription factor NorR regulates denitrification, norA1B1 transcription, and NOR activity expression in a ς54-dependent mechanism in response to exposures to sodium nitroprusside, the NO donor compound NOC18, or during growth with nitrite or nitrate (31Pohlmann A.

Recently, Hutchings et al. (32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) reported NorR-dependent activation of norV transcription by the NO+ donor and NO-generating compound nitroprusside in support of the proposed regulatory function. Interestingly, nitroprusside-elicited norV transcription was increased >5-fold by normoxic O2 suggesting mechanisms for NorR activation involving O2-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates rather than NO per se. The large oxygen enhancement of norV transcription observed with or without nitroprusside exposure has also supported proposals for aerobic functions for the norRVW operon, including O2reduction and the detoxification of O2-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates (25Gomes C.M.

We now report the rapid and robust induction of norVand norW transcription and NorVW activity by sub-micromolar NO via a NorR- and ς54-dependent mechanism inE. coli. We also show that a deletion within the conserved NorR N-terminal domain activates NorVW expression independent of NO exposure, thus demonstrating the role of the N terminus in NO sensing and signaling. Contrary to the results obtained with nitroprusside (32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), O2 greatly diminished norV andnorW induction by NO. The results are discussed in light of the proposed NO reduction and detoxification function of thenorRVW operon within the NO defense network. Bovine liver catalase (260,000 units/ml) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Glucose oxidase (4,000 units/ml) and β-galactosidase (1190 units/ml) were obtained from Sigma. Saturated NO stocks (2 mm) were prepared in water as previously described (7Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Salzman A.L. J. Biol.

Compressed gas cylinders containing 1200 ppm (±5%) of NO in ultrapure N2, 99.999% N2, 99.993% O2, and 1.05% O2 in ultrapure N2 were obtained from Praxair (Bethlehem, PA).

A Tn10 mutation in the rpoN locus was transduced with P1 phage and mutants were selected for tetracycline resistance.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to the method of Miller (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Frozen cell pellets were suspended at ∼1 × 1010 cells per milliliter in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and sonicated on ice. Cell-free extracts were prepared by centrifuging lysates at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Assays were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a 0.1-ml volume with 1–15 μg of extract protein in a 96-well plate. Extract activities were determined using a standard curve generated with 0–3.5 milliunits of β-galactosidase. Activity is reported in milliunits per milligram of extract protein where one milliunit cleaves 1 nmol ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside per minute at room temperature. Background β-galactosidase activity in parental AB1157 cells was 3.3 ± 0.6 milliunits/mg extract protein in anaerobic cells, 3.5 ± 0.7 in low aerobic cells, and 8.3 ± 1.0 in aerobic cultures. β-Galactosidase activity remained constant in AB1157 cells irrespective of NO exposure and was subtracted from the activities measured in lacZ fusion strains under similar growth conditions. Soluble protein was measured using Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using the Tukey Kramer honestly significantly different method in the JMP program (SAS Institute). norV and norW transcriptional units are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion with the start methionine of NorW located within the coding region of norV suggesting coordinate transcription and translation in response to NO stress (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast, norR is divergently transcribed fromnorVW (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and is autogenously regulated (32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Strain AG300 carrying a norV-lacZ fusion within thenorV genomic locus and lacking inducible anaerobic NOR activity (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was used to measure the responsiveness of norVtranscription to authentic NO. Exposure of anaerobic AG300 to 960 ppm gaseous NO (≤2 μm in solution) induced β-galactosidase activity by ∼50-fold within 5 min. β-Galactosidase expression peaked after 30–45 min of exposure resulting in ≥1000-fold induction (Fig. 1 A). A 30-fold increase in norV transcription was observed with 120 ppm NO (≤0.25 μm in solution) (Fig. 1 B). Maximal induction of β-galactosidase activity was observed with 480 ppm NO (≤1 μm in solution). Expression was blunted with 960 ppm NO exposure suggesting toxicity of NO under these conditions. NO similarly induced norW-lacZ in strain AG400 under anaerobic conditions (Table II). However, the norW-lac fusion was induced to a 10-fold lower extent than that observed for the norV-lac fusion following a similar NO exposure.Table IIExpression of norV-, norW-, and norR-lacZ fusionsβ-Galactosidase activityStrainGenotypewith N2 onlywith 0.5% O2with 21% O2ControlNOControlNOControlNOmilliunits/mgAG300Φ(norV-lacZ)2321 ± 12591 ± 3141 ± 1828 ± 2731 ± 1120 ± 7AG400Φ(norW-lacZ)113 ± 1538 ± 913 ± 1294 ± 994 ± 138 ± 15AG200Φ(norR-lacZ)28619 ± 213 ± 324 ± 122 ± 426 ± 135 ± 1 Open table in a new tab The dampened response of norW-lac to NO may be explained by the production of significant NOR activity from norVexpression within strain AG400 (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), thus resulting in a lower steady-state NO level. It is also possible that higher steady-state NO levels are required to activate maximal norW transcription. Nevertheless, the results clearly demonstrate a rapid, robust, and coordinate up-regulation of norV and norWtranscription in response to low levels of NO. The results in Table IIalso demonstrate a low non-inducible level of transcription fromnorR consistent with previous results obtained using nitroprusside as the potential inducer (32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NO-mediated induction of norV-lac andnorW-lac fusions was significantly inhibited by O2. Under fully aerated conditions (∼200 μmO2), induction ratios for norV-lacZ andnorW-lacZ fusions were reduced 200- and 20-fold, respectively, with no change in the basal expression levels (Table II). At a lower O2 concentration (∼5 μm),norV-lac and norW-lac induction ratios were reduced 3.1- and 1.8-fold, respectively. Lower norV andnorW induction in the presence of O2 can be explained by the decrease in cellular NO levels achieved by the inducible NOD. Indeed, NOD expression decreased norV-lacexpression by ∼96% in cells exposed to an atmosphere containing 960 ppm NO in 21% O2 for 45 min. NOD-deficient strain AG301 and control strain AG300 produced 3453 ± 493 and 149 ± 23 milliunits/mg β-galactosidase (n = 4, ±S.E.), respectively. Thus, norV and norW are maximally induced under conditions in which the O2-sensitive NOR functions most effectively (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and NOD indirectly regulates NOR expression. The central domain of the tripartite NorR protein is highly homologous with ς54-dependent response regulators (31Pohlmann A. Cramm R. Schmelz K. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Ramseier T.M. Figge R.M. Saier Jr., M.H. DNA Sequence. 1994; 5: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) thus suggesting an important role for ς54 in the NO response. Furthermore, the region upstream of the norVWgenes contains the respective −12 and −24 elements TTGCA and TGGCA characteristic of ς54-dependent promoters (40Reitzer L. Schneider B.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 422-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 41Barrios H. Valderrama B. Morett E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We used rpoN mutants to test the role of ς54 in NO-induced norV transcription and NOR activity expression. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in AG300 and ς54-deficient strain AG305 following a 45-min exposure to 600 ppm gaseous NO under microaerobic conditions. In the absence of ς54, norV-lacZ expression was substantially impaired (Fig.2 A). The ς54-deficient strain AG500 and parental AB1157 were similarly exposed to NO under low O2 and tested for anaerobic NOR and aerobic NOD activity. NOR activity was significantly reduced in strain AG500 (Fig. 2 B). There was no significant effect of ς54 on NOD (hmp) expression under these conditions (Fig. 2 C). The results clearly demonstrate a role for ς54 in norV transcription. The residual induction of norV transcription and NOR activity in the absence of ς54 suggests ancillary roles for other ς factors in norV transcription or mechanisms for post-transcriptional regulation. Expression of NorR from a multicopy plasmid rescued the NO inducibility of NOR activity in the norR deletion strain AG200 (Fig.3 A) thus confirming thetrans-acting regulatory role of NorR in the activation ofnorVW transcription and NOR activity expression (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the absence of NO, there was no measurable NOR activity expressed (Fig.3 A, open bars) indicating that overexpression of wild-type NorR does not by itself increase NorVW expression. However, internal deletion of NorR, eliminating amino acids 30–164 containing the putative signaling domain (31Pohlmann A. Cramm R. Schmelz K. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Ramseier T.M. Figge R.M. Saier Jr., M.H. DNA Sequence. 1994; 5: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but retaining the entire central ς54-interacting ATPase domain and the C-terminal DNA binding domain, induced NOR activity in the absence of NO (Fig.3 A). Further deletion of NorR to amino acid 214, eliminating part of the ς54-interacting ATPase domain, did not induce β-galactosidase activity (data not shown) thus further delineating the requirement for ς54 interaction with NorR for transcriptional activation. Interestingly, the NO-mediated induction of NOD activity was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in strains expressing NorR and elevated NOR activity (Fig. 3 B) thus suggesting an indirect role for NorR and NOR in regulating NOD expression by reducing NO levels. These results demonstrate the signaling function of the N-terminal domain of the E. coli norVW transcription regulator NorR similar to that described for other tripartite regulators (31Pohlmann A. Cramm R. Schmelz K. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). In addition, the results demonstrate that neither NorR nor ς54 is directly involved in the NO-mediated up-regulation of the E. coli NOD (hmp). Our data demonstrate that the exposure of E. coli to NO induces transcription of the norV and norW genes via a NorR and ς54-dependent mechanism. The data extend the results of Hutchings et al. (32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) demonstrating activation of norV transcription by the NO+ donor nitroprusside, nitrite, or nitrate in a NorR-dependent fashion. Given the relatively low concentration of NO required for anaerobic norV induction (Fig. 1 B), NO is the most probable physiological signal modulating NorR and norVW transcription. Our results differ from those of Hutchings et al. (32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) who reported that constitutive and induced norV transcription was greater in the presence of O2. One likely explanation for the discrepancy is that we used NO gas and Hutchings et al. (32Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) used nitroprusside as a NO+ donor and potential NO-generating agent. Nitroprusside may have deleterious effects on transcription or, alternatively, may generate NO at higher levels in aerobic cells. Pure NO gas is readily available and is clearly preferred for investigations of the effects of NO on NO defense gene regulation. The use of pure NO gas for the quantitative evaluation of gene expression responses also presents challenges because of the existence of multiple pathways for rapid and inducible NO metabolism and because of the incipient toxicity of NO. Nevertheless, the demonstration that the NO levels required for norV induction correspond with levels shown to exert cellular damage strongly supports the proposed role of the norRVW operon in NO reduction and detoxification. Thus, 240 ppm gaseous NO (≤0.5 μm in solution) inactivated E. coli aconitase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase and inhibited growth in the absence of the induced NorVW activity (6Gardner P.R.

Furthermore, the level of NO inducing half-maximal norV transcription (≤0.7 μm) approximates the apparent K m (NO) value of ∼0.4 μm determined for NorVW-catalyzed NO reduction (8Gardner A.M.

These results diminish the likelihood of a significant function of the operon in O2 detoxification or in the detoxification of unspecified reactive nitrogen intermediates generated from nitroprusside or NO exposure as previously suggested (25Gomes C.M.

A search of GenBankTM (NCBI) with the N-terminal 182 amino acids of NorR identifies several NorR orthologues (Fig.4). As in E. coli, NorR orthologues in Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pnuemoniae, Shigella flexnerei (AAN44223), andVibrio vulnificus CMCP6 (NP_763239) are positioned upstream of norVW orthologues. Interestingly, NorR orthologues in thePseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholera,Azetobacter vinelandii (ZP_00091183),Burkholderia sp. strain TH2 (BAC16772), andBurkholderia fungorum (ZP00028693) genomes are found divergently transcribed from flavohemoglobin (hmp) genes suggesting a potential role for NorR in regulating NODs in response to NO. In this regard it is noteworthy that NorR was not required for the induction of NOD activity in response to NO in E. coli (Fig.3 B), thus demonstrating the existence of one or more separate NO-responsive regulator(s) of hmp in E. coli. NorR belongs to the family of two-component response regulators (42Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). Similar to other tripartite regulators in this family, deletion of the N-terminal signaling or inhibitory domain of NorR activated NorVW expression independent of NO (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, conserved aspartate residues in the NorR N-terminal signaling domain suggest the potential for phosphorylation by a sensor histidine-kinase similar to that described for the NtrB/NtrC pair (43Weiss V. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In particular, aspartates 57 and 62 are in position to accept phosphate, and the conserved acidic residue at position 14 may serve to optimize phosphorylation (Fig. 4) (44Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the NorR N-terminal domain could activate transcription by interacting with a signal transducing protein as described for NifL/NifA (45Henderson N. Austin S.A. Dixon R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 484-491Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or by binding NO directly as the formate-sensing transcription regulator FhlA binds formate (46Hopper S. Bock A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2798-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NorR N-terminal domain contains potential metal-liganding histidine and cysteine residues that could form the NO sensor module. For example, NorR contains an His111-X-Cys113 site reminiscent of the Cys75-X-His77heme iron ligand-switch motif in the carbon monoxide-sensing CooA of Rhodospirillum rubrum (47Lanzilotta W.N.

Fig. 5 summarizes our current view of the NO defense network in E. coli. NO exposure elicits the synthesis of two major NO-metabolizing enzymes, NOD and NOR (NorVW) by activating transcription of their corresponding genes, hmpand norVW. The respective contribution of each enzyme to NO detoxification depends primarily on the availability of O2. NOD is effective under aerobic and microaerobic conditions (K m (O2) = 60–100 μm) (13Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12581-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Dou Y. Li T. Olson J.S. Zhu H. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31581-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The NOR activity of NorVW is unique in that its exquisite sensitivity to O2 restricts its NO scavenging function to anaerobic or microaerobic conditions (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The results also support a model in which norVW and hmptranscription are indirectly influenced by O2 availability, because O2 levels affect NorVW and NOD activities, which ultimately determine NO steady-state levels and the activity of transcription regulators such as NorR and Fnr (29Cruz-Ramos H.

In this regard, Omi resembles Smac/DIABLO, which also binds IAPs and as a result activates caspase-9 (11Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Google Scholar, 12Verhagen A.M.

Omi protein is synthesized as a precursor that is processed in the mitochondria to produce the mature protein. This processing exposes an internal tetrapeptide motif, AVPS, at the amino terminus. A similar motif is found in all IAP-binding proteins, including the Drosophila Grim, Reaper, Hid, and Sickle (13Chen P. Nordstrom W. Gish B. Abrams J.M.

Musumeci, and A. Zervos, submitted for publication. Omi can also induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent pathway that relies entirely on its ability to function as a serine protease (6Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Google Scholar, 7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y.

In order to investigate the caspase-independent mechanism of apoptosis initiated by Omi, we isolated specific inhibitors of its proteolytic activity. One such family of synthetic compounds was identified and is described in this paper. These heterocyclic compounds showed significant and specific activity against the protease in anin vitro assay. A compound from this family, which exhibited the highest activity against Omi, was selected for more detailed studies. This compound (ucf-101) naturally fluoresces and easily enters mammalian cells, allowing its use in in vivo experiments. Our results clearly showed ucf-101 had a profound effect on the activity of Omi and could substantially inhibit its ability to induce caspase-independent apoptosis in caspase-9 (−/−) null fibroblasts (17Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Google Scholar). The ucf-101 inhibitor can be used as a tool to dissect the two different activities (caspase-dependent versuscaspase-independent) of Omi and their respective contribution to apoptosis in various biological settings. Furthermore, ucf-101, or a similar compound, may be useful as an anti-apoptotic drug that would specifically target caspase-independent cell death under clinical conditions. Dephosphorylated-casein (Sigma, 3 ml of 2 mg/ml stock solution) was used in a dialysis cassette (Pierce) placed in labeling buffer (0.03 mg/ml FITC, 50 mm sodium borate, pH 9.3, 40 mm NaCl) and kept for 48 h at 4 °C in the dark with constant stirring. After labeling, the FITC-dephosphorylated casein (Dcasein-FITC) was further dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl to remove any residual unlabeled FITC. The Dcasein-FITC conjugate was recovered from the dialysis cassette and stored at 4 °C in the dark. PCR was used to amplify DNA sequences corresponding to Omi/HtrA2 (amino acids 134–458) and L56/HtrA1 (amino acids 140–480). The PCR products were digested with MfeI and XbaI and cloned in the corresponding EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites of pMAL-p2X vector (New England Biolabs). MBP-Omi-(134–458) and MBP-L56-(140–480) proteases were expressed in TB1 Escherichia coli (New England Biolabs) and purified on an amylose binding affinity column as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The concentration of purified proteases was determined using the Bradford assay. PCR was used to amplify the DNA sequence corresponding to Omi/HtrA2 (Omi-(134–458)). The PCR product was cloned in-frame in the bacterial expression vector pET-28 (Novagen). For bacterial expression, BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) bacteria were transformed with pET-Omi-(134–458). Single colonies were grown overnight in LB medium containing kanamycin. The overnight culture (1 ml) was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium, and growth was continued at 37 °C until the A 600 was ∼0.8. At this time, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the culture was placed in a shaking incubator overnight at 20 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The bacterial suspension was then sonicated, and the soluble fraction was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind resin (Novagen). The purity of the His-Omi-(134–458) protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the resulting gel. Opaque microtiter plates (Corning Glass) were used in order to minimize background absorbance. A typical assay included 10 μg of Dcasein-FITC substrate, 2 μg of MBP-Omi-(134–458) in assay buffer (20 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) in a final volume of 100 μl. Dcasein-FITC conjugate solution (50 μl of a 0.2 μg/μl stock solution) was added in each well using a Multidrop 384 multiple dispenser (Labsystems) and incubated in the Wallac 1420 Victor2 Multilabel Counter at 37 °C for 15 min. After this time, 50 μl of MBP-Omi-(134–458) protease (40 ng/μl) was added to each well. The fluorescence (535 nm) of the reactions was recorded every 5 min for a 30-min period. A Pharma Library Collection (Nanosyn) was screened for compounds, which may inhibit the proteolytic activity of MBP-Omi-(134–458) in an in vitroassay. Each compound, 10 μm final concentration, was preincubated with 50 μl of MBP-Omi-(134–458) (2 μg) for 15 min at 37 °C. After this time, Dcasein-FITC solution (10 μg) was added, and the change in fluorescence was read every 5 min during a 30-min period using a 535-nm bandpass filter. The proteolytic activity of MBP-Omi-(134–458) was expressed as the percentage inhibition, where 100% refers to the activity in the absence of inhibitor (Me2SO replaced the inhibitor in the assay). The assay was performed as described above using Dcasein-FITC as substrate. 2 μg of MBP-Omi-(134–458) was incubated with various concentrations of ucf-101, ucf-102, ucf-103, or ucf-104 for 15 min. After this time 10 μg of Dcasein-FITC substrate was added, and the reaction proceeded for an additional 30 min. The activity of MBP-Omi-(134–458) was monitored at 535 nm. The IC50 value for each of the two selected inhibitors was obtained using His-Omi-(134–458) and the EnzCheck assay kit (Molecular Probes) that contains BODIPY FL-casein as a generic substrate. Briefly, 35 μl of His-Omi-(134–458) (500 nm) diluted in 20 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol was incubated with 5 μl of various concentrations of the inhibitors (0.1–1000 μm) in 100% Me2SO (final concentration of Me2SO was 10%); 10 μl of BODIPY-FL casein (2.5 μm final concentration) diluted in buffer was added. The assay was carried out using 384-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was monitored continuously for 10 min at 37 °C on a Tecan SpectraFluorPlus microtiter plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) at an excitation wavelength 485 nm/emission wavelength 530 nm. IC50 values were calculated using the GraFit 4 program (Erithacus Software, Middlesex, UK). The amount of the inhibitor giving a 50% (IC50) decrease of the enzyme activity compared with the control reaction was estimated for various serine proteases. Briefly, 35 μl of the indicated enzyme diluted in the corresponding buffer was incubated for 10 min with 5 μl of various concentrations of inhibitor (0.1–1000 μm) in 50% Me2SO, 50% buffer. After this time, 10 μl of the corresponding peptidic colorimetric or fluorogenic substrate diluted in buffer was added. In the case of the FVIIa/TF assay, a preincubation of both proteins for 10 min at room temperature was performed prior to addition of the inhibitor to allow complex formation. For this experiment the following materials were used: canine FXa, rat FXa, and rabbit FXa (Enzyme Research Laboratories); trypsin from bovine pancreas and human thrombin (Sigma); human plasmin, human t-PA, human u-PA, and human kallikrein (Calbiochem-Novabiochem); human APC and recombinant human factor VIIa (American Diagnostica); and recombinant tissue factor (Dade Behring). The substrates used are as follows: spectrozyme fXa fluorogenic (American Diagnostica); kallikrein fluorogenic substrate; protein C-activated substrate (Calbiochem); Chromozym X, Chromozym PL, and Chromozym t-PA (Roche Diagnostics); I-1045, I-1140, and I-1140 (Bachem). The amount of each enzyme and its corresponding substrate used in the assay was canine FXa (2 nm), spectrozyme fXa fluorogenic (20 μm), rat FXa (5 nm), spectrozyme fXa fluorogenic (25 μm), rabbit FXa (5 nm), spectrozyme fXa fluorogenic (15 μm), kallikrein (5 nm), kallikrein fluorogenic substrate (50 μm), trypsin (2.5 nm), Chromozym X (150 μm), plasmin (5 nm), I-1045 (100 μm), thrombin (4 nm), Chromozym PL (150 μm), FVIIa/tissue factor (15 nm/3 nm), Chromozym t-PA (500 μm), t-PA (100 nm), I-1140 (200 μm), u-PA (3 nm), I-1140 (150 μm), activated protein C (5 nm), and protein C-activated substrate (100 μm) in a final concentration of 5% Me2SO. All enzymatic assays were carried out at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates (Nunc). Color development due to the release ofp-nitroanilide from the chromogenic substrates was monitored continuously for 20 min at 405 nm on a Tecan SpectraFluorPlus microtiter plate reader (Tecan). Fluorescence from the release of the coumarin derivative, aminomethylcoumarin, was measured at excitation 360 nm/emission 465 nm on the same reader. The IC50 values were calculated using the GraFit 4 program (Erithacus Software). HeLa cells were grown on coverslips using F-12 (Ham's) nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Different concentrations of ucf-101 were added to the cell media, and after 2 h cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were then placed on glass slides using Fluoromount-G solution (Southern Biochemical Association). The subcellular localization of ucf-101 was monitored using a LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss). Caspase-9 (−/−) cells were transfected with either pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) or M-Omi-GFP that encodes a cytoplasmic form of Omi/HtrA2 (7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Google Scholar). Transfected cells were kept in medium containing different concentrations of ucf-101. This medium, including the inhibitor, was replaced every 12 h. After 36 h, cells were stained with propidium iodide and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as described (7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Google Scholar). Normal and apoptotic GFP-expressing cells were counted using fluorescence microscopy. Because no physiological substrates for Omi protease are known, β-casein was used as a generic substrate in in vitro assays to monitor the protease activity of Omi. For high throughput screening, we developed a new assay that uses a mixture of α-casein, β-casein, and dephosphorylated casein (Dcasein) coupled to FITC, as a substrate. The use of Dcasein-FITC increases the fluorescence during the reaction with less fluctuation and lower background (data not shown). A typical assay uses 10 μg of Dcasein-FITC and 2 μg of MBP-Omi-(134–458) in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) at 37 °C for 30 min. There was a rapid increase in fluorescence for the first 20 min followed by a slower increase for the remaining 10 min of the assay. Various concentrations of substrate, Dcasein-FITC, as well as MBP-Omi-(134–458) were used for kinetic studies. By using an in vitro high throughput assay system, we screened a combinatorial library of synthetic compounds (Nanosyn). This collection represented compounds that had commonly accepted pharmaceutical hit structures with possible pharmacological properties. The assay was performed in multiple 96-well plates. The inhibition activity of each compound was expressed as the percentage of relative fluorescence change (decrease) compared with the control (no compound). The final concentration of each compound tested was 10 μm. Fifty two compounds showed more than a 20% inhibition of MBP-Omi-(134–458) activity in the initial screening, but only one compound (ucf-101) showed greater than a 50% inhibition at the concentration tested after two rounds of screening and selection (Table I).Table IScreening for inhibitors of the proteolytic activity of Omi% inhibition1st screening2nd screening06261–194684720–3952140–5921Total52875A combinatorial library of 528 selected compounds was used in a high throughout screening for potential inhibitors of the proteolytic activity of Omi.

Open table in a new tab A combinatorial library of 528 selected compounds was used in a high throughout screening for potential inhibitors of the proteolytic activity of Omi. Several compounds had weak activity against Omi, but after two rounds of selection only one chemical showed substantial and reproducible inhibition against Omi in the assay used. We obtained several analogs of ucf-101, and the chemical structures are shown in Fig.1. The activity of these ucf analogs was tested using MBP-Omi-(134–458) in the same in vitro assay system. All three analogs inhibited the proteolytic activity of MBP-Omi-(134–458) but to a lesser extent than ucf-101 (Fig.2). ucf-104 (20 μm) inhibited 58% MBP-Omi-(134–458) activity, whereas the same concentration of ucf-101 inhibited more than 78% MBP-Omi-(134–458) activity. When MBP-Omi-(134–458) was preincubated with various concentrations of ucf-101, -102, -103, and -104 at 37 °C for longer periods (40 min or 1 h) inhibition was reduced, indicating the inhibitors did not irreversibly bind the enzyme (results not shown). MBP-Omi-(134–458) was also incubated with various amounts of Dcasein-FITC in the presence of 10 μm ucf-101. The rate of the reaction decreased by 50% when the concentration of the substrate was doubled and even reached the rate of the control reaction at higher concentrations of Dcasein-FITC (results not shown). These results suggest ucf-101 is a competitive inhibitor of Omi protease.Figure 2Inhibition of MBP-Omi-(134–458) by ucf-101 and several other ucf analogs. The assay was performed with 10 μg of Dcasein-FITC incubated with 2 μg of MBP-Omi-(134–458) in the presence of various concentrations of ucf-101 and three analogs, ucf-102, ucf-103, and ucf-104. ▪, ucf-101; ▴, ucf-104; ●, ucf-103; ♦, ucf-102.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inhibitory effect of ucf-101 on the activity of His-Omi-(134–458) was monitored by incubating inhibitor and enzyme together for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of β-casein as a generic substrate. Fig.3 shows that bacterially made His-Omi-(134–458) had substantial activity against β-casein, and after 30 min total degradation of the substrate occurred. ucf-101 inhibited His-Omi-(134–458) activity in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 4–9) when assayed for 30 min with 200 ng of His-Omi-(134–458) and 5 μg of β-casein. ucf-101 (80 μm) was able to inhibit completely the activity of 200 ng of His-Omi-(134–458) (lane 5). Omi/HtrA2 and L56/HtrA1 are members of the same family of mammalian serine proteases with extensive homology in their catalytic domains (1Faccio L. Fusco C. Chen A. Martinotti S. Bonventre J.V. Zervos A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2581-2588Google Scholar). We used bacterially made His-Omi-(134–458) and His-L56-(140–480) to investigate whether ucf-101 was able to inhibit the activity of His-L56-(140–480) in a similar manner. Fig. 4 shows ucf-101 is an effective inhibitor of the activity of His-L56-(140–480) but to a lesser extent than His-Omi- (134–458). The enzymatic activity of His-Omi and the determination of the IC50 for ucf-101 and ucf-102 were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These values are shown in Table II. ucf-101 had an IC50 of 9.5 μm, and ucf-102 had an IC50 of 45.9 μm.Table IIIC50 of ucf-101 and ucf-102 inhibitors on His-OmiInhibitorsIC50 in μmucf-1019.5ucf-10245.9The value is the average from three independent experiments.

To investigate the potential use of ucf-101 inhibitor in in vivo experiments, we tested its ability to enter mammalian cells. ucf-101 has natural fluorescence at 543 nm that was used to detect the presence of the compound. HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of ucf-101 and observed by confocal microscopy. Intense red fluorescence, due to the presence of ucf-101, was observed in the cytoplasm of the treated cells (Fig. 5) Mouse embryo caspase-9 (−/−) null fibroblasts (17Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with pEGFP-N1 (control) or M-Omi-GFP (7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic expression of M-Omi-GFP induced apoptosis in ∼70% of the transfected cells. When cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ucf-101, it was found that increasing the concentration of inhibitor up to 10 μm gradually reduced Omi-induced apoptosis up to 40%. ucf-101 had no effect on the control (vector alone) transfected cells. When the concentration of the ucf-101 increased to 25 μm, the anti-apoptotic activity of the inhibitor was compromised due to a cytotoxic side effect that caused apoptosis both in the M-Omi-GFP, as well as control transfected cells (Fig. 6). Omi/HtrA2 is a mitochondrial serine protease that is released to the cytoplasm upon induction of apoptosis. In the cytoplasm, Omi binds to XIAP and relieves its inhibition of caspase-9 (6Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Google Scholar, 7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y.

Wrobel C. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 445-454Google Scholar). In this respect, Omi acts in a manner similar to Smac/DIABLO, another mitochondrial protein that also binds to XIAP (11Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Google Scholar, 12Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Google Scholar). This interaction with XIAP is mediated via an AVPS motif that is exposed at the amino terminus of mature Omi protein after processing (6Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Google Scholar, 7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Google Scholar). Omi is also able to induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner that exclusively relies on its ability to function as a protease (6Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Google Scholar, 7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y.

Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 20-26Google Scholar). This caspase-independent pathway is not well understood; its contribution to overall cell death is not known, and the role of Omi as a protease in this pathway is not clear. Furthermore, although the catalytic domain of all HtrAs including Omi protein is conserved fromE. coli to humans, the AVPS tetrapeptide is replaced at least in bovine Omi by SVLG (18Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 22: 436-441Google Scholar). This suggests the IAP binding activity of human HtrA2 that leads to caspase-dependent apoptosis may not be critical to the overall function of Omi. Because the caspase-independent pathway relies on the ability of Omi to function as a protease, it suggests that proteolytic cleavage of specific proteins is involved. This cleavage might inactivate and remove apoptotic inhibitors, or it may activate precursor proteins whose function might be necessary for caspase-independent cell death. In order to investigate the contribution of the proteolytic activity of Omi to its overall pro-apoptotic function, we decided to screen for specific inhibitor(s) of its activity. One such specific inhibitor was identified and called ucf-101. This heterocyclic compound was able to inhibit the proteolytic activity of Omi in vitro in a very specific and reversible manner. The specificity of ucf-101 was tested against a panel of several unrelated serine proteases, and no significant activity was detected. When L56/HtrA1 was used in the same assay, ucf-101 showed specific inhibition against this protease. L56/HtrA1 belongs to the same family of proteases as Omi, and they both share extensive homology throughout their respective catalytic domains (1Faccio L. Fusco C. Chen A. Martinotti S. Bonventre J.V. Zervos A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2581-2588Google Scholar). The normal function of L56/HtrA2 is not known, and unlike Omi that localizes to mitochondria, L56 is secreted (19Hu S.I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Google Scholar). The natural fluorescence of ucf-101 was used to monitor its ability to enter mammalian cells. This property is essential for ucf-101 to be useful for in vivo experiments designed to test inhibition of Omi that is intracellular. To test the ability of ucf-101 to inhibit the proteolytic activity of Omi in vivo, we used an assay where transient overexpression of a cytoplasmic form of Omi induces caspase-independent cell death (7Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Google Scholar). The cells used in this assay were caspase-9 (−/−) null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (17Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Google Scholar) in which overexpression of a cytoplasmic form of Omi can induce the caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis. This form of cell death caused by Omi relies entirely on its ability to function as a protease. Therefore, if ucf-101 blocks the activity of Omi, it will interfere with apoptosis of the caspase-9 (−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. When these fibroblasts were transfected with the vector encoding the cytoplasmic Omi and treated with ucf-101, apoptosis was dramatically reduced. ucf-101, like many known protease inhibitors, was cytotoxic to mammalian cells when used at high concentrations. Therefore, the ability of ucf-101 to inhibit caspase-independent apoptosis at low doses was compromised by its cytotoxicity at higher doses. This toxicity was seen only at high concentrations of the chemical and does not exclude its use in in vivo experiments where it exhibits activity against Omi at much lower concentrations. ucf-101 will be a useful tool to elucidate the role of Omi in caspase-independent cell death. Several clinical conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases, show excessive caspase-independent cell death (20Kitanaka C. Kuchino Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 508-515Google Scholar, 21Sperandio S. de Belle I. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14376-14381Google Scholar). If Omi through its proteolytic activity plays a role in the pathogenesis of any of these clinical conditions, ucf-101 or a similar compound would be useful for therapeutic intervention against untimely or excessive cell death. We are grateful to the members of the Zervos lab and Patrice Connel for comments, suggestions, and critical reading of the manuscript. The excellent technical assistance of Petra Baums and Claudia Burkhart is appreciated. We also thank R. Crowl for the L56/HtrA1 cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2080886563,"In addition to its well known role in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation, ubiquitin (Ub) is also involved in promoting internalization of cell surface proteins into the endocytic pathway. Moreover, putative Ub interaction motifs (UIMs) as well as Ub-associated (UBA) domains have been identified in key yeast endocytic proteins (the epsins Ent1 and Ent2, and the Eps15 homolog Ede1). In this study, we characterized the interaction of Ub with the Ede1 UBA domain and with the UIMs of Ent1. Our data suggest that the UIMs and the UBA are involved in binding these proteins to biological membranes. We also show that the Ent1 ENTH domain binds to phosphoinositides in vitro and that Ent1 NPF motifs interact with the EH domain-containing proteins Ede1 and Pan1. Our findings indicate that the ENTH domain interaction with membrane lipids cooperates with the binding of membrane-associated Ub moieties. These events may in turn favor the occurrence of other interactions, for instance EH-NPF recognition, thus stabilizing networks of low affinity binding partners at endocytic sites.

It is an effective way to control the composition of the plasma membrane, and thus the physiological responses of the cell, so it is a tightly regulated pathway. Many cytosolic proteins are required for the early stages of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, including the adaptor protein complex AP2, the coat protein clathrin, and more recently, a class of proteins called accessory factors (1Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 2Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Because accessory factors interact with AP2 and are required for endocytosis, but are not enriched in purified clathrin-coated vesicles, they have been suggested to play a regulatory rather than a structural role in clathrin-coated vesicle formation (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions, interactions, and order of operation of most accessory factors have not yet been determined. One accessory factor of interest to many investigators is the protein epsin, which is conserved from yeast to humans. Rat epsin 1 (Eps15 interactor 1) was first identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a protein that binds to another endocytic accessory factor, Eps15 (4Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Epsin and eps15 are localized to endocytic sites at the plasma membrane and interact directly through the Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) tripeptide motifs of epsin binding to theEps15 homology (EH)1 domains of Eps15 (4Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The yeast epsins Ent1 and Ent2 were similarly identified as binding partners of the EH domain-containing endocytic protein Pan1 (5Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Several independent lines of evidence have indicated an important role for epsin in the internalization step of endocytosis. First, overexpressing fragments of epsin in cultured cells inhibits internalization of ligands such as transferrin and epidermal growth factor (4Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 7Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5915-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Second, mutation of the yeast epsins results in growth defects and reduced internalization of plasma membrane lipids and proteins (6Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Watson H.A. Cope M.J. Groen A.C. Drubin D.G. Wendland B. Mol. Biol.

Third, Drosophila melanogasterepsin (liquid facets) exhibits genetic interactions with genes encoding other endocytic machinery components (11Cadavid A.L. Ginzel A. Fischer J.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth,in vitro studies show that epsin can stimulate clathrin polymerization into the spherical basket that encases endocytic vesicles (12Kalthoff C. Alves J. Urbanke C. Knorr R. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally, recent work suggests that epsin binding to phospholipids initiates the membrane curvature necessary to form an endocytic vesicle (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Epsins from all species share several features (Fig.1 A), including a conserved epsin amino-terminal homology (ENTH) domain that binds the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), two or three copies of the ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM, Fig.1 A) that binds ubiquitin (Ub), and a carboxyl-terminal region containing numerous short linear peptide sequences that serve as ligands for binding to components of the endocytic machinery such as AP2 (mammalian epsins), EH domains, and clathrin (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 4Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D.

Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To understand the function of such multivalent proteins, it is necessary to characterize the nature of each interaction in isolation as well as in the context of the entire protein, where cooperativity may influence some of its properties. In this study, we have defined the binding partners for each of the characterized domains of the yeast epsin Ent1, using in vitro recombinant protein binding, yeast two hybrid, and immobilized phospholipid binding experiments. The yeast epsins are almost exclusively localized in cortical patches at the plasma membrane (6Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Watson H.A. Cope M.J. Groen A.C. Drubin D.G. Wendland B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3668-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but the cis- and trans-acting components necessary for their membrane association have not been determined. Here we show that Ub covalently attached to transmembrane proteins (often a requirement for internalization; reviewed in Ref. 15Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) or to peripheral membrane proteins mediates the recruitment of Ent1 to membranes. By examining the requirements for recruitment of Ent1 to biological membranes, we have uncovered evidence for cooperativity between the ENTH domain and the UIMs for efficient membrane binding. Other data indicate that the NPF-containing regions of Ent1 also contribute to additional layers of cooperative interactions. Together, our data are consistent with a model in which epsin might function as an endocytic adaptor protein. We suggest that epsin binds PI(4,5)P2-enriched membrane domains where it recruits components of the endocytic machinery and perhaps selects certain ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins for inclusion into endocytic vesicles. The Gal4AD and BD fusion constructs were prepared by ligating the appropriate PCR fragments (digested with BamHI-SalI) into theBamHI-XhoI and BamHI-SalI sites of the pGADT7 (LEU2, Clontech) and pGBT9 (TRP1, Clontech) vectors, respectively. To prepare His6-tagged and GST fusion proteins, cDNAs were subcloned into the pET28a (Novagen) or pGEX-4t-1 (AmershamBiosciences) vectors, respectively. Amino acid substitutions were made using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Murine p53 in pAS2–1 and SV40 large T-antigen in pACT2 were obtained from Clontech. Ubiquitin and the terminal domain of clathrin cloned in pGEX-2t-1 were kindly provided by Dr. Scott Emr's lab (UCSD) and Dr. Peter McPherson (McGill University), respectively. The yeast strain AH 109 (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS- GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS- MEL1TATA-lacZ, Clontech) was maintained on YPD agar plates. Transformations were performed according to the Clontech's Yeast Protocols Handbook. Protein expression was induced inRosetta cells (Novagen) transformed with pET28a- or pGEX-derived constructs by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mmfinal concentration) followed by a 5-h incubation at 30 °C. The cells were harvested, resuspended in TBST (10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and incubated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C and sonicated. The lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorvall centrifuge, and the supernatants were collected. For His6-tagged protein purification, the lysates were incubated in batch with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in the presence of 5 mm imidazole (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The unbound fraction was separated by centrifugation, and the resin containing the bound His6-tagged protein was packed into a disposable polypropylene column (Pierce). The column was washed with TBST/15 mm imidazole, and the protein was then eluted with TBST/150 mm imidazole, and fractions containing the His6-tagged protein were pooled. The imidazole from the His6-tagged protein and the glutathione from the GST fusion protein fractions were eliminated by using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). For GST fusion protein purification, the lysates were incubated in batch with agarose beads coupled to glutathione for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed 4 times with TBST. The beads were then incubated with 20 mm glutathione (Sigma) in TBST for 30 min at room temperature, and the supernatant containing the purified fusion protein was collected.

Dahmus M.E. Callis J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) orpep4Δ cells (MATα leu2–3 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-ho1 suc2Δ9 pep4Δ::LEU2) expressing copper promoter-driven myc-tagged ubiquitin were grown overnight in selective medium to mid-log phase and induced with 0.1m CuSO4 for 3 h. Twenty to fiftyA 600 (1 A 600 nmcorresponds to ∼1–2 × 107 cells) were harvested (200 × g) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in softening solution (Tris, pH 9.4, 1 mm DTT). Cells were harvested and spheroplasted in YPD medium containing 1 msorbitol and 1μl of zymolyase per A 600 for 30 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were washed once, and pellets were Dounce-homogenized in HEPES/KOAc lysis buffer containing 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Homogenates were spun at 300 × g for 5 min, and the resulting pellets were stored at −80 °C before use in membrane-binding experiments. All binding assays were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 10 mm free ubiquitin (Sigma). For GST pull-downs, glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) loaded with either GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with purified His6-tagged recombinant protein. For Ub binding, Ub coupled to agarose beads (Sigma) was incubated with either purified His6-tagged recombinant protein or 35S-labeled in vitrotranscription/translation products. After washing with TBST, bound radiolabeled samples were quantified in a scintillation counter, whereas all other samples were boiled in Laemmli's protein sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using either a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the Ent1 protein (previously described in Ref. 9Watson H.A. Cope M.J. Groen A.C. Drubin D.G. Wendland B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3668-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or an anti-His6 tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Clontech). 35S-Labeled proteins were obtained byin vitro transcription/translation of pET28a constructs using the TNT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) and Easytag expression protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transcription/translation products were diluted 1:100 in TBS, centrifuged (136,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and their specific activity was determined by a conventional trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay (only tracers showing at least 10% incorporation were used for further experiments). The predominance of a single radiolabeled species was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The concentration of radioactive material for different mutants was normalized according to 35S incorporation and the number of methionines present in the corresponding Ent1 truncations. 3–10 × 106 cpm of 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with membrane suspensions prepared from 1A 600 of cells in a total volume of 300 μl, for 1 h at either room temperature or 4 °C, and in the presence or absence of 10 mm purified ubiquitin. After washing, membrane associated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Experiments were conducted in triplicate, and their S.D. was calculated. Slightly different washing procedures resulted in some variability in background between experiments. Another source of variability may be caused by differences in the initial status and in the preservation (from batch to batch and time of storage) of the two major reagents used in these assays: (i) the membrane suspensions (composition of phosphoinositides and ubiquitinated proteins); (ii) the 35S-labeled proteins (concentration of binding-competent species). Each experiment was performed two to four times (as indicated in the corresponding figure legend) and always showed similar trends. Nitrocellulose membranes containing immobilized phospholipids (PIP-Strips membranes, Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT), blocked with TBST with 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), were incubated with purified His6-tagged recombinant protein for 1 h at room temperature. The bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-His6tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Clontech). Anti-Ent1/2 serum was described (9Watson H.A. Cope M.J. Groen A.C. Drubin D.G. Wendland B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3668-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Anti-Ub serum was a gift of Cecile Pickart (The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health). Anti-Ede1 serum was produced in our lab against a peptide and preincubated with extract from ede1Δ cells. It has been shown previously that Ent1 binds Ub via its UIMs (10Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We confirmed and further characterized the specificity of this interaction. In an in vitro pull-down assay, we found that recombinant His6-Ent1 protein bound Ub-agarose beads as assessed by immunodetection of starting and bound material with an anti-His6 antibody (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1and 2). Importantly, this interaction was specifically inhibited by the presence of an excess (10 mm) of free Ub (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). We next investigated whether both UIMs are necessary for the recognition of Ub. Both conserved serines within the Ent1 putative UIMs (Ser177 and Ser201) were mutated to aspartate, glutamate, lysine, arginine, or cysteine residues, which were selected based on random permutation probabilities according to Dayhoff's PAM250 matrix (i.e. the residue substitutions least likely to cause structural perturbation in the protein).35S-labeled His6-Ent1 wild type, single, and double mutants were produced by in vitrotranscription/translation, incubated with Ub-conjugated agarose beads, and bound radioactivity was quantified. Compared with Ent1 WT, all five of the Ent1 UIM double mutants exhibited significantly impaired ubiquitin binding (data not shown), and as demonstrated by the 34% reduction for the S → D double mutant (Fig. 1 C). Also, mutation of a single conserved serine within either UIM decreased the binding of the mutant proteins for Ub-agarose beads by at least 50% (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that the two UIMs cooperate for the interaction of Ent1 with Ub. It has been demonstrated that certain cell-surface transmembrane proteins, such as Ste2 and Ste6, are ubiquitinated as a prerequisite to their internalization (17Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 18Loayza D. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 779-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that these and/or other Ub-modified proteins such as peripheral membrane proteins may act as docking sites for Ub-binding proteins such as Ent1. To test this possibility, we prepared a crude membrane fraction from yeast that contains plasma membrane, which is the major localization site of many endocytic proteins in vivo (Fig. 2 A), including the yeast epsins (6Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We confirmed by Western blotting that these membranes contained an abundance of Ub-conjugated proteins (Fig.2 A), and tested whether these membranes could recruit recombinant His6-Ent1 in a Ub-dependent manner. Purified His6-Ent1 was incubated with a suspension of membranes for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 10 mm free Ub. After washing, the presence of the recombinant protein associated with the membrane pellet was assessed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with an anti-His6 antibody. Our results showed that His6-Ent1 interacts with membranes prepared from either MATa (Fig. 2 B,lane 1) or MATα cells (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). 10 mm free Ub greatly reduced this membrane recruitment (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and4). We also observed that even in cases where our His6-Ent1 preparations contained some protein degradation products (some as abundant as the intact protein), only full-length Ent1 was recruited to the yeast membranes. Additionally, an excess of yeast cytosolic proteins did not compete the interaction (data not shown). To characterize further this membrane association process, we studied the recruitment of Ent1 UIM mutants. For these experiments,35S-labeled in vitro transcription/translation products were incubated with membrane suspensions for 1 h at 4 °C, and after washing, the radioactivity associated with the membrane pellet was quantified. As shown in Fig. 2 C, and consistent with their reduced binding to Ub-agarose, the S → D single and double mutants exhibited at least 50% reduced recruitment to membranes as compared with WT Ent1. We observed reduced membrane binding with all five UIM double mutants (S → D, S → E, S → K, S → R, and S → C), and the reduction was comparable with the binding of WT Ent1 to membranes in the presence of free Ub (ranging from 40% to 60% inhibition, depending on the experiment). The remaining bound material may be nonspecific binding or, alternatively, could represent a Ub-independent component of membrane recruitment (see below). The finding that a single mutation introduced into either the first or second UIM of Ent1 was sufficient to drastically decrease the membrane binding capability of the protein is again consistent with cooperative binding of the two UIMs to Ub. We also carried out saturation experiments by incubating increasing concentrations of 35S-labeled Ent1 with a constant amount of membrane in the presence or absence of free Ub (data not shown). Although we were not able to confirm that binding equilibrium was achieved after 1 h at 4 °C, we roughly estimated an avidity dissociation constant of ∼20 μm for each UIM. The ENTH domains of mammalian epsins bind phosphoinositides (7Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar); therefore, we tested whether the Ent1 ENTH domain also interacts with lipids, thus possibly contributing to Ent1 membrane association. Purified His6-tagged proteins plus 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were incubated with nitrocellulose strips containing a variety of immobilized phospholipids. After washing, the bound proteins were detected using an anti-His6 antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence. Both His6-Ent11–454 (full-length) and His6-Ent11–149 (ENTH domain) bound phosphoinositides immobilized onto nitrocellulose (Fig.3 A). As expected, an Ent1 amino-terminal truncation lacking the ENTH domain (Ent1149–454) did not exhibit phospholipid binding activity (Fig. 3 A). It should be noted that, because of the qualitative nature of this binding assay, slight differences observed between full-length and the ENTH domain binding were considered insignificant. Given that the Ent1 ENTH domain binds phosphoinositides and its UIMs bind ubiquitin, we next explored a possible interplay between the UIMs and the ENTH domain for membrane recruitment. To this end, we prepared two Ent1 truncations (see Fig. 1 A), one lacking the first 148 amino acids that comprise the ENTH domain (Ent1149–454, containing both UIMs plus the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein) and another consisting of amino-acids 1–240 (Ent11–240, containing the ENTH domain plus both UIMs and a putative coiled coil region). We assayed the binding of the Ent11–240 and Ent1149–454 truncations at room temperature rather than 4 °C to preserve physiological membrane characteristics such as membrane lipid fluidity. As before, 35S-labeled in vitro transcription/translation products were incubated with membranes, and the membrane-associated radioactivity was quantified. Each Ent1 truncation bound the membranes, consistent with Ub-dependent recruitment. However, we found that Ent11–240 bound membranes to a greater extent than Ent1149–454 (Fig. 3 B). This suggested that, in addition to the UIMs, the ENTH domain also contributed to the membrane recruitment of Ent1. Moreover, we also found that the highly phosphorylated soluble inositol phosphate IP6 (phytic acid) that binds ENTH domains (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 19Saiardi A. Sciambi C. McCaffery J.M. Wendland B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was able to reduce significantly (by 20–40%) some of the membrane recruitment of Ent11–240(Fig. 3 B). In contrast, efficient membrane recruitment of Ent11–240 was still observed on incubation with IS6 (myoinositol hexasulfate) (Fig. 3 B). Membrane recruitment of the Ent1149–454 truncation was the same in the presence of either IP6 or IS6 (Fig.3 B). These results further support the idea that the interaction of the Ent1 ENTH domain with phosphoinositides plays a role in its membrane association. It should be noted that the precise phosphoinositide content of these membranes was not characterized. When studied at 4 °C, both Ent11–240 and Ent1149–454 truncated proteins showed levels of membrane recruitment similar to full-length Ent1 (data not shown), which suggests a predominant role for the UIMs (common to both truncations, see Fig. 1 A) in membrane recruitment at low temperature. It is possible that when the binding to membranes is instead conducted at 4 °C, the ENTH domain interaction with lipids may be disfavored because of membrane rigidity and weakened entropic contributions of the hydrophobic contacts. Taken together, these data suggest that, whereas the contribution of the UIM-Ub interaction to the overall membrane binding is favored at 4 °C, the ENTH domain provides a significant contribution to membrane binding at room temperature, which is more similar to physiological conditions, and may be more akin to what occurs in vivo. Ede1 is an endocytic protein (the yeast homolog of eps15) with a multimodular domain architecture, including 3 EH domains and a UBA domain (14Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3309-3319PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Ede1 UBA domain binds Ub (10Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), 2R. C. Aguilar, H. A. Watson, and B. Wendland, unpublished results. and given that this protein is also found almost exclusively associated with membranes (20Gagny B. Wiederkehr A. Dumoulin P. Winsor B. Riezman H. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3309-3319PubMed Google Scholar),2 we tested whether the Ede1 UBA domain interacts with our membrane preparations similarly to the Ent1 UIMs. As shown in Fig.4 B, the UBA domain of Ede1 (residues 1217–1382) was able to bind biological membranes, and in two independent experiments this recruitment was impaired (≈30% inhibition in the experiments shown) by the presence of free Ub. These experiments required the use of high concentrations of35S-labeled UBA domain and membranes to detect significant binding, which could suggest a weaker interaction than that of the UIM/Ub complex. However, by analogy to the cooperative membrane binding observed among different domains of Ent1, it is possible that full-length Ede1 may bind membranes more efficiently than its UBA domain alone. Ede1 exhibits a cortical patch membrane localization pattern similar to that of yeast epsins (6Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,9Watson H.A. Cope M.J. Groen A.C. Drubin D.G. Wendland B. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2147-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).2 It is possible that Ede1 and Ent1 colocalize through recognition of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Alternatively, they could colocalize through an EH/NPF interaction, because the yeast epsins were originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the EH domains of Pan1 (5Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found that Ent1 is indeed able to interact in a two-hybrid system with Ede1 EH domains, specifically with the third EH domain (EH3), and not the first or second EH domains (Fig.5 A). The carboxyl-terminal Ent1149–454 protein was sufficient to bind the Ede1 EH3 domain, consistent with the NPF motifs being the binding determinants involved in this"

To gain insight into the mechanism(s) for these apparently paradoxical effects, we studied as a model amyloidogenic protein, a dimeric immunoglobulin light chain variable domain. With a range of molar ratios of CR, i.e. r = [CR]/[protein dimer], we investigated the aggregation kinetics, conformation, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and thermal stability of the protein. In addition, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize the thermodynamics of CR binding to the protein. During incubation at 37 °C or during thermal scanning, with CR at r = 0.3, 1.3, and 4.8, protein aggregation was greatly accelerated compared with that measured in the absence of the dye. In contrast, with CR atr = 8.8, protein unfolding was favored over aggregation. The aggregates formed with CR at r = 0 or 0.3 were typical amyloid fibrils, but mixtures of amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates were formed at r = 1.3 and 4.8. CR decreased the apparent thermal unfolding temperature of the protein. Furthermore, CR perturbed the tertiary structure of the protein without significantly altering its secondary structure. Consistent with this result, CR also increased the rate of hydrogen-deuterium exchange by the protein. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that CR binding to the protein was enthalpically driven, indicating that binding was mainly the result of electrostatic interactions. Overall, these results demonstrate that at low concentrations, CR binding to the protein favors a structurally perturbed, aggregation-competent species, resulting in acceleration of fibril formation. At high CR concentration, protein unfolding is favored over aggregation, and fibril formation is inhibited. Because low concentrations of CR can promote amyloid fibril formation, the therapeutic utility of this compound or its analogs to inhibit amyloidoses is questionable.

Numerous in vitro studies have supported the thesis that partially folded protein molecules are the precursors for the nucleation and growth of amyloid fibrils (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

However, it is well established that thermodynamic and conformational stability of native proteins, which are determined by intrinsic or extrinsic factors, are inversely related to their propensity to form amyloid fibrils (4Hurle M.R.

Therefore substantial efforts have been made to discover ligands (which could be used to treat or prevent amyloidoses) that can strongly bind to and stabilize the fully folded, native state of proteins, resulting in inhibition of fibril formation (e.g. 8). Congo red (CR)1 has been the subject of several studies investigating its effects on the formation of fibrils (e.g. 9–13) and is often used diagnostically as a stain for amyloid fibrils (2Serpell L.C.

CR is a symmetrical sulfonated azodye with a hydrophobic center consisting of a biphenyl group spaced between the negatively charged sulfate groups. CR binds to amyloid fibrils to induce a characteristic shift in maximal absorbance from ∼490 to ∼540 nm and an enhanced apple-green birefringence and dichroism under polarized light (14Benditt E.P.

Thus, even the phenomenological effects of CR on protein aggregation and fibrillogenesis appear to be highly variable, and the mechanism(s) underlying these differences have not been determined. There have been studies that document CR binding to native or partially folded states of several different proteins, regardless of their secondary structures (9Caughey B. Brown K. Raymond G.J.

However, there have not been any detailed reports on the effects of CR binding on protein conformation nor on the potential roles that binding-induced structural changes might play in modulation of protein fibrillization by CR. In addition, the driving forces of CR binding to proteins remain controversial, as to whether the binding is caused by hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, or both (18Roterman I.

Recently we showed that CR enhanced amyloid fibril formation by an amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain variable domain (VL), SMA, under high pressure (29Kim Y.-S. Randolph T.W. Stevens F.J.

In the present study, to gain further insight into the mechanism(s) for CR effects on amyloid fibril formation, we characterized (at atmospheric pressure) the aggregation kinetics, conformational changes, and thermal stability of SMA with a range of molar ratios of CR. In addition, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the thermodynamics of CR binding to SMA. Recombinant VL SMA was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by the methods of Wilkins-Stevens et al. (30Wilkins-Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.-L. Berrios- Hammond M. Westholm F.A.

Instead of 5-ml prepacked Econo-Pac Q and S cartridges, High Q and S resins (Bio-Rad) were packed in 1 × 50-cm glass columns (Bio-Rad). Fractions were eluted with an 8× volume (400 ml), 0–900 mm NaCl gradient, collected, and assayed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated to 15–20 mg/ml with a stirred ultracentrifuge cell (Amicon) and a YM3 membrane (Amicon). All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The purity of the protein exceeded 99% based on SDS-PAGE analysis. The purified protein was stored at 4 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, plus 100 mmNaCl buffer (5Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Phani R.P. Poras D. Wilkens-Stevens P. Cai X.

The SMA concentration was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 1.71 mg ml−1 cm−1at 280 nm (30Wilkins-Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.-L. Berrios- Hammond M. Westholm F.A. Murphy C.

Recombinant SMA has the same sequence as the VL that originated from lymph node-derived amyloid fibrils of a patient with immunoglobulin light chain-related amyloidosis (30Wilkins-Stevens P.

The SMA molar concentration was calculated using a dimer molecular mass of 25.5 kDa because the protein dominantly exists as a dimer under the experimental concentrations used in the present study. Throughout the experiments, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, plus 100 mm NaCl buffer (“buffer”) was used. CR (Sigma C6767) solutions were prepared daily in buffer and filtered three times using a 0.45-μm pore size polysulfone filter (Whatman) (29Kim Y.-S. Randolph T.W. Stevens F.J. Carpenter J.F. J.

The CR concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 5.93 × 104mcm−1 at 505 nm after dilution into 40% (v/v) ethanol water (16Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Other chemicals were of reagent or higher grade. Solutions of 40 μm (1 mg/ml) SMA with various molar ratios of CR (r = [CR]/[SMA dimer]),i.e. r = 0, 0.3, 1.3, 4.8, and 8.8, were incubated in buffer, containing 0.05% NaN3, at 37 °C with agitation at 250 rpm in an orbital shaker (6Kim Y.-S.

After centrifugation of the samples (14,000 rpm for 5 min), the supernatants were analyzed by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SEC). The supernatants of the samples were also analyzed on reducing SDS-PAGE with a 12% Tris-HCl ready gel (Bio-Rad). Some samples were analyzed with SEC coupled with a triple detector (model 300TDA Detectors, Viscotek Co.), which monitors light scattering, refractive index, and intrinsic viscosity of proteins. Ovalbumin (Sigma A2512A, grade VI) was used for the calibration of the refractive index and light-scattering detectors and has a molecular mass of 42.7 kDa and refractive index increment with protein concentration (dn/dc) of 0.185 ml/g (31Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Chromatograms were analyzed by the TriSEC 3.0 GPC software (Viscotek Co.) to determine molecular mass, radius of gyration (R g), hydrodynamic radius (R h), and intrinsic viscosity of the samples. CD spectroscopy was performed with an Aviv 62DS spectrometer (Aviv) equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. Far-UV CD spectra (190–260 nm) for 117 μm (2.97 mg/ml) SMA with various molar ratios of CR (r = 0, 1.2, 2.3, 4.8, and 8.8) were collected every 0.5 nm with an averaging time of 5 s at 25 °C in a 0.01-cm path length quartz cuvette. Near-UV CD spectra (260–340 nm) for 40 μm (1 mg/ml) SMA with various molar ratios of CR (r = 0, 1.3, 4.8, and 8.8) were collected every 0.5 nm with an averaging time of 5 s at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. The far- and near-UV CD spectra were collected immediately after mixing the samples. To monitor protein aggregation directly in the sample cell, far-UV CD spectra of SMA (117 μm = 2.97 mg/ml) with various molar ratios of CR (r = 0, 1.3, 4.8, and 8.8) were acquired as described above during isothermal incubations at 37 °C (up to 140 min at 20-min intervals) and during heating from 25 to 60 °C at 5 °C intervals, with a dwell time of ≈25 min at each temperature. For the samples incubated isothermally at 37 °C for 140 min in the CD cell, the induced-CR CD spectrum (400–650 nm) was acquired at 37 °C every 1 nm with an averaging time of 5 s (14Benditt E.P.

The induced-CR CD spectrum (400–650 nm) was also collected at 37 °C for 40 μm native SMA and preformed amyloid fibrils of SMA in the presence of 160 μm CR. For far- and near-UV CD spectra, raw spectra were corrected for the appropriate buffer blank and converted to mean residue ellipticity, [Θ] (deg cm2/dmol) (32Woody R.W.

Thermal unfolding of SMA (4 μm = 0.1 mg/ml) with various molar ratios of CR (r = 0, 1.3, 4.8, and 8.8) was studied by measuring ellipticity at 217 nm during heating from 25 to 80 °C at 1 °C intervals in a 0.1-cm path length cell with an averaging time of 5 s. Values for the midpoint of the transition region, T m, for the unfolding curve for each sample were obtained as described before (6Kim Y.-S. Wall J.S. Meyer J. Murphy C. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C.

To monitor protein aggregation, IR spectra for 0.7 mm (16 mg/ml) SMA with various molar ratios of CR (r = 0, 1.3, and 2.8) were recorded at 37 °C as a function of time. The temperature was controlled by circulating ethylene glycol around a custom made IR cell holder and was measured by a thermal couple probe, inserted into a depression in the cell. Protein aggregation was monitored by following band intensity at 1627.8 cm−1 in the second derivative amide I spectra, which is indicative of intermolecular β-sheet (33Dong A. Prestrelski S.J.

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HX) was initiated by mixing 1 volume of protein stock solution (1.6 mm = 40 mg/ml in H2O buffer) with 3 volumes of 100% D2O buffer containing an appropriate CR concentration to give a final protein concentration of 0.4 mm (10 mg/ml) SMA with various molar ratios of CR (r = 0, 0.02, 1.3, and 1.9) in 75% D2O buffer. Samples were immediately placed in a liquid IR cell (P/N20500, Specac) with CaF2 windows separated by a 12-μm polypropylene spacer (Chemplex Industries). A time-dependent series of spectra was acquired at 25 °C. The time from the sample preparation to acquisition of the first spectrum was about 90 s. HX was monitored by the shift in the frequency of the second derivative amide I band, which was at 1,639 cm−1 in spectra for the proteins in H2O, as a function of the length of time of exposure to 75% D2O buffer (6Kim Y.-S.

The thermodynamics of CR binding to SMA were measured using an isothermal titration microcalorimeter (VP-ITC, MicroCal Inc.) (35Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). The samples were thoroughly degassed before each titration. The experiments were performed at 25 °C with 20.1 μm (0.5 mg/ml) SMA in the sample cell and 760 μm CR in the titrant syringe, at 25 °C with 32.3 μm (0.8 mg/ml) SMA and 1,036 μm CR, and at 30 °C with 20.1 μm (0.5 mg/ml) SMA and 760 μm CR. The sample in the cell was stirred at 300 rpm by the syringe, and 10 μl of titrant was delivered over 20 s with 180-s intervals between injections to allow complete equilibration. The data were collected automatically and subsequently analyzed by Origin software from MicroCal, Inc. Before the curve-fitting process, a background titration, consisting of the identical CR solution but only the buffer solution in the sample cell, was subtracted from each experimental titration to account for the heat of dilution (35Wiseman T.

Notch-1 induction is achieved at the transcriptional level and requires both the SV40 large T-antigen and the small t-antigen. Notch-1 upregulation is maintained in SV40-transformed human mesothelial clones and in SV40-positive mesotheliomas and derived cell lines. Activation of Notch-1 promotes cell cycle progression and it is required for the growth of SV40-transformed mesothelial cells. Our finding is relevant to the process of SV40-mediated human cell transformation, an effect that cannot be accounted for solely by SV40-Tag inhibition of Rb and p53."

Horwitz J. Srinivasan A. Ding L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscles and the brain (9Srinivasan A.N. Nagineni C.N. Bhat S.P. J. Biol.

Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for the participation of αB-crystallin and other mammalian sHSP in these pathways includes their phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinases (12Hoover H.E.

Biol. 2000; 99: 431-445PubMed Google Scholar). αB-crystallin is phosphorylated at three serine residues during ischemia and in response to cytotoxic signals and mitogenic and inflammatory agents (16Ito H.

J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1659-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is presumably used to modulate the cellular role of these proteins, the details of which remain unclear. The importance of this role has been highlighted by the identification of an inherited mutation in αB-crystallin that is associated with desmin-related myopathy (18Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In the lens, αB-crystallin phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase is age-related and is induced in response to stress (19Wang K. Gawinowicz M.A. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Ueda Y. Duncan M.K. David L.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of the phosphorylation of mammalian sHSP involve both the oligomeric structure and the chaperone activity. Equilibrium sedimentation analysis and size exclusion chromatography of phosphorylated αB-crystallin and its serine to aspartate mimics reveal a reduction in the size of the oligomer (16Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the effects of phosphorylation on a related mammalian sHSP, HSP27, where the oligomer dissociates to a tetramer (21Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 22Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In several cellular systems, the phosphorylation of both αB-crystallin and HSP27 is accompanied by translocation of these proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (23Macrae T.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On the functional level, phosphorylation of αB-crystallin has been reported to marginally reduce its efficiency in suppressing the aggregation of model substrates in vitro (16Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In these assays, complex formation between αB-crystallin and the substrate is indirectly detected through the reduction in light scattering. Because of the non-equilibrium nature of the assay, it is not always possible to determine the origin of the change in efficiency, i.e.whether it reflects lower affinity or a change in the kinetics of binding and/or scattering by the resulting complex between the substrate protein and phosphorylated αB-crystallin. In general, little mechanistic insight can be obtained from these studies. In a recent study, we reported the equilibrium binding of αA-crystallin to destabilized mutants of T4 lysozyme (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The advantage of these mutants is that they do not aggregate on the time scale of binding and their equilibrium folding constants are in the 104–107 range. The differential binding of αA-crystallin to these mutants suggests recognition of transient excited states. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding curves reveal two different modes of binding. The T4L mutants provide an ideal model system to investigate the effects of αB-crystallin phosphorylation on its binding to non-native proteins and to gain insight into the mechanism of binding. For this purpose, we have constructed five phosphorylation mimics of αB-crystallin consisting of different combinations of serine to aspartate substitutions. The equilibrium binding of these mutants to destabilized T4L reveals a significant increase in the extent of binding in the S/D variants relative to the WT. The increased binding results from higher affinity and the availability of a larger number of binding sites. Given the phosphorylation-induced destabilization of the αB-crystallin oligomeric structure, the results are consistent with the emerging hypothesis that changes in its quaternary structure are required or coupled to the recognition and binding of destabilized protein substrates (25Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Koteiche H.A. Berengian A.R. Mchaourab H.S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The cDNA of mouse αB-crystallin, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), was cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of the plasmid pET-20(b+) (30Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 31Klemenz R. Frohli E. Aoyama A. Hoffmann S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Schafer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 803-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned DNA was verified by DNA sequencing and determined to have an identical DNA sequence to that deposited in GenBankTM under accession numberM63170. Overlap-extension site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the following PCR fragments: S19D, S45D, S59D, S45D/S59D (αB-D2), and S19D/S45D/S59D (αB-D3). The fragments were then digested and subcloned into the pET 20(b+) vector between theNdeI and XhoI sites. All mutant constructs were sequenced to confirm the substitution and the absence of unwanted change. Single-site mutants are named by specifying the original residue, the number of the residue, and the new residue, in that order. The T4L mutants were expressed, purified, and spin-labeled as described previously (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin variant plasmids were used to transform competentEscherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cultures, inoculated from overnight seeds, were grown to midlog phase at 37 °C. Then the temperature was dropped to 34 °C, and the expression of αB variants was induced by the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h of induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0). The resuspended cultures were disrupted by sonication, and the DNA was precipitated by the addition of 0.017% polyethyleneimine. The lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 ×g. αB-crystallin and its single variants were purified using anion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography as described previously (6Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). αB-D2 and αB-D3 were loaded on a Source Q column, washed with buffer A (20 mmTris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and eluted with a gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in buffer A. Ammonium sulfate was added to the eluted anion exchange peak to a final concentration of 1 m, and the sample then was loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose column, washed, and eluted with a 1–0 mammonium sulfate gradient. This step was followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column. Room temperature EPR analysis of spin-labeled T4L was carried out on a Bruker E500 spectrometer equipped with a super high Q cavity. Variable temperature experiments were carried out on a Bruker EMX spectrometer using a TM110 cavity. The temperature of the cavity was maintained using a stream of nitrogen gas. Samples, consisting of 50 μm T4L and varying concentrations of αB-crystallin variants, were incubated at the desired temperature in a water bath for 105 min. They were then loaded in 25-μl glass capillaries and transferred to the EPR cavity 15 min before data collection. A double reciprocal representation of the binding curves was used to emphasize the difference between isotherms arising from a single set of independent binding sites versus those arising from at least two such sets. The former is expected to result in a linear curve whereas the latter leads to curved isotherms. Using the appropriate equations, both simulations and curve-fitting were performed using the program Origin (OriginLab Inc.). For non-linear least squares fits, the Levenberg-Marquart method was used. Simulations were based on the optimum overlay with the data. To investigate the recognition and binding steps involved in sHSP chaperone function, a set of destabilized T4L mutants was constructed, the ΔG unf of which span the 5–10 kcal/mol range (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Matthews B.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The rationale was that progressive destabilization of a substrate protein will lead to the formation of a stable complex with the chaperone without the need for the extreme denaturing conditions used in previous assays. Because T4L binding occurs under conditions that strongly favor the native state, the threshold for binding is then a reflection of the free energy balance between association with the chaperone and refolding from the non-native state recognized. Complex formation is directly detected using fluorescent or paramagnetic probes in contrast to the indirect detection using light scattering in aggregation assays. The probes are introduced at non-destabilizing sites in T4L via cysteine mutagenesis followed by reaction with the appropriate reagent. In a previous report, we demonstrated the binding of T4L mutants to the lens chaperone αA-crystallin (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To explore the effect of phosphorylation on the chaperone activity of αB-crystallin, the following mutants were constructed: S19D, S45D, S59D, S45D/S59D (αB-D2), and S19D/S45D/S59D (αB-D3). All mutants form oligomeric structures as deduced from size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The elution volumes of the single and double aspartate mutants are indistinguishable from that of the WT. In contrast, the elution volume of αB-D3 is larger, presumably reflecting its smaller molecular mass as reported previously (16Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism analysis of this variant revealed secondary and tertiary structures similar to the WT (16Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because αB-D3 is a combination of the single Ser to Asp substitutions, it is logical to assume that the single mutants have intact static structures at the level of a single subunit. Table I summarizes the thermodynamic characteristics of the spin-labeled T4L mutants used in this study. All reported ΔG unf values were obtained from non-linear least squares fit of guanidine HCl-unfolding curves as described previously (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The T4L mutants contained a cysteine residue at the solvent-exposed site 151 in helix J, which allows the attachment of a nitroxide spin label according to Scheme FS1.Table IΔGunf of the T4L mutants obtained from denaturant unfolding curves at various pH values and temperaturesΔG unfT4L mutants23 °CpH 7.2pH 7.2pH 8.030 °C37 °Ckcal/molkcal/molWT14.3 ± 1.513.3 ± 1.0D70N9.2 ± 0.69.6 ± 0.57.8 ± 0.86.8 ± 0.4L99A7.9 ± 0.76.9 ± 0.86.5 ± 0.35.3 ± 0.7L99A/A130S6.6 ± 0.55.6 ± 0.44.7 ± 0.33.8 ± 0.3L99A/F153A4.2 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Incubation of 50 μm T4L mutants with a 10-fold molar excess of WT αB-crystallin at 23 °C, pH 7.2, results in a small fraction of bound T4L such that it is not possible to construct binding isotherms. In contrast, under the same conditions αB-D3 binds extensively to all mutants except for the most stable, D70N. The fraction of bound T4L is deduced from the change in the EPR spectral line shape of the mutant in the presence of the chaperone (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig.1 a compares the binding isotherms of L99A and L99A/A130S αB-D3. Both curves are linear and can be fit to the equation, 1/r=(KDa/n)×1/L+1/nEquation 1 where r is the ratio of bound T4L to total α-crystallin, L is the fraction of free native state T4L,n is the number of binding sites, andK Da is the dissociation constant. TableII lists the number of binding sites and the corresponding dissociation constants obtained for the two mutants. Because αB-crystallin does not recognize the native state of T4L, the resulting K Da is an apparent dissociation constant. It differs from the intrinsic dissociation constant by a unitless equilibrium constant that characterizes the transition from the native state to the state recognized by the chaperone. Thus, the higher K Da for L99A relative to L99A/A130S, reported in Table II, presumably reflects the higher stability of the native state of the former. The number of available binding sites is similar in the range of 0.4–0.5 T4L per αB-D3 subunit.Table IIStoichiometries and dissociation constants of T4L binding to αB-D3 at pH 7.2, 23 °CT4L mutantnK Da(μm)L99A0.413L99A/A130S0.485.8 Open table in a new tab The isotherm of the most destabilized mutant, L99A/F153A, shown in Fig.1 b appears also to be linear. However, the intercept is significantly smaller reflecting an apparent increase in the number of binding sites. One interpretation of this isotherm is that L99A/F153A binds through a single but different mode than L99A with n≅ 2. An alternative interpretation, based on the two-mode binding of αA-crystallin (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), is that binding occurs through two sets of independent binding sites. The dashed curve superimposed on Fig. 1 b is a numerical simulation withK Da1 = 8 μm,K Da2 = 40 μm,n 1 = 0.6, and n 2 = 1.2. The choice of n 1 andn 2 is justified by the results presented below (Fig. 5). In either case, this result implies that a second mode for binding of L99A/F153A is available presumably because of the conformation of the transient state(s) populated at this value of ΔG unf. It should be noted that the overall fold of the native state of this mutant, determined by x-ray crystallography, is similar to that of L99A (33Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 747-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The presence of two modes of binding is revealed more directly in the binding isotherms at pH 8. Similar to αA-crystallin, increased pH results in significant changes in the binding properties of αB-crystallin (24Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in the pH titration of the binding of T4L-D70N to αB-D3 shown in Fig.2. Despite the lack of change in the ΔG unf of D70N in the 6–8 pH range (34Anderson D.E. Becktel W.J. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), the fraction of bound T4L increases significantly with increasing pH. The origin of the increase in the bound fraction can be gleaned from quantitative analysis of the binding isotherm of L99A/A130S at pH 8.0 shown in Fig. 3. The curved isotherm of this mutant, bound in a single mode at pH 7.2, reflects the presence of two sets of binding sites characterized by different affinities, referred to as binding modes. The first, a high affinity/low capacity mode, has a number of binding sites similar to that obtained at pH 7.2 but a significantly higher affinity. The second has a higher number of binding sites but a lower affinity. The superimposed solid line is a numerical simulation based on the equation describing binding to two sets of independent binding sites, 1/(rt)=1/(r1+r2)Equation 2 where r t is the ratio of total T4L bound to αB-crystallin and r i is the ratio of T4L bound at site i to αB-crystallin given by Equation 1. The parameters used for this simulation are reported in TableIII.Table IIIStoichiometries and dissociation constants of T4L-L99A/130S binding to αB-crystallin variants at pH 8.0, 23 °CαB variantsnK DaμmαB-S19D0.4820αB-S45D0.5515αB-S59D0.6564αB-D2BiphasicBiphasicαB-D3n 1 = 0.4,n 2 = 1.0K D1 = 0.5,K D2 = 23 Open table in a new tab The increased extent of binding at pH 8.0 allows a comparative analysis of the binding properties of αB-crystallin phosphorylation analogs. Fig. 4 compares the binding isotherms of these variants to the same T4L mutant L99A/A130S. Because of the increased binding, the αB-D2 isotherm is shown separately in Fig.4 b along with that of αB-D3. The curves for WT αB-crystallin and the single serine to aspartate variants are all linear suggesting predominant binding at the high affinity sites. The decrease in the slope indicates increased affinity whereas the similar intercept implies a similar number of available sites. Thus, Fig. 4demonstrates that the S45D substitution is the most effective among the single substitution in increasing the affinity (Table III). It is noted that the determination of the number of binding sites of WT αB-crystallin is inherently unreliable due to the weak binding and the resulting accessible ranges of 1/L and 1/r. The combination of S45D and S59D (αB-D2) results in incipient curving of the binding isotherm indicating a contribution from the low affinity mode. A parallel set of experiments, carried out with L99A as the substrate, leads to similar conclusions (data not shown). To determine whether the differences between αB and its phosphorylation analogs persist under physiological temperatures, binding isotherms were obtained at 37 °C. Fig. 5 a shows the binding isotherm of L99A to αB-D3 at this temperature. The data do not conform to the linear behavior expected for independent equivalent binding sites (Equation 1). Therefore, a non-linear least squares fit to Equation 2 was performed resulting in the superimposed solid line of Fig. 5. The corresponding parameters obtained from this fit are reported in Table IV. Because of the decrease in the stability of L99A at 37 °C relative to 23 °C, binding by the high affinity mode is expected to increase. Furthermore, the curvature suggests that the reduction in ΔG unf is sufficient to activate the low affinity mode similar to L99A/F153A at 23 °C (Fig.1 b).Table IVStoichiometries and dissociation constants of T4L-D70N binding to αB-crystallin variants at 37 °CT4L-70NT4L-99A at pH 7.2pH 7.2pH 8.0nK DanK DanK DaμmμmμmαB-S59D0.5316αB-D3n 1= 0.4,K D1= 0.5,n 1= 0.5,K D1 = 0.17,n 1 = 0.6,K D1 = 0.16,n 2 = 0.8 (1.1)K D2 = 103 (151)n 2 = 1.1K D2 = 21n 2 = 1.3K D2 = 22.5 Open table in a new tab However, the increase in the extent of binding cannot be attributed solely to the change in ΔG unf of L99A. Fig.5 b shows the binding isotherm of D70N at 37 °C where it has a ΔG unf similar to L99A/A130S at 23 °C. Comparison of the 1/r values at similar 1/Lindicates a higher extent of binding for D70N. The incipient curving of the isotherm of this mutant reflects an activation of the second mode of binding at 37 °C and not 23 °C. Furthermore, the affinity of the low capacity mode increases by almost an order of magnitude (TablesII and IV). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that activation of binding at high temperature is partly associated with changes in the binding characteristics of αB-D3. At 37 °C, the extent of binding of T4L by αB-crystallin phosphorylation analogs is higher than the WT. Fig.6 compares the binding isotherms of WT-αB, S59D, and αB-D3 to D70N at pH 8. The decrease in the slope of the S59D isotherm relative to the WT indicates increased affinity, assuming that a similar number of sites are available. The three Ser to Asp substitutions result in a significant increase in the amount of T4L bound per αB-crystallin subunit as a consequence of the activation of the second mode of binding (Table IV). It is noted that comparison of the isotherms of D70N in Figs. 5 and 6 indicates that binding is also pH-activated at 37 °C. To develop a mechanistic understanding of the chaperone activity of sHSP, it is central to determine whether conformational changes occur during or as a control of recognition and binding. Because the phosphorylation of mammalian sHSP has been associated with changes in their oligomeric assembly (16Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol.

The main conclusion of this study is that phosphorylation of αB-crystallin results in a significant enhancement of its binding to non-native states of T4L. The activation occurs in the single phosphorylation analogs that tend to be the predominant form physiologically, in particular at residue Ser-45 (16Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D.

https://openalex.org/W1991951536,"The chromosomal translocation specifically linked to the Ewing sarcoma family results in the generation of fusion proteins comprising the amino terminal portion of EWS and the DNA-binding domain of ets transcription factors. The EWS/ets chimeric proteins act as aberrant transcription factors leading to tumorigenic processes. We searched for genes specifically activated in Ewing sarcoma cells but not in other tumor cell lines using the gene array technique, and found significantly enhanced expression of the Id2 gene. High levels of Id2 transcripts were detected in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and tumor tissues. The EWS/ets chimeric proteins activated the Id2 gene via the 5′-upstream promoter sequence. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation revealed a direct interaction of EWS/Fli-1 with the promoter regions of the Id2, TGF-β type II receptor, cyclin D1, and c-myc genes. Since EWS/Fli-1 transactivates c-myc, a cooperative action of the chimeric protein and c-myc leads to overexpression of Id2. In the present study, we suggest that Id2 is a target of the chimeric proteins and that the c-myc/Id2 pathway plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenic processes provoked by EWS/ets proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2037372389,"We have shown that the age-associated increase in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages (Mφ) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production is because of ceramide-induced up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 transcription that leads to increased COX-2 expression and enzyme activity. To determine the mechanism of the age-related and ceramide-dependent increase in COX-2 transcription, we investigated the role of various transcription factors involved in COX-2 gene expression. The results showed that LPS-initiated activations of both consensus and COX-2-specific NF-κB, but not AP-1 and CREB, were significantly higher in Mφ from old mice than those from young mice. We further showed that the higher NF-κB activation in old Mφ was because of greater IκB degradation in the cytoplasm and p65 translocation to the nucleus. An IκB phosphorylation inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, inhibited NF-κB activation, as well as PGE2 production, COX activity, COX-2 protein, and mRNA expression in both young and old Mφ. Similar results were obtained by blocking NF-κB binding activity using a NF-κB decoy. Furthermore, NF-κB inhibition resulted in significantly greater reduction in PGE2 production and COX activity in old compared with young Mφ. Addition of ceramide to the young Mφ, in the presence or absence of LPS, increased NF-κB activation in parallel with PGE2 production. Bay 11-7082 or NF-κB decoy prevented this ceramide-induced increase in NF-κB binding activity and PGE2 production. These findings strongly suggest that the age-associated and ceramide-induced increase in COX-2 transcription is mediated through higher NF-κB activation, which is, in turn, because of a greater IκB degradation in old Mφ.

The age-associated dysregulation in macrophages (Mφ)1contributes to the impaired T cell function with aging. We, as well as others, have demonstrated that immune cells, including Mφ, from old animals and humans produced more PGE2 than those from their young counterparts (3Bartocci A. Maggi F.M. Welker R.D.

Sci. 1980; 27: 159-166Google Scholar). We further showed that the increased PGE2 production by Mφ contributes to the decline in T cell-mediated function with aging (8Beharka A.A. Wu D. Han S.N. Meydani S.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 93: 59-77Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to PG endoperoxide (PGH2), which is further converted to different PGs and thromboxane. COX is hence a key factor in PG synthesis. Two isoforms of COX have been identified: a constitutive form, COX-1 (9DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1412-1416Google Scholar, 10Merlie J.P. Fagan D. Mudd J. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3550-3553Google Scholar), and the inducible counterpart, COX-2 (11Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S.

A. 1991; 88: 2692-2696Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the age-associated increase in Mφ PGE2 production is because of higher COX activity in Mφ from old mice compared with those from young mice. This increased COX activity is, in turn, a result of increased expression of COX-2 protein and mRNA (13Hayek M.G. Mura C.V. Wu D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2445-2451Google Scholar). In a recent study, we further demonstrated that the age-related increase in COX-2 mRNA was because of a higher level of ceramide in old Mφ compared with those of young, which induced up-regulation of COX-2 transcription (14Claycombe K.J. Wu D. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Palmer H. Beharka A. Paulson E. Meydani S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30784-30791Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that the effect of ceramide was not mediated through components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or p38 (14Claycombe K.J. Wu D. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Palmer H. Beharka A. Paulson E. Meydani S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30784-30791Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism of the age-related and ceramide-induced increase in COX-2 transcription, we investigated the role of various nuclear transcription factors that are involved in COX-2 gene expression. The binding sites for several nuclear transcription factors, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), nuclear factor interleukin-6, and cAMP-responsive element (CRE), have been identified on the promoter region of the COX-2 gene (15Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar, 16Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar, 17Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Google Scholar). A number of studies have suggested that NF-κB activation and binding to its cognate site on the COX-2 promoter region are required to induce COX-2 expression (16Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar, 18Hwang D. Jang B.C. Yu G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Google Scholar, 19Newton R. Kuitert L.M.E. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Google Scholar). Dysregulation of NF-κB activation has been indicated in certain inflammatory diseases (20Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Google Scholar, 21Neurath M.F. Becker C. Barbulescu K. Gut. 1998; 43: 856-860Google Scholar, 22Miagkov A.V. Kovalenko D.V. Brown C.E. Didsbury J.R. Cogswell J.P. Stimpson S.A. Baldwin A.S. Makarov S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13859-13864Google Scholar), in which COX-2-catalyzed prostaglandin production may play an important role. It is thus feasible that the age-associated increase in COX-2 expression may be mediated through a corresponding change in the regulation of NF-κB with aging. However, to date, age-related changes in Mφ NF-κB activity and the role of NF-κB in age-related up-regulation of COX-2 have not been demonstrated. Along with NF-κB, another redox-sensitive transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), has been shown to be involved in COX-2 transcriptional regulation (23Poligone B. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38658-38664Google Scholar, 24Subbaramaiah K. Lin D.T. Hart J.C. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12440-12448Google Scholar). Although an independent AP-1 binding site has not been recognized on the COX-2 promoter, it was reported that the binding site for AP-1 in the COX-2 promoter is a CRE binding site (15Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar, 24Subbaramaiah K. Lin D.T. Hart J.C. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12440-12448Google Scholar, 25von Knethen A. Brune B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1532-1540Google Scholar). A number of studies suggest that binding of nuclear proteins, such as CRE-binding protein (CREB) and c-Jun, to CRE, an element of COX-2 promoter, induces COX-2 transcription (26Caivano M. Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Google Scholar, 27Mestre J.R. Rivadeneira D.E. Mackrell P.J. Duff M. Stapleton P.P. Mack-Strong V. Maddali S. Smyth G.P. Tanabe T. Daly J.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 147-151Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the roles of NF-κB, AP-1, and CREB in the age-associated up-regulation of Mφ COX-2 transcription. Our recent study showed that the intracellular concentration of ceramide was higher in LPS-stimulated Mφ of old mice compared with those of young mice and that this increased level of ceramide mediates the age-associated up-regulation of COX-2 transcription (14Claycombe K.J. Wu D. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Palmer H. Beharka A. Paulson E. Meydani S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30784-30791Google Scholar). Whereas the effect of ceramide on regulation of transcription factors has not been well defined, previous studies showed that ceramide induced AP-1 (28Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Google Scholar) and NFκB activation (29Majumdar S. Lamothe B. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2644-2651Google Scholar). We hypothesize that up-regulated COX-2 transcription with aging is because of altered activation of transcription factors involved in COX-2 expression by ceramide. We demonstrate here that of the three transcription factors studied, only NF-κB contributes to the age-associated up-regulation of COX-2. The age-associated increase in NF-κB activation is because of enhanced IκB degradation in the cytoplasm, resulting in increased nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB. Ceramide induces increased COX-2 activation and the consequent PGE2 production through up-regulating NF-κB activation. Specific pathogen-free male young (4–6 months) and old (22–24 months) C57BL/6NIA mice were obtained from National Institute on Aging colonies at Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI). Mice exhibiting skin lesions, visible tumors, or splenomegaly were excluded from the study. Mice were housed individually in microisolator cages at a constant temperature (23 °C) with a 12-h light-dark cycle and were fed autoclaved mouse chow Harlan 7012 (Harlan Teklad) and waterad libitum. All conditions and handling of the animals was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Jean Mayer Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, and were in accordance with guidelines provided by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were injected per peritoneum with 3 ml of 2.98% thioglycollate to elicit Mφ. Three days later, the mice were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation. Peritoneal exudate cells were obtained by peritoneal lavage with cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2% fetal bovine serum. Peritoneal exudates were enriched for Mφ by their adherence to tissue culture-treated plastic dishes or plates for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by vigorous washing and the remaining cells were at least 90% macrophages as assessed by the expression of cell surface markers Mac-1 and F4/80. Cells were monitored for their general condition and viability throughout the study as assessed by morphology, adherence, and trypan blue exclusion. No cytotoxicity was observed in treated cells compared with untreated controls. We previously conducted a number of studies using resident macrophages (8Beharka A.A. Wu D. Han S.N. Meydani S.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 93: 59-77Google Scholar, 13Hayek M.G. Mura C.V. Wu D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2445-2451Google Scholar, 30Wu D. Mura C.

Med. 2002; 32: 503-511Google Scholar). Because of a large number of Mφ that were necessary for various experiments and the limited number of resident Mφ obtainable from each mouse, we used thioglycollate-elicited Mφ. Prior to use of thioglycollate in our experiments, we compared the magnitude and pattern of responsiveness between resident and thioglycollate-elicited Mφ. Although there are differences between the two types of cells in their ability to response to certain stimulation agents, the relative response pattern, the age-related difference, as well as the response to in vitro intervention are the same between these two cell types. Particularly and of relevance to this study, thioglycollate-elicited Mφ showed the age-associated difference in COX-2 expression similar to that observed with resident Mφ (8Beharka A.A. Wu D. Han S.N. Meydani S.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 93: 59-77Google Scholar,13Hayek M.G. Mura C.V. Wu D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2445-2451Google Scholar, 30Wu D. Mura C. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C661-C668Google Scholar). Mφ (2 × 107) in a 10-cm dish were incubated overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were washed and then stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4, Sigma) at 5 μg/ml for various lengths of time. This concentration of LPS was used because our testing experiments indicated it to be optimal for production of PGE2 and nitric oxide. A parallel experiment was conducted using IL-1β (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 50 ng/ml as stimulator. For the NF-κB inhibition study, the cells were preincubated with an inhibitor of IκB-α phosphorylation, Bay 11-7082 (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 30 min, or a NF-κB decoy (see “NF-κB Decoy Approach” below) for 24 h before LPS stimulation. To increase intracellular ceramide levels, cell-permeable C2-ceramide (30 μm) (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA) was added to the cell cultures with or without the presence of LPS and the cells were incubated for different times. The concentration of 30 μm was chosen based on our previous study in which different doses of ceramide were used and shown to induce an efficient COX-2 expression and PGE2 production at this level (14Claycombe K.J. Wu D. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Palmer H. Beharka A. Paulson E. Meydani S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30784-30791Google Scholar). At the end of the stimulation period, the cells were washed with cold PBS and then collected with a cell scraper. The cells were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After the cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 1 min, the supernatants were collected as a cytosolic fraction and stored at −70 °C. The remaining pellets were resuspended in a high salt buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) and incubated in rotation at 4 °C for 30 min. The nuclear lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected as a nuclear fraction and stored at −70 °C. For the NF-κB binding activity assay, both consensus and COX-2 promoter-specific sequences were used. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an NF-κB consensus sequence (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG C-3′) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). A COX-2-specific NF-κB binding oligonucleotide (distal, −408/−388, 5′-GAGGTGAGGGGATTCCCTTAG-3′) and its complementary sequence were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility laboratory and were annealed before labeling. For AP-1 and CREB binding assays, the double-stranded consensus oligonucleotides (AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ and CREB, 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) were purchased from Promega. All the oligonucleotides were end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). 32P-Labeled probes were purified using MicroSpin™ G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). For each reaction, nuclear extracts (2 μg of protein) were incubated with labeled oligonucleotide in the presence of binding buffer (Promega) at room temperature for 20 min. To ensure specificity of probe binding, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled (cold) and mutant oligonucleotides were added to the nuclear samples and incubated for 10 min before the labeled oligonucleotide was added. In supershift assays, antibodies specific for the p65 or p50 subunit of NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the binding reaction and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before the labeled oligonucleotide was added. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved at 350 V for 1 h in 4% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using Kodak x-ray film. Bands were quantified by ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The cytosolic and nuclear samples were prepared as described under “Preparation of Cytosolic and Nuclear Extracts” and were used for IκB-α and p65 detection, respectively. For COX-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) detection, Mφ were preincubated with or without Bay 11-7082 for 30 min and then stimulated by LPS (5 μg/ml) for 16 h. Total cellular lysates were collected and 25 μg of protein from each sample was electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight, the membranes were incubated with the respective antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The membranes were rinsed and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) for 1 h. After being rinsed, the membrane was incubated in a Chemiluminescent Detection System (Tropix) for 4 min and then exposed to film. The equal loading across the samples was first estimated by staining the membranes with Ponceau S (Sigma) and further confirmed by reprobing the stripped membranes with β-actin antibody (Sigma). All bands were quantified by ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech). The bands of interest molecules were normalized with β-actin bands and presented as relative density ratio. Peritoneal Mφ (1 × 106 cells/well) were plated to 24-well plates and isolated by adherence as described above. The cells were preincubated with or without Bay 11-7082 for 30 min before being stimulated by 5 μg/ml LPS (Sigma), 30 μm ceramide (Matreya), or both for 12 to 24 h. After the supernatants were removed and stored at −70 °C for analysis of accumulated production of PGE2, the cells were layered with 1 ml of medium containing 30 μm AA and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min for determination of COX activity as described by Fu et al. (32Fu J.-Y. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Raz A. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16737-16740Google Scholar). Total cellular COX activity can be measured by adding excess exogenous AA to Mφ, because the intracellular enzyme pool is saturated with the substrate and is functioning at maximal velocity. After 10 min, 2.1 mm aspirin was added to inactivate the COX enzyme activity. Supernatants were immediately removed and stored at −70 °C. Cells were then incubated with 1m NaOH for 5 min, at which time the supernatant was removed and stored at −20 °C for protein analysis by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). PGE2 was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described (4Hayek M.G. Meydani S.N. Meydani M. Blumberg J.B. J. Gerontol. 1994; 49: B197-B207Google Scholar). Mφ were preincubated with or without Bay 11-7082 for 30 min and then stimulated by LPS (5 μg/ml) for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using the Totally RNA Isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to first-strand cDNA using random hexamer, and amplified by PCR using the Superscript amplification kit (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions for COX-2 mRNA were 1 cycle for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C and 5 min at 55 °C. Mouse exon 8 sense primer (5′-ACTCACTCAGTTTGTTGAGTCATTC-3′) and exon 10 antisense primer (5′-GTAATTGGGATGTCATGATTAGTTT-3′) were used to generate 583-bp PCR products. To normalize the COX-2 mRNA reverse transcriptase-PCR results, 18 S rRNA primers and the competitors at a ratio of 4:6 (Ambion) were used to generate 18 S rRNA PCR products from the same cDNA samples used in COX-2 mRNA PCR assays. Our PCR conditions for both murine COX-2 mRNA and 18 S rRNA were tested to be within the linear range of PCR product formation (14Claycombe K.J. Wu D. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Palmer H. Beharka A. Paulson E. Meydani S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30784-30791Google Scholar). The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in an ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gel and the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and quantified using ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech). The COX-2-specific NF-κB binding oligonucleotide (distal, 5′-GAGGTGAGGGGATTCCCTTAG-3′) and its complementary sequence (5′-CTAAGGGAATCCCCTCACCTC-3′), and their mutated counterparts (5′-GAGGTGAGGGCCTTCCCTTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAAGGGAAGGCCCTCACCTC-3′) were custom synthesized by Qiagen Operon (Alameda, CA). The underlined letters denote phosphorothioated bases and the bold letters mark mutations. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to double strands by heating at 90 °C for 5 min and then cooling down to room temperature within 3 h. To be efficiently delivered to the cells, the double-stranded oligonucleotides were mixed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The complex was then added to the cell cultures at 0.5 to 10 nm for oligonucleotides and 5 μg/ml for LipofectAMINE reagent. The cells were incubated in antibiotics and serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h, after which the cells were washed and then stimulated for varied times depending on the purpose. Data were analyzed using SYSTAT statistical software (SYSTAT 10, 2000; Evanston, IL). Paired Student'st test was used to determine the effect of incubation time and inhibitor. The difference between two age groups was assessed using nonpaired Student's t test. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significance was set at p < 0.05. We previously showed that the age-associated increase in PGE2 production is because of the ceramide-induced up-regulation of COX-2 transcription with aging (14Claycombe K.J. Wu D. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Palmer H. Beharka A. Paulson E. Meydani S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30784-30791Google Scholar). Of the transcription factors found in the promoter region of the COX-2 gene, NF-κB is the most intensively studied and several investigations have linked its activity to the activation of the COX-2 gene (16Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar, 18Hwang D. Jang B.C. Yu G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Google Scholar). Although the age-related up-regulation of NF-κB activation has been shown in rat gastric mucosa (33Xiao Z.Q. Majumdar A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G855-G865Google Scholar), kidney (34Kim H.J. Kim K.W. Yu B.P. Chung H.Y. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 683-692Google Scholar), liver, heart (35Helenius M. Hanninen M. Lehtinen S.K. Salminen A. Biochem.

Lett. 1997; 225: 61-64Google Scholar), its binding activity in Mφ, a major source of PGE2, has not been compared between young and old animals. In this study, the peritoneal Mφ from young and old mice were stimulated with LPS for different times as indicated in Fig.1. NF-κB binding activity in nuclear fractions was assessed by EMSA. Fig. 1 A shows the results obtained using an NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide as the binding motif. Without stimulation, there was no detectable binding activity in either young or old Mφ. At every time point following LPS stimulation, the NF-κB binding activity was higher in old Mφ compared with that of young Mφ. To assure the specificity of the binding, a 50-fold concentrated unlabeled (cold) NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was added to compete with the 32P-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide. The binding was competed out in both young and old Mφ at peak time (2 h). When a mutated NF-κB oligonucleotide was added, however, the binding was not affected, further indicating the sequence specificity. To determine the composition of the NF-κB proteins in the binding complex, we used antibody supershift in EMSA. As seen in Fig. 1 A, the binding complex was shifted by antibodies to p65 and p50 units. Next, we used a COX-2-specific NF-κB oligonucleotide in EMSA. Similar to the experiments in which the consensus oligonucleotide was used, a consistently higher binding activity was observed in old compared with young Mφ (Fig.1 B). The specificity was examined using the samples from old Mφ at peak stimulation time (2 h) and 50-fold cold oligonucleotide was shown to completely compete out the band. The supershift assay yielded similar results to those observed in the assay using the consensus oligonucleotide. After establishing an age-related difference in NF-κB binding activity, we examined whether two other transcription factors, AP-1 and CREB, which have been shown to be involved in COX-2 regulation, are affected by the aging process. Culture conditions and LPS doses were the same as those used in the NF-κB gel shift assay. Both AP-1 and CREB were activated by LPS treatment, but the induction was less potent than that seen in NF-κB so that the autoradiography required 5–8-fold longer exposure times than that with the NF-κB probe. The binding activity for both AP-1 and CREB peaked at around 1 h poststimulation and no significant difference was detected between young and old mice in either AP-1 or CREB activation (data not shown). To determine the mechanism of the age-related increase in NF-κB activation, we examined the two key steps preceding the NF-κB binding activity: IκB degradation in the cytoplasm and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. The results indicated that there was no difference between young and old Mφ in expression of IκB under resting conditions. However, after LPS stimulation, there was greater IκB-α degradation in old Mφ than that in young Mφ. The degradation also occurred faster, as shown at 15 min after stimulation, and appeared to recover more slowly when compared with young Mφ (Fig.2 A). We then examined the p65 appearance in nuclear extracts following its translocation from the cytoplasm. As shown in Fig. 2 B, p65, which was not detected in the nucleus before stimulation, gradually increased during the time from 15 min to 2 h after LPS stimulation, followed by a decline between 2 and 4 h. These results indicate that the increased NF-κB binding activity with age is because of different rates of IκB degradation, and subsequent NF-κB translocation, two immediate events prior to the binding of the NFκB to its target genes. As no age-related change was observed in AP-1 and CREB activation, the relationship between NF-κB activation and age-related increase in COX-2 expression was further investigated. Because increased NF-κB activation in old Mφ was associated with a higher IκB phosphorylation and the consequent degradation, to inhibit NF-κB activation, we used Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IκB phosphorylation, and therefore NF-κB activation (37Pierce J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2085194817,"p68 RNA helicase has been implicated in a variety of processes, including rearrangement of RNA secondary structures, RNA splicing, gene transcription and tumor development, yet its mechanisms of action are not well understood. In this study, we show that p68 is predominantly localized to the cell nucleus, where it partially colocalizes with the transcriptional coactivator p300. Accordingly, p68 and p300, or the paralogous CREB-binding protein (CBP), coimmunoprecipitate. Similarly, p68 and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) are able to interact in vivo. GST pull-down assays confirmed these interactions in vitro, demonstrating that p68 can interact with several domains of CBP, while CBP/p300 bind to amino acids 176-388 of p68 and RNA Pol II binds to the N-terminal 80 amino acids of p68. Furthermore, p68 stimulates transcription mediated by the C-terminal transactivation domain of CBP. p68 is also able to stimulate TPA oncogene responsive unit (TORU) promoter activity, and p300 acts in synergy with p68. On the other hand, suppression of CBP/p300 function by the adenoviral protein E1A abolishes TORU promoter activation by p68. Altogether, our results suggest the existence of a multiprotein complex in which p68 RNA helicase, CBP/p300 and RNA Pol II jointly promote gene expression."

It is now generally admitted that the pathological infectious mechanism is due to a protein present ubiquitously in the brain (referred to as PrPc)1 that becomes deleterious after its biophysical conversion into a protease-resistant protein referred to as PrPres or PrP-scrapie (3Ghetti B.

This “bio-transformation” and subsequent pathologies absolutely require the presence of PrPc because the absence of endogenous PrPc totally precludes the PrPsc-mediated infectivity and neurotoxicity (4Büeler H.

The invalidation of the PrP gene (Prnp) led to the conclusion that the Prnp −/− mice exhibit normal development and unaltered behavioral phenotype (9Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H.

Several clues of a possible participation of PrPc in programmed cell death came from the identification of a significant but restricted sequence homology of PrPc octapeptide repeats with the anti-apoptotic oncogene Bcl-2 protein and its ability to bind to Bcl-2 in double hybrid approach (11Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 12Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) also indicated that prion protein could rescue human neurons from Bax-induced apoptosis. Alternatively, the possibility that a restricted sequence corresponding to the 106–126 part of the molecule could elicit a cellular toxic response has also been extensively documented (14Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 15Brown D.R. J.

Cappai R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the 106–126 domain of the prion protein has no genuine physiological or pathological existence as it has never been described as a catabolite of PrPc that would have been proteolytically generated upon normal or pathological conditions. Therefore, the “toxic” potential of the 106–126 peptide could either be not relevant to any normal or altered situation or, alternatively, could reflect a phenotype that would be also triggered by the whole parent prion protein. The latter hypothesis would be in contradiction with the above studies, suggesting an anti-apoptotic PrPc-related phenotype, but would be in line with the work of Westaway et al. (17Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Cayetano-Canlas J. Groth D. Foster D. Yang S.-L. Torchia M. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 117-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), showing that transgenic mice over-expressing “normal” wild type PrPcexhibit degeneration in central and peripheral nervous system as well as in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the 106–126 domain appears to be targeted by a set of proteolytic activities called disintegrins, ADAM10 and ADAM17, that cleave PrPc at the 110/111 peptide bond and thereby “inactivate” the putative toxic core of the PrPc protein (18Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To establish a pro- or anti-apoptotic PrPc-mediated phenotype, we have examined the possible toxicity of PrPc and its putative involvement in the control of cell death. We show that in TSM1 cells, over-expressed and endogenous PrPc all trigger p53-dependent caspase 3 activation leading to a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Murine TSM1 neuronal cells (19Chun J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) stably expressing mouse 3F4-tagged MoPrPc (3F4MoPrPc) were obtained and cultured as previously described (18Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PrPc- or p53-antisense cDNAs (referred to as ASPrP or ASp53, respectively) were obtained after transfection of 1 μg of antisense pcDNA3 vector bearing 3F4MoPrPc or p53 with DAC30 (Eurogentec). Doubly transfected 3F4MoPrPc/ASp53 TSM1 cells were obtained after transfection of 3F4MoPrPc-expressing cells with ASp53 cDNA. p53-inactive cells were obtained from ATCC (NCI-H1299 clone) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were scraped and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) determined by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed for their p53, active caspase 3, Mdm2, phospho-p38, and PrPc immunoreactivities by Western blot and hybridization with anti-p53 (mouse monoclonal, Pab24, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-active caspase 3 (rabbit polyclonal R&D System), mouse monoclonal anti-Mdm2, anti-phospho-p38 (Promega, Charbonnières-les Bains, France) and anti-PrPc (SAF32, Ref. 21Demart S.

The secreted N-terminal fragment (N1) of PrPcwas recovered after incubation for 8 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 in serum-free medium. Medium was then incubated overnight with 2 μg/ml SAF32 monoclonal and protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratory Inc.) and analyzed using sheep anti-mouse peroxydase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:10,000, AmershamBiosciences) as described (18Vincent B.

Cells were grown in 6-well plates and incubated for 15 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of staurosporine (0.5 μm). Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended with 750 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.1% tri-natrium citrate, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The PI fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (CellQuest software; BD Biosciences). Nuclei were characterized for their side angle scatter and forward-angle scatter parameters. Red fluorescence due to PI staining of DNA was then counted on a logarithmic scale. All measurements were performed under identical conditions. This technique allows discrimination of populations of fragmented nuclei from debris and non-viable cells and also from intact diploid nuclei those show higher fluorescence staining. The number of apoptotic nuclei is expressed as a percentage of the hundred thousand events gated. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in 96-well plates in a final volume of a 100 μl per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 μm of staurosporine. Briefly, XTT is metabolized by mitochondrial dehydrogenase to a water soluble formazan salt only by metabolically active viable cells. XTT metabolizing activity was determined as previously described (22Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 15 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of etoposide, ceramide C2, or staurosporine (0.5 μm) or 15 μm of the Fyn kinase inhibitor PP2. In some cases, cells were pre-incubated for 24 h with Ac-DEVD-al (100 μm) or for 2 h with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (1 μm, Calbiochem). Cells were then rinsed, gently scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, then resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer and analyzed as previously detailed (22Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The PG13-luciferase p53 gene reporter construct (provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein) has been previously described (23El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Gen. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). One μg of PG13-luciferase was co-transfected with 1 μg of a β-galactosidase transfection vector (to normalize transfections efficiencies) in TSM1 neurons and in PrP+/+and PrP−/− primary cultured neurons. Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured according to previously described procedures (23El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Gen. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) using Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for one-way analysis of variance and the unpaired Student's t test for pair-wise comparisons. We have obtained stable TSM1 transfectants over-expressing 3F4MoPrPc (Fig.1 A, upper panel). As expected, these cells secrete higher amounts of a 11–12-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 A, lower panel), the immunological characterization of which previously led to its identification as the N-terminal product (called N1) derived from proteolysis of PrPc at the 110/111–112 peptide bond (18Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The over-expression of PrPc in TSM1 neurons increases both basal and staurosporine-induced toxicity (Fig. 1 B) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C) as measured by XTT and PI incorporation, respectively. This phenotype has been observed for all clones examined (not shown). Over-expression of PrPc increases staurosporine-stimulated but not basal Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive Ac-DEVD-7AMC-hydrolyzing caspase 3-like activity in TSM1 neurons (Fig.1 D). This was accompanied by an augmentation of staurosporine-induced active caspase 3-like immunoreactivity (Fig.1 D). It should be emphasized that PrPcexpression potentiated the increase of caspase 3 activity triggered by several other apoptotic stimuli such as ceramide C2 and etoposide in TSM1 (Fig. 1 E). PP2, a selective inhibitor of kinases belonging to the Src family, such as Lck and Fyn, (24Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollock B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) did not affect the extent of PrPc-induced staurosporine-stimulated caspase 3 activation in TSM1 neurons (Fig. 1 F). To examine the endogenous contribution of PrPc to TSM1 susceptibility to staurosporine, we set up stable antisense-PrPc (ASPrPc) TSM1 transfectants. This antisense approach led to a drastic reduction of endogenous PrPc expression and to a barely detectable N1 secretion (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the staurosporine-stimulated, but not the basal caspase 3 activity observed in mock-transfected TSM1 neurons, was drastically reduced in ASPrPc-TSM1 cells (Fig. 2 B). Concomitantly, PrPc-antisense abolished the staurosporine-induced augmentation of active caspase 3-like immuno-reactivity (Fig. 2 B). In line with these observations, the staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation was reduced by about 50% in ASPrPc-expressing TSM1 neurons (Fig.2 C), a percentage that matched well the extent of the reduction of caspase 3 activity (see Fig. 2 B). We examined the putative contribution of the tumor suppressor oncogene p53 to the PrPc-induced caspase 3 activation and toxicity by antisense and pharmacological approaches. We set up TSM1 stable transfectants expressing p53 antisense cDNA either alone (ASp53) or in combination with 3F4MoPrPc(3F4MoPrPc/ASp53)(see Fig. 4 B). Our data show that all 3F4MoPrPc-related phenotypes can be prevented by antisense down-regulation of p53. Thus, Fig.3 A clearly shows that ASp53 drastically protects TSM1 cells from both basal and staurosporine-stimulated PrPc-mediated toxicity measured by the XTT assay (compare 3F4MoPrPc with 3F4MoPrPc/ASp53). Furthermore, ASp53 fully prevents the 3F4MoPrPc-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3 D, compare 3F4MoPrPc-sts with3F4MoPrPc/ASp53-sts). Finally, ASp53 totally reverses the staurosporine-induced caspase activation triggered by 3F4MoPrPc (Fig. 3 B, compare3F4MoPrPc and3F4MoPrPc/ASp53 transfectants).Figure 3PrPc-induced caspase 3 is p53-dependent. A, mock-, 3F4MoPrPc, or 3F4MoPrPc-TSM1 cells stably transfected with p53 antisense cDNA (3F4MoPrP/ASp53), respectively, were checked for their cell viability in the absence (−) or presence (+) of staurosporine (Sts) as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B–D, TSM1 cells stably transfected with p53 antisense cDNA (ASp53 and 3F4MoPrP/ASp53, respectively) were measured for their caspase activity (B and C) and DNA fragmentation (D) in the absence (−) or presence (+) of staurosporine (B and D) or pifithrin-α (Pft, 10 μm, B). Barsrepresent the means ± S.E. of 3–6 independent determinations (carried out in duplicates).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We took advantage of the recent design of a specific p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α (25Komarov P.G. Komarova E.A. Kondratov R.V. Christov-Tselkov K. Coon J.S. Chernov M.V. Gudkov A.V. Science. 1999; 285: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), to further confirm the role of endogenous p53 in PrPc-mediated caspase activation. This pharmacological approach allowed us to show that pifithrin-α abolishes the 3F4MoPrPc-mediated staurosporine-stimulated increase of caspase 3 activity (Fig. 3 C, compare3F4MoPrPc and Mock−/+pft). Interestingly, pifithrin-α appeared inactive in ASp53-TSM1 cells (Fig. 3 C, compare ASp53−/+pft), indicating that the antisense and pharmacological approaches indeed inhibited the same expected molecular target,i.e. p53. This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that pifithrin-α did not significantly modify caspase 3 activity displayed by doubly transfected 3F4MoPrPc/ASp53-TSM1 neurons that remain at the level of pifithrin-α-treated mock- and 3F4MoPrP-transfected cells (Fig. 3 C). Because PrPc-proapoptoptic phenotype appeared p53-dependent, we examined whether PrPc could also affect p53 expression and transcriptional activity. First, our data show that TSM1 over-expressing 3F4MoPrPc displays higher endogenous p53-like immunoreactivity than mock-transfected cells (Fig.4 A). This was also observed in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4 E). Conversely, ASPrPc-TSM1 cells exhibit lower p53-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 A). To correlate the modulation of p53 immunoreactivity with its biological activity, we examined the p53 transcriptional activity by means of the PG13-luciferase construct classically used as the p53 gene reporter (23El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Gen. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p53 transcriptional activity was drastically enhanced in 3F4MoPrPc-TSM1 cells (Fig. 4 C) and lowered in ASPrPc-expressing neurons (Fig. 4 C). As expected, ASp53-expressing cells exhibit lower p53 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 B, compare ASp53 and Mock) and totally prevents the p53 increase observed with singly transfected 3F4MoPrPc cells (Fig. 4 B, compare3F4MoPrP and 3F4MoPrP/ASp53 withASp53). We took advantage of a cell system in which p53 is functionally deficient (26Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D. D'Amico D. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar) to examine the ability of PrPcto increase p53 expression in co-transfection experiments. Any PrPc-dependent increase in p53 could not be explained by a transcriptional activation as the p53 cDNA is driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and therefore would imply post-transcriptional PrPc-dependent p53 modulation. As expected, mock-transfected cells do not display any p53 transcriptional activity (Fig.5 A). PrPc cDNA transfection does not modify this null phenotype. However, we establish that transient co-transfection of PrPc and p53 cDNAs drastically potentiates the p53 transcriptional activity associated with p53 cDNA transfection alone (compare p53 and3F4/p53 in Fig. 5 A). These data led us to search for post-transcriptional modifications triggered by PrPc that would have altered p53 transcriptional activity. Mdm2 was recently shown to decrease p53 metabolic stability thereby lowering its activity (27Yin Y. Luciani M.G. Fahraeus R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Mdm2 fully reverses the PrPc-induced increase of p53 transcriptional activity (Fig. 5 E). As p38 MAPK was reported to up-regulate p53 activity via upstream decrease of Mdm2 expression (28Zhu Y. Mao X.O. Sun Y. Xia Z. Greenberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22909-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor (29Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S.

SB203580 significantly reduced but did not abolish the staurosporine-induced caspase activation in mock- and 3F4MoPrPc-expressing neurons (Fig.5 D). Accordingly, over-expression of PrPcincreases phospho-p38 MAPK immunoreactivity in both TSM1 neurons (Fig.5 B) and p53-inactive fibroblasts (Fig. 5 C). Altogether, our data suggest that PrPc increases p53 activity by p38 MAPK activation and concomitant reduction of Mdm2. Although a series of studies (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar) attempted to delineate the prions-related pathogenic mechanisms, very few data concern the putative physiological function of PrPc. This lack of attention perhaps came in part from the fact that the absence of the protein does not seem absolutely crucial because mice in which the prnp gene had been invalidated are safe and healthy, with apparently poorly detectable alterations in their development and behavior (9Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H. DeArmond S. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). However, Kuwahara et al. (30Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) reported that hippocampal neurons prepared fromPrnp −/− mice undergo exacerbated cell death triggered by serum deprivation, thereby suggesting that PrPc could display an anti-apoptotic tonus. More recently, an interesting study documented the fact that PrPcprotected human neurons from Bax-induced cell death (13Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These data are apparently in opposition with a previous work demonstrating that transgenic mice over-expressing wild type PrPc could exhibit severe neurodegeneration (17Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Cayetano-Canlas J. Groth D. Foster D. Yang S.-L. Torchia M. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 117-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent article indicated that the post-natal deletion of the PrPcalters CA1 hippocampal neuron excitability but does not induce neurodegeneration (10Mallucci G.R. Ratté S. Asante E.A. Linehan J. Gowland I. Jefferys J.G.R. Collinge J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) as would have been expected if the protein displayed an important anti-apoptotic function at adulthood. Furthermore, an infected hypothalamic neuronal cell line exhibits increased apoptosis (31Schätzl H.M. Laszlo L. Holtzman D.M. Tatzelt J. DeArmond S.J. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8821-8831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this results from a dysfunction in the normal control of cell death by PrPc remains a possibility. The 106–126 domain of PrPc was shown to be toxic (14Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 15Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and appears to activate several pro-apoptotic markers (16Jobling M.F. Stewart L.R. White A.R. McLean C. Friedhuber A. Maher F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Barrow C.J. Collins S.J. Cappai R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32White A.R. Guirguis R. Brazier M.W. Jobling M.F. Hill A.F. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Colins S.J. Cappai R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This fragment is never proteolytically released as such from PrPc. In this context, either the bulk of studies examining the effect of 106–126 just describe not relevant and artifactual data, or, more likely, the studies carried out with this fragment can be seen as a revelator of a PrPc function that would be pro-apoptotic. Our study clearly establishes by means of neuronal cell systems, stable transfections, antisense, and pharmacological approaches that PrPc drastically exacerbates cell responsiveness to pro-apoptotic stimuli. Thus, over-expression or specific induction of PrPc enhances staurosporine-induced cell toxicity, DNA fragmentation, and increases both caspase 3-like activity and immuno-reactivity that are all reversed by PrPc antisense approach. The fact that PrPc-mediated caspase activation also occurs in HEK293 cells (33Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) importantly indicates that the pro-apoptotic PrPc-related phenotype is not cell-specific. A recent study (34Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) suggested that PrPc could behave as a signaling molecule, transducing the signal after its coupling to the Src kinase Fyn. In our experiments, the selective Src inhibitor PP2 does not affect the PrPc-induced caspase activation, indicating that Fyn kinase phosphorylating activity was clearly not essential for PrPc-induced apoptosis in our experimental conditions. It should be noted that distinct cell types were used in the two studies, and more particularly the Fyn-dependent PrPc-mediated signaling appeared drastically dependent on the differentiation state of the 1C11 cells used in Mouillet-Richardet al. (35Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Clearly the lack of Fyn dependence observed for PrPc-mediated phenotype in TSM1 cells indicates that Fyn requirement is likely restricted to few specialized PrPc phenotypes much more than for more general PrP function in cell death control. We demonstrate that the PrPc-induced caspase 3 activation is mediated by p53. Indeed, PrPc expression increases p53 immuno-reactivity and transcriptional activity, whereas the PrPc antisense approach led to the opposite phenotype. Furthermore, p53 antisense blocked the PrPc-induced toxicity, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3 activation. The opposite phenotype triggered by down-regulation of endogenous PrPcimportantly indicates that the pro-apoptotic phenotype observed in PrPc-transfected cells was not artifactually related to the procedure involving over-expression of the protein. This is in agreement with our other data showing that Rov9 cells display a pro-apoptotic phenotype only after selective PrPc induction (33Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PrPc controls p53 expression and activity at a post-transcriptional level. Thus we were able to demonstrate that in a cell line deficient in active p53, PrPc drastically increases p53 activity after co-transfection of p53 and PrPc cDNAs. As p53 and PrPc cDNA are driven by a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter, p53 enhanced activity cannot be derived from increased transcription of p53, the genuine promoter of which leads to an inactive protein in our cell system. Interestingly, Mdm2 fully prevents the PrPc-induced p53 increase observed in the above cell system. Mdm2 was recently shown to control p53 expression at post-transcriptional levels (27Yin Y. Luciani M.G. Fahraeus R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar) and particularly modulates p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, one could conclude that PrPc increases p53 expression and transcriptional activity via a decrease of the p53 down-regulator Mdm2. To support this hypothesis we examined the putative contribution of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase that was recently shown to down-regulate Mdm2 and concomitantly increase p53 expression in neurons in a model of hypoxia. Indeed, we clearly showed that phospho-38 MAPK immuno-reactivity, the activated form of this kinase, was higher in PrPc-expressing TSM1 cells, in PrP+/+ than in PrP−/− neurons, and could be increased by PrPc in fibroblasts (see Fig. 5). Furthermore, p38 inhibitor could partly block the PrPc-associated caspase 3 activation in transfected TSM1 neurons. Altogether, our data show that PrPc exerts a pro-apoptotic phenotype through the modulation of caspase 3 activity via a p53-dependent pathway that is positively and negatively controlled by p38 MAPK and Mdm2, respectively. It is interesting to note that a recent study indicated that misfolded PrPc could be neurotoxic and could induce neurodegenerescence when accumulating in the cytosol, even at small amounts (35Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Whether such a small amount of PrPc could account for the phenotype observed in our over-expression system is difficult to examine. However, the fact that our antisense approach led to an anti-apoptotic phenotype would suggest that even in normal conditions, a small fraction of endogenous PrPc could be responsible for our observed p53-dependent caspase 3 activation. We recently documented the fact that PrPcundergoes basal and protein kinase C-regulated cleavage in the middle of its 106–126 domain by proteases of the disintegrins family, thereby releasing a fragment that we called N1 (for review see Ref. 36Checler F. Vincent B. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 616-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This PrPc cleavage also observed by Chen et al.(37Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) is reminiscent of the one taking place in the middle of the Aβ domain borne by the β-amyloid precursor protein (38Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this intra-Aβ cleavage not only lowers Aβ production but also gives rise to a cytotrophic and neuroprotective secreted fragment called sAPPα. Whether the cleavage generating N1 not only abolishes a pro-apoptotic control of PrP but also produces a fragment with opposite neuroprotective influence is currently being examined in our laboratory.

The final step in B antigen synthesis is carried out by an α1–3 galactosyltransferase (GTB) that transfers galactose from UDP-Gal to type 1 or type 2, αFuc1→2ॆGal-R (H)-terminating acceptors. Similarly the A antigen is produced by an α1–3N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that transfersN-acetylgalactosamine from UDP-GalNAc to H-acceptors. Human α1–3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and GTB are highly homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A).

The crystal structure of the mutant reveals the basis for the shift in donor specificity. α1–3N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase α1–3 galactosyltransferase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Human blood group A and B antigens are produced by glycosyltransferase enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a monosaccharide from a nucleotide donor to Fucα1–2Galॆ- R (H) acceptor substrates (1Watkins W.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1980; 10: 379-385Google Scholar, 2Palcic M.M. Seto N.O.L. Hindsgaul O. Transfus. Med. 2001; 11: 315-323Google Scholar). The A-synthesizing α1–3N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA,1 EC 2.4.1.40, glycoprotein-fucosylgalactoside α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to H-terminating acceptors producing the A antigen GalNAcα1–3[Fucα1–2]Galॆ-R. The B-synthesizing α1–3 galactosyltransferase (GTB, EC 2.4.1.37, glycoprotein-fucosylgalactoside α-galactosyltransferase) utilizes UDP-Gal as its donor producing Galα1–3[Fucα1–2]Galॆ-R. GTA and GTB are highly homologous enzymes, differing at only four amino acids of 354 (3Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Google Scholar). Changing these four amino acids, R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A, alters the specificity of transfer from that of GTA to GTB. X-ray diffraction studies of crystals of GTA and GTB and their complexes with H-acceptor and UDP have revealed the basis for donor and acceptor specificity (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Google Scholar). Both residues 266 and 268 are involved in recognition of the donor monosaccharide with Leu/Met-266 being primarily responsible for the discrimination between GalNAc and Gal. Donor specificity is not absolute since small levels of crossover reactions have been observed where GTA is able to use UDP-Gal to synthesize B antigens at about 0.47 the rate of UDP-GalNAc transfer (5Greenwell P. Yates A.D. Watkins W.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 149: 149-170Google Scholar, 6Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Compston C.A. Li H. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14133-14138Google Scholar). Similarly GTB can slowly synthesize the A antigen, and A antigen structures have been observed on normal group B red blood cells (7Goldstein J. Lenny L. Davies D. Voak D. Vox Sang. 1989; 57: 142-146Google Scholar). cis-AB enzymes are rare dual specificity hybrid enzymes capable of utilizing either donor. Several natural and recombinantcis-AB enzymes have been characterized with interchanges in the four amino acids such as AAAB (Arg-176, Gly-235, Leu-266, and Ala-268) (8Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Kominato Y. Hakomori S. Ishimoto S. Nishida S. Shima M. Fujimura Y. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 120-123Google Scholar), ABBA, AABA and BBBA, and BABA. Two othercis-AB enzymes result from point mutations of GTB: one at codon 266 (M266L) (9Mifsud N.A. Watt J.M. Condon J.A. Haddad A.P. Sparrow R.L. Transfusion. 2000; 40: 1276-1277Google Scholar) and one at position 234 (P234S) (10Roubinet F. Janvier D. Blancher A. Transfusion. 2002; 42: 239-246Google Scholar). Another mutation at position 234 (P234A) has been reported to modify the specificity of the GTB to transfer not only Gal but also small amounts of GalNAc leading to a phenotype called B(A) (11Yu L.C. Lee H.L. Lin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 487-493Google Scholar). To elucidate the structural basis of functional modification induced by the P234S replacement, recombinant GTB P234S was characterized by kinetic and x-ray diffraction studies. The original GTB and GTA gene sequences (amino acids 54–354) were described previously (12Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Bundle D.R. Narang S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 323-328Google Scholar,13Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Evans S.V. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Palcic M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 770-775Google Scholar). In this study, GTB (amino acids 63–354) and GTA (amino acids 63–354) are denoted as wild type and were constructed by PCR using the original GTA and GTB (amino acids 54–354) clones as templates. The forward primer MIN2 (5′-ATA TGA ATT CAT GGT TTC CCT GCC GCG TAT GGT TTA CCC GCA GCC GAA-3′) introduced an EcoRI site at the 5′ end, and the reverse primer PCR3B (5′-ATA ATT AAG CTTCTA TCA CGG GTT ACG AAC AGC CTG GTG GTT TTT-3′) introduced aHindIII site in the 3′ end of GTA and GTB genes. The amplified genes were cloned into the expression vector pCWΔlac (pCW was a gift of F. W. Dahlquist (14Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Google Scholar), and pCWΔlac was a gift of W. Wakarchuk), transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen), and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. The P234S GTB mutant was constructed by directed mutagenesis using PCR (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, pp. 8.5.7-10. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) and GTB (residues 63–354) plasmid DNA as a template. Two fragments were amplified with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) by using the forward primer MIN2 together with SM01 (5′-GTA GAA GCT gga GTG CAG GGT ACC GAA CAG CGG-3′) and the reverse primer PCR3B with SM02 (5′-CTG CAC tcc AGC TTC TAC GGT TCC TCC CGT GAA G-3′). SM01 and SM02 were designed so that the two fragments overlap with each other and have a single codon substitution (CCC to TCC) at codon 234 (lowercase letters). The two overlapping fragments were isolated, annealed by 3′ extension using PCR, and amplified using the outside primers MIN2 and PCR3B. The resulting fragment containing the desired mutation was digested with EcoRI andHindIII (underlined in the previous section) and inserted into the corresponding sites of pCWΔlac. Both wild type and mutant enzymes were expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (16Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Szpacenko A. Palcic M.M. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 324: 161-169Google Scholar) except 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm UDP, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol were used for elution from the UDP-hexanolamine affinity column, and the enzyme was concentrated in a Centriplus 30 filtration unit (Amicon). The P234S mutant had expression levels of 40 mg/liter of culture compared with wild type GTB and GTA with expression levels of 50–100 mg/liter. Protein concentrations were estimated with a Bio-Rad protein assay procedure that is based on the method of Bradford using bovine gamma globulin as a protein standard (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was used to confirm homogeneity. Steady-state kinetic studies were carried out on all enzymes using a Sep-Pak radiochemical assay using the hydrophobic acceptor Fucα1–2Galॆ-O(CH2)7CH3 (6Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Compston C.A. Li H.

Assays were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 12 ॖl containing substrates and enzyme in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, with 20 mm MnCl2 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Seven different concentrations of the donor and acceptor were used, and the amount of substrate consumed was less than 157 to ensure linear initial reaction rates. Data were analyzed as described previously (6Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Compston C.A. Li H. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14133-14138Google Scholar, 13Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A.

Open table in a new tab The reported structures of GTA and GTB are virtually identical except for the four critical amino acid residues (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Google Scholar). These enzymes represent a paradigm for structure-function relationships since changes in only four amino acids alter enzyme specificity. Of these residues, Arg/Gly-176 is far from the active site, Gly/Ser-235 appears in close vicinity to the acceptor binding site, and Leu/Met-266 and Gly/Ala-268 are both within the donor recognition pocket. The P234S mutation is striking in that this one mutation of a single residue in GTB results in the near abolishment of B donor (UDP-Gal) transfer and a large increase in A donor (UDP-GalNAc) transfer activity. The results of kinetic analysis with UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc for wild type GTB, P234S GTB, and wild type GTA are presented in Table I. For the P234S GTB mutant, the kcat for UDP-Gal has decreased from the 5.1 s−1 of wild type GTB to 0.24 s−1. This is comparable to 0.088 s−1, thekcat of the wild type GTA cross-reaction utilizing UDP-Gal as a donor. While the binding of UDP-Gal has been affected with an increase in the Km for UDP-Gal from 27 ॖm of wild type GTB to 106 ॖm for the mutant, a much larger effect is seen on acceptor binding. There is a 50-fold increase in acceptor Km compared with that of wild type GTB. For P234S, kcat for UDP-GalNAc is 14.4 s−1, comparable to the kcatof wild type GTA (17.5 s−1). The binding of UDP-GalNAc to the mutant has been affected somewhat with a Km of 167 ॖm and Kib of 49 ॖm. Acceptor binding to P234S has been dramatically affected with over a 300-fold increase in both Kmand Kia. The crystal structure of the mutant enzyme provides a structural basis for the reversal in enzyme donor preference and weakened acceptor binding. Fig. 1 shows the position of residue 234 in P234S and wild type GTB relative to two of the residues that normally serve to differentiate between the donor sugars. It is clear that in the mutant enzyme the replacement of proline by serine creates a void at the proline C-γ position. This atom normally makes van der Waals contact with Met-266 in wild type GTB, and its removal enables Met-266 to alter its side chain orientation. This conformational change provides sufficient space to accommodate theN-acetyl group of UDP-GalNAc and also creates an unfavorable void and lack of enzyme-substrate complementarity in the donor-binding pocket for UDP-Gal, analogous to the void observed in GTA recognition of UDP-Gal (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Google Scholar). Acceptor binding is also affected in P234S. The movement of the Met-266 side chain results in the loss of its van der Waals contacts with the acceptor moiety. Also the mutation of P234S creates a new van der Waals contact between the serine hydroxyl group and the C-6 methyl group of the fucose ring of the acceptor. Significantly the mutation to serine causes the ordering of a water molecule about Ser-234, which must be displaced in order for acceptor to bind. The effect of these changes is to weaken the binding of acceptor for reaction with either UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc donors. In addition, the point mutation at residue 234 occurs in the immediate vicinity of the critical residue Ser-235 that is thought to act on the acceptor by forcing the aliphatic tail to adopt different conformations between GTA and GTB. We have previously speculated that this residue may be responsible for selecting the glycoconjugate structures possessing the H-antigen acceptor (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Google Scholar). It is therefore plausible that changes introduced at the neighboring residue 234 would influence acceptor binding and ultimately the behavior of the mutant. Further, in the production of GTA/GTB hybrid enzymes the placement of a Ser residue (as in GTB) instead of a Gly residue (as in GTA) at position 235 results in weaker acceptor binding (13Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Evans S.V. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Palcic M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 770-775Google Scholar). The presence of tandem serine residues may further destabilize acceptor binding via steric and local charge distribution effects. There are two examples reported of glycosyltransferases with altered donor specificity for a single amino acid replacement. In ॆ1–4-galactosyltransferase, mutation of tyrosine 289 to leucine gave an enzyme that is capable of transferring GalNAc at a rate comparable to Gal (20Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20833-20839Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the mutant showed that there was sufficient room for the enzyme to accommodate the N-acetyl group of the alternate donor. For ॆ1–3-glucuronosyltransferase, mutation of histidine 308 to arginine produces an enzyme that can efficiently utilize UDP-Glc, UDP-Man, and UDP-GlcNAc as well as UDP-GlcA donor (21Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Levoin N. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25439-25445Google Scholar). However, unlike these examples of broadened donor specificity, the P234S mutation in glycosyltransferase B results in a complete reversal of donor saccharide recognition. The reason for the difference in behavior of cloned P234S, which produces predominantly blood group A structures, and the phenotype of red blood cells of individuals with this mutation that react with both anti-A and anti-B reagents is not clear. The cloned enzyme is a truncated, soluble form, whereas full-length membrane-associated enzyme biosynthesizes cell surface structures. Cell surface blood group structures are also found on glycoproteins, whereas a lipid-like acceptor was used to characterize the cloned enzyme. This study highlights the dramatic effect of a single amino change on the catalytic reaction of a glycosyltransferase enzyme that ultimately affects blood group structure. We have shown that residues adjacent to the four conserved amino acids in GTA and GTB can dramatically influence the specificity of A and B transferases by inducing conformational changes that alter the specificity and kinetics of these enzymes. The enzymology and structure of other point mutations at Pro-234 of both GTA and GTB enzymes are currently under investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2092099059,"The c-Myb, A-Myb and B-Myb transcription factors have nearly identical DNA-binding domains, activate the same reporter gene constructs in animal cells, but have different biological roles. The Myb proteins are often coexpressed in the same cells, raising questions about whether they activate similar or distinct gene expression profiles, and whether they cooperate or compete in regulating the same promoters. Here, recombinant adenoviruses were used to express each protein in human mammary cells, and then microarray assays were used to assess global changes in gene expression. Each Myb protein induced a unique and specific set of changes, displaying activities far more complex than revealed by standard reporter gene assays. These results have important implications for the roles of various Myb proteins in normal and transformed human cells, for regulatory pathways that might modify their activities and for the importance of acquired mutations that may qualitatively alter their functions in tumors."

Inhibition of cell proliferation and reactivation of apoptosis are basic principles in anticancer therapy. The efficiency of this approach is often limited by insuf-ficient targeting and delivery of anticancer drugs into the tumors. Phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) directed against PLK1 and BCL-2 were administered systemically via the tail vein into nude mice bearing A549, MDA-MB-435, and Detroit562 xenografts. To enhance tumor-specific uptake and to reduce systemic toxicity of antisense ODNs membrane electroporation transfer was applied in vivo. Northern and Western blot analyses were used to assess PLK1 and BCL-2 expression. Tumor mass was assessed after resection of tumors. All three cell lines and corresponding xenografts expressed high levels of PLK1 and were sensitive towards antisense PLK1 treatment. Antisense BCL-2 therapy was effective in tumors expressing high levels of BCL-2, but not in A549 cells and corresponding xenografts, which express low levels of BCL-2. Administration of antisense ODNs in a dose of 5 mg/kg, twice weekly during four weeks supported by the membrane electroporation transfer, eradicated 60-100% of the xenografted tumors. Antitumor effect in BCL-2 overexpressing MDA-MB-435 cells was synergistic for BCL-2 and PLK1 combination therapy. This study provides evidence that combined systemic administration of antisense ODNs against proliferation and pro- survival associated targets and in vivo electroporation of tumors represents a promising antitumor therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2056490499,"Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to familial, early-onset breast cancer. Both the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins appear to function in the homologous recombination pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 have also been implicated in transcription by RNA polymerase II, for both proteins have domains which, when tethered adjacent to a promoter, can activate transcription. In experiments reported here, we have used protein affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation techniques to show that the putative N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain of BRCA2 interacts with replication protein A (RPA), a protein essential for DNA repair, replication and recombination. This interaction was not mediated by DNA and was specific for human RPA but not yeast RPA. Since the cancer-predisposing mutation Y42C in BRCA2 significantly compromised the interaction between RPA and BRCA2, this interaction may be biologically important. That BRCA2 protein in HeLa cell extract also coimmunoprecipitated with RPA suggested that this interaction occurs in vivo. Therefore, the transcriptional activation domains within BRCA2, and perhaps BRCA1, may provide links to RPA and DNA repair processes rather than transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1968141804,"Estrogens play a crucial role in the development of breast cancer. Estradiol can be produced in the breast tissue in situ, and one of the enzymes involved in this process is 17beta-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) type 1 that catalyzes the interconversion of estrone (E1) to the biologically more potent estradiol (E2). The gene coding for 17beta-HSD type 1 (HSD17B1) is located at 17q12-21, close to the more studied ERBB2 and BRCA1. The aim of this study was to investigate if HSD17B1 shows an altered gene copy number in breast cancer. We used real-time PCR and examined 221 postmenopausal breast tumors for amplification of HSD17B1 and ERBB2. In all, 32 tumors (14.5%) showed amplification of HSD17B1 and 21% were amplified for ERBB2. Amplification of the two genes was correlated (P=0.00078) and in 14 tumors (44%) with amplification of HSD17B1, ERBB2 was co amplified. The patients with amplification in at least one of the genes had a significantly worse outcome than patients without (P=0.0059). For estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen, amplification of HSD17B1 was related to decreased breast cancer survival (P=0.017), whereas amplification of ERRB2 was not. Amplification of HSD17B1 might be an indicator of adverse prognosis among ER-positive patients, and possibly a mechanism for decreased benefit from tamoxifen treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1985310505,"It has been established that sialyl Lewis x in core 2 branched O-glycans serves as an E- and P-selectin ligand. Recently, it was discovered that 6-sulfosialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3(sulfo→6))GlcNAcβ1→ 3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr, functions as an L-selectin ligand in high endothelial venules. Extended core 1O-glycans can be synthesized when a core 1 extension enzyme is present. In this study, we first show that β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-3 (β3GlcNAcT-3) is almost exclusively responsible for core 1 extension among seven different β3GlcNAcTs and thus acts on core 1 O-glycans attached to PSGL-1. We found that transcripts encoding β3GlcNAcT-3 were expressed in human neutrophils and lymphocytes but that their levels were lower than those of transcripts encoding core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (Core2GlcNAcT-I). Neutrophils also expressed transcripts encoding fucosyltransferase VII (FucT-VII) and Core2GlcNAcT-I, whereas lymphocytes expressed only small amounts of transcripts encoding FucT-VII. To determine the roles of sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1O-glycans, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were stably transfected to express PSGL-1, FucT-VII, and either β3GlcNAcT-3 or Core2GlcNAcT-I. Glycan structural analyses disclosed that PSGL-1 expressed in these transfected cells carried comparable amounts of sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 and core 2 branchedO-glycans. In a rolling assay, CHO cells expressing sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans supported a significant degree of shear-dependent tethering and rolling of neutrophils and lymphocytes, although less than CHO cells expressing sialyl Lewis x in core 2 branched O-glycans.

These results indicate that sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans can function as an L-selectin ligand and is potentially involved in neutrophil adhesion on neutrophils bound to activated endothelial cells. Mucin-type O-glycans are unique in having clusters of large numbers of O-glycans. These O-glycans contain N-acetylgalactosamine residues at reducing ends, which are linked to serine or threonine residues in a polypeptide (1Fukuda M. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-52Google Scholar). These attached O-glycans can be classified into several different groups according to the core structure (2Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Glycoconjugates: Composition, Structure, and Function. Marcel Decker, Inc., New York1992: 263-332Google Scholar). In many cells, a structure called core 1, Galβ1→3GalNAc, is the major constituent ofO-glycans. Core 1 oligosaccharides are converted to core 2 oligosaccharides, Galβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAc, when core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core2GlcNAcT) 1The abbreviations used are: Core2GlcNAcT-I, core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; HEV, high endothelial venule(s); LSST, L-selectin ligand sulfotransferase; FucT-VII, fucosyltransferase VII; β3GlcNAcT, β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RT, reverse transcription; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography 1The abbreviations used are: Core2GlcNAcT-I, core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; HEV, high endothelial venule(s); LSST, L-selectin ligand sulfotransferase; FucT-VII, fucosyltransferase VII; β3GlcNAcT, β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RT, reverse transcription; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography is present (3Piller F.

Various ligand carbohydrates can be formed in core 2 branched oligosaccharides. For example, sialyl Lewis x in mucin-type glycoproteins of blood cells can be found in core 2 branched oligosaccharides such as NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAcβ1→6(NeuNAcα2→ 3Galβ1→3)GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr (see Fig. 1) (5Fukuda M.

When leukocytes are recruited to inflammatory sites, E- and P-selectins expressed in activated endothelial cells recognize α2→3-sialylated, α1→3-fucosylated O-glycans, allowing leukocytes to eventually extravasate (7Lowe J.B. Stoolman L.M. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Berhend T.L. Marks R.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 475-484Google Scholar, 8Phillips M.L. Nudelman E. Gaeta F.C.A. Perez M. Singhai A.K. Hakomori S.I. Paulson J.C.

It has also been demonstrated that L-selectin in neutrophils mediates neutrophil rolling on neutrophils adherent to activated endothelial cells (10Bargatze R.F. Kurk S. Butcher E.C. Jutila M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1785-1792Google Scholar, 11Alon R. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 849-865Google Scholar). PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoproteinligand-1) contributes to this process, although the nature of the glycan moieties that decorate this and other potential L-selectin ligands in neutrophils has not been well characterized. On the other hand, L-selectin in lymphocytes recognizes 6-sulfosialyl Lewis x in core 2 branched O-glycans, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3(sulfo→6))GlcNAcβ1→ 6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr, which are expressed in high endothelial venules (HEV) in lymph nodes (12Hiraoka N.

The roles of sialyl Lewis x in core 2 branched O-glycans have been demonstrated by analyzing mutant mice with deficient Core2GlcNAcT-I, obtained through homologous recombination (17Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Google Scholar). Leukocytes derived from null mutant mice display significantly reduced adhesion to L-, P-, and E-selectins, demonstrating that ligands for these selectins are mainly carried by core 2 branchedO-glycans. By contrast, in these mice, lymphocyte adhesion to HEV in lymph nodes is only marginally impaired, and MECA-79 antibody staining that decorates HEV is not reduced (17Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal that L-selectin ligand activity remaining after abrogation of Core2GlcNAcT-I is due to the activity of 6-sulfosialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4[Fucα1→3(sulfo→6)]GlcNAcβ1→ 3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr (18Yeh J.-C.

Moreover, a minimum MECA-79 epitope was found to be a 6-sulfo structure in the extended core 1O-glycan, and MECA-79 antibody binds efficiently to 6-sulfosialyl Lewis x-containing extended core 1 O-glycans (18Yeh J.-C.

These findings are consistent with previous findings that MECA-79 antibody inhibits lymphocyte adhesion to HEV without removal of sialic acid (19Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T. Butcher E.C. J.

This cloning was possible because it was reported that β1,3-galactosyltransferase and β3GlcNAcT are highly homologous proteins (24Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 406-411Google Scholar). In parallel, at least five additional β3GlcNAcTs have been molecularly identified based on similarity to the previously cloned β1,3-galactosyltransferase or to β3GlcNAcT-2 (22Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N. Nakagawa S. Koizumi S. Sekine S. Narimatsu H. Sasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3498-3507Google Scholar, 25Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R.

These results indicate that core 1-β3GlcNAcT belongs to the β3GlcNAcT gene family, and it is thus designated β3GlcNAcT-3. β3GlcNAcT-3 transcripts are highly expressed in the small intestine, colon, and placenta and are moderately expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, and prostate (18Yeh J.-C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Google Scholar). It is not known whether blood cells express β3GlcNAcT-3. In this study, we address the function and expression pattern of β3GlcNAcT-3. First, we show that β3GlcNAcT-3 was the only enzyme that significantly formed extended core 1 among highly related β3GlcNAcTs. We then show that β3GlcNAcT-3 transcripts were present in both human neutrophils and lymphocytes, but that these cells lacked LSST. Transfection studies using FucT-VII and β3GlcNAcT-3 or Core2GlcNAcT-I showed that extended core 1 could be synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and that extended core 1 structure was fucosylated by FucT-VII more efficiently than core 2 branches. Finally, we show that sialyl Lewis x synthesized in extended core 1 served as an L-selectin ligand, although it is apparently less potent than sialyl Lewis x in core 2 branches. cDNA cloning of β3GlcNAcT-3 was described previously (18Yeh J.-C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding human β3GlcNAcT-1 (21Sasaki K.

Commun. 2002; 294: 843-848Google Scholar) were cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (29Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Google Scholar). RT-PCR primers were as follows: β3GlcNAcT-1, 5′-CGAGAGCCATGCAGATGTCCTAC-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AAGGGCTCAGCAGCGTCGGGGAG-3′ (3′-primer); β3GlcNAcT-2, 5′-GACAAGATATGAGAAATGAGTGTTGG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-TTTTAGCATTTTAAATGAGCACTCTGC-3′ (3′-primer); β3GlcNAcT-4, 5′-AGCACGGAGACAGTCTCCAGCTG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AGGCATCAATTTCGCATCACGATAG-3′ (3′-primer); β3GlcNAcT-5, 5′-AGACTTGAGTGGATATGAGAATGTTG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AAGTACTATTAGATAAACGCAGCCCT-3′ (3′-primer); β3GlcNAcT-6, 5′-ACGCTCAAGCACCTGCACTTGCT-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-ACTGGCCTCAGGAGACCCGGTG-3′ (3′-primer); and β3GlcNAcT-7, 5′-GCCGCCATGTCGCTGTGGAAGA-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′GGGTCAGAGCACCTGGAGCTTG-3′ (3′-primer). As templates, we used a human fetal brain cDNA library in pcDNA1 (30Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar) for β3GlcNAcT-1, human esophagus cDNA in a human digestive system multiple tissue cDNA panel (BD Biosciences) for β3GlcNAcT-2, an SK-N-MC cell cDNA library (see below) for β3GlcNAcT-4, human pituitary gland Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences) for β3GlcNAc-5, human stomach cDNA in a human digestive system multiple tissue cDNA panel (BD Biosciences) for β3GlcNAcT-6, and human colon Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences) for β3GlcNAcT-7. A cDNA library of SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells was prepared by isolation of total RNA with TRIzol (Invitrogen), followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR products were first inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). In the case of β3GlcNAcT-1, -2, -4, -6, and -7, cDNAs in pCR2.1-TOPO were digested with EcoRI and inserted into the dephosphorylated EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1(N). pcDNA3.1(N) is a vector created by the digestion of pcDNA3.1/Zeo with SphI and BspLU11I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by filling in and self-ligation to remove the Zeocin resistance gene and f1 origin. For β3GlcNAcT-5, cDNA in pCR2.1-TOPO was digested with EcoRI andScaI and subcloned into theEcoRI-EcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1(N). Similarly, β3GlcNAcT-3 was cloned into the HindIII-XhoI sites of pcDNA1.1, resulting in pcDNA1.1-β3GlcNAcT-3. cDNA encoding LSST was cloned as described previously (12Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J.-C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 79-89Google Scholar, 15Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.Y. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.R. Huang C.C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 899-910Google Scholar). To determine whether all of β3GlcNAcTs direct the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with one of the pcDNA3.1(N)-β3GlcNAcTs or pcDNA1.1-β3GlcNAcT-3. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were dissociated into monodispersed cells using an enzyme-free cell dissociation solution (Hanks' balanced saline solution-based) purchased from Cell and Molecular Technologies. Monodispersed cells were incubated with human anti-i serum (Dench) (31Feizi T. Childs R.A. Watanabe K. Hakomori S.I. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 975-980Google Scholar), followed by affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-human IgM antibodies (Pierce). The stained cells were subjected to FACS analysis using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) as described previously (32Ohyama C. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1516-1525Google Scholar). HeLa cells were chosen as recipient cells for transfection because the molecular mass of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1, a major carrier of poly-N-acetyllactosamines (33Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21327-21330Google Scholar), is the smallest among Namalwa, HL-60, CHO, HepG2, and HeLa cells. The results indicated that HeLa cells express minimum amounts of β3GlcNAcTs because poly-N-acetyllactosaminylated lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 displays a higher molecular mass than lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 containing minimum amounts of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (33Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21327-21330Google Scholar). To determine which β3GlcNAcT directs expression of MECA-79 antigen, Lec2 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA1-LSST and one of the pcDNA3.1(N)-β3GlcNAcTs or pcDNA1.1-β3GlcNAcT-3. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were dissociated into monodispersed cells using the cell dissociation solution as described above. Monodispersed cells were incubated with MECA-79 antibody (BD Biosciences) (19Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Google Scholar), followed by affinity-purified FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM antibody (ICN Biochemicals). The stained cells were subjected to FACS analysis as described above. CHO mutant Lec2 cells lack a functional Golgi CMP-sialic acid transporter; and therefore, sialylation is absent in Lec2 cells (34Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Google Scholar). The absence of sialylation facilitates core 1 extension because core 1 extension and sialylation compete with each other for the same acceptor, Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→R. To determine which β3GlcNAcT can add β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine to core 1, Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→R, Lec2 cells were transiently transfected with pZeoSV-PSGL-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Cummings) and vectors encoding β3GlcNAcT using LipofectAMINE as described previously (12Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J.-C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 79-89Google Scholar). The ratio of pZeoSV-PSGL-1 and β3GlcNAcT cDNA was 1:5 (w/w) to achieve efficient modification of PSGL-1 by β3GlcNAcT. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline with a cell scraper. The cells were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing to disrupt the plasma membrane. The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant membrane fraction was first resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and then 10% Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. After gentle rocking at 4 °C for 15 min, the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction, containing PSGL-1, was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane fraction was then lysed in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter, the blot was reacted with anti-PSGL-1 antibody (KPL-1, BD Biosciences), followed by secondary antibody; and immunoreactive PSGL-1 was visualized using enhanced Luminol reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human neutrophils and lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of a volunteer as described previously (35Clark R.A. Nuaseef W.M. Coligan J.E. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 7.23.1-7.23.17Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was drawn in a syringe containing heparin, and erythrocytes were sedimented by dextran/saline solution, obtaining leukocyte-rich plasma in the upper layer. Ficoll-Paque Plus solution (Amersham Biosciences) was added beneath this layer and centrifuged. Mononuclear cells enriched with lymphocytes were isolated from the saline/Ficoll interface. The pellet from the above centrifugation was enriched with neutrophils, which were isolated after hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Total RNA was isolated from neutrophils and lymphocytes using TRIzol. RT-PCR of β3GlcNAcT-3 (18Yeh J.-C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B.

Using isolated RNA from respective cells as a template, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using RNase H− reverse transcriptase. PCR was carried out using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and the following PCR primers: β3GlcNAcT-3, 5′-TTCTTCAACCTCACGCTCAAGCAG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AGCATCTCATAAGGTAGGAAGCGG-3′ (3′-primer); Core2GlcNAcT-I, 5′-TGAAATGCTTGACAGGCTGCTGAG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-GGTGTTTCGAGTGGAGGAAGCATT-3′ (3′-primer); LSST, 5′-GGGAGATCTCATGATTGACAGTCG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-TAGTGGATTTGCTCAGGGACAGTC-3′ (3′-primer); FucT-VII, 5′-GTCAGCAACTTCCAGGAGCGGCA-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-TCAAGGTCCTCATAGACTTGGCTG-3′ (3′-primer); PSGL-1, 5′-CCCTGTCCACAGAACCCAGTGC-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-GAAGCTGTGCAGGGTGAGGTCAT-3′ (3′-primer); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCTGGCCAAGGTCATCCATGACA-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-ATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGCT-3′ (3′-primer) or 5′-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACA-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-ACATGGCCTCCAAGGAGTAAGA-3′ (3′-primer). The last primer pair was included in the human digestive system multiple tissue cDNA panel. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. To confirm that the PCR products were derived from respective transcripts, RT-PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose. CHO cells were first transfected with pZeoSV-PSGL-1 and selected in the presence of 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). CHO colonies stably expressing PSGL-1 were selected after staining with anti-PSGL-1 antibody KPL-1, establishing CHO-PSGL-1 cells. CHO-PSGL-1 cells were stably cotransfected with pcDNA1.1-β3GlcNAcT-3 (core 1 β3GlcNAcT) and pSV-hygromycin and selected in 100 μg/ml Zeocin and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Expression of β3GlcNAcT-3 was shown by the expression of larger forms of PSGL-1 that contains extended core 1 O-glycans (see also “Results”). The resultant CHO-PSGL-1/C1 cells were then cotransfected with pCDM8-FucT-VII and pcDNA3 and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). CHO-PSGL-1/C1 cells stably expressing FucT-VII were selected after staining with anti-sialyl Lewis x antibody (CSELX-1), resulting in CHO-PSGL-1/F7/C1 cells. In parallel, CHO-PSGL-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA1.1-Core2GlcNAcT-I together with pcDNA3 and cultured in the presence of 100 μg/ml Zeocin and 400 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells expressing Core2GlcNAcT-I were chosen for expressing larger forms of PSGL-1 that contains core 2 branched O-glycans. Expression of core 2 O-glycans was confirmed after transient transfection of CD43 (also called leukosialin) and staining with T305 antibody, resulting in CHO-PSGL-1/C2 cells. As reported previously, T305 reacts with core 2 branched O-glycans attached to CD43 (4Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Google Scholar, 38Piller F. Le Deist F. Weinberg K. Parkman R. Fukuda M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1501-1510Google Scholar). CHO-PSGL-1/C2 cells were stably transfected with pCDM8-FucT-VII and pSV-hygromycin and cultured in the presence of Zeocin, hygromycin B, and Geneticin. Cells expressing FucT-VII were selected after staining with CSELX-1 antibody, resulting in CHO-PSGL-1/F7/C2 cells. As a control, CHO-PSGL-1 cells were stably transfected with pCDM8-FucT-VII and pcDNA3 and cultured in the presence of Zeocin and Geneticin. Cells expressing FucT-VII were selected after staining with CSELX-1 antibody, resulting in CHO-PSGL-1/F7 cells. cDNA encoding PSGL-1/IgG chimeric protein was constructed using pZeoSV-PSGL-1 and pcDNA3.1-IgG essentially as described previously (12Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J.-C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 79-89Google Scholar), resulting in pcDNA3.1-PSGL-1/IgG. CHO-PSGL-1/F7/C1, CHO-PSGL-1/F7/C2, and CHO-PSGL-1/F7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-PSGL-1/IgG as described previously (12Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J.-C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 79-89Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were cultured in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 100 μm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, and 20 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PSGL-1/IgG chimeric protein was isolated using ImmunoPure immobilized protein A (Pierce) from the medium obtained after 48 h of additional culture as described previously (12Hiraoka N. Petryniak B.

https://openalex.org/W2169514498,"We explored the role of known copper transporters and chaperones in delivering copper to peptidylglycine-α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), a copper-dependent enzyme that functions in the secretory pathway lumen. We examined the roles of yeast Ccc2, a P-type ATPase related to human ATP7A (Menkes disease protein) and ATP7B (Wilson disease protein), as well as yeast Atx1, a cytosolic copper chaperone. We expressed soluble PHMcc (catalytic core) in yeast using the yeast pre-pro-α-mating factor leader region to target the enzyme to the secretory pathway. Although the yeast genome encodes no PHM-like enzyme, PHMcc expressed in yeast is at least as active as PHMcc produced by mammalian cells. PHMcc partially co-migrated with a Golgi marker during subcellular fractionation and partially co-localized with Ccc2 based on immunofluorescence. To determine whether production of active PHM was dependent on copper trafficking pathways involving the CCC2 or ATX1 genes, we expressed PHMcc in wild-type, ccc2, and atx1mutant yeast. Although ccc2 and atx1 mutant yeast produce normal levels of PHMcc protein, it lacks catalytic activity. Addition of exogenous copper yields fully active PHMcc. Similarly, production of active PHM in mouse fibroblasts is impaired in the presence of a mutant ATP7A gene. Although delivery of copper to lumenal cuproproteins like PAM involves ATP7A, lumenal chaperones may not be required.

For example, cytochromec oxidase is essential for respiration, superoxide dismutase is essential for free radical detoxification, lysyl oxidase is essential for maturation for connective tissue, ceruloplasmin is essential for iron uptake, tyrosinase is essential for melanin synthesis, and dopamine ॆ-monooxygenase is essential for catecholamine formation (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991: 4Google Scholar). Another important copper-dependent enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM),1 catalyzes the C-terminal amidation of glycine-extended peptide precursors, a modification essential for the bioactivity of numerous hormones and neuropeptides (2Merkler D.J. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1994; 16: 450-456Google Scholar, 3Bell J. Ash D.E. Snyder L.M. Kulathila R. Blackburn N.J. Merkler D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16239-16246Google Scholar, 4Kulathila R.

Peptide amidation occurs in two consecutive steps that require the peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase (PAL) domains of the bifunctional PAM protein (see Fig. 1). This reaction can be initiated in the trans-Golgi network but occurs primarily within secretory granules (6Schnabel E. Mains R.E. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1223-1235Google Scholar, 7El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Google Scholar). Production of amidated peptides by PAM requires copper and molecular oxygen and two reducing equivalents, usually supplied by two molecules of ascorbate. The PHM domain of PAM binds copper at two non-equivalent sites (CuA and CuB), both of which are critical for activity (8Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.W. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10901-10909Google Scholar). Each copper atom is reduced by transfer of a single electron from ascorbate, generating semidehydroascorbate. Copper is bound by three His residues at the CuA site (His107, His108, His172) and by two His residues and a Met residue at the CuB site (His242, His244, Met314) (9Prigge S.T. Kolhekar A.S. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 976-983Google Scholar). The process by which copper is delivered to the PHM domain of PAM in the secretory pathway is unknown. P-type ATPases are likely to play a role in copper transport into the secretory pathway. Two copper transporting P-type ATPase genes,ATP7A and ATP7B (10Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Google Scholar, 11Tanzi R.E. Petrukhin K. Chernov I. Pellequer J.L. Wasco W. Ross B. Romano D.M. Parano E. Pavone L. Brzustowicz L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 344-350Google Scholar), were identified in studies of inherited disorders of human copper metabolism (12Llanos R.M. Mercer J. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 259-270Google Scholar). Mutations in the ATP7A gene lead to Menkes disease, a disorder characterized by copper deficiency. ATP7A is expressed in all tissues except the liver, and mutations in ATP7A prevent normal intestinal absorption of copper and distribution of copper throughout the body. The resulting lack of copper compromises the function of many tissues, resulting in death in early childhood. Mutations in the ATP7B gene cause Wilson disease, which is characterized by failure of the liver to excrete copper into the biliary tract or to deliver copper to ceruloplasmin, a multi-copper oxidase needed for serum iron homeostasis (13Hellman N.E. Gitlin J.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 439-458Google Scholar). The prevalence of ATP7B in the liver means that protein mutations result in liver toxicity because of the accumulation of copper. Although tissue-specific, both disorders involve a defect in P-type ATPase-mediated export of copper from the cytosol into the secretory/endocytic pathways (14Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Google Scholar). Due in large part to the clarity that yeast genetics brings to the analysis of protein function, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model organism for studying many fundamental processes of eukaryotic cells (15Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Google Scholar). The importance of oxidative metabolism to eukaryotic cells has led to conservation of mechanisms of copper metabolism from yeast to human cells. Indeed, it has been shown that the molecular components of copper trafficking pathways are highly conserved between yeast and humans. In S. cerevisiae, the pathway begins with Cu+ uptake through the action of copper transporters Ctr1 and Ctr3 (16Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar, 17Knight S.A. Labbe S.F. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, copper is bound by cytoplasmic copper chaperones that deliver the metal to specific target enzymes (18O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Google Scholar). The Atx1 copper chaperone delivers copper to Ccc2, the only yeast homologue of the mammalian Wilson and Menkes ATPases (19Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Google Scholar). Ccc2 is required for transport of copper from the cytosol into the lumen of the trans-Golgi network, where the multi-copper ferroxidase Fet3, the yeast homolog of ceruloplasmin, is loaded with copper (20Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar, 21Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Google Scholar). The yeast genome does not encode a PHM or a PAL homolog. In the present study, we determined whether active PHM could be produced in the yeast secretory pathway and whether its production requires the assistance of known copper transporters and chaperones. In particular, the roles of the P-type ATPase Ccc2 and the cytosolic copper chaperone Atx1 were investigated. We expressed soluble rat PHMcc (PHMcatalytic core) using the yeast α-mating factor leader sequence to target the enzyme to the yeast secretory pathway (Fig. 1). We compared the activity of PHMcc produced in yeast to that of PHMcc produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation, we established that PHMcc was partially co-localized with Golgi markers and Ccc2 in yeast cells. Using gene knockouts, we established an essential role for the secretory pathway copper transporter Ccc2 and the cytosolic copper chaperone Atx1 in producing active PHMcc in yeast. Finally, we demonstrated that active Menkes protein, a mammalian homologue of Ccc2, can support production of active PHM in fibroblasts. Strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study are isogenic to wild-type YPH252 (Matα ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1-Δ1his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). In ccc2mutant cells (ccc2Δ::URA3,URA- by 5-fluoroorotic acid, strain MP103 (23Portnoy M.E. Rosenzweig A.C. Rae T. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15041-15045Google Scholar)), theCCC2 gene was replaced with the URA3 gene. Theatx1Δ::LEU2 cells (strain SL215 (19Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Google Scholar)) were in the same background but derived from the opposite mating type parental strain (YPH250). Strain stocks were maintained on standard YPD (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) medium. Cultures for experimental analysis were obtained by growth in a synthetic minimal medium containing dextrose (SD) (24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar) or in low copper defined medium prepared by using a metal-depleted nitrogen base supplemented with all essential metals except copper (i.e.1.4 mm CaCl2, 3.2 ॖmMnSO4, 2.9 ॖm ZnSO4, 4.2 mm MgSO4, 1.6 ॖmFeCl2) (Difco Manual). We expressed PHMcc protein using a yeast α-mating factor signal sequence. Soluble and integral membrane PAM proteins (PAM-3 and PAM-2) expressed in yeast with the rat PAM signal sequence were not directed to the secretory pathway, remained cytosolic, and exhibited no enzyme activity, even in the presence of added copper (data not shown). pSM703.αMF-PHMcc was generated by PCR amplification of PHMcc (amino acids 42–356 of rat PAM-1; nucleotides 421–1365) from pBS.PAM-1, which encodes full-length PAM-1 (25Stoffers D.A. Green C.B. Eipper B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 735-739Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into the pICK9 vector (Invitrogen) using the unique XhoI and NotI sites; pICK9.PHMcc, containing the PHM fragment with the αMF pre-pro-sequence (amino acids 1–81) and a LEKR linker, was digested with BamHI andNotI. The digested PHMcc product was ligated into the same sites of the pICK9K vector (Invitrogen). A multi-copy αMF-PHMcc plasmid, pSM703.αMF-PHMcc, was constructed by inserting theBamHI-NotI αMF-PHMcc fragment of pICK9K.PHMcc into the 2ॖ URA3 plasmid pSM703 (26Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Google Scholar). As described by Yuanet al. (21Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Google Scholar), the pDY207.Ccc2-HA vector fused the 3′-end of the CCC2 coding sequence with sequences encoding three tandem copies of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag followed by two stop codons and the CYC1 terminator. The PAM-1 recombinant adenovirus (PAM-1 virus) encodes full-length rat PAM-1 (nucleotides 293–3245); its preparation was described previously (27El Meskini R. Galano G.J. Marx R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3384-3393Google Scholar,28Marx R. El Meskini R. Johns D.C. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8300-8311Google Scholar). The murine mottled fibroblast cell line 802-1 (Mo−/Y, Mt−/+), and the corresponding wild-type cell line 802-5 (Mo+/Y, Mt−/+) were a gift from Dr. Jonathan D. Gitlin (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal clone III bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) as described previously (29Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Google Scholar). Cells were used 48 h after PAM-1 virus infection (28Marx R. El Meskini R. Johns D.C. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8300-8311Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of PAM-expressing S. cerevisiae cells, the yeast strains transformed with pSM703 vector or vector encoding αMF-PHMcc were harvested at mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 1) in regular SD medium or low copper SD medium (less than 0.25 ॖm copper) minus uracil. Yeast cell extracts were prepared by glass bead homogenization in 20 mm sodium (N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) (TES)/TMT (10 mm mannitol, 17 Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, and 1 mm bathocuproinedisulfonate to limit the availability of copper during extraction as described previously (20Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). To analyze PAM expression in mammalian fibroblasts, the 802-1 and 802-5 cells, grown as described above, were scraped into TMT buffer containing protease inhibitors, frozen and thawed three times, and centrifuged for 5 min to remove cell debris (27El Meskini R. Galano G.J. Marx R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3384-3393Google Scholar). With either yeast or mammalian expression systems, samples were resolved by 8 or 127 SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by Western blot using rabbit polyclonal antiserum to PHM (JH1761) and the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). PHM activity was measured in yeast and mammalian cell extracts as described previously (8Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.W. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10901-10909Google Scholar) using α-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly as substrate. Protein (30 to 50 ng) was assayed in the presence or absence of 0.5 ॖmCuSO4 as indicated, in duplicate, and reactions were carried out for 2 h. PHM specific activity is expressed as picomoles of product formed per h (units) per microgram of protein. Yeast strain YPH252 transformed with pSM703 vector (26Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Google Scholar), pSM703.αMF-PHMcc, pDY207 vector, pDY207.CCC2-HA (21Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Google Scholar), or both pSM703.αMF-PHMcc and pDY207.CCC2-HA were used for indirect immunofluorescence staining according to standard procedures (30Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Google Scholar, 31Portnoy M.E. Liu X. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to an A600 of 1 in selecting SD medium, fixed with 47 formaldehyde, digested with zymolase, and incubated overnight with PHM antiserum (JH1761) or purified mouse HA antibody (HA.11; BabCo, Richmond, CA). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Caltag, San Francisco, CA) or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Nucleic acids were stained by 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Fluorescence images and Nomarski differential interference contrast images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV microscope (Microscopy Facility, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions). Where indicated, a Noran confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope was used. Two signals, fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) and Cy3 (red), were collected simultaneously from yeast cells in optical sections of 0.2 ॖm. The procedure for subcellular fractionation of yeast cells is based on sedimentation through sucrose density gradients, as described previously (32Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Google Scholar), but with some modifications. Yeast (YPH252) transformed with pSM703.αMF-PHMcc were grown to log phase (A600 = 1) in SD medium minus uracil. After being chilled on ice, cells (500 optical density units) were harvested by centrifugation at 3700 × gfor 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of cold 10 mm sodium azide and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 ×g. Cells were resuspended to 50 A600units/ml in spheroplast buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium azide, 40 mm mercaptoethanol), and zymolase 20T (ICN Biomedicals) was added to 1.5 mg/ml; cells were converted to spheroplasts by incubating for 45 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking. All further steps were carried out on ice. The spheroplast suspension was adjusted to 1 mm EDTA, layered on top of 8 ml of 1.8m sorbitol, and spheroplasts were centrifuged through the sorbitol cushion by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (0.8m sorbitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of the following protease inhibitors: 2 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 16 ॖg/ml benzamidine, and 300 ॖg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The spheroplast lysate was homogenized with a tissue grinder (Kontes Scientific Glassware) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g to remove unlysed cells and debris. The resulting supernatant (1 ml) was layered onto a step gradient containing 1 ml each of 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, and 547 sucrose (w/v) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2. Gradients were centrifuged for 2.5 h at 174,000 × g in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C. Fractions (660 ॖl) were collected from the top, and an equal aliquot of each fraction was analyzed. For Western blot analysis, 50 ॖl of aliquot of each fraction was used for SDS-PAGE as described above. Reactions (25 ॖl of each fraction) were carried out in a total volume of 100 ॖl, except for NADPH-cytochrome c reductase assays, which were carried out in a volume of 1 ml. Vacuolar α-mannosidase was assayed through the generation of p-nitrophenol fromp-nitrophenyl-α-mannopyranoside, which leads to an increase in A400. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.4 mm p-nitrophenyl-α-mannopyranoside, 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5 (33Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 121-130Google Scholar). GDPase was assayed as described by Abeijon et al. (34Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Google Scholar). Incubation tubes contained 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 2 mmCaCl2, 7 mm GDP, and 0.17 Triton X-100. Liberated phosphate was measured with the Fiske Subbarow kit (Sigma). Nonspecific NDPase plus free Pi were determined using CDP as a nonspecific substrate. These values were subtracted from those obtained with the substrate GDP to give GDPase activity. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was assayed by the absorbance increase at 550 nm according to Feldman et al. (35Feldman R.I. Bernstein M. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9332-9339Google Scholar). Assay mixtures (1 ml) contained 1.0 mg/ml cytochrome c, 100 ॖm NADPH, 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.4 mm KCN, 1.0 ॖm FMN, and 0.6 m sorbitol. Reaction rates were determined from the initial linear phase of the assay. The yeast genome does not encode a protein homologous to PHM or to any of the other members of this family of copper-containing monooxygenases; the amino acid sequence of rat PHMcc was compared with the S. cerevisiaegenome using BLASTN 2.2.3 (Apr-24–2002) (NCBI) (36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar). To determine whether we could use S. cerevisiae to identify proteins involved in the delivery of copper to PHM, we first expressed soluble PHMcc in S. cerevisiae and analyzed cell extracts and medium for PHM activity. We fused the αMF signal/pro-region to the catalytic core of rat PHM (αMF-PHMcc) to direct the foreign monooxygenase into the yeast secretory pathway. With its pro-region, αMF-PHMcc should have a mass of 41 kDa. Transformation of wild-type yeast with vector encoding αMF-PHMcc led to expression of a 34-kDa protein recognized by antiserum to rat PHMcc (Fig. 2), indicating that the αMF pro-region had been removed. Vector alone yielded only a smaller, nonspecific cross-reactive protein. PHMcc secreted by stably transfected CHO cells consistently had a slightly higher apparent molecular mass (36 kDa) than the cross-reactive product detected in yeast extracts. Although an LEKR sequence separated the αMF pro-region from PHMcc, the exact site of endoproteolytic cleavage was not determined, and this difference in mass may reflect different trimming or nicking of PHMcc in yeast and CHO cells. Extracts prepared from wild-type yeast contained no detectable PHM activity (<0.01 units/ॖg protein). Control experiments demonstrated complete recovery of exogenous rat PHMcc activity added to yeast extract (1 ॖg protein) and assayed in the presence of 0.5 ॖm exogenous copper (data not shown). Extracts prepared from yeast expressing αMF-PHMcc contained 5.4 ± 0.5 units/ॖg of protein when assayed under the same conditions. To compare the specific activity of PHMcc expressed in yeast with that of PHMcc secreted by stably transfected CHO cells (with PHM specific activity of 9000 ± 500 units/ॖg of protein) (8Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.W. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10901-10909Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), the amount of PHMcc protein was estimated based on cross-reactivity with an antiserum specific to rat PHMcc (37Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Google Scholar). PHMcc expressed in yeast is at least as active as PHMcc secreted by mammalian cells; for the same amount of PHM enzyme activity (25 or 125 units), less PHM protein is present in the yeast lysate than in the mammalian cell medium. Despite the fact that the α-mating factor-PHMcc construct yields a soluble, active protein, PHMcc is secreted very poorly, accumulating in post-Golgi vesicles. Secreted PHM could be detected in lyophilized yeast growth medium by Western blot analysis; however PHM activity was not detectable (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was utilized to determine the subcellular localization of PHMcc in yeast. Cells expressing PHMcc were fixed and visualized with a PHM antiserum (Fig.3A). PHM staining was observed in punctate structures reminiscent of Golgi-like vesicles. The punctate PHM staining pattern was similar to that obtained for proteins thought to be associated with Golgi or post-Golgi vesicles (38Franzusoff A. Redding K. Crosby J. Fuller R.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 27-37Google Scholar, 39Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Google Scholar, 40Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Google Scholar), with some puncta significantly larger than others. The staining is specific for PHMcc, as only very faint homogeneous staining was observed in cells transformed with empty vector (Fig.3A). The 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining profile (Fig. 3A, middle panel) demonstrated that PHMcc is neither nuclear nor perinuclear and is not associated with mitochondria. Comparison of the distribution of PHMcc to the differential interference contrast optics images (Fig.3A, right panel) demonstrated that PHMcc is not vacuole-associated. The yeast copper transporter Ccc2 is known to reside in post-Golgi vesicles (21Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Google Scholar, 41Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar). To evaluate a functional connection between Ccc2 and PHMcc, we compared the subcellular localization of expressed PHMcc with that of an epitope-tagged version of Ccc2 (Fig. 3A). Yeast of the wild-type strain, transformed with vectors encoding both PHMcc and HA-tagged Ccc2, were stained simultaneously with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to PHM and a mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA tag and examined using confocal microscopy (Fig. 3B). PHM staining (in green) and Ccc2-HA staining (in red) were superimposed. As shown in the merged image (Fig. 3B), PHMcc and Ccc2 were sometimes localized to the same vesicular structures (Fig. 3B, arrows). However, the distributions of Ccc2 and PHMcc were not identical, with some vesicles staining more intensely for PHM (arrowheads) and others staining more intensely for Ccc2 (lines). Based on their subcellular localization, Ccc2 and PHMcc have access to the same subcellular compartments. As might be expected for an integral membrane protein and a soluble, secretory protein, transient co-localization of Ccc2 and PHMcc was observed. To confirm our conclusion that PHMcc is at least transiently localized to the Golgi compartment of the secretory pathway, subcellular fractionation was carried out. Extracts prepared from wild-type yeast expressing PHMcc were subjected to velocity sedimentation through sucrose gradients. The various subcellular compartments were identified in gradient fractions by measuring enzymatic markers characteristic of each organelle (Fig.4). The distribution of PHMcc protein was determined by Western blot analysis. The bulk of the PHM was found in fractions 8 though 11. The higher molecular mass cross-reactive protein localized in fractions 1 through 5 corresponds to a nonspecific band visualized in the same gradient fractions of yeast cells transformed with expression vector alone. The Golgi marker GDPase (34Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Google Scholar) was also localized to fractions 8 through 11. PHMcc was clearly separated from the endoplasmic reticulum marker (35Feldman R.I. Bernstein M. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9332-9339Google Scholar), NADPH-cytochrome reductase, which was highly localized to fraction 13, and from the vacuolar marker (33Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 121-130Google Scholar), α-mannosidase, which was concentrated in fraction 3 (Fig. 4B). Based on both immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation, the bulk of PHMcc is localized to the Golgi complex in S. cerevisiae at steady state. Because active PHM can be produced in wild-type yeast, mutant yeast were used to assess the role of specific copper transporters and chaperones in providing copper to PHM. In yeast, the cytosolic copper chaperone Atx1 shuttles copper to Ccc2, an intracellular copper transporter that is localized to the membranes of the Golgi compartment (18O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Google Scholar, 19Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Google Scholar, 42Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Google Scholar, 43Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Google Scholar). This transporter pumps copper into the lumen of the Golgi complex, making it available for insertion into copper-dependent lumenal enzymes. To assess the role of Ccc2 and the cytosolic copper chaperone Atx1 in providing copper to PHM, we expressed PHMcc in yeast bearing mutations in theCCC2 or ATX1 genes (Fig.5). As shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A), equal expression of PHMcc protein was observed in wild-type yeast and in ccc2 and atx1 mutant cells. We next compared the catalytic activity of PHMcc produced in wild-type,ccc2, and atx1 mutant cells. Because the addition of exogenous copper or the binding of copper made accessible following homogenization could obscure any deficits present in PHMcc expressed inccc2 or atx1 mutant cells, we varied the assay conditions. Reduced ascorbate was added to the extraction buffer to promote retention of bound copper (by keeping it reduced), and bathocuproinedisulfonic acid was supplemented to ensure that any free copper was made inaccessible (20Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). When assayed without added copper ions, no PHM"
https://openalex.org/W2067613942,"The physiological properties of most ion channels are defined experimentally by functional expression of their pore-forming α subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Here, we cloned a family ofXenopus KCNE genes that encode MinK-related peptide K+ channel ॆ subunits (xMiRPs) and demonstrated their constitutive expression in oocytes. Electrophysiological analysis of xMiRP2 revealed that when overexpressed this gene modulates human cardiac K+ channel α subunits HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) and KCNQ1 by suppressing HERG currents and removing the voltage dependence of KCNQ1 activation. The ability of endogenous levels of xMiRP2 to contribute to the biophysical attributes of overexpressed mammalian K+ channels in oocyte studies was assessed next. Injection of an xMiRP2 sequence-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) oligo reduced endogenous xMiRP2 expression 5-fold, whereas a control siRNA oligo had no effect, indicating the effectiveness of the RNA interference technique in Xenopus oocytes. The functional effects of endogenous xMiRP2 silencing were tested using electrophysiological analysis of heterologously expressed HERG channels. The RNA interference-mediated reduction of endogenous xMiRP2 expression increased macroscopic HERG current as much as 10-fold depending on HERG cRNA concentration. The functional effects of human MiRP1 (hMiRP1)/HERG interaction were also affected by endogenous xMiRP2. At high HERG channel density, at which the effects of endogenous xMiRP2 are minimal, hMiRP1 reduced HERG current. At low HERG current density, hMiRP1 paradoxically up-regulated HERG current, a result consistent with hMiRP1 rescuing HERG from suppression by endogenous xMiRP2. Thus, endogenous Xenopus MiRP subunits contribute to the base-line properties of K+ channels like HERG in oocyte expression studies, which could explain expression level- and expression system-dependent variation in K+channel function.AF545500AF545501AF545502 The physiological properties of most ion channels are defined experimentally by functional expression of their pore-forming α subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Here, we cloned a family ofXenopus KCNE genes that encode MinK-related peptide K+ channel ॆ subunits (xMiRPs) and demonstrated their constitutive expression in oocytes. Electrophysiological analysis of xMiRP2 revealed that when overexpressed this gene modulates human cardiac K+ channel α subunits HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) and KCNQ1 by suppressing HERG currents and removing the voltage dependence of KCNQ1 activation. The ability of endogenous levels of xMiRP2 to contribute to the biophysical attributes of overexpressed mammalian K+ channels in oocyte studies was assessed next. Injection of an xMiRP2 sequence-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) oligo reduced endogenous xMiRP2 expression 5-fold, whereas a control siRNA oligo had no effect, indicating the effectiveness of the RNA interference technique in Xenopus oocytes. The functional effects of endogenous xMiRP2 silencing were tested using electrophysiological analysis of heterologously expressed HERG channels. The RNA interference-mediated reduction of endogenous xMiRP2 expression increased macroscopic HERG current as much as 10-fold depending on HERG cRNA concentration. The functional effects of human MiRP1 (hMiRP1)/HERG interaction were also affected by endogenous xMiRP2. At high HERG channel density, at which the effects of endogenous xMiRP2 are minimal, hMiRP1 reduced HERG current. At low HERG current density, hMiRP1 paradoxically up-regulated HERG current, a result consistent with hMiRP1 rescuing HERG from suppression by endogenous xMiRP2. Thus, endogenous Xenopus MiRP subunits contribute to the base-line properties of K+ channels like HERG in oocyte expression studies, which could explain expression level- and expression system-dependent variation in K+channel function.AF545500AF545501AF545502 voltage-gated potassium channel MinK-related peptide human MiRP Chinese hamster ovary RNA interference short interfering RNA two-electrode voltage clamp slow activating potassium current rapidly activating potassium current transient outward current reverse transcriptase expressed sequence tag 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Voltage-gated potassium (Kv)1 channels form an aqueous pore through the plasma membrane by the assembly of four α subunits, each with six transmembrane helices and a pore loop (1Yellen G. Nature. 2002; 419: 35-42Google Scholar). The favored method for evaluating potassium channel function is by microinjection of channel cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes to facilitate two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) or patch clamp studies. However, observed differences in the behavior of potassium channel genes when expressed in oocytes compared with mammalian cells suggest that endogenous factors in either or both systems dictate channel properties to some extent (2Seebohm G.

Further, because ॆ subunits alter the sensitivity and functional effects of both therapeutic and unwanted drug interactions and are linked to drug-induced long QT syndrome, the assignment of both α and ॆ subunits to native currents is essential for drug screening and rational drug design (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar,15Sesti F. Abbott G.W. Wei J. Murray K.T. Saksena S. Schwartz P.J. Priori S.G. Roden D.M. George Jr., A.L. Goldstein S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10613-10618Google Scholar). Previous studies using either Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells as expression systems have produced conflicting reports and often no consensus as to the functional consequences of α-ॆ subunit interactions, particularly in the case of HERG, which interacts with human MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar, 9Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R.

In addition, many investigators report that within a single study the properties of heterologously expressed MiRP/α subunit currents vary with the expression system or with the concentration of MiRP cRNA, even at levels where α-subunit saturation would be expected (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar, 16Zhang M. Jiang M. Tseng G.N. Circ.

Med. 2002; 80: 524-532Google Scholar). This finding suggests that these interactions depend on factors intrinsic to the expression system used. Clearly, resolving the true heteromultimeric identity of native ion channels and currents recorded in heterologous expression studies is important for our understanding of channel structure-function and physiology. Here we cloned a family of xMiRPs endogenously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and demonstrated that xMiRP2 interacts with overexpressed HERG to shape the functional attributes of HERG during oocyte expression studies. xMinK, xMiRP2, xMIRP4.1, and xMiRP4.2 were cloned from cDNA isolated by RT-PCR from stages V and VIX. laevis oocyte mRNA using primer sequences as follows: xMinK, 5′-ATGCCAGGGTTAAACACCACTGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGTTGCTGGG AGAAGAGGGGATATA-3′(reverse); XMIRP2, 5′-CAGTTTGATTGGAGAGTGGGATTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGACCCCTGGGGCCTCGTC-3′ (reverse); xMIRP4.1, 5′-ATGAATTGTAGTAATACTTCTC GT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAAAGTAAGTTTTCACTTTCAATACT-3′ (reverse); xMIRP4.2, 5′-CGGGAATCAGACTTCTGTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTTTACAGGATACACAGTAGC-3′ (reverse). Genes were identified by a BLAST search of EST data bases with mammalian KCNE gene sequences using the tblastn algorithm. All genes showed a canonical initiation ATG site with G at −3, A at +3, and no intervening methionines 3′ of the nearest 5′ stop codon. For functional expression, xMiRP2 was ligated into pGA1 and linearized with SacI for transcription of cRNA for injection into oocytes. For studies in oocytes, cRNA transcripts for xMiRP2, human MiRP1 (hMiRP1) (in pGA1), hKCNQ1 (in a pBluescript-based vector), and HERG (in pSP64, Promega) were produced as described previously (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar). To avoid dilution errors, all oocytes were injected first with the appropriate α subunit cRNA and then immediately afterward with modifying ॆ subunits or short interfering RNA (siRNA). For studies in CHO cells, cDNAs in pCINeo (Promega) were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (in pBOB) using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), and currents were recorded 24–36 h later. For RNAi, 500 pg of double-stranded siRNA 21-mer oligos (Dharmacon) corresponding to bases 104–124 of xMiRP2 (top strand 5′-AAGGGAACCACACGGACGCCA-3′) was injected into oocytes immediately after the injection of α subunit cRNA. siRNA oligo for xMiRP2 was co-transfected into CHO cells with the appropriate channel cDNA. For the assessment of RNAi gene silencing at the mRNA level, an equal amount of oocytes was injected either with xMiRP2 cRNA or scrambled control siRNA, and RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) on the same day that functional experiments were carried out and on the same batch of oocytes. RNA concentration was measured by spectrophotometry (SmartSpec3000; Bio-Rad), and RT-PCR was performed with Xenopus ॆ-actin primers (forward, 5′-AAGGAGACAGTCTGTGTGCGTCCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CAACATGATTTCTGCAAGAGCTCC-3′) to normalize mRNA concentration. The optical density of samples run on a 17 agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide was measured using a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Samples normalized to ॆ-actin cDNA concentration were subsequently amplified using xMiRP2-specific primers, and optical density was quantified. Whole-cell currents in oocytes were recorded at room temperature by TEVC using an OC-725C Amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), an IBM computer, and pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data analysis was performed using CLAMPFIT (Axon Instruments). Bath solution was (in mm) 4 KCl, 96 NaCl, 0.7 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Whole-cell currents were recorded at room temperature in CHO cells using a Multiclamp 700A Amplifier (Axon Instruments), an IBM computer, and pCLAMP8 software. Cells were studied on an inverted microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics for green fluorescent protein detection. The bath solution was composed of (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 CaCl2, and 10 d-glucose (pH 7.4). Pipettes were of 3–5 Megaohms resistance when filled with intracellular solution containing (in mm) 10 NaCl, 117 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 11 HEPES, 11 EGTA, and CaCl2 (pH 7.2). Oocytes were lysed with: (in mm) 150 NaCl, 0.2 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 NaF, 10 Na3VO4, 50 Tris (pH 7.4), and the following detergents: 17 Nonidet P-40, 17 CHAPS, 17 Triton X-100, and 0.57 SDS. Samples were clarified by two separate centrifugations at 10,000 × g for 20 min before the addition of standard SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separation by SDS-PAGE on 157 or 4–207 gradient gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Western blots were performed with an in-house primary antibody raised by injection into rabbits of a mammalian expression vector expressing full-length hMiRP2. Detection was via goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) for fluorography. Band intensities for assessment of RNAi efficiency at the protein level were quantified as for cDNA bands. Xenopus EST data bases were searched with mammalian KCNE gene sequences, leading to the identification of four Xenopus clones designated here as xMinK, xMiRP2, xMiRP4.1, and xMiRP4.2 on the basis of their closest mammalian KCNE relatives. The four Xenopus genes were subsequently cloned from cDNA isolated by RT-PCR from stages V and VIXenopus oocyte mRNA (Fig.1). Homologues of mammalian MiRP1 and MiRP3 were not detected in Xenopus EST data bases. Mammalian MiRP2 co-assembles with several diverse Kv channel α subunits, removing the voltage dependence of KCNQ1 (9Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Google Scholar), suppressing HERG current without altering gating kinetics (9Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Google Scholar, 11Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 390-400Google Scholar), and converting Kv3.4 to a subthreshold-activating delayed rectifier (7Abbott G.W. Butler M.H. Bendahhou S. Dalakas M.C. Ptacek L.J. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 217-231Google Scholar). Here we investigated the effects of the interaction between xMiRP2 and the cardiac-delayed rectifiers HERG and KCNQ1. Effects of human MiRP2 on Kv3.4 are pronounced in mammalian cells but not in Xenopusoocytes (7Abbott G.W. Butler M.H. Bendahhou S. Dalakas M.C. Ptacek L.J. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 217-231Google Scholar). This interaction was not covered here but is currently under study. Injection of HERG cRNA into oocytes resulted in the expression of rapidly inactivating delayed rectifier K+currents that passed large tail currents during a −30-mV tail pulse because of rapid recovery from inactivation and slow deactivation. Co-injection of xMiRP2 cRNA with HERG in oocytes resulted in the complete suppression of HERG current (Fig.2, A and B). The results demonstrate that xMiRP2 functions like hMiRP2 to strongly inhibit HERG current when it is overexpressed in Xenopusoocytes. Overexpression of xMiRP2 with KCNQ1 in oocytes resulted in an increase in the time- and voltage-independent component of KCNQ1 current as observed previously for human MiRP2 (Fig. 2, Cand D). Xenopus MiRP2 can thus modulate human K+ channels when overexpressed in oocytes. To evaluate whether endogenous levels of xKCNEsubunits are sufficient to modulate cloned mammalian Kvchannel α subunits expressed in oocytes, we tested the applicability in oocytes of the RNAi sequence-specific post-transcriptional silencing technique that has been shown to suppress gene expression in a variety of other cell types (30Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Google Scholar). A double-stranded xMiRP2-specific, siRNA oligo was injected into Xenopus oocytes, and the effects were compared against those of a scrambled control siRNA oligo. To ensure that xMiRP2 siRNA was causing a loss of xMiRP2 mRNA, RNA was isolated from oocytes injected with siRNA for xMiRP2, scrambled siRNA, or cRNA for xMiRP2. RT-PCR to produce cDNA was followed by normalization of samples to Xenopus ॆ-actin cDNA concentration (Fig. 3A,top panel). Next, normalized cDNA samples were probed for xMiRP2 cDNA by PCR using sequence-specific primers (Fig.3A, middle panel). Compared with batches of oocytes injected with scrambled control siRNA, the band intensity of amplified xMiRP2 cDNA from batches of oocytes injected with xMiRP2 siRNA was reduced 8-fold as assessed by densitometry (Fig.3A, bottom panel). Injection of 3 ng of xMiRP2 cRNA, in contrast, increased the band intensity of amplified xMiRP2 cRNA 30-fold (n = two batches of 8–12 oocytes). To assess the effects of xMiRP2 siRNA at the protein level, antibodies raised to full-length human KCNE3 and 807 similar to xMiRP2 in the transmembrane and C-terminal domains were used to probe injected oocyte lysates (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Probing the oocyte lysates with anti-MiRP2 antibody gave a band at 15–18 kDa, in the range expected for xMiRP2. Although xMiRP2 has one or more predicted N-glycosylation sites, depending on the prediction method used, only one band was visible here. We concluded therefore that the large majority of xMiRP2 protein present in the oocyte at baseline is in one particular glycosylation state, probably the mature form, as observed previously for mouse MiRP2 in the murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line (7Abbott G.W. Butler M.H. Bendahhou S. Dalakas M.C. Ptacek L.J. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 217-231Google Scholar). Similar levels of xMiRP2 protein were detected in water-injected oocytes and oocytes injected with scrambled control siRNA, whereas oocytes injected with xMiRP2 siRNA showed a 5-fold reduction of endogenous xMiRP2 protein as assessed by densitometry (n = two batches of oocytes) (Fig.3B, lower panel). Thus, RNAi can be used inXenopus oocytes to specifically suppress endogenous genes, in this case xMiRP2. The effects of the suppression of endogenous xMiRP2 expression on injected HERG currents were assessed next. HERG is an especially suitable indicator of endogenous xMiRP2 contribution to heterologously expressed K+ currents, because the unique gating attributes of HERG channels (i.e. rapid inactivation at positive voltages and rapid recovery from inactivation at negative voltages (31Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Google Scholar)) allow the assessment of small HERG tail currents at −30 mV, a voltage at which contamination from other oocyte currents and leaks is negligible. Varying amounts of HERG cRNA were injected into oocytes in the absence or presence of xMiRP2-specific siRNA to silence endogenous xMiRP2, and HERG tail currents were measured by TEVC after 3 days. At levels of HERG cRNA that normally expressed virtually zero HERG tail current (as much as 0.7 ng), co-injection with xMiRP2 siRNA rescued HERG currents to 500 nA as anticipated when an endogenous protein that suppresses HERG is silenced (Fig.4, A and B). Indeed, xMiRP2 silencing increased HERG currents at all concentrations tested below 5 ng of HERG (Fig. 4C). This effect was specific because scrambled control siRNA had no effect (Fig.4D). To eliminate the possibility that xMiRP2 siRNA oligos increased HERG current because of an artifact via direct interaction with HERG protein rather than by post-transcriptional xMiRP2 gene silencing, we switched expression systems and assessed the effects of xMiRP2 siRNA on HERG currents in CHO cells using a whole-cell voltage clamp. xMiRP2 siRNA should have no effect on HERG current density in CHO cells, because even if CHO cells express endogenous hamster MiRP2, xMiRP2 siRNA is sequence-specific for Xenopus MiRP2. Transfection of cells with xMiRP2, siRNA, and HERG cDNA produced a mean current density not significantly different from cells transfected with HERG cDNA alone. This result argues against our previous oocyte results being an artifact caused by direct interaction of xMiRP2 siRNA with HERG protein (Fig. 4E). In contrast to human andXenopus MiRP2, which completely suppress HERG currents expressed in oocytes (9Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Google Scholar) (presumably by inhibiting functional HERG channel formation), hMiRP1 partially reduces HERG currents by the formation of lower conductance fast deactivating functional channel complexes (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar). The variability of hMiRP1 effects on HERG currents depending on expression system or HERG expression level has been reported previously. Although hMiRP1 mutations have been linked to inherited and acquired arrhythmia in three studies, and the effects of hMiRP1 on HERG have been noted by several groups, the reported effects differ (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar, 11Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10613-10618Google Scholar, 16Zhang M. Jiang M. Tseng G.N. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1012-1019Google Scholar, 17Isbrandt D. Friederich P. Solth A. Haverkamp W. Ebneth A.

Res. 2001; 89: 33-38Google Scholar). We hypothesized that some of the variability of the effects of hMiRP1 on HERG results from the displacement of xMiRP2 and that addition of hMiRP1 cRNA would rescue HERG currents at lower HERG levels (at which HERG is normally inhibited by endogenous xMiRP2) by forming functional hMiRP1/HERG complexes in favor of nonfunctional xMiRP2/HERG complexes. We first recapitulated previous reports of hMiRP1 modulation of HERG in both Xenopus oocytes and CHO cells. Using 10 ng of HERG cRNA/oocyte to achieve a high HERG current density, we compared current attributes with and without the injection of hMiRP1 cRNA. Co-injection of either 10 or 20 ng of hMiRP1 cRNA/oocyte resulted in similar ∼607 reductions in HERG tail currents (Fig.5A, left panel). hMiRP1 also reduced HERG currents in CHO cells, producing an ∼407 reduction in tail current density compared with HERG co-transfected with blank plasmid (Fig. 5A, right panel). Next, similar experiments were conducted using lower concentrations of HERG cRNA in oocyte expression studies. In contrast to the high current density HERG experiments, co-injection of hMiRP1 cRNA (2 ng/oocyte) with lower levels of HERG cRNA (0.5 ng/oocyte) actually up-regulated HERG −30-mV tail currents ∼3-fold after 2 and 3 days of expression (Fig. 5B). Similar effects were observed with xMiRP2 siRNA or a combination of hMiRP1 cRNA and xMiRP2 siRNA in the same batch of oocytes (Fig. 5B). The results suggest that, paradoxically, because hMiRP1 is able to couple with HERG and prevent suppression by endogenous levels of xMiRP2, at low HERG levels hMiRP1 increases HERG currents despite the formation of channels with lower unitary conductance. Previously, the finding that the KCNQ1 α subunit is expressed endogenously in X. laevis oocytes and up-regulated by the heterologous expression of mammalian MinK led to the discovery that human cardiac IKs is formed by MinK/KCNQ1 complexes in vivo (10Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Xenopus oocytes also express relatives of mammalian MiRPs and that these endogenous xMiRPs can interact with injected mammalian Kv channel α subunits. HERG, like KCNQ1, is a human cardiac Kv channel widely studied because of the role it plays in cardiac repolarization and the propensity of HERG to interact nonspecifically with a wide range of therapeutic agents, a propensity that contributes to acquired cardiac arrhythmia (21Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Google Scholar,32Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Google Scholar). The functional properties of HERG are modified by mammalian MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar, 9Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Google Scholar, 11Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A.

We have demonstrated that endogenous levels of xMiRP2 are sufficient to modify overexpressed HERG in oocytes. HERG currents recorded after the injection of HERG cRNA into oocytes are thus the sum product of 舠pure舡 HERG channels, xMiRP2-suppressed HERG, and/or channels formed by HERG with other xMiRP subunits. This fact can dramatically affect the interpretation of previous and future studies on HERG gating, pharmacology, and trafficking. We have yet to elucidate the mechanism by which xMiRP2 inhibits HERG, but this complete suppression suggests the formation of a non-functional channel, perhaps one that fails even to reach the plasma membrane. A question then remains to be answered. What happens to MiRP2-sequestered HERG, and can it be rescued by stimulating regulatory pathways or with use of drugs that bind to HERG and that rescue HERG channels containing trafficking mutations associated with long QT syndrome (33Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Anson B.D. January C.T. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2830-2835Google Scholar, 34Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4989-4998Google Scholar)? If so, the association of endogenous xMiRP2 with HERG may impact previous and future oocyte-based studies of HERG regulation and pharmacological rescue. The hMiRP1 versusxMiRP2 data presented here suggest that endogenous xMiRP2 forms the molecular basis for some of the previously reported variability in hMiRP1/HERG oocyte studies. The hMiRP1 versus xMiRP2 findings also highlight the importance of understanding the molecular background of expression systems used in α-ॆ subunit interaction studies. We anticipate that this phenomenon (i.e. the functional effects of an introduced mammalian ॆ subunit resulting partially from the displacement of an endogenous expression system ॆ subunit) will prove to be a recurring theme once the full range of Kv channel interactions with Xenopus and mammalian MiRPs is explored in oocytes and in other cell types. The issue of MiRP/α-subunit interaction is particularly contentious when cardiac Kv channels are considered. Both HERG and KCNQ1, the α subunits that generate the two principal repolarization currents, IKr and IKs, respectively, in human ventricular myocardium, are modulated by MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 in at least one expression system (35Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A. Sesti F. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 981-983Google Scholar). KCNQ1 is also strongly suppressed by MiRP3 (KCNE4) (36Grunnet M. Jespersen T. Rasmussen H.B. Ljungstrom T. Jorgensen N.K. Olesen S.P. Klaerke D.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 119-130Google Scholar) and forms with MiRP4 a slowly activating channel that resembles MinK/KCNQ1 channels but with a much more positive voltage dependence of activation (37Angelo K. Jespersen T. Grunnet M. Nielsen M.S. Klaerke D.A. Olesen S.P. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1997-2006Google Scholar). Little doubt exists that MinK/KCNQ1 complexes form human cardiacIKs. Compared with currents formed by overexpression of KCNQ1 alone, MinK/KCNQ1 channels exhibit a 4-fold higher conductance and a greatly slowed activation rate, generating a current that strongly resembles IKs in terms of biophysical attributes, regulation, and pharmacology. Further, mutations in both subunits that diminish channel function are associated with long QT syndrome in humans (19Splawski I. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lehmann M.H. Sanguinetti M.C. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 338-340Google Scholar, 23Duggal P. Vesely M.R. Wattanasirichaigoon D. Villafane J. Kaushik V. Beggs A.H. Circulation. 1998; 97: 142-146Google Scholar, 24Tyson J. Tranebjaerg L.

Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1562-1567Google Scholar). More debate exists concerning the precise molecular correlate of humanIKr. Although the introduction of HERG α subunits into oocytes or immortal mammalian cell lines creates a potassium current with many of the attributes of cardiacIKr (21Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Google Scholar, 32Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Google Scholar), coexpression with human MiRP1 alters the single channel properties of HERG to produce a current more closely resembling previous in vivo recordings ofIKr (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar). Mutations in hMiRP1 diminish flux through hMiRP1/HERG channels and are associated with inherited long QT syndrome (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar, 17Isbrandt D. Friederich P. Solth A. Haverkamp W. Ebneth A. Borggrefe M. Funke H. Sauter K. Breithardt G. Pongs O. Schulze-Bahr E. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 524-532Google Scholar). Further, some hMiRP1 mutations increase sensitivity to the blockade of hMiRP1/HERG channels in vitro by drugs known to block IKr (e.g.clarithromycin). Importantly, in each case the same drug (e.g. sulfamethoxazole) had precipitated drug-inducedtorsades de pointes and a prolonged QTc interval, specifically in patients from whom each mutation was isolated (6Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar, 15Sesti F. Abbott G.W. Wei J. Murray K.T. Saksena S. Schwartz P.J. Priori S.G. Roden D.M. George Jr., A.L. Goldstein S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10613-10618Google Scholar). However, largely as a result of the reported wide variability in effects of MiRP1/HERG coexpression, the assignment of this combination of subunits as the molecular basis of human IKris still questioned. Here we have noted one cause of the reported variability in hMiRP1/HERG behavior: the dependence of hMiRP1 effects on HERG expression level because of interference from endogenous MiRPs such as xMiRP2. At low levels of HERG cRNA, HERG current is completely suppressed by endogenous xMiRP2. The fact that we were able to subsequently reconstitute HERG current by either silencing the expression of xMiRP2 or introducing an ostensibly preferred partner illustrates just how promiscuous the association between an α subunit and the MiRPs can be. Can we infer from this that HERG will favor in every cell type an interaction with MiRP1 over other ॆ subunits? Enough evidence does not exist at this time to support such a claim. However, our findings in conjunction with those from other studies highlight the important idea that native currents such asIKr are probably formed from a spectrum of molecular components with temporal and spatial dependence, and thus the success of direct native-cloned current comparisons is governed not only by the choice of expression system but also by the inclusion of possible ॆ subunit partners and by the precise choice of native tissue source. Increasingly, for example, evidence suggests thatIKr is regulated by MinK in some cardiac myocytes: MinK up-regulates HERG in some mammalian cell lines, knockdown of MinK suppresses HERG in murine myocytes, and immunoprecipitation of MinK from horse heart pulls down HERG, and KCNQ1 (25Finley M.R.

Oocytes remain an expression system with numerous advantages for the assessment of ion channel function. Here we have described the first reported use (to our knowledge) of RNAi post-transcriptional gene silencing in the oocyte system. The use of RNAi to control endogenous modifying subunits in oocytes, mammalian cell expression systems (which may also contain endogenous MiRPs), and native studies will improve our understanding of the heteromultimeric molecular basis of human Kv currents and also allow us to accurately define the properties of 舠pure舡 α subunit complexes. This knowledge will facilitate the linkage of channel α and ॆ subunit genes to inherited and acquired disease, the rational design of channel-directed therapeutic drugs, and screening for avoidance of unwanted channel-drug interactions. Consideration of endogenous modifying subunits in heterologous expression systems is likely to be most crucial when undertaking single channel recordings, because the lower α subunit expression levels often required for these studies (when compared with macroscopic studies) will generate a higher molar ratio of endogenous ॆ subunits to exogenous α subunits. The impact of endogenous xMiRPs on macroscopic studies should not be overlooked, however, because our results here show that endogenous xMiRP2 affects the behavior of HERG, for example, at tail current densities in the range widely used by investigators of whole-cell HERG biophysics, pharmacology, and intersubunit interactions (6Abbott G.W.

https://openalex.org/W2046911380,"Adult transgenic mice with muscle-specific overexpression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I have enlarged skeletal muscles. In this study, we; 1) characterized the development of muscle hypertrophy with respect to fiber type, age, and sex; 2) determined the primary anabolic process responsible for development of hypertrophy; and 3) identified secondary effects of muscle hypertrophy on body composition. Transgene expression increased with age and was present only in fibers expressing type IIB fast myosin heavy chain. Muscle masses were greater by 5 wk of age, and by 10 wk of age the differences were maximal despite continued transgene expression. Total DNA and RNA contents of the gastrocnemius muscle were greater for transgenic mice than for nontransgenic littermates. The differences were maximal by 5 wk of age and preceded the increase in protein mass. The accelerated protein deposition ceased when the protein/DNA ratio attained the same value as in nontransgenic controls. Despite localization of IGF-I expression to muscle without changes in plasma IGF-I concentrations, genotype also modified the normal age and sex effects on fat deposition and organ growth. Thus, enhanced DNA accretion by IGF-I was primarily responsible for stimulating muscle growth. In turn, secondary effects on body composition were incurred that likely reflect the impact of muscle mass on whole body metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2142485165,"We have determined the crystal structure of a novel regulatory protein (MGP-40) from the mammary gland. This protein is implicated as a protective signaling factor that determines which cells are to survive the drastic tissue remodeling that occurs during involution. It has been indicated that certain cancers could surreptitiously utilize the proposed normal protective signaling by proteins of this family to extend their own survival and thereby allow them to invade the organ and metastasize. In view of this, MGP-40 could form an important target for rational structure-based drug design against breast cancer. It is a single chain, glycosylated protein with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. It was isolated from goat dry secretions and has been cloned and sequenced. It was crystallized by microdialysis from 20 mg ml−1solution in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and equilibrated against the same solution containing 19% ethanol. Its x-ray structure has been determined by molecular replacement and refined to a 2.9 Å resolution. The protein adopts a β/α domain structure with a triose-phosphate isomerase barrel conformation in the core and a small α+β folding domain. A single glycosylation site containing twoN-acetylglucosamine units has been observed in the structure. Compared with chitinases and chitinase-like proteins the most important mutation in this protein pertains to a change from Glu to Leu at position 119, which is part of the so-called active site sequence in the form of Asp115, Leu119, and Asp186 and in this case resulting in the loss of chitinase activity. The orientations of two Trp residues Trp78and Trp331 in the β barrel reduces the free space, drastically impairing the binding of saccharides/polysaccharides.

We have isolated a glycoprotein from goat dry secretions which has a molecular mass of 40 kDa. This mammary gland protein has been named MGP-40. 1The abbreviations used are: MGP-4040-kDa mammary gland proteinTIMtriose-phosphate isomerase1The abbreviations used are: MGP-4040-kDa mammary gland proteinTIMtriose-phosphate isomerase It shows a high sequence homology to the proteins of the chitinase-like family (1Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but has no chitinase activity. Very similar proteins have been reported earlier as prominent in the whey secretions of nonlactating cows (3Rejman J.J. Hurley W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and found in large amounts in the culture supernatants of the MG-63 human osteosarcoma cell line (4Johansen J.S. Williamson M.K. Rice J.S. Price P.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), cultures of human synovial cells (5Nyirkos P. Golds E.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and human cartilage cells (1Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J.

However, little is known about the functions of these inactive chitinase-related proteins. Based on their sequence homology it is also unclear whether one could assume that they might bind to chitin-like polysaccharide or glycoproteins. This molecular event would then help regulate various kinds of tissue remodeling and/or differentiation processes. For example, one of these proteins appears only during wound repair in cartilage, and a second works during the earliest event of pregnancy when a newly fertilized ovum is implanted in the oviduct. A third member of these chitinase-related proteins was identified in specific types of cancer cells from the mammary gland of mice (6Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar). It was also found later that it was expressed by the normal gland once the young mouse pups were weaned. During this period of involution, the structure and function of the gland must revert back to the nonpregnant state. It appears that MGP-40 acts normally as a protective signaling factor that determines which cells are to survive the drastic tissue remodeling that must occur during involution. Thus, many breast epithelial cells, which have increased in number during pregnancy, must now be destroyed. These cells die by a precise programmed cell death pathway called apoptosis, but most of the breast tissues remain viable, and it is assumed that MGP-40 contributes to regulating which cells in the gland are to survive. It has been reported that certain types of breast cancer cells also produce an MGP-40-like protein called BRP39 (7Aronson N.N. Blanchard C.J. Madura J.D. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sc. 1997; 37: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To understand the role of MGP-40 and related proteins in the breast cancer growth, we have analyzed the three-dimensional structure of MGP-40 by x-ray diffraction method. The structure has revealed features indicating unusual aspects of conformational variations leading to alter the scope of functions. 40-kDa mammary gland protein triose-phosphate isomerase 40-kDa mammary gland protein triose-phosphate isomerase Fresh samples of dry secretions from goats were obtained from National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, India. All purification steps were carried out at 277 K. The pooled sample of dry secretions was diluted twice with distilled water. It was further diluted twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cation exchanger CM-Sephadex was added (7 g liter−1) and stirred slowly for 1 h using a mechanical stirrer. The gel was allowed to settle, the milk was decanted, and the gel was washed with an excess of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, packed in a column (25 cm × 2.5 cm) and washed with the same buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, which facilitated the removal of impurities. MGP-40 was then eluted with the same buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. The protein solution was dialyzed against triple distilled water and again passed through a CM-Sephadex C50 column (10 cm × 2.5 cm) preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.35 m NaCl in the same buffer. The protein was concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell. The concentrated samples were passed through a Sephadex G-150 column (100 cm × 2 cm) using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The second peak in this final chromatographic step corresponded to a molecular mass of 40 kDa. The N-terminal sequence was determined and showed a high identity with a protein isolated earlier from the secretions of a nonlactating cow (3Rejman J.J. Hurley W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because the function of this protein was not yet known and because it was secreted from the mammary gland and had molecular mass of 40 kDa, we named it MGP-40. The mammary gland tissue was obtained from a nonlactating goat during the period of involution, and the complete cDNA sequence was determined. The isolation of poly(A)+ mRNA and cDNA synthesis were performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The N-terminal sequence of MGP-40 was compared with those of chitinase-like proteins, and the sequences of conserved regions were used for the synthesis of primers. PCR was performed with Taq polymerase (Promega) using an MJ Research thermal cycler, model PTC-100. The nucleotide sequencing was performed on the cloned double stranded DNA (pGEM-T) using an automatic sequencer (ABI-377). The complete nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences are given in Fig.1. To determine the binding of carbohydrates to MGP-40, the following compounds were used: glucose,N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc), glucosamine, galactose,N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, mannose, lactose, and trehalose (Sigma). For the experiment as positive control with a chitinase from Penicillium chrysogenum (GlcNAc)4was used. Solute quenching experiments were also performed using KI with chitinase and MGP-40 in the presence and absence of sugars. The binding was monitored by measuring the tryptophan fluorescence. All fluorescence experiments were performed on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 295 nm. Emission intensities were collected over a wavelength range of 300–400 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm. Fluorescence emission scans were performed at room temperature by titration of 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μm ligands, respectively, with 1 μm of MGP-40 in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. All data were corrected for blank titration without MGP-40 by using the corresponding ligand in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. As a control, ligands were also treated with 8 μmtryptophan under the same conditions. The purified samples of MGP-40 from goat dry secretions were used for crystallization. The crystals were obtained by microdialysis with a protein concentration of 20 mg ml−1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, dialyzing against the same buffer containing 19% (v/v) ethanol at pH 8.0 and 277 K. The colorless irregularly shaped crystals with the dimensions 0.5 mm × 0.4 mm × 0.2 mm grew after a period of 3–4 months. The crystals of MGP-40 were stable in the x-ray beam.

After rigid body refinement, it yielded an R factor of 49.4% and a correlation coefficient of 38.1%.

The corresponding residues in MGP-40 are Asp115, Leu119, and Asp186. The mutation of Glu to Leu in MGP-40 shows that it lacks chitinase activity. There is another chitinase-like family of proteins that lack chitinase activity with varying mutations of three essential residues as His/Asn from Asp at the first position, Gln for Glu at the second position and Asn for the third position. These proteins also lacked chitinase-like catalytic activity but were reported to bind saccharides/polysaccharides in a manner similar to that observed in chitinases (14Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z.

Some regions such as 1–16, 34–41, 110–121, 151–156, 232–249, 273–282, 298–305, and 325–332 are highly conserved in these proteins. These proteins contain identical locations of cysteine residues and form two identical disulfide bridges. However, there is an exception in BRP39, which has four cysteine residues, and the free Cys20present in other similar proteins is replaced by Phe20 in BRP39 (Table III). The most striking observation in these proteins pertains to the presence of an identical sequence of three residues Asp115, Leu119, and Asp186corresponding to the three essential residues Asp, Glu, and Asp in chitinases. These proteins were either expressed in mammary gland during involution/mammary tumor/breast cancer (3Rejman J.J. Hurley W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The exact physiological functions of these proteins are not yet fully understood. However, the expression of MGP-40 in mammary gland during involution supports its possible role in apoptosis. The strikingly similar characteristics suggest that these proteins might have similar three-dimensional structures and closely related functions. Therefore, this group of proteins can be considered proteins of one family. Because the crystal structure of MGP-40 is the first report from this class, they can be called proteins of MGP-40 family.

To understand the relationship among the proteins of these three families,i.e. MGP-40, chitinase-like, and chitinases, the sequences of representative proteins from the three classes have been compared. The sequences of MGP-40 from the MGP-40 family, YM1 from the family of chitinase-like proteins, and Chit1 from chitinases are listed in TableIV. YM1 and Chit1 show sequence identities with MGP-40 at the level of 46 and 25%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the chain lengths in these three classes of proteins are not similar. Compared with MGP-40, YM1 contains two extra stretches of residues 146–150 and residues 391–398, whereas Chit1 possesses two large segments of residues 76–91 and residues 387–401, which are absent in both MGP-40 and YM1. Furthermore, YM1 and Chit1 are not glycosylated. The number and locations of disulfide bridges in YM1 are identical to those observed in MGP-40, but the locations of free cysteines in the two sequences are different. On the other hand, Chit1 has only one disulfide bridge, which is widely different from both MGP-40 and YM1. These variations among the proteins of three families are expected to provide interesting structural and functional comparisons.Table IIISequence alignment of proteins having identical Asp-115, Leu-119, Asp-186 residues as a characteristic feature Open table in a new tab Table IVSequence comparisons of MGP-40 with a selected chitinase-like protein (YM1) and a chitinase (Chit1)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab MGP-40 contains a single polypeptide chain of 361 residues. Structural evaluations of the final model of the protein using PROCHECK (19Laskowski R. Macarthur M. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar) indicated that 87.3% of the residues are in the most allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (20Ramachrandan G.N. Sasisekaran V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows a section of the final electron density map superimposed upon the final model. The refined model included all 361 residues, 48 water molecules, and 2 molecules of GlcNAc, yielding an R factor of 18.0% and a freeR factor of 23.5%. The root mean square deviations in bond lengths and angles were 0.009 Å and 1.7 °, respectively. The overall folding of the protein is shown in Fig.4, a and b. The structure is broadly divided into two globular domains, a β/α TIM barrel (21Gordon S. Res. Immunol. 1998; 149: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) domain and a small α+β domain. The TIM barrel domain contains both the N and C termini of MGP-40. This domain is made up of two polypeptide segments that are from 2–237 and 310–360 (Fig.4a). The TIM barrel domain includes about 79% of the residues. The small α+β domain contains the remaining 21% of the residues of MGP-40. There are two disulfide bonds formed by the residues Cys5-Cys30 and Cys279-Cys343 (Fig. 4b). The latter disulfide bond is formed between the two domains and apparently holds them together. There is a free Cys20 in MGP-40, which is located in a tightly packed hydrophobic pocket containing residues Tyr7, Ala24, Ile25, Phe338, and Phe349. It is practically inaccessible to solvent. The secondary structure elements of the TIM barrel and that of the small domain are listed in TableV. The polypeptide chain of MGP-40 starts with β1 of the TIM barrel domain and folds into β1, α1-1, α1-2, α1-3, β2-1, β2-2, α2, β3, α3-1, α3-2, β4 α4, β5, α5-1, α5-2, β6, α6-1, α6-2, β7 (Fig. 4a), then switches over to the small domain at residue 240 to form β1′, β2′, α1′, β3′, β4′, and β5′ (Fig. 4b). At residue 310, it returns to the TIM barrel domain to generate α7, β8, α8-1, and α8-2 to complete the folding of the chain. The eight stranded parallel β sheet structure forms the core of the protein structure, and eight pieces of α helices surround it covering at least three-fourths of the barrel from outside. The interior of the barrel is filled predominantly with hydrophobic residues. Although there are two possible sites of glycosylation, only one of them, Asn39-Ile40-Ser41, is actually glycosylated with two units of GlcNAc through β (1Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J.

This is a unique feature of MGP-40 structure because the residue corresponding to Arg84 does not exist in chitinases, and it is mutated to Pro in chitinase-like proteins. It should also be mentioned here that Arg84 is conserved in the proteins of MGP-40 family, reimposing their similarity. Furthermore, the interactions of Arg84 with GlcNAc and Asn39 influence the backbone conformation of loop Val75-Phe85, which in turn alters the disposition of Trp78 leading to the differences of the saccharide/polysaccharide binding to the protein.Figure 4Ribbon diagrams (29Kraulis P.J.

Despite the importance of protein-protein interactions between the electron donor and acceptor proteins, there has been no structural information for the interaction of thioredoxin or Grx with natural target proteins. Here, we present the crystal structure of a novel Haemophilus influenza peroxiredoxin (Prx) hybrid Prx5 determined at 2.8-Å resolution. The structure reveals that hybrid Prx5 forms a tightly associated tetramer where active sites of Prx and Grx domains of different monomers interact with each other. The Prx-Grx interface comprises specific charge interactions surrounded by weak interactions, providing insight into the target recognition mechanism of Grx. The tetrameric structure also exhibits a flexible active site and alternative Prx-Grx interactions, which appear to facilitate the electron transfer from Grx to Prx domain.

The N-terminal cysteine directly reacts with reactive oxygen species substrates, resulting in the formation of cysteine sulfenic acid. The C-terminal cysteine, which is in the vicinity of the N-terminal cysteine of the other monomer in the dimeric structure found in most 2-Cys Prx proteins, forms a disulfide bond with the N-terminal cysteine sulfenic acid (5Chae H.Z.

These structures revealed that Prx proteins have a thioredoxin fold with several insertions between secondary structural elements of the core thioredoxin fold. All Prx proteins except for human Prx5 were found as tightly associated dimers (α2) or decamers ((α2)5) utilizing the dimer as a basic unit. 2-Cys Prx proteins exhibit the structural transition between the dimeric and decameric states depending on environmental status such as redox states, ionic strength, and pH (11Schröder E.

Recently, novel hybrid Prx proteins with a glutaredoxin (Grx) domain fused in them were found from several pathogenic bacteria includingHaemophilus influenza (GenBankTM accession number P44758) (16Hwang Y.S. Chae H.Z. Kim K. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 514-518Google Scholar), Neisseria meningitidis(GenBankTM accession number CAB94403), and Vibrio cholerae (GenBankTM accession number AE004330). An anaerobic sulfur-oxidizing phototroph, Chromatium gracilealso has the hybrid Prx (17Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Jacquemotte F. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Bartsch R.G. Beeumen J.J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20890-20897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Prx and Grx domains of these hybrid proteins have sequence homology with human Prx5 and Escherichia coli Grx3, respectively (16Hwang Y.S. Chae H.Z. Kim K. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 514-518Google Scholar, 18Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautiere P.-E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.-P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The fusion of Grx domain in these hybrid Prx5 proteins suggests that Grx domain is likely to act as the electron donor for Prx domain of these proteins (18Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautiere P.-E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.-P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). H. influenza hybrid Prx5, which is a prototype example of these hybrid Prx proteins, was first found from a sequence search of the bacterium's genome and originally named as HI0572 (16Hwang Y.S. Chae H.Z. Kim K. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 514-518Google Scholar). There are three cysteines in H. influenza hybrid Prx5 that comprise a total of 241 residues. The first cysteine, Cys-49, corresponds to the N-terminal cysteine that is absolutely conserved throughout all Prx proteins. The second and third (Cys-180 and Cys-183) are the two cysteines in the conserved CXXC motif of Grx domain. There are no non-conserved cysteines in H. influenza hybrid Prx5. We determined the crystal structure of H. influenza hybrid Prx5 (hyPrx5) to understand the functional role of fusion between Prx and electron donor proteins as well as electron donor specificity. The tetrameric structure of hyPrx5 reveals detailed information on the conformation of catalytic sites that account for the glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity of hyPrx5. The tetramerization is mediated by interconnecting Prx and Grx domains of the protein, suggesting that the fusion is essential for the tetramerization. Most importantly, Prx and Grx domains of different monomers form significant interaction with each other to allow the intermolecular electron transfer between the two domains. The Prx-Grx interaction found in the hyPrx5 tetramer reveals the atomic-level features of the Grx surface used for the interaction with an intact protein target. Thus, the tetrameric structure of hyPrx5 provides a framework in understanding the mechanism of target recognition by Grx as well as activities of the Prx-Grx hybrid proteins. HyPrx5 was crystallized at room temperature by the vapor diffusion method. For the crystallization, 2 μl of reservoir solution (1.6 mammonium sulfate, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0)) and 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) were mixed and equilibrated against the reservoir. Tetragonal crystals appeared within 2 or 3 days and grew to the their full size of 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm after 1 week. The crystals belong to the P43212 space group with cell constants ofa = b = 72.85 Å, c = 229.63 Å. There are two molecules of hyPrx5 in the asymmetric unit. The multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) (19Hendrickson W.A. Ogata C.M.

The randomly selected 5% of the data were set aside for theR free calculation. Refinement included 2-fold NCS restraints, an overall anisotropic B factor, and bulk solvent correction. The data set collected at the edge wavelength (λ = 0.9795), which was nearly complete, was used in the refinement. The stereochemical analysis using the program PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The air-oxidized hyPrx5 protein (∼0.5 mg/ml) was prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl. For the preparation of the reduced hyPrx5 sample, 1 mm dithiothreitol (about 80-fold molar excess for the reduction of disulfide bond in hyPrx5) was supplemented in the hyPrx5 solution, and the sample was preincubated for 1 h before the experiment. The sample absorbance was monitored at 280 nm during centrifugation at 8,000 rpm until equilibrium was reached (about 24 h). Data were fitted using the equation corresponding to IDEAL1 model implemented in Beckman data analysis software, A obs = A 0exp[((1 − sρ)ω2/2RT)M r(r 2− r 02)] + E, wheres is the partial specific volume of macromolecule (0.736 ml/g), ρ is the solvent density (1.002 g/ml), ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, R is the universal gas constant,T is the absolute temperature, A 0 is the absorbance at reference at radius r 0,r 0 is the reference radius,M r is the gram molecular weight of the macromolecule, and E is the base-line offset. The program SigmaPlot v5.0 (SPSS Inc.) was used for the data fitting. The refined structure of hyPrx5 reveals two discrete domains, peroxiredoxin (residues 3–162) and glutaredoxin (residues 171–241) domains with a connecting loop (residues 163–170) (Fig. 1 a). No direct interactions are found between Prx and Grx domains in the monomeric structure. There are two monomers of hyPrx5 in the asymmetric unit of crystals, and the two monomers have different domain arrangements enabled by the flexible linker between Prx and Grx domains (Fig.1 b). The dimer in the asymmetric unit associates with another dimer generated by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry operation of the first dimer, resulting in a tightly associated tetramer (Fig. 1,c and d). The tetramer has a donut shape with the outer and inner diameters of about 85 and 18 Å, respectively (Fig.1 c). When viewed from the side, the tetramer appears as a cylinder of 65 Å height (Fig. 1 d).Figure 1Monomeric and tetrameric structures. a, the monomeric structure of hyPrx5 with secondary structural elements.

In addition to the thioredoxin fold, Prx domain of hyPrx5 has several insertions, (i) N-terminal two antiparallel β strands (β1 and β2) followed by a short α-helix (α1), (ii) helix α3 and strand β5 between strand β4 and helix α4, (iii) two short antiparallel β-strands (strands β6 and β7) between helix α4 and strand β8. A search for homologous structures by using the DALI server (32Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) confirmed that the structure of Prx domain of hyPrx5 is similar to that of other Prx proteins. Of these, the structure of human Prx5 (10Declercq J.P. Evrard C. Clippe A. Stricht D.V. Bernard A. Knoops B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) is most similar to that of the hyPrx5 Prx domain. A total of 151 of 160 Cα atoms in the hyPrx5 Prx domain can be aligned with the corresponding atoms of human Prx5 with an root mean square deviation of 1.50 Å. The structure of the hyPrx5 Grx domain is very similar to that of Grx3 (33Nordstrand K. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), comprising a central β sheet with four strands (β10, β11, β12, and β13) flanked by three helices (α6, α7, and α8) (Figs. 1 aand 2). The root mean square value of Cα-carbon alignment between the hyPrx5 Grx domain and Grx3 is 1.32 Å for 66 of 69 residues in the hyPrx5 Grx domain. The tetramerization of hyPrx5 is achieved mainly by two strong subunit contacts, Prx-Prx (monomers A-B and C-D) and Grx-Grx (monomers A-D and B-C) contacts (Fig. 1,c and d). In addition to these contacts, the Prx-Grx interaction, which has important implications in the peroxidase mechanism of hyPrx5, is also involved in the tetramerization (see below). To verify the tetramerization of hyPrx5 in solution we determined the molecular weight of hyPrx5 by analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3). In oxidized and reduced conditions, the molecular masses were estimated to be 117.0 and 115.1 kDa, respectively. These values are close to the expected tetrameric molecular mass of hyPrx5 (∼108 kDa), indicating that hyPrx5 forms a tetramer in solution and the oligomeric state is not dependent on redox conditions. Dynamic light scattering and gel filtration experiments showed similar results (data not shown). The redox-independent tetramerization of hyPrx5 should be important for its biological function since the electron transfer reaction between the Prx and Grx domains occur in the tetrameric interface, and the tetramerization maintains the optimal geometry between the Prx and Grx domains fused by a flexible linker (see below). The Prx-Prx contact in hyPrx5 is completely different from the dimeric interface in other Prx proteins (6Hirotsu S. Abe Y. Okada K. Nagahara N. Hori H. Nishino T. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The dimeric contact between two Prx domains of hyPrx5 is formed by the face perpendicular to the direction of strands in the central sheet, whereas that of other Prx proteins makes use of the face parallel to the direction of strands. The Prx-Prx contact of hyPrx5 involves residues in loops β3-α2 (residues 45–47), β4-α3 (residues 81–82), β5-α4 (residues 101–102), and β6-β7 (residues 118–121). In addition, residues Trp-22, Asp-79, Ala-85, and Arg-123, whose side chains are near the loop, regions play an important role in the dimerization. The interface, which buries 10.5% (826 Å2) of the total surface area of Prx domain, is highly complementary and involves mainly hydrophobic interactions with a salt bridge (Arg-A123–Asp-B79). The same dimeric association is found also in the structure of human Prx5 that is highly homologous to Prx domain of hyPrx5. Even though the report (10Declercq J.P. Evrard C. Clippe A. Stricht D.V.

Here, we provide evidence that arsenite can induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a time- and dose-dependent manner in JB6 Cl 41 cells. Arsenite induces phosphorylation of Akt1 at serine 473 and increases Akt1 activity. A dominant-negative mutant of Akt1 inhibits the arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. Additionally, active Akt1 kinase strongly phosphorylates histone H3 at serine 10 in vitro. The arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was almost completely blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor PD98059. N- or C-terminal mutant mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 or its inhibitor H89 had no effect on arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in JB6 Cl 41 cells. However, cells deficient in p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (Rsk2 −/−) totally block this phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggested that arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is mediated by Akt1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 but not mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1.

On the other hand, arsenite is also an extremely effective chemotherapeutic agent used to treat certain cancer patients, especially those with acute promyelocytic leukemia (11Zhang P. J. Biol. Regul.

Studies show that arsenite can induce apoptosis in many cell types because of its ability to increase activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (13Salazar A.M. Ostrosky-Wegman P. Menendez D. Miranda E. Garcia-Carranca A. Rojas E. Mutat. Res. 1997; 381: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ability of arsenic to act as either a carcinogen or a chemotherapeutic agent is related to cell type, arsenic species, and length and dose of exposure (1Bode A.M. Dong Z. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 42: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, arsenic acts in a paradoxical manner. However, the mechanisms of arsenic's actions as a carcinogen or as a chemotherapeutic agent are unclear.Phosphorylation of histone H3 is known to play an important role in chromatin remodeling and chromosome condensation (14Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of histone H3 is associated with active immediate-early gene expression, including that of proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun (15Strelkov I.S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 75-78PubMed Google Scholar, 16Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We reported that UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is mediated by MAPKs (17Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the ability of arsenite to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 has not been reported, and the signal transduction pathway mediating phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 also remains unclear.To explore the mechanism of arsenite's action in carcinogenesis, we used arsenite to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in JB6 Cl 41 cells. We found that this compound induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and increased Akt1 activation and phosphorylation of Akt1 at serine 473. A dominant-negative mutant of Akt1 inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, and a dominant-negative mutant of ERKs and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 also blocked the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. In addition, arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was totally blocked in ribosomal S6 protein kinase 2 (RSK2)-deficient cells (Rsk2 −/−). Furthermore, dominant-negative mutant MSK1 had no effect on phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite. Taken together, these data indicate that Akt1, ERKs, and RSK2, but not MSK1, are involved in the mediation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.DISCUSSIONStudies show that JB6 Cl 41 cells, which are derived from mouse skin, are a well developed cell culture model for studying tumor promotion (20Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 21Colburn N.H. Former B.F. Nelson K.A. Yuspa S.H. Nature. 1979; 281: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found previously that exposure of JB6 P+ cells to low concentrations of arsenic induces cell transformation (8Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Goranson A. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14595-14601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Dong Z. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110 Suppl. 5: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present study, to further explore the mechanism of arsenite's action in carcinogenesis, JB6 Cl 41 cells were employed to study phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite. Using dominant-negative mutant cells and kinase inhibitors, we found that arsenite induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). DN-ERK2 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059, DN-Akt1, and a deficiency of RSK2 distinctly inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, but DN-MSK1 had little effect. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that arsenite can induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 through activation or phosphorylation of the Akt1, ERK2, and RSK2 pathways.Studies show that histone H3 is associated with activation, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells into hepatocytes in the d-galactosamine model of liver regeneration (23Dabeva M.D. Shafritz D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1606-1620PubMed Google Scholar). Histone H3 in situ hybridization has become an extremely accurate technique for assessment of S-phase cell proliferation indices and has shown that histone H3 mRNA expression levels are greatly increased in malignant cells compared with normal cells (24Gown A.M. Jiang J.J. Matles H. Skelly M. Goodpaster T. Cass L. Reshatof M. Spaulding D. Coltrera M.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Specifically, histone H3 at serine 10 is phosphorylated in mitotic and meiotic chromosome condensation (25Wei Y. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) are involved in mediation of histone H3 phosphorylation. Arsenite acts as a cocarcinogen with a second (genotoxic) agent by inhibiting DNA repair and/or enhancing positive growth signaling (29Rossman T.G. Uddin A.N. Burns F.J. Bosland M.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 176: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but the relationship between arsenite and histone H3 has not reported until now. We hypothesized that arsenite could act to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 through MAPKs or other factors. Our results show that phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was induced by arsenite in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). These results are in agreement with our primary hypothesis and also provide evidence to illustrate the potent carcinogenic effect of arsenite in cell lines.Akt1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by various stimuli, such as hormones, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components (30Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Akt1 has been shown to promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis because of its ability to phosphorylate Bad, one of its primary targets (31Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown thatAkt1 gene amplification and the Akt1 pathway may play a major role in stimulating proliferation and survival in cells overexpressing erbB2 in cancer (32Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that Akt1 kinase is involved in arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in JB6 cells. Both Akt1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt1 at serine 473 increased when JB6 Cl 41 cells were stimulated with arsenite (Fig. 3). DN-Akt1 inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and activated-Akt1 increased arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 compared with empty vector-transfected JB6 cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, using either pure histone H3 protein or chromatin, active Akt1 was shown to strongly phosphorylate histone H3 at serine 10 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). These results indicated that Akt1 kinase plays a very important role in arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.We reported that ERK2 and JNKs are involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. In the present research, ERK2 was also shown to mediate arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. DN-ERK2 and PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, almost totally blocked phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (Fig. 6). But unlike UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, JNKs had no effect on arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (data not shown). These results indicated that ERK2 but not JNKs are involved in the mediation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.MSK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of nucleosomal components (33Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. An inactivation mutation in either the N- or C-terminal MSK1 kinase domain completely annuls its activity (33Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). We established stably expressed N- or C-terminal MSK1 kinase dead JB6 Cl 41 cells and found that either one inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. In the present study, we confirmed our previous results (Fig.7 A) but found that the N- or C-terminal MSK1 kinase dead mutants had no effect on phosphorylation of histone 3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (Fig. 7, C and F). H89, a MSK1 inhibitor, suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate- or epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 induced by UVB. However, in this study, H89 had no effect on phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (Fig. 7 I). So, these results indicate that MSK1 is not involved in the mediation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.The formation of the MAPK-RSK complex has been shown to be necessary for activation of the RSK isoform stimulated by growth factors in vivo (34Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RSK2 has been implicated in the phosphorylation of histone H3 in response to mitogenic stimulation by epidermal growth factor (35Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was almost totally blocked in a time- and dose-dependent manner by deficiency of RSK2, but deficiency of Rsk2 had no effect on total histone H3 or acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (Fig. 8). These data strongly suggest that arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is also mediated by RSK2.In summary, this study shows that arsenite induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, and Akt1, ERK2, and RSK2, but not MSK1, mediate arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. This pathway for arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is distinctly different from the pathway of UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (Fig.9). Akt1 is another kinase that mediates the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in vivo andin vitro. The present study further provides powerful evidence illustrating the probable mechanisms of arsenite in carcinogenesis in cells or animal models. However, many questions, including how arsenite enters cells, still need to be answered. Arsenite is a common human carcinogen found as a contaminant in drinking water (1Bode A.M. Dong Z. Crit. Rev.

We found that this compound induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and increased Akt1 activation and phosphorylation of Akt1 at serine 473. A dominant-negative mutant of Akt1 inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, and a dominant-negative mutant of ERKs and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 also blocked the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. In addition, arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was totally blocked in ribosomal S6 protein kinase 2 (RSK2)-deficient cells (Rsk2 −/−). Furthermore, dominant-negative mutant MSK1 had no effect on phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite.

Histone H3 in situ hybridization has become an extremely accurate technique for assessment of S-phase cell proliferation indices and has shown that histone H3 mRNA expression levels are greatly increased in malignant cells compared with normal cells (24Gown A.M. Jiang J.J. Matles H. Skelly M. Goodpaster T. Cass L. Reshatof M. Spaulding D. Coltrera M.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Specifically, histone H3 at serine 10 is phosphorylated in mitotic and meiotic chromosome condensation (25Wei Y. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) are involved in mediation of histone H3 phosphorylation. Arsenite acts as a cocarcinogen with a second (genotoxic) agent by inhibiting DNA repair and/or enhancing positive growth signaling (29Rossman T.G. Uddin A.N. Burns F.J. Bosland M.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 176: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but the relationship between arsenite and histone H3 has not reported until now. We hypothesized that arsenite could act to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 through MAPKs or other factors. Our results show that phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was induced by arsenite in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). These results are in agreement with our primary hypothesis and also provide evidence to illustrate the potent carcinogenic effect of arsenite in cell lines.Akt1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by various stimuli, such as hormones, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components (30Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Akt1 has been shown to promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis because of its ability to phosphorylate Bad, one of its primary targets (31Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown thatAkt1 gene amplification and the Akt1 pathway may play a major role in stimulating proliferation and survival in cells overexpressing erbB2 in cancer (32Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that Akt1 kinase is involved in arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in JB6 cells. Both Akt1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt1 at serine 473 increased when JB6 Cl 41 cells were stimulated with arsenite (Fig. 3). DN-Akt1 inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and activated-Akt1 increased arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 compared with empty vector-transfected JB6 cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, using either pure histone H3 protein or chromatin, active Akt1 was shown to strongly phosphorylate histone H3 at serine 10 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). These results indicated that Akt1 kinase plays a very important role in arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.We reported that ERK2 and JNKs are involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. In the present research, ERK2 was also shown to mediate arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. DN-ERK2 and PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, almost totally blocked phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (Fig. 6). But unlike UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, JNKs had no effect on arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (data not shown). These results indicated that ERK2 but not JNKs are involved in the mediation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.MSK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of nucleosomal components (33Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. An inactivation mutation in either the N- or C-terminal MSK1 kinase domain completely annuls its activity (33Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). We established stably expressed N- or C-terminal MSK1 kinase dead JB6 Cl 41 cells and found that either one inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. In the present study, we confirmed our previous results (Fig.7 A) but found that the N- or C-terminal MSK1 kinase dead mutants had no effect on phosphorylation of histone 3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (Fig. 7, C and F). H89, a MSK1 inhibitor, suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate- or epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 induced by UVB. However, in this study, H89 had no effect on phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (Fig. 7 I). So, these results indicate that MSK1 is not involved in the mediation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.The formation of the MAPK-RSK complex has been shown to be necessary for activation of the RSK isoform stimulated by growth factors in vivo (34Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RSK2 has been implicated in the phosphorylation of histone H3 in response to mitogenic stimulation by epidermal growth factor (35Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was almost totally blocked in a time- and dose-dependent manner by deficiency of RSK2, but deficiency of Rsk2 had no effect on total histone H3 or acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (Fig. 8). These data strongly suggest that arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is also mediated by RSK2.In summary, this study shows that arsenite induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, and Akt1, ERK2, and RSK2, but not MSK1, mediate arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. This pathway for arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is distinctly different from the pathway of UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (Fig.9). Akt1 is another kinase that mediates the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in vivo andin vitro. The present study further provides powerful evidence illustrating the probable mechanisms of arsenite in carcinogenesis in cells or animal models. However, many questions, including how arsenite enters cells, still need to be answered. Studies show that JB6 Cl 41 cells, which are derived from mouse skin, are a well developed cell culture model for studying tumor promotion (20Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 21Colburn N.H. Former B.F. Nelson K.A. Yuspa S.H. Nature. 1979; 281: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found previously that exposure of JB6 P+ cells to low concentrations of arsenic induces cell transformation (8Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Goranson A. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14595-14601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Dong Z. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110 Suppl. 5: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present study, to further explore the mechanism of arsenite's action in carcinogenesis, JB6 Cl 41 cells were employed to study phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite. Using dominant-negative mutant cells and kinase inhibitors, we found that arsenite induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). DN-ERK2 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059, DN-Akt1, and a deficiency of RSK2 distinctly inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, but DN-MSK1 had little effect. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that arsenite can induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 through activation or phosphorylation of the Akt1, ERK2, and RSK2 pathways. Studies show that histone H3 is associated with activation, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells into hepatocytes in the d-galactosamine model of liver regeneration (23Dabeva M.D. Shafritz D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1606-1620PubMed Google Scholar). Histone H3 in situ hybridization has become an extremely accurate technique for assessment of S-phase cell proliferation indices and has shown that histone H3 mRNA expression levels are greatly increased in malignant cells compared with normal cells (24Gown A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2082162427,"We investigated the status and the regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 in a choroidal melanoma tumor-derived cell line (OCM-1). By contrast to normal choroidal melanocytes, the expression level of p27Kip1 was low in these cells and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway was constitutively activated. Genetic or chemical inhibition of this pathway induced p27Kip1 accumulation, whereas MAP kinase reactivation triggered a down-regulation of p27Kip1 that could be partially reversed by calpain inhibitors. In good accordance, ectopic expression of the cellular calpain inhibitor calpastatin led to an increase of endogenous p27Kip1 expression. In vitro, p27Kip1 was degraded by calpains, and OCM-1 cell extracts contained a calcium-dependent p27Kip1 degradation activity. MAP kinase inhibition partially inhibited both calpain activity and calcium-dependent p27Kip1 degradation by cellular extracts. Immunofluorescence labeling and subcellular fractionation revealed that p27Kip1 was in part localized in the cytoplasmic compartment of OCM-1 cells but not of melanocytes, and accumulated into the nucleus upon MAP kinase inhibition. MAP kinase activation triggered a cytoplasmic translocation of the protein, as well as a change in its phosphorylation status. This CRM-1-dependent cytoplasmic translocation was necessary for MAP kinase- and calpain-dependent degradation. Taken together, these data suggest that in tumor-derived cells, p27Kip1 could be degraded by calpains through a MAP kinase-dependent process, and that abnormal cytoplasmic localization of the protein, probably linked to modifications of its phosphorylation state, could be involved in this alternative mechanism of degradation.

Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Google Scholar). Two gene families of CDK inhibitors are known: the CDK4 and CDK6 specific inhibitors of the INK4 family, and the Kip/Cip inhibitors, which include p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. p27Kip1 accumulates in serum-starved and density-arrested cells, as well as in response to antiproliferative stimuli (2Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Google Scholar). Its accumulation is associated with cell cycle arrest in G1and/or with cell entry into quiescence (4Rivard N. L'Allemain G. Bartek J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18337-18341Google Scholar). Stimulation of quiescent cells by growth factors leads to a down-regulation of p27Kip1 that is necessary for the G1/S transition (5Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Google Scholar). Indeed this CDK inhibitor, first considered as a broad specificity inhibitor, now appears as a specific inhibitor of CDK2-cyclin E during the G1 phase. Recently, a number of clinical studies have linked low levels and reduced half-life of the p27Kip1 protein with a poor survival prognosis for many tumor types (for reviews see Refs. 6Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Google Scholar and 7Sgambato A. Cittadini A. Faraglia B. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 18-27Google Scholar). Consequently the regulation of p27Kip1 expression has received special attention during the last few years. Factors modifying the stability of this protein are clearly important, and various mechanisms of p27Kip1 degradation have been described. The best characterized is the ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome. This involves phosphorylation of residue Thr187 by CDK2 (8Muller D. Bouchard C. Rudolph B. Steiner P. Stuckmann I.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2168-2180Google Scholar). This pathway has been extensively dissected and appears to be involved in a variety of physiological processes. However, other p27Kip1 degradation mechanisms have also been described. These include ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome (18Shirane M. Harumiya Y. Ishida N. Hirai A. Miyamoto C.

The signal transduction pathways leading to p27Kip1regulation have been partially identified. One of them is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (31Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell.

Mitogenic stimulation also activates the p42/p44 MAP kinase (indicated as MAP kinase in the text). This pathway was also found to affect p27Kip1 regulation in several ways. In some studies, MAP kinase activation by constitutive Raf or MEK mutants led to a down-regulation of p27Kip1 (34Rivard N. Boucher M.J. Asselin C. L'Allemain G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C652-C664Google Scholar, 35Treinies I. Paterson H.F. Hooper S. Wilson R. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 321-329Google Scholar, 36Greulich H. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13280-13288Google Scholar). In contrast, similar activation in other cases did not modify the p27Kip1 level, but rather its association with CDKs (37Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Google Scholar, 38Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, accumulation of p27Kip1 following MAP kinase activation has also been described (40 ,41). Recently, we described a MAP kinase-dependent degradation of p27Kip1independent of CDK2 activity in NIH3T3 cells (42Delmas C. Manenti S. Boudjelal A. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Darbon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34958-34965Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that calpains can regulate several proteins involved in cell cycle progression, notably p53 (44Pariat M. Carillo S. Molinari M. Salvat C. Debussche L. Bracco L. Milner J. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2806-2815Google Scholar), p21 (45Chen Z. Knutson E. Kurosky A. Albrecht T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3613-3625Google Scholar), cyclin D1 (46Choi Y.H. Lee S.J. Nguyen P. Jang J.S. Lee J. Wu M.L. Takano E. Maki M. Henkart P.A. Trepel J.B. J. Biol.

The calpains are a family of nonlysosomal, calcium-dependent proteases including the ubiquitous calpains I and II, various tissue-specific isoforms, and a 28-kDa regulatory subunit (43Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Google Scholar). The activity of these proteases are tightly regulated by a highly specific endogenous inhibitor named calpastatin. In the present study, we demonstrate the existence of a calpain- and MAP kinase-dependent degradation of p27Kip1 in tumor-derived choroidal melanoma cells, and we show that nuclear export is necessary for this process. Primary cultures of human choroidal melanocytes were established essentially as previously described and their purity was assessed by immunocytochemistry using specific markers, cytofluorometric analysis, transforming growth factor-ॆ responsiveness, and cell proliferation behavior (47Mouriaux F. Casagrande F. Pillaire M.J. Manenti S. Malecaze F. Darbon J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 876-884Google Scholar). Cell culture was performed in Hams' F-12 medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 ॖg/ml amphotericin B, 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2, and 107 fetal calf serum. Cells were replated at 1:3 dilution when they reached confluence. The melanoma cell line (spindle-shape OCM-1) was kindly provided by Dr. S. Saornil (Valladolid Institute, Spain). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 57 fetal calf serum. The calpain inhibitors calpeptin, ALLM, PD150606, the calpastatin peptide, and the corresponding control peptide were fromCalbiochem. Transient transfection experiments were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as follows. Cells were plated at 106 cells per well in 6-well culture dishes. After 24 h, the transfection was usually performed with 1 ॖg of plasmid DNA mixed with 4 ॖl of LipofectAMINE reagent. Cells were incubated for 3 h with this mixture in 1 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free culture medium. At that time, 2 ml of medium containing antibiotics and 157 serum were added, and cells were left overnight in the presence of the transfection mixture. Cells were then placed in the presence of fresh culture medium containing 107 serum and then harvested after appropriate times and treatments depending on the experiment. The dominant negative (S222A) hemagglutinin 1-tagged MEK-1 (MEKSA) in pCDN3 was kindly provided by Alain Eychène (Orsay, France). The pCDNA3-calpastatin expression vector was provided by Marc Piechaczyk (Montpellier, France). For one-dimensional electrophoresis, cells were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 107 SDS-PAGE gels. For two-dimensional isoelectric focusing separations (IEF), cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 17 Nonidet P-40, 10 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na orthovanadate in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete tablet, Amersham). One volume of these fractions was mixed with 4 volumes of IEF sample buffer (7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 47 CHAPS, 50 mm DTT, 24 mm spermine) and 27 ampholine buffer was added just before the run. These fractions were loaded on immobilized linear pH (pH 3 to 10) 13-cm strips, and focused for 50,000 V/h, using the IPGphor apparatus from Amershan Biosciences. The IEF strips were either kept at −80 °C before use, or equilibrated in 50 mmTris, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 307 glycerol, 10 mmDTT for 30 min before loading for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For phosphatase treatment, immunoprecipitated p27Kip1 (see below) was incubated with 30 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (Biolabs) in 20 ॖl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 107 glycerol) for 4 h at 37 °C. Proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (20 V, 30 min). The membranes were then blocked by 57 nonfat milk and 17 bovine serum albumin in TBS-T (TBS with 0.057 Tween 20), incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, washed 3 times for 10 min in TBS-T, incubated with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody for 30 min, and washed three times. All dilutions were performed in TBS-T. The horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by an incubation of the membrane for 1 min in ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of Western blots was performed by densitometric analysis with the ImageQuant software. p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated from OCM-1 fractions with the C-19 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Cell fractions were prepared in low stringency RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2,5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.27 Tween 20, 107 glycerol, 10 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na orthovanadate). One ml of these fractions were incubated for 3 h with 5 ॖg of the polyclonal antibody. After adding 40 ॖl of protein A-Sepharose, the fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer, twice with 1 ml of PBS, and then processed for Western blot or calpain degradation assays. OCM-1 and TCM-8 cells were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold buffer B (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0,17 Nonidet P-40). After 15 min incubation in ice, cells were disrupted with several strokes of a Dounce homogeneizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were sedimented by centrifugation (800 × g, 4 °C) for 5 min and the supernatant was kept as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellets were resuspended in buffer B, placed over a sucrose 舠cushion舡 (307 sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8,3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged for 10 min (800 × g, 4 °C). The corresponding pellet containing purified nuclei was washed once with buffer B, resuspended in buffer B, sonicated for 10 s, and heated for 1 min at 90 °C for DNA denaturation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein from each sample was separated by a 12.57 SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Cells were grown on coverslips in 4-well plates. After treatment, cells were fixed in 37 paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.57 Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS, saturation was performed by incubation for 10 min in 17 fetal calf serum in PBS at room temperature. Immunolabeling was then performed as follows: coverslips were incubated with primary antibody (monoclonal antibody against p27Kip1 or polyclonal antibody against HA tag) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed twice in 17 fetal calf serum in PBS and incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (A488 antibody against mouse Ig or A594 antibody against rabbit Ig, respectively). Cells nuclei were then stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 ॖg/ml, Sigma) and coverslips were mounted with Mowiol. Fluorescence emission images were obtained with a conventional Leica microscope system or with a Leica confocal microscope system. Monoclonal anti-p27Kip1 (K25020) from Transduction Laboratories was used for Western blotting (1:2000) and immunofluorescence analysis (1:100). Polyclonal anti-p27Kip1 (C-19) sc-528 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used for immunoprecipitation at 5 ॖg/ml. The antibody specific for Ser10-phosphorylated p27Kip1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-phospho-Thr187 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Active MAPK were detected by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody from Promega (1:5000). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA.11) polyclonal antibody was from Babco and Alexa fluor antibodies were from Molecular Probes. These antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry at 1:500. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Biolabs. Antibodies against MKP-1, Raf-1, and ERK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the antibody against MEK was from Biolabs. The monoclonal antibody against calpastatin was from Biomol ResearchLaboratories. Calpains I and II were purified from 2 kg of fresh rabbit muscle using phenyl-Sepharose and anionic exchange chromatographic steps according to Garret et al. (48Garret C. Cottin P. Dufourcq J. Ducastaing A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 209-214Google Scholar), and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3 at 2 °C. For zymographic detection of calpains, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 17 Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 ॖm pepstatin, 1 ॖm aprotinin, 100 ॖm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Separation of proteins was performed in nondenaturing conditions, in 107 polyacrylamide gels containing 0.27 casein as described (49Croall D.E. Moffett K. Hatch H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 129-132Google Scholar). After the migration, gels were incubated for 20 h in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm ॆ−mercaptoethanol, after two initial washes of 30 min in this same buffer. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue, and destained to reveal the zymographic bands corresponding to calpains. As a control, a second gel was incubated in the same buffer with 5 mm EGTA instead of calcium. Radiolabeled35S-p27Kip1 proteins used for in vitro assays was produced by in vitrotranscription-translation (tnt T7 Quick System, Promega). To obtain cell lysates, cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (1:1) and incubated for 15 min in ice. After Dounce homogenization, lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were quantified for protein concentration (Bradford assay, Bio-Rad)) and stored at −80 °C. In vitro assays were performed in a 30-ॖl final volume of PBS containing in vitro translated p27Kip1 and 100 ॖg of cell lysate. Reactions were achieved at 30 °C, stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. We wished to evaluate the effect of mitogenic stimuli (growth factors and cell adhesion) on MAP kinase-mediated signaling and on the cell cycle regulatory role of p27Kip1 in OCM-1 melanoma cells. To this end, the effects of serum starvation (24 h) or suspension (24 h) on these cells were examined. Western blot analysis of the corresponding fractions revealed that p27Kip1 levels were not significantly modified by these treatments (Fig.1A, upper panel). Similarly, the activity of the p42/44 MAP kinase, detected after Western blot with a phospho-specific antibody, was not reduced by serum starvation nor by the absence of adhesion (Fig. 1A,lower panel). Neither serum starvation nor cell suspension modified the MAP kinase protein levels (not shown). By contrast, serum starvation of primary culture melanocytes led to a MAP kinase inhibition as measured by the active, phosphorylated form, as well as significantly increased p27Kip1 levels (Fig.1B). This up-regulation was further increased after 48 h of serum starvation (not shown). In asynchronous cultures, p27Kip1 expression was much higher in melanocytes than in melanoma cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the electrophoretic pattern of the protein was different in the two cell lines. p27Kip1 appeared as a doublet in melanocytes whereas a single band was detected in OCM-1 cells in these electrophoretic conditions. The doublet observed in melanocytes does not correspond to the difference of migration observed between various phosphorylated populations (see Fig. 4, A–C) and will be discussed later (Fig. 4D). In asynchronous cultures, the MAP kinase activity and protein levels were similar in both cell types, as was also the case for the expression levels of MEK and Raf-1 (not shown). By contrast, the expression of the MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) was reduced in OCM-1 cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting a possible explanation to MAP kinase deregulation. To further compare the status of p27Kip1 in transformed and normal cells, we examined protein accumulation and localization in asynchronous conditions by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 1D). Higher levels of p27Kip1 expression were again detected in melanocytes, confirming the Western blot analysis. Furthermore, subcellular localization of p27Kip1 was apparently different, with diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in transformed OCM-1 cells, versus major nuclear labeling in 507 of primary melanocytes. Together, these data suggest that MAP kinase is constitutively activated in OCM-1 cells, and that p27Kip1 regulation by mitogenic signals is different in normal melanocytes and in transformed melanoma cells.Figure 4p27Kip1 phosphorylation states. A, p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated from asynchronous OCM-1 cells, and further treated (+PPase) or not (−PPase) with calf intestinal phosphatase. Two-dimensional electrophoresis separation was then performed as described under 舠Materials and Methods,舡 and the p27Kip1 profile was analyzed by Western blot with a monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories. Major spots were numbered from 1 to 5. B, OCM-1 cells were left asynchronous (Ctr), treated for 24 h with U0126 (U0), or released from U0 block for 4 h (−U0 4h) and the two-dimensional profile of p27Kip1 from the corresponding fractions was analyzed. C, OCM-1 cells were treated with U0126 and the two-dimensional electrophoretic patterns of p27Kip1 from nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (Cy) compartments were compared. D, Western blot analysis of p27Kip1 from TCM-8 melanocytes following two-dimensional separation. Duplicated spots were numbered 1′ to 5′.E, expression of p27Kip1 and its phosphorylated forms on serine 10 (P-S10) and threonine 187 (P-T187) were compared in the cytoplasmic (Cy) and nuclear (N) fractions of asynchronous OCM-1 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then investigated whether the low levels of p27Kip1 expression in OCM-1 melanoma cells might reflect a regulatory effect of the constitutive MAP kinase activity. To modulate the level of activated MAP kinase, OCM-1 cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126. The effect of this treatment on p27Kip1 expression was followed by Western blot (Fig.2A). MAP kinase inhibition was accompanied with p27Kip1 accumulation that was maximal after 16 h. On removing the MEK inhibitor from the culture medium, a progressive down-regulation of p27Kip1 was observed beginning after 8 h (Fig. 2A). By contrast, in melanocytes the effect of U0126 on the p27Kip1 level was modest as shown by Western blot (Fig. 2B) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that MAP kinase activity can influence p27Kip1 levels to a higher extent in OCM-1 cells than in TCM-8 normal melanocytes. To confirm this result, OCM-1 cells were transfected with the dominant negative form of MEK (MEKSA). The effect on endogenous p27Kip1was investigated by double immunofluorescence labeling. We observed five times more cells with a strong nuclear labeling of p27Kip1 (557) in cells expressing MEKSA than in MEKSA-negative cells (107), which show weaker and more diffuse labeling both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2,D and E). When transfection was performed with empty pCDNA3 vector, the localization status of p27Kip1 was not modified by comparison with nontransfected cells (not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that MAP kinase activity regulates p27Kip1 levels and possibly affect its subcellular localization in OCM-1 cells. In the immunofluorescence experiments shown in Figs.1 and 2, we detected an atypical cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1 and an effect of the dominant negative MEK mutant on this localization. To further define this relationship, we performed the following immunofluorescence experiments. Cells were first treated with the MEK inhibitor for 24 h, then cultured in the absence of the inhibitor for increasing times. The cellular localization of p27Kip1 was then examined by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3A, in untreated cells, diffuse p27Kip1 staining was observed in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. In U0126-treated cells, this staining became mostly nuclear, although reduced but still evident cytoplasmic p27Kip1 remained in many cells. The intensity of the whole immunolabeling was increased in U0126-treated cells, in good correlation with the corresponding Western blot analysis (see Fig. 2A). When U0126 was removed, a clear decrease of the nuclear signal was observed after 6 h, concomitant with a discrete increase of the cytoplasmic fluorescence. Because the p27Kip1 down-regulation observed by Western blot was modest at that time (see Fig. 2A), this likely reflected a nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the protein. These data thus suggest that MAP kinase activity induces p27Kip1 cytoplasmic relocalization in OCM-1 cells. To further test this hypothesis, subcellular fractionation was performed on cells treated by the MEK inhibitor. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, about 807 of cellular p27Kip1 was cytoplasmic in asynchronous cells, whereas only 507 of the protein was cytoplasmic in cells treated with U0126 for 24 h. As a control, we employed cyclin H, described as a nuclear protein. Indeed, cyclin H was mostly detected in the nuclear fractions. When U0126 was removed from the cells to allow MAP kinase reactivation, a clear translocation of the protein from the nuclear to the cytoplasmic compartment was observed (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data show that p27Kip1 is largely cytoplasmic in OCM-1 cells, and demonstrate that this atypical localization is at least partially because of constitutive MAP kinase activity. Recent works have focused on the importance of p27Kip1 phosphorylation for its localization and its degradation. For this reason, we employed bidimensional electrophoresis to investigate the phosphorylation state of the protein in our experimental conditions. In asynchronous OCM-1 cells, the two-dimensional pattern revealed five major spots (numbered 1 to 5) ranging from pH 6."
https://openalex.org/W2002933410,"We demonstrate a genomewide approach to determine the physiological role of a putative transcription factor, Ylr266, identified through yeast genome sequencing program. We constructed activated forms of the zinc finger (Zn(2)Cys(6)) protein Ylr266, and we analyzed the corresponding transcriptomes with DNA microarrays to characterize the up-regulated genes. The direct target genes of Ylr266 were further identified by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure. The functions of the genes directly controlled by YLR266c are in agreement with the observed drug-resistance phenotype of the cell expressing an activated form of Ylr266. These target genes code for ATP-binding cassette or major facilitator superfamily transporters such as PDR15, YOR1, or AZR1 or for other proteins such as SNG1, YJL216c, or YLL056c which are already known to be involved in the yeast pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) phenomenon. YLR266c could thus be named PDR8. Overlaps with the other PDR networks argue in favor of a new specific role for PDR8 in connection with the well known PDR regulators PDR1/PDR3 and YRR1. This strategy to identify the regulatory properties of an anonymous transcription factor is likely to be generalized to all the Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and related yeasts."

The ability of 14-3-3 proteins to form homodimers or heterodimers in cells has also been demonstrated using biochemical approaches (6Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Aitken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S. Mitchell K. Peden A. Zemlickova E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the significance of 14-3-3 dimerization for target protein regulation has only been shown in a few instances. For example, although Raf binds equally well to both the dimeric and monomeric forms of 14-3-3, only the dimeric form of 14-3-3 is able to maintain Raf in an inactive state in the absence of GTP-bound Ras and to stabilize an active conformation of Raf in vivo (8Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Other evidence supporting the importance of 14-3-3 dimerization comes from studies with a mutant form of 14-3-3 that sequesters endogenous 14-3-3 into heterodimers, in which only the wild-type subunit is capable of binding to target proteins (9Zhang S. Xing H. Muslin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24865-24872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). There are only two isoforms of 14-3-3 in Drosophila, D14-3-3ζ and ε. D14-3-3ζ is highly enriched in brain and presynaptic termini of motor axons and plays important roles in regulating olfactory learning and synaptic functions (11Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that D14-3-3ζ forms a regulatory protein complex with the Drosophilacalcium-dependent potassium channel (dSlo),1 mediated by its binding to a novel channel binding protein, Slob (13Schopperle W.M. Holmqvist M.H. Zhou Y. Wang J. Wang Z. Griffith L.C. Keselman I. Kusinitz F. Dagan D. Levitan I.B.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The interaction between D14-3-3ζ and Slob is dependent upon the phosphorylations of two serine residues located at the N-terminal domain of Slob. Co-expression of dSlo with D14-3-3ζ and Slob in transfected cells results in a dramatic decrease in dSlo channel activity (14Zhou Y. Schopperle W.M. Murrey H. Jaramillo A. Dagan D. Griffith L.C. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that D14-3-3ζ may participate in the regulation of ion channel activity and synaptic transmission in the nervous system. To investigate the molecular mechanism of this regulatory protein complex, we explored the role of 14-3-3 dimerization in regulating dSlo channel function. We report here that D14-3-3ζ forms dimers when expressed in cell lines. Similar to mammalian 14-3-3, substitution of key amino acids in the N-terminal domain of D14-3-3ζ abolishes its dimerization and produces a monomeric form of D14-3-3ζ. We found that the D14-3-3ζ monomer is capable of forming a complex with dSlo, via binding to Slob. Moreover, the dSlo channel activity, measured using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique, is similarly modulated when dSlo is co-expressed with Slob, together with either the wild-type or the dimerization-deficient mutant form of D14-3-3ζ. We also show that modulation of dSlo channel activity by wild-type D14-3-3ζ is not affected by overexpression of another 14-3-3ζ mutant, which can heterodimerize with wild-type 14-3-3 but does not itself bind to Slob. Taken together, these results suggest that monomeric D14-3-3ζ is capable of modulating dSlo channel activity in this regulatory complex. Rabbit polyclonal anti-dSlo, anti-Slob, and anti-14-3-3 antibodies were generated and purified as described previously (13Schopperle W.M. Holmqvist M.H. Zhou Y. Wang J. Wang Z. Griffith L.C.

Anti-1D4 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. D. Oprian (Brandeis University). The 14-3-3 dimerization-deficient mutants were created using site-directed mutagenesis of the following D14-3-3ζ amino acids: L15AE to Q15QR and R88VE to N88VQ. A PCR strategy with appropriate primers was used to introduce the pertinent mutations and to generate 1D4 or FLAG epitope tags on the C terminus of D14-3-3ζ cDNA. The PCR products were then cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3. Wild-type and dimerization-deficient mutant 14-3-3ζ-EBFP cDNAs were constructed by cloning the respective D14-3-3ζ cDNA into the vector pEBFP-N1 (Clontech). QuikChange strategy (Stratagene) was used to generate mutations in D14-3-3ζ at amino acid residues Arg-59 and Arg-63 (R59A/R63A). Construction of dSlo-pcDNA3, dSlo-EGFP, and Slob-pcDNA3 was as described previously (13Schopperle W.M. Holmqvist M.H. Zhou Y. Wang J. Wang Z. Griffith L.C. Keselman I. Kusinitz F. Dagan D.

A calcium phosphate transfection protocol was used to introduce cDNAs into the cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (Sigma)). After a centrifugation to remove insoluble debris from the lysate, the supernatant was precleared with 50 μl/ml protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). 14-3-3 proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-1D4 or anti-FLAG antibodies (4 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 50 μl/ml protein A/G plus-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were then washed with lysis buffer five times. Transfected cells were lysed in a HEPES-based lysis buffer containing 1% Triton, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaNO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was added to the lysates to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and they were incubated at 4 °C with slow rotation for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with 1× SDS gel-loading buffer. Proteins in the cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS), the blots were probed with appropriate primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated with a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes of the membrane with TBST and one wash with TBS, protein complexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). dSlo channel activity was recorded in the whole-cell configuration from tsA201 cells expressing dSlo-EGFP and Slob, together with pEBFP vector, or wild-type or dimerization-deficient mutant D14-3-3ζ-EBFP. For experiments with R59A/R63A 14-3-3-1D4, cells were transfected with dSlo-EGFP, Slob and WT D14-3-3ζ-EBFP together with pcDNA3 vector, or R59A/R63A 14-3-3-1D4, in a 1:1:1:2 molar ratio. The FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was used to transfect cells with these cDNAs. Recordings were done 1–2 days after transfection on an Axiovert 25 inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Transfected cells bearing both GFP and BFP fluorescence were identified with the fluorescein isothiocyanate and BFP filter sets. Patch electrodes with resistances of 1–3 MΩ were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished. The bath solution contained (in millimolar): 30 KCl, 120 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). The pipette solution contained (in millimolar): 150 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 BAPTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). Free calcium concentrations in the pipette solution were determined as described previously (15Zhou Y. Wang J. Wen H. Kucherovsky O. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3855-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz with an Axopatch 200A amplifier. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with pCLAMP8 software. All results are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance. The crystal structure of human 14-3-3ζ shows that the dimerization interface is formed by interaction of helix A with helices C and D (3Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Substitutions of several key amino acids in both helices A and D result in a dimer-deficient form of human 14-3-3ζ (8Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Because D14-3-3ζ is highly homologous to its mammalian counterparts, with an 81.2% amino acid sequence identity between human 14-3-3ζ and D14-3-3ζ (Fig.1 A), we used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the role of these key amino acids in dimer formation of D14-3-3ζ. Mutations of D14-3-3ζ were made in helix A (L15AE to Q15QR, MW-14-3-3), or helix D (R88VE to N88VQ, WM-14-3-3), or both (MM-14-3-3) (Fig. 1, A and B). For biochemical studies, cDNA constructs for both the wild-type and mutant forms of D14-3-3ζ were tagged with either a 1D4 or FLAG epitope (Fig. 1 B). The ability of D14-3-3ζ to dimerize was first tested using a co-immunoprecipitation approach. Wild-type D14-3-3ζs with the 1D4 and FLAG epitope tags were co-expressed in tsA201 cells. D14-3-3ζ-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was probed with anti-1D4 antibody on a Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2 A,lane 1, D14-3-3ζ-1D4 co-immunoprecipitates with D14-3-3ζ-FLAG. In addition, we used a chemical cross-linking method to verify the dimerization of D14-3-3ζ. When cell lysates from wild-type D14-3-3ζ-transfected cells were incubated with DSS, two bands corresponding to the molecular weights of the monomeric and dimeric D14-3-3ζ were detected on the Western blot (Fig.2 B, lane 1). Taken together, these results show that wild-type D14-3-3ζ is capable of forming dimers in vitro. All three D14-3-3ζ mutants are readily expressed in tsA201 cells. On a Western blot, they migrate at positions similar to that of wild-type D14-3-3ζ (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that they are metabolically stable. We then examined the effect of these mutations on D14-3-3ζ's ability to dimerize. As shown in Fig. 2 (A andB), although substitutions of the two amino acids in helix D (WM-D14-3-3ζ) have little effect on the dimerization of D14-3-3ζ (lane 2), mutations of the three amino acids in helix A (MW-D14-3-3ζ) completely abolish the formation of a D14-3-3ζ dimerin vitro, as determined by both co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking assays (lane 3). In addition, substitution of all five amino acids in both helices A and D (MM-D14-3-3ζ) also results in a total loss of D14-3-3ζ dimerization (Fig. 2,A and B, lane 4). These data indicate that the key amino acids identified in human 14-3-3ζ are conserved and critical for dimerization of D14-3-3ζ as well (8Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To determine if the dimerization-deficient mutants of D14-3-3ζ are capable of binding Slob, we again utilized the co-immunoprecipitation strategy. Wild-type or dimerization-deficient mutants of D14-3-3ζ were co-expressed with Slob in tsA201 cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for 14-3-3. The immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Slob antibody for 14-3-3-bound Slob. As shown in Fig.3, all three mutants of D14-3-3ζ bind Slob as well as does wild-type D14-3-3ζ, suggesting that these mutations in D14-3-3ζ do not affect its ability to interact with Slob. These results suggest that the D14-3-3ζ monomer is sufficient to bind Slob. Wild-type D14-3-3ζ interacts with the dSlo channel, via its binding to Slob (14Zhou Y. Schopperle W.M. Murrey H. Jaramillo A. Dagan D. Griffith L.C. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We asked whether the dSlo·Slob·D14-3-3ζ protein complex persists with monomeric D14-3-3ζ. Either the wild-type or dimerization-deficient mutant D14-3-3ζ (MM-D14-3-3ζ) was co-expressed with both Slob and dSlo in tsA201 cells, and the 14-3-3 immunoprecipitate was probed on a Western blot with anti-dSlo antibody for dSlo protein present in the complex. As shown in Fig.4, dSlo was co-immunoprecipitated equally well with both the wild-type (lane 1) and dimerization-deficient mutant MM-D14-3-3ζ (lane 2). These results show that, in the presence of Slob, the monomeric D14-3-3ζ is able to enter into a protein complex with the dSlo channel. We have shown previously that co-transfection of D14-3-3ζ, together with Slob, dramatically decreases the activity of dSlo channels (14Zhou Y. Schopperle W.M. Murrey H. Jaramillo A. Dagan D. Griffith L.C. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To investigate whether dimerization of D14-3-3ζ is necessary for modulation of the dSlo channel by D14-3-3ζ, we measured dSlo currents using the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration. dSlo-EGFP and D14-3-3ζ-EBFP were used in these experiments to identify co-transfected cells by fluorescence. In tsA201 cells transfected with cDNAs for both dSlo and Slob, whole-cell K+ currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −80 mV, with 30 μmintracellular free Ca2+ (Fig.5 A). When wild-type D14-3-3ζ was co-expressed with Slob and dSlo, dSlo channel activity was decreased dramatically (Fig. 5 B), as evidenced by a slowdown of activation kinetics (Fig. 5 D) and a reduction of peak current amplitude (Fig. 5 E) evoked by the same depolarizations. This is consistent with our previous study in detached membrane patches (14Zhou Y. Schopperle W.M. Murrey H. Jaramillo A. Dagan D. Griffith L.C. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine if the D14-3-3ζ dimer is required to modulate the dSlo channel activity in this protein complex, we fused EBFP to one of the dimerization-deficient mutants of D14-3-3ζ, MM-D14-3-3ζ, which does not dimerize but interacts with dSlo via Slob (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Fusion of EBFP to wild-type and mutant D14-3-3ζ does not interfere with their binding to Slob (data not shown). In addition, we used chemical cross-linking to confirm that EBFP-tagged wild-type 14-3-3 proteins still form dimers, but MM-D14-3-3-EBFP does not dimerize (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 C, co-transfection of MM-D14-3-3ζ, together with Slob and dSlo, also decreases the whole-cell current of dSlo channels. The extent of reduction of current amplitude and the slowdown of activation by co-transfection of D14-3-3ζ is not significantly different between wild-type and dimerization-deficient forms of D14-3-3ζ (Fig. 5, D andE). At +150 mV, the time constant for activation (τ) of dSlo current is 7.8 ± 4.3 ms in the absence of D14-3-3ζ and 120.9 ± 43.2 ms or 134.9 ± 71.5 ms in the presence of wild-type or mutant D14-3-3ζ, respectively (Fig. 5 D). The dSlo current density at +150 mV is 805 ± 397 pA/picofarad (pF) in control and 353 ± 80 pA/pF in WT co-transfected and 334 ± 126 pA/pF in MM-D14-3-3ζ co-transfected cells (Fig. 5 E). Both parameters are significantly different between control and either the wild-type or mutant D14-3-3ζ co-transfected cells but not between wild-type and mutant D14-3-3ζ groups. This suggests that the monomeric D14-3-3ζ is sufficient to modulate dSlo channel activity. To explore further the role of dimerization of D14-3-3ζ in the modulation of dSlo channel activity, we constructed another mutant, R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ, which no longer binds Slob (Fig6 A) but still forms a dimer with wild-type D14-3-3ζ (Fig. 6 B, lane 1). It has been reported that similar mutants of mammalian 14-3-3 sequester wild-type 14-3-3 proteins into a heterodimer form, in which only the wild-type subunit is able to bind the target protein. This mutant thus can function as a dominant negative when dimer binding is required for the targeting of 14-3-3 proteins (9Zhang S. Xing H. Muslin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24865-24872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Kagan A. Melman Y.F. Krumerman A. McDonald T.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We first asked whether R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ can influence the binding of WT-D14-3-3ζ homodimers to Slob, via forming heterodimers with WT-D14-3-3ζ. To demonstrate that Slob is able to bind 14-3-3 homodimers, we used a different approach to detect the 14-3-3 proteins in this protein complex. Slob was co-expressed with either wild-type or the dimerization-deficient mutant MM-D14-3-3ζ, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for Slob. The immunoprecipitates were then probed with anti-14-3-3 antibody for Slob-bound 14-3-3. As shown in Fig. 7, there is more 14-3-3 protein in Slob immunoprecipitates from cells co-transfected with WT- D14-3-3ζ than those with MM-D14-3-3ζ (compare lanes 2 and 4 in the top panel). Because both WT- and MM-D14-3-3ζs have similar affinity for Slob (Fig. 3), this result suggests that Slob can bind to either 14-3-3 homodimers or monomers. Moreover, when an excess of R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ is co-expressed with either wild-type or the dimerization-deficient mutant D14-3-3ζ (Fig.7), the amount of D14-3-3ζ detected in Slob immunoprecipitates is reduced only in WT (compare lanes 1 and 2) but not in MM-D14-3-3ζ (compare lanes 3 and 4) co-transfected cells. Because R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ does not directly bind to Slob and only dimerizes with WT-D14-3-3ζ but not with MM-D14-3-3ζ (Fig. 6), the reduction of WT-D14-3-3ζ in the Slob·14-3-3 complex suggests that R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ heterodimers with WT 14-3-3 compete with WT 14-3-3 homodimers for binding to Slob. We next investigated whether R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ has an effect on the modulation of dSlo channel activity by D14-3-3ζ. Whole-cell dSlo currents were recorded from cells transfected with dSlo, Slob, and WT D14-3-3ζ in the absence or presence of R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ. We found no significant difference in either current amplitude or activation kinetics between cells with (Fig.8 B) or without (Fig.8 A) co-transfection of R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ. At +150 mV, the time constant for activation of dSlo current is 122.3 ± 104.2 ms in the absence and 111.2 ± 17.9 ms in the presence of R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ (Fig. 8 C), and the dSlo current density is 392 ± 201 pA/pF in control and 343 ± 118 pA/pF in R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ co-transfected cells (Fig. 8 D). These data show that, although R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ can heterodimerize with wild-type D14-3-3ζ, it does not interfere with the ability of D14-3-3ζ to modulate dSlo channel activity via Slob. That is, R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ does not act as a dominant negative for this response. Taken together with the results in Fig. 6, these data provide further evidence that dimer binding of D14-3-3ζ to Slob is not required for the modulation. Since their rediscovery in the late 1980s, 14-3-3 proteins have been recognized as a family of multifunctional proteins that bind to and regulate the function of a variety of cellular proteins (1Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 7Aitken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S. Mitchell K. Peden A.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6331-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). While efforts continue to identify novel 14-3-3 binding partners, recent attention has focused on investigating the molecular mechanism of 14-3-3 function, especially the role of 14-3-3 dimerization (2Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 18Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Two modes of action have been attributed to the dimeric nature of 14-3-3 proteins. First, because one 14-3-3 dimer allows simultaneous binding of two ligands, 14-3-3 proteins can serve as a scaffold to bridge the interaction between two different proteins. Such 14-3-3-mediated association has been reported for several proteins (19Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Vincenz C. Dixit V.M.

On the other hand, 14-3-3 proteins can cause conformational changes in their binding partners via interaction of the 14-3-3 dimers with multiple sites in the target protein (8Tzivion G. Luo Z.

We demonstrated previously that D14-3-3ζ modulates the activity of the dSlo channel through its interaction with the dSlo-binding protein, Slob (13Schopperle W.M. Holmqvist M.H. Zhou Y. Wang J.

The interaction between D14-3-3ζ and Slob requires phosphorylation of Slob by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and is abolished by mutations in two phosphoserine motifs in Slob (14Zhou Y. Schopperle W.M. Murrey H. Jaramillo A. Dagan D. Griffith L.C. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we asked whether modulation of dSlo channel activity requires dimerization of D14-3-3ζ. This may involve one of the following mechanisms: 1) 14-3-3 dimers may bring other proteins into this complex, thereby allowing these proteins to modulate dSlo or 2) 14-3-3 may change the conformation of Slob upon simultaneous binding of the 14-3-3 dimer to the two phosphoserine motifs in Slob. Using a combination of molecular biological and biochemical methods, we demonstrate here that D14-3-3ζ proteins form dimers in a heterologous expression system, and the amino acid residues crucial for dimerization are conserved between Drosophila and human 14-3-3 proteins, indicating that they have similar dimerization interfaces (4Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The dimerization-deficient mutants of D14-3-3ζ can be stably expressed in transfected cells. They not only bind well to Slob but also form complexes with dSlo. This is similar to reports from other groups showing that other proteins bind monomeric and dimeric forms of 14-3-3 with similar efficiency (23Ichimura T. Ito M. Itagaki C. Takahashi M. Horigome T. Omata S. Ohno S. Isobe T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We show further that co-expression of either the dimeric or the dimerization-deficient form of D14-3-3ζ, together with Slob, decreases the activity of dSlo channels in transfected cells. No significant difference was observed between wild-type and the dimerization-deficient mutant of D14-3-3ζ in modulating dSlo channel activity, as measured by changes in both the activation kinetics and the peak current density of whole-cell dSlo currents. In addition, we found that modulation of dSlo channel activity by wild-type D14-3-3ζ is not affected by overexpression of a mutant, R59A/R63A D14-3-3ζ, which interferes with the binding of 14-3-3 homodimers to Slob. These results, taken together, indicate that the modulation of dSlo channel activity does not require the formation of 14-3-3 dimers. It is not uncommon to find examples in which dimerization of 14-3-3 is not essential for its function (25Campbell J.K. Gurung R. Romero S. Speed C.J. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Mitchell C.A.

Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Our studies provide evidence that binding of monomeric D14-3-3ζ is sufficient to change dSlo channel properties. It rules out the possibility that the modulation observed in this overexpression system is dependent upon other regulatory proteins that might have been bridged by a 14-3-3 dimer. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the profound modulation of dSlo channel activity by Slob and D14-3-3ζ remains to be determined. It is well-established that ion channels are subject to modulation by intimately associated proteins, including auxiliary channel subunits, protein kinases, phosphatases, and other regulatory proteins. Although 14-3-3 proteins are abundant in brain, exploration of the function of 14-3-3 proteins in the nervous system has just begun. Several groups have reported that 14-3-3 proteins interact with various types of ion channels and membrane receptors, including Ca2+-activated Cl− channels, growth factor receptors, and γ-aminobutyric acid, type B and α2-adrenergic receptors (27Craparo A.

Moreover, a very recent report shows that 14-3-3 proteins associate with the human ether-a-go-go-related channel and that this protein-protein interaction amplifies and prolongs adrenergic stimulation of human ether-a-go-go-related K+ channel activity (16Kagan A. Melman Y.F. Krumerman A. McDonald T.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Taken together with our finding that 14-3-3 modulates dSlo channel activity in Drosophila, these data strongly suggest that the 14-3-3 protein family plays important roles in regulating diverse neuronal functions.

The most common disease-causing mutation in CFTR is a 3-base pair deletion, resulting in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (ΔF508) (3Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Inauzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tusi L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Google Scholar). This mutation accounts for ∼70% of all mutant alleles and generates a protein that is unable to fold appropriately. Misfolded ΔF508 CFTR is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and eventually degraded by the proteasome. Although the molecular basis for disease in patients bearing the ΔF508 mutation has been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular bases for disease in the more than 1000 different mutations that have been detected in CF patients (Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium, www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/CFTR).In addition to its localization within the apical plasma membrane, morphological, biochemical, and functional data indicate that CFTR is also localized to endosomal and recycling compartments (8Bradbury N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S175-S191Google Scholar, 9Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8296-8302Google Scholar, 10Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14568-14572Google Scholar). The distribution of CFTR between endosomes and the plasma membrane appears to be in a dynamic equilibrium. The rapid efficient endocytosis of CFTR is mediated by clathrin-coated pits in both polarized and non-polarized cells, and CFTR can be detected in isolated clathrin-coated vesicles (9Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8296-8302Google Scholar). Efficient internalization of integral membrane proteins relies on the presence of short peptide sequences within their cytoplasmic domains. Tyrosine- and dileucine/leucine-isoleucine-based endocytic signals have been the most extensively studied endocytic signals identified in type I and type II membrane proteins (12Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Google Scholar, 13Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Google Scholar). Studies utilizing full-length (14Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3655-3660Google Scholar) and chimeric proteins fused to either the transferrin receptor (15Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Google Scholar) or the interleukin 2 receptor (16Hu W. Howard M. Lukacs G.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 561-572Google Scholar) have identified a tyrosine-based motif (1424YDSI) in the carboxyl tail of CFTR. Moreover, cross-linking and in vitropull-down assays demonstrated that Tyr1424 associates with the μ subunit of the AP-2 component of the clathrin endocytic machinery (17Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46251-46259Google Scholar). Recently an individual with mutation N287Y (991A→T) was identified based on a diagnosis of elevated sweat electrolytes (18Shrimpton A.E. Borowitz D. Swender P. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 436-442Google Scholar). Since tyrosine-based signals are important in endocytic targeting, we hypothesized that the N287Y mutation generated a novel additional internalization signal in CFTR (Fig. 1 a), leading to reduced cell surface expression of CFTR as a result of increased endocytic activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with morphological, biochemical, and functional assays, we demonstrate that N287Y CFTR generates a novel endocytic sequence enhancing the endocytic rate of CFTR compared with wild type. Such increased endocytosis leads to a reduced steady-state level of CFTR at the plasma membrane, likely accounting for the CF phenotype observed in patients bearing this mutation. Moreover, since neither biosynthesis nor single channel kinetics are appreciably altered in this mutation, the sole molecular basis for this disease-causing mutation appears to be altered endocytic rates. These studies reveal not only a novel class of CFTR mutations but also a new paradigm in the localization of endocytic sequences in polytopic proteins.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the N287Y mutation in CFTR causes clinical disease by dramatically increasing the rate at which CFTR is sequestered from the plasma membrane without altering its channel properties. Although there are several classes of CF-causing mutations, they nonetheless can be broadly grouped into two main categories (23Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Google Scholar, 24Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 777-807Google Scholar). The first group includes those mutants that affect channel density at the cell surface either by affecting protein synthesis (class I); by reducing protein folding, processing, and export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (class II); or by altering stability and abundance of mRNA or protein (class V). Disease-associated mutations within the second group generate CFTR molecules that reach the cell surface but fail to appropriately transport chloride ions either because of a defect in regulation by ATP and protein kinase A (class III) or channel conductance (class IV). Several mutations, including the ΔF508 mutation, display disruption in both protein traffic and ion channel activation/conductance. Recently Lukacs and colleagues (22Haardt M. Benharouga M. Lechardeur D. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21873-21877Google Scholar) have suggested a class VI mutation that would include mutations in CFTR that alter protein stability within the plasma membrane by increasing degradation rates. Several point mutations have been described in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic loops of CFTR in CF patients (25Seibert F.S. Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11966-11974Google Scholar, 26Ferec C. Novelli G. Verlingue C. Quere I. Dallapiccola B. Audrezet M.P. Mercier B. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1995; 9: 135-137Google Scholar). Based upon these studies and others (27Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Google Scholar), the intracellular loops of CFTR are emerging as significant contributors to CFTR trafficking and function. Approximately half of the disease-causing point mutations identified in the second intracellular loop give rise to processing mutants; the rest appear to process appropriately but have significantly reduced open probabilities.Here we report a novel class of CFTR mutation. In contrast to previously reported mutations in CFTR, the biosynthesis, exocytic insertion into the plasma membrane, overall protein stability, and single channel kinetics are unaltered; only endocytic kinetics are changed. The N287Y mutation, a mutation in the second intracellular loop, results in a channel that is biosynthetically and biophysically normal but has greater endocytosis kinetics compared with wild-type CFTR. This increased endocytic rate results in a significant reduction (∼50%) in steady-state CFTR levels in the plasma membrane as determined by cell surface biotinylation and whole cell patch clamp analysis. Similarly targeting of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells is unaffected by the N287Y mutation. In contrast to other mutations in the second intracellular loop, the N287Y mutation has no functional consequence on the gating kinetics of CFTR. Thus open probability and single channel conductance are essentially wild type. The only physiological consequence of the N287Y mutation is therefore to produce a more rapidly endocytosed protein, reducing steady-state levels in the plasma membrane. The genotype of the initial patient reported to have the N287Y mutation was ΔF508/N287Y (18Shrimpton A.E. Borowitz D. Swender P. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 436-442Google Scholar). Since little or no cell surface CFTR is produced by the ΔF508 allele, the only cell surface CFTR protein is produced by the N287Y allele. This would lead to a 75% reduction in the amount of CFTR at the cell surface in this patient compared with an individual homozygous for wild-type CFTR.The most parsimonious interpretation of our data is that the N287Y mutation generates a novel tyrosine-based endocytic motif. Yet the mutant tyrosine-containing sequence (284MIENLRQT → 284MIEYLRQT) does not conform to the canonical NPXY or YXXΦ sequences whereX is a variable amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic. However, non-canonical tyrosine-based endocytic motifs have recently been described in ionotropic receptors (28Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Google Scholar) that result in AP-2-mediated targeting to the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. Thus it is possible that the N287Y mutation results in the generation of a sequence that displays modest affinity for the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex. Although we have focused upon the role of the N287Y mutation in mediating enhanced endocytosis of CFTR, it is still a formal possibility that the N287Y mutation could also reduce the endocytic recycling rate. However, it still remains to be determined whether CFTR does indeed recycle or whether endocytosed CFTR is degraded. It is of interest to note that the N287Y mutation is a gain of function mutation and appears to generate an endocytic signal that is present within the body of the protein rather than at the termini of the protein, a localization not previously identified in polytopic membrane proteins. The first identification of an endocytic targeting sequence and a disease-causing mutation within that sequence was the NPVY sequence identified in the cytoplasmic tail of the low density lipoprotein receptor; mutations in this sequence result in an inhibition of endocytic internalization of the low density lipoprotein receptor (29Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1976; 4: 663-674Google Scholar, 30Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Google Scholar) with concomitant increases in plasma low density lipoprotein. In contrast, our studies report a mutation that generates an additional endocytic signal resulting in increased rates of endocytosis and loss of CFTR from the cell surface. In the broader context of molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of human genetic diseases, the significance of our observations lies in the recognition that mutations can reduce the expression level of a membrane protein not only by impairing its biosynthesis or stability (or in the case of ion channels their biophysical fingerprint) but also by accelerating endocytic retrieval from the plasma membrane. Disruption of intracellular trafficking events has been recognized as the underlying molecular basis for a growing number of human genetic diseases including diabetes mellitus, familial hypercholesterolemia, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, α1-antitrypsin activity, and cystic fibrosis (CF)1 (1Aridor M.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46251-46259Google Scholar). Recently an individual with mutation N287Y (991A→T) was identified based on a diagnosis of elevated sweat electrolytes (18Shrimpton A.E. Borowitz D. Swender P. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 436-442Google Scholar). Since tyrosine-based signals are important in endocytic targeting, we hypothesized that the N287Y mutation generated a novel additional internalization signal in CFTR (Fig. 1 a), leading to reduced cell surface expression of CFTR as a result of increased endocytic activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with morphological, biochemical, and functional assays, we demonstrate that N287Y CFTR generates a novel endocytic sequence enhancing the endocytic rate of CFTR compared with wild type. Such increased endocytosis leads to a reduced steady-state level of CFTR at the plasma membrane, likely accounting for the CF phenotype observed in patients bearing this mutation. Moreover, since neither biosynthesis nor single channel kinetics are appreciably altered in this mutation, the sole molecular basis for this disease-causing mutation appears to be altered endocytic rates. These studies reveal not only a novel class of CFTR mutations but also a new paradigm in the localization of endocytic sequences in polytopic proteins. DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the N287Y mutation in CFTR causes clinical disease by dramatically increasing the rate at which CFTR is sequestered from the plasma membrane without altering its channel properties. Although there are several classes of CF-causing mutations, they nonetheless can be broadly grouped into two main categories (23Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Google Scholar, 24Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 777-807Google Scholar). The first group includes those mutants that affect channel density at the cell surface either by affecting protein synthesis (class I); by reducing protein folding, processing, and export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (class II); or by altering stability and abundance of mRNA or protein (class V). Disease-associated mutations within the second group generate CFTR molecules that reach the cell surface but fail to appropriately transport chloride ions either because of a defect in regulation by ATP and protein kinase A (class III) or channel conductance (class IV). Several mutations, including the ΔF508 mutation, display disruption in both protein traffic and ion channel activation/conductance. Recently Lukacs and colleagues (22Haardt M. Benharouga M. Lechardeur D. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21873-21877Google Scholar) have suggested a class VI mutation that would include mutations in CFTR that alter protein stability within the plasma membrane by increasing degradation rates. Several point mutations have been described in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic loops of CFTR in CF patients (25Seibert F.S. Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11966-11974Google Scholar, 26Ferec C. Novelli G. Verlingue C. Quere I. Dallapiccola B. Audrezet M.P. Mercier B. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1995; 9: 135-137Google Scholar). Based upon these studies and others (27Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Google Scholar), the intracellular loops of CFTR are emerging as significant contributors to CFTR trafficking and function. Approximately half of the disease-causing point mutations identified in the second intracellular loop give rise to processing mutants; the rest appear to process appropriately but have significantly reduced open probabilities.Here we report a novel class of CFTR mutation. In contrast to previously reported mutations in CFTR, the biosynthesis, exocytic insertion into the plasma membrane, overall protein stability, and single channel kinetics are unaltered; only endocytic kinetics are changed. The N287Y mutation, a mutation in the second intracellular loop, results in a channel that is biosynthetically and biophysically normal but has greater endocytosis kinetics compared with wild-type CFTR. This increased endocytic rate results in a significant reduction (∼50%) in steady-state CFTR levels in the plasma membrane as determined by cell surface biotinylation and whole cell patch clamp analysis. Similarly targeting of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells is unaffected by the N287Y mutation. In contrast to other mutations in the second intracellular loop, the N287Y mutation has no functional consequence on the gating kinetics of CFTR. Thus open probability and single channel conductance are essentially wild type. The only physiological consequence of the N287Y mutation is therefore to produce a more rapidly endocytosed protein, reducing steady-state levels in the plasma membrane. The genotype of the initial patient reported to have the N287Y mutation was ΔF508/N287Y (18Shrimpton A.E. Borowitz D. Swender P. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 436-442Google Scholar). Since little or no cell surface CFTR is produced by the ΔF508 allele, the only cell surface CFTR protein is produced by the N287Y allele. This would lead to a 75% reduction in the amount of CFTR at the cell surface in this patient compared with an individual homozygous for wild-type CFTR.The most parsimonious interpretation of our data is that the N287Y mutation generates a novel tyrosine-based endocytic motif. Yet the mutant tyrosine-containing sequence (284MIENLRQT → 284MIEYLRQT) does not conform to the canonical NPXY or YXXΦ sequences whereX is a variable amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic. However, non-canonical tyrosine-based endocytic motifs have recently been described in ionotropic receptors (28Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Google Scholar) that result in AP-2-mediated targeting to the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. Thus it is possible that the N287Y mutation results in the generation of a sequence that displays modest affinity for the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex. Although we have focused upon the role of the N287Y mutation in mediating enhanced endocytosis of CFTR, it is still a formal possibility that the N287Y mutation could also reduce the endocytic recycling rate. However, it still remains to be determined whether CFTR does indeed recycle or whether endocytosed CFTR is degraded. It is of interest to note that the N287Y mutation is a gain of function mutation and appears to generate an endocytic signal that is present within the body of the protein rather than at the termini of the protein, a localization not previously identified in polytopic membrane proteins. The first identification of an endocytic targeting sequence and a disease-causing mutation within that sequence was the NPVY sequence identified in the cytoplasmic tail of the low density lipoprotein receptor; mutations in this sequence result in an inhibition of endocytic internalization of the low density lipoprotein receptor (29Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1976; 4: 663-674Google Scholar, 30Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Google Scholar) with concomitant increases in plasma low density lipoprotein. In contrast, our studies report a mutation that generates an additional endocytic signal resulting in increased rates of endocytosis and loss of CFTR from the cell surface. In the broader context of molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of human genetic diseases, the significance of our observations lies in the recognition that mutations can reduce the expression level of a membrane protein not only by impairing its biosynthesis or stability (or in the case of ion channels their biophysical fingerprint) but also by accelerating endocytic retrieval from the plasma membrane.

The repressing activity of Mlc is inactivated by binding to the dephosphorylated form of EIICBGlc (PtsG), which is formed during the transport of glucose. Here, we demonstrate that EIIBGlc, the cytoplasmic domain of PtsG, alone is sufficient to inactivate Mlc but only when EIIBGlc is attached to the membrane by a protein anchor, which can be unrelated to PtsG. Several EIIBGlc mutants, which were altered in and around the phosphorylation site (Cys-421) of EIIBGlc, were tested for their ability to bind Mlc and to affect transcriptional repression by Mlc. The exchange of Cys-421 with serine or aspartate still allowed binding to Mlc, and in addition, derepression became constitutive, i.e. independent of phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) phosphorylation. Mutations were made in the surface-exposed residues in the vicinity of Cys-421 and identified Arg-424 as essential for binding to Mlc. Binding of Mlc to the EIIBGlcconstructs in membrane preparations paralleled their ability to derepress Mlc-dependent transcription in vivo. These observations demonstrate that it is not the charge change at Cys-421, produced by PTS phosphorylation, that allows Mlc binding but rather the structural change in the environment surrounding Cys-421 that the phosphorylation provokes. Native Mlc exists as a tetramer. Deleting 18 amino acids from the C-terminal removes a putative amphipathic helix and results in dimeric Mlc that is no longer able to repress.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25398-25402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The major target for Mlc regulation is the phosphotransferase (PTS)1-dependent transport of glucose. The expression of the genes for both of the PTS enzyme II systems capable of transporting glucose, the glucose-specific transporter (EIICBGlc = PtsG) and the less specific, so-called mannose transporter (EIIABCDMan = PtsM, ManXYZ) as well as the genes for the general components of the PTS, enzyme I, and HPr, are all controlled by Mlc. In addition to these PTS proteins, MalT, the central transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon, is subject to transcriptional control by Mlc. The maltose regulon consists of 10 genes encoding enzymes and an ABC transporter involved in the uptake and the metabolism of maltose and maltodextrins, which produce intracellular glucose and glucose-1-P. The particular feature that makes Mlc an attractive subject of study is its mode of regulation. Unlike normal prokaryotic transcriptional regulators, no low molecular weight molecule, which could act as an inducer to inactivate Mlc and prevent its binding to DNA, has been identified. The induction of Mlc-controlled genes is dependent upon the activity of the PTS, and it is the binding (sequestration) of Mlc to PtsG, when PtsG is actively transporting glucose, that inactivates Mlc (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Nam T.-W. Cho S.-H. Shin D. Kim J.-H. Jeong J.-Y. Lee J.-H. Roe J.-H. Peterkofsky A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5344-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An analogous system, in which the activity of the signal transduction protein GlnK, is regulated by sequestration by the ammonium transporter, AmtB, has been recently described (11Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Other examples of membrane association affecting the activity of transcription regulators are known (12Ostrovsky de Spicer P. Maloy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4295-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Qin Y. Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that this might be a general method used by bacteria to achieve cellular compartmentalization. Binding of Mlc to PtsG was shown to be dependent upon the phosphorylation state of Cys-421 in the EIIBGlc domain of PtsG. Mlc interacts with the non-phosphorylated Cys-421 form of PtsG, and phosphorylation by the PTS inhibits this binding. Deletions in PtsG that remove parts of the integral membrane EIIC domain but retain one or more transmembrane helices (TM) still allow binding of Mlc to membranes carrying these deleted PtsG in vitro and derepression of Mlc-controlled genes in vivo (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The largest deletion studied within EIICGlc, which was still able to regulate Mlc, removed TMs numbered 1–8 (14Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but retained a putative ninth helix (15Lengeler J.W. Jahreis K. Wehmeier U.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the interdomain “linker” sequence (16Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This linker is conserved in several members of the glucose subfamily of enzyme IIs (16Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Deletions that removed all of the EIICGlc domain and produced a soluble EIIBGlcprotein were no longer able to regulate Mlc-controlled genes (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, Nam et al. (9Nam T.-W. Cho S.-H. Shin D. Kim J.-H. Jeong J.-Y. Lee J.-H. Roe J.-H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.-O. Ryu S. Seok Y.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showed, by surface plasmon resonance, that the soluble EIIBGlc domain did interact with Mlc. This raised the question of whether the role of the ninth helix and linker sequence is just to permit the binding of the soluble EIIBGlc domain to the membrane or whether these sequences are also part of the recognition site for Mlc. The work described here was undertaken to investigate this question and to try to identify the regions of EIIBGlc that are in contact with Mlc. The solution structure of EIIBGlc is known from NMR studies (17Eberstadt M. Golic Grdadolnik S. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation site, Cys-421, is located on a convex surface and is part of a polar patch surrounded by a ring of hydrophobic residues. The amino acid residues showing a significant amide shift upon phosphorylation of Cys-421 were located in this patch (18Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Golic Grdadolnik S. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As the binding of Mlc to PtsG is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of Cys-421, we reasoned that the best candidates to interact with Mlc would be amino acids in this region. To identify contact residues, alanine mutations were constructed in these amino acids, and their effect on Mlc binding was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Mlc is a tetramer with the DNA binding domain, a helix-turn-helix motif, at the N-terminal. The part of the molecule responsible for interaction with PtsG and tetramerization is within the C-terminal region. As a first approach to define the regions of Mlc important for the contact with PtsG, C-terminal deletions were made in Mlc. These showed that a tetrameric form of Mlc was necessary to bind to EIIBGlc and to regulate Mlc-controlled genes in vivo. Most of the strains used are derivatives of JM101 carrying a ptsG-lacZ fusion on a λ-lysogen (2Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). JM-G2 carries the mlc:tet mutation, and JM-96 is ΔptsG:cat, ptsM8, which eliminates glucose uptake by the PTS. JM-G77 is ΔptsG:cat and ΔptsHIcrr:kan, which eliminates all PTS phosphorylation. These strains have been described previously (2Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IT1168 (ptsG:kan) (19Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used for membrane preparations. β-galactosidase activities were measured as described by Miller (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). To construct plasmids encoding Mlc with the 9 and 18 C-terminal amino acids deleted, two PCR fragments were amplified using the primerBamH1-mlc, N-terminal (5′-CGGATCCGATGGTTGCTGAAAACCAGCC-3′) and the primer mlc-Δ410–419-PstI, C-terminal (5′-AACTGCAGTTAACCGTTATACATCGCGTCTTTTACC-3′) or the primer mlc-Δ402–419-PstI, C-terminal (5′-AACTGCAGTTATGCAGCGCCTGCCATCGTGC-3′) using pSL104 (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (encoding wild type Mlc with N-terminal His6 tag) as template. The two PCR fragments were digested with BamHI andPstI (restriction sites in the oligonucleotides are underlined) and ligated into pGDR11, a pQE31 derivative harboring thelacI q gene (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids, pMlc410 and pMlc401, encode Mlc proteins with 9 and 18 amino acids deleted from the C terminus and an N-terminal His6 tag. The pTZ19R-derived plasmid expressing PtsG(Δ5–390) was described previously (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PtsG(Δ5–353) was made using an oligonucleotide, Glc17Nsi (5′-CCAATGCATTTCTGTGGCTGTTCCCGATCGTC-3′) homologous to DNA corresponding to amino acids 354–360 with a 5′ extension carrying anNsiI site (underlined) in phase with the NsiI site covering amino acids 4–5 of ptsG. A PCR fragment was amplified between Glc17Nsi and an oligonucleotide specific to thelac insert of pTZ19R vector DNA (Lac22). This fragment was digested with NsiI and EcoRI and inserted between the same sites of pTZ(PtsG) to replace the full-size ptsGgene. To construct the Gp8-IIB hybrid proteins, two PCR fragments, one corresponding to Gp8 and the other corresponding to the IIB domain, were independently amplified and used to replace the wild typeptsG of pTZ(PtsG). Glc17Bgl (5′-TACAGATCTCTGTGGCTGTTCCCGATCGTC-3′) corresponds to amino acids 354–360 of PtsG, and Glc15Bgl (5′-ACTAGATCTGAAGATGCAAAAGCGACA-3′) corresponds to amino acids 391–396, and both have a 5′ extension including aBglII site (underlined). DNA fragments corresponding to the EIIBGlc domain were amplified with these oligonucleotides and the primer specific to the pTZ19R vector DNA (Lac22) and the fragments digested with BglII andEcoRI. The gene for Gp8 of M13 was amplified with oligonucleotides gp8Nsi (5′-AGAATGCATTGAAAAAGTCTTTAGTCCTCAAAGCC-3′) and gp8Bgl (5′-ACTAGATCTGCTTGCTTTCGAGGTGAATTTC-3′), and restriction sites are underlined. gp8Nsi is homologous to amino acids 2–9 of Gp8 with a 5′ extension replacing the Met codon and carrying an NsiI site in phase with the NsiI site of ptsG. The gp8-Bgl oligonucleotide is homologous to the C-terminal amino acids 73–67 of Gp8 with a 5′ extension replacing the TGA stop codon and including a BglII site in phase with theBglII site of oligonucleotides Glc15Bgl and Glc17Bgl. The amplified fragment was digested with NsiI andBglII and inserted together with either of theBglII-EcoRI IIB domain fragments into the pTZ(PtsG) NsiI-EcoRI plasmid backbone. Gp8 plus the Glc17Bgl fragment gave pTZ(Gp8-TM9-IIB), whereas the Glc15Bgl fragment gave pTZ(Gp8-IIB). The pTZ(Gp8) control plasmid was made by replacing the BglII-EcoRV fragment of pTZ(Gp8-IIB) with oligonucleotides incorporating tandem stop codons in phase with Gp8 between BglII and EcoRV restriction sites. Pwo was used for PCR amplifications and the structure of the resulting plasmids verified by sequencing (by MWG Biotec AG). Oligonucleotide mutagenesis was carried out by the Kunkel method as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.74-15.79Google Scholar) on the single strands synthesized from pTZ19R(Gp8-IIB). The plasmid expressing Gp8-IIB with the C421S mutation was made as described above for the wild type construct using pMaG-C421S as template (a gift from B. Erni). IT1168 and JM-G77 transformed with different PtsG constructs were used for membrane preparations. Protocol 1, as described in Leeet al. (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was followed for measuring binding of Mlc. Antibodies against EIIBGlc were obtained from a rabbit immunized with purified EIIBGlc with a C-terminal His6 tag obtained from cells transformed with pJBH (22Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and against Mlc using Mlc-His6 purified from cells transformed with pSL104. In vitro phosphorylation to label PTS proteins in total extracts was performed as described previously (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mlc, when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, exhibits an apparent molecular weight of 46,000 (9Nam T.-W. Cho S.-H. Shin D. Kim J.-H.

When analyzed by molecular sieve chromatography (Fig.1) under non-denaturing conditions, it eluted from the column as a protein of 182,000 daltons, indicative of a tetrameric protein. Nam et al. (9Nam T.-W. Cho S.-H. Shin D. Kim J.-H. Jeong J.-Y. Lee J.-H. Roe J.-H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.-O. Ryu S. Seok Y.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have similarly estimated a native molecular weight of 172,000. Mlc and NagC (a homologous transcriptional repressor that controls genes forN-acetylglucosamine utilization (23Plumbridge J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 371-380PubMed Google Scholar)) share high sequence identity throughout their whole length. In both NagC and Mlc, the C-terminal sequence is predicted to form an α-helix that shows significant signs of an amphipathic character (Fig.2). Therefore, it seemed likely that this helix might be involved in the tetramerization of Mlc, analogous to the coiled coil of the E. coli Lac repressor (24Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3227-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We made two constructs lacking the last 9 or 18 C-terminal amino acids of Mlc. All three proteins (the two C-terminal deletions and the wild type Mlc) contain a His6 tag at their N termini for easy purification. Fig. 1 shows the results of molecular sieve chromatography with the three proteins. The variant lacking half of the putative amphipathic helix was still able to form a tetramer, whereas the variant lacking all of the helix eluted as a dimer. The in vivo effect of these proteins on the Mlc-dependentptsG-lacZ gene fusion is shown in Fig.3. Although wild type and Mlc(Δ9) still strongly repressed the expression ofptsG-lacZ, Mlc(Δ18) was unable to do so.Figure 2Helical wheel representation of the last 18 amino acids of Mlc.

JM-G2 carrying theptsG-lacZ fusion and the mlc:tet mutation was transformed with plasmids pSL104, encoding full-size Mlc with an N-terminal His6 tag; pMlc410 and pMlc401, which encode Mlc proteins with 9 and 18 amino acids deleted from the C terminus; and pGDR11, the vector plasmid. They were grown in minimal casamino acids medium, and β-galactosidase activities were measured after growth with 50 μm IPTG.

Thus, tetramerization of Mlc appears to be necessary for repression at Mlc-dependent operons as well as for binding of Mlc by PtsG. We followed the example of Görke and Rak (25Görke B. Rak B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and used Gp8, the major coat protein of bacteriophage M13, as a simple membrane anchor to replace the integral membrane EIICGlc domain of PtsG. Gp8 is synthesized as a 73-amino-acid long precursor that is processed during membrane insertion to the mature 50-amino-acid long form. Mature Gp8 consists of 20 amino acids in the periplasm, 20 amino acids spanning the plasma membrane, and a C-terminal tail of 10 amino acids in the cytoplasm. Two constructs were made. In the first (Gp8-TM9-IIB), the whole of Gp8 was inserted between amino acids 5 and 354 of PtsG, whereas in the shorter construct (Gp8-IIB), Gp8 was located between amino acids 5 and 391 of PtsG (Fig. 5). The longer hybrid protein includes TM9 and the linker between the two domains. We verified that the deletion of amino acids 5–353 from PtsG produces a membrane-bound protein capable of regulating the activity of Mlc (Fig.5). On the other hand, deleting between amino acids 5 and 390 produces a soluble protein, PtsG(Δ5–390), which cannot regulate Mlc activityin vivo (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ability of the deleted PtsG derivatives and Gp8-IIB hybrids to bind Mlc in vivo and in vitro was measured. A convenient in vivo test is the ability of plasmid-encoded Gp8-IIB constructs to derepress the ptsG-lacZ fusion carried by a λ-lysogen on the chromosome of the ΔptsHIcrr, ΔptsG strain (JM-G77). This strain produces chromosomal levels of Mlc. In a ptsG +, ΔptsHIcrr strain, which is missing the common central components of the PTS (EI, HPr, and EIIAGlc), there is no PTS phosphorylation so that PtsG is permanently unphosphorylated,i.e. in the form that will bind Mlc. This produces derepressed expression of Mlc-regulated genes, even in the absence of glucose transport. If, in addition, ptsG is deleted (ΔptsHIcrr, ΔptsG), there is no PtsG, Mlc stays bound to its DNA targets, and the expression of the fusion stays at the fully repressed, basal level. Introducing PtsG or membrane-bound deletions of PtsG on plasmids into this strain produces high level expression of the ptsG-lacZ fusion (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both Gp8-IIB constructs, expressed from IPTG-inducible plasmids, in the ΔptsHIcrr, ΔptsG strain were active in derepression of ptsG-lacZ, whereas the Gp8 domain by itself was inactive (Table I, Fig. 5).Table IEffect of mutations in Gp8-IIB on the regulation by M1cMutationA.

Open table in a new tab We confirmed that the Gp8-IIB construct was capable of binding Mlc to the membrane fraction in vitro by centrifugation as described previously (8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fig.6 A shows the ability of Gp8-IIB, contained in isolated everted membrane vesicles made in the ΔptsHIcrr, ΔptsG strain, to bind Mlc, whereas Gp8 alone is unable to bind Mlc. Western blotting with anti-EIIBGlc antibodies showed that the amounts of overproduced PtsG and Gp8-IIB in the membrane preparations were comparable (Fig. 6 B). If the amino acids present between positions 353 and 390 of PtsG were essential for the interaction with Mlc, then we would expect Gp8-EIIBGlc to be inactive. However, since it regulates ptsG-lacZ expression in vivo and binds Mlc in vitro, we can conclude that only the soluble IIB domain of PtsG, downstream of amino acid 390, is necessary for binding of Mlc. Thus, it demonstrates that TM9 and the linker region of PtsG are dispensable for Mlc binding but that the membrane attachment, be it via EIICGlc or via Gp8, is not. To clarify the interaction between the IIB domain of PtsG and Mlc, a series of mutations was made in the vicinity of Cys-421 on the Gp8-IIB construct, and the effect of the mutations on the binding of Mlc and subsequent inactivation of Mlc as repressor was studied. Gp8-IIB and its variants were expressed from plasmids in strains that were either capable of PTS-dependent phosphorylation or lacked the PTS enzymes. The various mutations were first tested in the ΔptsHIcrr, ΔptsG strain (JM-G77), in which there is no PTS phosphorylation. The binding of EIIBGlc to Mlc is expected to be maximal, and thus, derepression of Mlc-dependent genes will be at their highest level. Table I lists the mutations made and shows the results. The change of the phosphorylatable Cys-421 to Ser or Asp still allowed derepression. The change of Cys to the negatively charged Asp could have mimicked the condition of PtsG phosphorylation and therefore could have prevented Mlc-binding. Since the opposite result was obtained, it seems unlikely that the presence of the negative charge on Cys-421 is mediating Mlc release. This implies that the change in charge at Cys-421 is not the direct signal for Mlc interaction, and indeed, it shows that the Cys residue itself is not essential for binding Mlc. As the signal to bind Mlc is generated by the dephosphorylation of Cys-421, it seemed likely that residues surrounding Cys-421, which are affected by its phosphorylation (18Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Golic Grdadolnik S. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are important for the contact with Mlc. Thus, we changed the surface-exposed residues surrounding Cys-421 to Ala. In contrast to the changes at Cys-421, the change of the nearby Arg-424 to Ala produces a protein that is completely incapable of derepressing Mlc-regulated genes (and therefore incapable of binding to Mlc, see below). The ptsG-lacZ fusion remains fully repressed (Table I). Changes to Ala at positions Asp-419, Ile-422, Arg-426, and Ile-458 were still capable of fully derepressing Mlc, whereas Ala substitutions at positions Thr-423 and Gln-456 showed reduced derepression. The dramatic effect of the R424A mutation prompted us to test other substitutions at this position, in particular changes to histidine and lysine, to try to conserve the positive charge of arginine. Both were also inactive in derepression ofptsG-lacZ. The series of Gp8-IIB mutants was also tested under conditions of PTS phosphorylation (in strain JM-G96, which isptsHIcrr +ΔptsG). During growth on glycerol (i.e. in the absence of glucose), the central PTS proteins phosphorylate Cys-421, and expression of Mlc-regulated genes is low. This is the case for the wild type Gp8-IIB construct and for all the mutants except the two Cys-421 mutations, which produce highptsG-lacZ activities in this strain (Table I). Changes at Cys-421 were expected to produce proteins showing the same activity in both pts + and Δpts backgrounds. Yet the Cys-421 mutants behave somewhat differently under phosphorylating and non-phosphorylating conditions (see “Discussion”). To determine whether the mutant Gp8-IIB constructs were still sensitive to regulation by PTS phosphorylation, we grew theptsHIcrr +ΔptsG strain onN-acetylglucosamine. We demonstrated previously that growth on other PTS sugars, such as N-acetylglucosamine, provides conditions where the phosphate group on Cys-421 of EIIBGlcis continuously removed by cross-dephosphorylation between the different EIIs of the PTS so that Mlc-regulated genes are derepressed (3Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Lee S.-J. Boos W. Bouché J.-P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This allows the distinction between an inactive Gp8-IIB (one that is defective in binding Mlc) and a protein that shows wild type behavior (phosphorylation-dependent Mlc-binding) (Table I). The exchange of Arg-424 to Ala, His, or Lys produces proteins that do not derepress ptsG-lacZ under any conditions (Table I); thus, we conclude that mutations at Arg-424 lead to proteins that are genuinely impaired in binding Mlc. D419A and I422A, which were fully active in the ptsHIcrr ΔptsG strain, exhibit essentially wild type character in theptsHIcrr +ΔptsG. The other mutants that were fully or partially active in the ΔptsHIcrrstrain are more or less defective under dephosphorylating conditions, hinting at problems in Cys-421 dephosphorylation. In particular, the R426A variant showed somewhat reduced activity under these conditions. In another set of experiments, we tested the ability of the different Gp8-IIB variants to be phosphorylatedin vitro by the general components of the PTS. Total sonicated extracts of the pts + strain (JM-G96) containing the plasmid-encoded Gp8-IIB constructs were treated with32[P]ATP (which is converted in the extracts to PEP), and the labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging (Fig. 7). In this analysis, phosphorylated Gp8-IIB can easily be recognized as a di"

Kringle domains of plasminogen have been shown to demonstrate anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities. Here, we report our investigation of the kringle domain of uPA for anti-angiogenic activity and a possible cellular mechanism of action. The recombinant kringle domain of uPA (Asp45-Lys135) (UK1) inhibited endothelial cell proliferation stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or epidermal growth factor. It also inhibited migration of endothelial cells induced by VEGF or uPA, and in vivo angiogenesis on the chick chorioallantoic membrane. It did not block plasminogen activation by activated uPA in clot lysis and chromogenic substrate assays. Neither binding of UK1 to immobilized uPA receptor nor competitive inhibition of uPA binding were confirmed by real-time interaction analysis. However, internalization of UK1 followed by translocation from cytosol to nucleus was determined to be specific to endothelial cells. It also elicited a transient increase of Ca2+ flux of more than 2-fold within 2 min of exposure in an endothelial cell-specific manner. These results suggest that the kringle domain of uPA exhibits anti-angiogenic activity and that its anti-angiogenic activity may occur through a different mechanism from inhibition of uPA-uPA receptor interaction or uPA proteolytic activity and may be associated with endothelial-cell specific internalization not mediated by the uPA receptor.

Urokinase is a highly specific serine protease that converts plasminogen into plasmin. It also binds to a specific glycolipid-anchored receptor (uPA receptor) with high affinity, primarily via its growth factor-like domain, to mediate proteolysis on the cell surface. Angiogenesis is a complex, multistep process that occurs during normal physiology such as wound healing, pregnancy, and development, as well as under pathological conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and tumorigenesis (8Folkman J.

There is an increasing body of evidence showing that inhibition of angiogenesis can lead to the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis (13Folkman J. Nat.

Angiostatin was first isolated from serum and urine of tumor-bearing animals and found to consist of the first four kringles of plasminogen (14). In vitro, it specifically inhibits endothelial cell proliferation but not proliferation of other cell types, including tumor cells (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A.

However, its cellular mechanism of action remains unclear. In general, a kringle is composed of 78–80 amino acids interconnected by a triple disulfide-linked loop. The triple disulfide bonds are strictly conserved between kringles (19Castellino F.J. Beals J.M. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 26: 358-369Google Scholar). The identity of amino acid sequence between plasminogen kringles averages about 50%. Interestingly, each kringle of angiostatin has been demonstrated to display differential effects on endothelial cell proliferation and migration (17Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D.

Because angiostatin is a cryptic fragment derived from plasminogen, we were interested to learn whether the urokinase kringle domain exhibits anti-angiogenic activity, although urokinase itself promotes angiogenesis. The urokinase kringle also shares a low degree of sequence identity with the plasminogen kringles. In this work we examined the effects of the recombinant kringle domain of urokinase in anti-angiogenic activity. To explore the mechanism of action for the anti-angiogenic activity, we tested whether the kringle affects uPA proteolytic activity or interacts with uPA receptor. We also demonstrated that the internalization of the recombinant kringle domain is specific to endothelial cells, which might explain in part why it has endothelial cell-specific activity. In addition, we report an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentration elicited by the kringle domain of urokinase, specifically in endothelial cells. Recombinant human single chain-uPA (sc-uPA) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was obtained from Mogam Biotech Research Institute (Kyungki-do, Korea). Two chain-uPA (tc-uPA) was kindly provided by Green Cross Co. (Kyungki-do, Korea). Angiostatin, containing kringles 1–4, was prepared by digestion of human plasminogen with porcine elastase as published previously (28Kirsch M. Strasser J. Allelende R. Belleo L. Zhang J. Black P.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4654-4659Google Scholar) and was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Bio-prep SE 100/17 column. Recombinant human uPA receptor (uPAR, 870-UK/CF), anti-human uPAR polyclonal antibody (AF807), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from R&D system (Minneapolis, MN). The reagents used for cell culture, M199, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and trypsin solution were purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Endothelial cell growth medium (EGM®) and endothelial cell basal medium (EBM-2®, Mg2+- and Ca2+-free) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Angiogenin was purified from cow's milk as described previously (29Chang S.-I. Paik S.-B. So S.-H. Ahn B.-C. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 29: 353-358Google Scholar). Control mouse isotype IgG was provided kindly by Dr. Jeong-Im Sin (The Catholic University of Daegu, Korea). Polyclonal antisera were raised against the human recombinant urokinase kringle domain by injecting BALB/c mice three times with 100 μg of the recombinant protein. The IgG fraction was then purified from this antiserum by protein-A chromatography. Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells were isolated from fresh cords by an adaptation of the method described by Jaffe et al. (30Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Google Scholar) and maintained in M199 medium containing 20% FBS, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplements (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 90 μg/ml heparin, 25 mm Hepes, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics. Cells at passage 3, 4, or 5 were used for the experiments. Bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells were obtained from Dr. T. H. Lee (23Lee T.H. Rhim T.Y. Kim S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28805-28812Google Scholar) and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics, and 3 ng/ml bFGF. NIH 3T3 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 in air for BCE cells and in 5% CO2 in air for HUVE, NIH 3T3, and HEK-293 cells. Total RNA was isolated form HUVE cells by using a Qiagen total RNA isolation kit, and cDNAs were generated using an oligo(dT) primer and the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). cDNA encoding the amino acids spanning from Ser1 to Lys135 of human uPA was amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and two primers, forward primer A (5′-CAGAATTCCATGGCCAGCAATGAACCTCATCAAGTTCC-3′) and reverse primer B (5′-GCCGCTCGAGTTTTCCATCTGCGCAGTC-3′). The amplified cDNA was introduced into a blunt vector T-7Blue according to the manual of Perfectly pT-7Blue blunt cloning kit (Novagen, Madison, WI). The nucleotide sequence of construct was confirmed by manual sequencing using the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). For the removal of the NcoI site, PCR-directed mutagenesis was carried out without any change of amino acid sequence by two rounds of PCR reactions. In the first reaction, either forward primer C (5′-ATGGCCCGGCCCTGCCTG-3′) and reverse primer B, or forward primer A and primer D (5′-CAGGCAGGGCCGGCCCATAGTGTCAGTGCTGGCCTT-3′) were used as a primer set, and the above cDNA was used as a template (the change from G to A is indicated by boldface type). In the second round, primers A and B were used as a primer set, and two PCR products from the first round reactions as templates, to produce a single annealed PCR product. The final PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and ligated to pET-21d (Novagen) linearized withNcoI and XhoI and dephosphorylated, resulting in the recombinant plasmid pET-21d/ATF. For the construction of the expression vector for the urokinase kringle region (UK1) spanning from Asp45 to Lys135, insert cDNA was amplified using two primers, forward primer E (5′-CATAATTCCATGGATAAGTCAAAAACC-3′) and reverse primer B, and plasmid pET-21d/ATF as a template. The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into NcoI andXhoI sites of pET-21d, resulting in the expression plasmid, pET-21d/UK1. pET-21d/UK1 was used for the transformation ofEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. This construct has the following additional amino acids: methionine and alanine at the amino terminus and leucine and glutamic acid before His tag at the carboxyl terminus. The E. colitransformant was grown in 2.5 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A 600 of about 0.6. To induce the production of recombinant protein, isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. Cells were incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C and finally harvested by centrifugation for 15 min (8,000 × g). Refolding and purification of UK1 were carried out as follows. The cell pellet was suspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH. 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 20 μg/ml RNase A, 50 μg/ml DNase I) and subjected to sonication for 15 min. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 ×g. The insoluble fraction was dissolved in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 6 murea). After centrifugation, the supernatant solution was applied to a ProBondTM resin His tag affinity column (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The column was washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, and protein was eluted with buffer A containing 1 m imidazole. The eluant was stepwise diluted with 0.1 m Tris-Cl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, followed by addition of reduced (1 mm) and oxidized (0.1 mm) glutathione and incubation at room temperature overnight. The solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) and distilled water. The dialyzed solution was lyophilized, dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and applied to a Bio-prep SE 100/17 column for the final purification. The endotoxin content of purified UK1 used for cell assays did not exceed 0.6 endotoxin unit/mg of protein. Amino acid sequence was determined with an Applied Biosystems, Model Procise 491, protein sequencing system at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Seoul, Korea). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry was performed using a Voyager Biospectrometry workstation with a linear mass analyzer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at the Korea Basic Science Institute (31Kim H.-J. Park S. Bull. Korean Chem. Soc. 1999; 20: 370-372Google Scholar). BCE cell proliferation assay was performed as previously described (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A.

Biophys. 2000; 375: 359-363Google Scholar). 12,500 cells/well were plated into gelatinized 24-well culture plates and were incubated in DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics for 24 h. The media was replaced with 0.25 ml of DMEM, 5% FBS, 1% antibiotics, and the test sample applied. After 30 min of incubation, 0.25 ml of DMEM, 5% FBS, 1% antibiotics, 2 ng/ml bFGF was added to each well. After 72 h, cells were dispersed in trypsin and counted by a trypan blue exclusion method. For HUVE cells, [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was performed as the follows: 2 × 104 cells/well were plated into gelatinized 24-well culture plates and were incubated in M199, 10% FBS, 90 μg/ml heparin, 1% antibiotics for 24 h. The media was replaced with 0.25 ml of M199, 5% FBS, 90 μg/ml heparin, 1% antibiotics, and the test sample applied. After 30 min of incubation, 0.25 ml of M199, 5% FBS, 90 μg/ml heparin, 1% antibiotics, and a growth factor (6 ng/ml bFGF, 20 ng/ml VEGF, or 20 ng/ml EGF) was added to each well. After 18 h, 1 μCi (0.037 MBq) of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) was added to each well. After further incubation for 6 h, cells were fixed with methanol, washed with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid solution three times, and dissolved in 0.25 n NaOH, 1% SDS. Radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. To evaluate migration, a modified Boyden chamber-based assay (33Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Google Scholar) was performed. Transwell polycarbonate membrane (8-μm pore size) (Costar, Cambridge, MA) was coated with 0.1% gelatin. After HUVE cells were trypsinized and suspended in M199 medium (4 × 105 cells/ml), 100 μl was added to each well in the upper chamber. The filter was placed over a bottom chamber containing M199 medium, 2 ng/ml VEGF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For testing inhibitory activity, HUVE cells were preincubated with inhibitors in M199 medium in the cell culture incubator for 30 min before being added to the upper chamber, and the inhibitor was added to the bottom chamber. The assembled chamber was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to allow cells to migrate through the gelatin-coated polycarbonate filter. The filter membrane was removed from the chamber, fixed with methanol, and stained with hematoxylin Gill No. 2 (Sigma) and eosin. Non-migrated cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by scraping with a cotton swab. The total number of migrated cells with nuclei per well was counted using a digital photographic system. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The migration of HUVE cells by uPA was determined using a “scratch” wound assay (34Dimmeler S. Dernbach E. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 258-262Google Scholar, 35Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Google Scholar, 36Jianhua H. Kontos C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10760-10766Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVE cells were plated in six-well culture plates at 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured in EGM. When the cells are confluent, they were washed with prewarmed PBS and then cultured in EBM-2 supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h. The cell monolayer was scraped with a cell scraper to create a cell-free zone. After washing three times with EBM-2, HUVE cells were treated with uPA in the absence or in the presence of UK1 (10–500 ng/ml) in EBM-2 containing 1% FBS. HUVE cell migration was quantified by measuring the width of the cell-free zone (distance between the edges of the injured monolayer) after 24 h under a Leica DM IRB real-time inverted microscope. Each sample was assayed in duplicate, and the assays were repeated twice. To determine anti-angiogenic activity in vivo, a CAM assay was performed as previously described (37Nguyen M. Shing Y. Folkman J. Microvasc. Res. 1994; 47: 31-40Google Scholar, 38You W.K. So S.H. Lee H.S. Park S.Y. Yoon M.R. Chang S.-I. Kim H.Y. Joe Y.A. Hong Y.K. Chung S.I. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 197-202Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs (Pulmuone, Kyungki-do, Korea) were incubated at 37 °C and 80–90% relative humidity. At day 2, a portion of albumin was removed and a window was made on day 3. At day 4.5 of incubation, test samples loaded on a quarter size Thermanox coverslip (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were applied on the CAM of individual embryos. After another 2-day incubation, a 20% fat emulsion was injected into the CAM for observation of the inhibition zone of angiogenesis. The vascular networks in the CAMs were blindly scored for the presence or absence of an avascular zone larger than 5 mm in diameter. Human fibrinogen was prepared by a modification of the method of Mosesson et al. (39Mosesson M.W. Sherry S. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2829-2835Google Scholar). The ability of the fibrinogen to clot was higher than 95% when thrombin was added. Fibrin clot plates were prepared from fibrinogen (3 mg/ml) containing human plasminogen (0.2 mg/ml) in buffer (20 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) by adding of human thrombin (Sigma, 0.4 unit/ml) and incubating for 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of PBS containing tc-uPA (10 pmol in 10 μl of PBS) in the presence or absence of an excess molar concentration (50- or 100-fold) of UK1 were overloaded on the fibrin clot plate. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the diameter of the clear zone was photographed and measured. Ten microliters of the substrate (N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide, Sigma) solutions (3 mm) was mixed with 0.2 ml of HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 (0.1 mm, 0.16 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and 10 μl of plasminogen (1 mg/ml), and prewarmed to 25 °C. Aliquots of PBS containing tc-uPA (1.5 pmol in 10 μl of PBS) in the presence or absence of an excess molar concentration (50- or 100-fold) of UK1 were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The assays were started by the addition of the aliquots. After 10 min of incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of acetic acid. The digestion of the substrate was determined by measuring increased absorbance of freep-nitroaniline at 405 nm. An assay of UK1 and uPA binding was performed by real-time interaction analysis using a BIAcore 2000TM apparatus (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 20 °C using PBS buffer containing 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (running buffer). Recombinant uPAR (20 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) was immobilized on a CM-5 type sensor chip using the reagents and procedures supplied with the Amine Coupling Kit (BIAcore AB). The samples of UK1, sc-uPA, and tc-uPA were diluted in the running buffer before injection. For general binding assay, each sample was injected over the human uPAR at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The kinetics of binding was measured at a buffer flow of 30 μl/min, including an injection phase of 3 min followed by dissociation for 5 min. Sensor chips were regenerated at the end of each run by the injection of 0.05m acetic acid, 0.25 m NaCl. The BIAevaluationTM software was used for the subtraction of bulk effects (flow cell 1) and a blind curve obtained with buffer alone to compensate for drift. The sensorgram was analyzed by non-linear curve fitting using the BIAevaluationTMsoftware, version 3.0.2, assuming single-site association and dissociation models (1:1 binding with drift base line). Optimal sections of each curve were selected, and the applicability of the chosen model was ascertained by evaluating the resulting fitted curves, using the residual plot function of the software (requiring a random point scattering for the fit to be accepted) as well as calculation of χ2 (requiring a χ2 value below 10 in both the association and dissociation phase for acceptance). Calculated values for the association constant (k a) and the dissociation rate constant (k d) were used for deriving the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d =k d/k a). Fluorescein-labeled UK1 was prepared by reaction of the fluorescein succidimidyl ester (Pan Vera, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HUVE cells were trypsinized, seeded at 5 × 103 cells/cm2 on a 18- × 18-mm cover glass placed in six-well culture plates, and cultured in EGM for 24 h. After washing with prewarmed PBS, HUVE cells were cultured in EBM-2 supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with prewarmed (37 °C) EBM-2. A washed cover glass was mounted in a modified chamber positioned on the platform of a inverted laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). To incubate cells in prewarmed (37 °C) EBM-2 with fluorescein-labeled UK1 (1 μg/ml), exchange of the 0.5-ml chamber volume was achieved with manual volume replacement by pipetting from the above. After 30 min, the chamber was washed with prewarmed (37 °C) EBM-2, and then fluorescence was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM510). The cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 20 min, washed with EBM-2, and then fluorescence was observed with a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cells were trypsinized and seeded, at 5 × 103 cells/cm2, on a 18- × 18-mm cover glass placed in six-well plates. HUVE cells were cultured in EGM for 24 h, and NIH 3T3 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. After washing with prewarmed PBS, HUVE cells were cultured in EBM-2 supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h, and NIH 3T3 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM for 24 h. HUVE cells were washed three times with prewarmed (37 °C) EBM-2, and NIH 3T3 and HEK-293 cells were washed with prewarmed (37 °C) DMEM. The cells on the cover glass were incubated in the medium containing 4.4 μm fluo-3AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 40–60 min. After washing the cells three times with prewarmed (37 °C) EBM-2 or DMEM, the washed cover glass was mounted in a modified chamber positioned on the platform of a ZEISS inverted laser confocal microscope. The cells in prewarmed (37 °C) EBM-2 or DMEM were incubated with UK1 (5 μg/ml) as described in the above, and the fluo-3AM fluorescence images were measured at a given time by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM510). Because the kringle domain (UK1) of urokinase has no glycosylation site (7Bachman F. Bloom A.L. Forbes C.D. Thomas D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, Singapore1994: 575-613Google Scholar), we expressed it in bacteria. The recombinant plasmid constructed for UK1 expression contains 6 histidine residues at the carboxyl-terminal end. Most of the expressed protein appeared in inclusion bodies (IB) as an insoluble form. The solubilized IB protein was purified using a Ni+-chelate column, refolded in vitro, and purified to homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.1 A). The yield of purified protein was about 20% of the isolated IB. The purified UK1 migrated on SDS-PAGE as a single band of about 13–14 kDa under reducing conditions. Under non-reducing conditions, it migrated a little faster, corresponding well with the expected molecular weight (Fig.1 B). Mass spectrometric analysis indicated a molecular mass of 11,593 Da, in agreement with the calculated mass of 11,595 Da (6 Da have been subtracted due to the three disulfide bonds formed). From t"
https://openalex.org/W2036321537,"A gene encoding a 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) homolog was identified in the hyperthermophilic Archaea Aeropyrum pernix. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the produced enzyme was purified and characterized. The enzyme is an extremely thermostable DERA; its activity was not lost after incubation at 100 °C for 10 min. The enzyme has a molecular mass of ∼93 kDa and consists of four subunits with an identical molecular mass of 24 kDa. This is the first report of the presence of tetrameric DERA. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined by x-ray analysis. The subunit folds into an α/β-barrel. The asymmetric unit consists of two homologous subunits, and a crystallographic 2-fold axis generates the functional tetramer. The main chain coordinate of the monomer of the A. pernix enzyme is quite similar to that of the E. colienzyme. There was no significant difference in hydrophobic interactions and the number of ion pairs between the monomeric structures of the two enzymes. However, a significant difference in the quaternary structure was observed. The area of the subunit-subunit interface in the dimer of the A. pernix enzyme is much larger compared with the E. coli enzyme. In addition, theA. pernix enzyme is 10 amino acids longer than the E. coli enzyme in the N-terminal region and has an additional N-terminal helix. The N-terminal helix produces a unique dimer-dimer interface. This promotes the formation of a functional tetramer of theA. pernix enzyme and strengthens the hydrophobic intersubunit interactions. These structural features are considered to be responsible for the extremely high stability of the A. pernix enzyme. This is the first description of the structure of hyperthermophilic DERA and of aldolase from the Archaea domain.

This is the first description of the structure of hyperthermophilic DERA and of aldolase from the Archaea domain. 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5- phosphate aldolase Aldolases catalyze carbon–carbon bond formation and cleavage and are attractive as synthetic catalysts due to their ability to produce stereospecific carbohydrates (1Wong C.H. Halcomb R.L. Ichikawa Y. Kajimoto T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 412-432Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). They are divided into two major classes based on the mode of stabilization of reaction intermediates. Class I and II aldolases employ a Schiff base mechanism (2Gefflaut T. Blonski C. Perie J. Willson M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 301-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Morse D.E. Tsolas O. Lai C.Y. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 213-253Google Scholar) and a divalent metal ion for intermediate stabilization (4Morse D.E. Horecker B.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1968; 31: 125-181PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. 2-Deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA1; EC 4.1.2.4) belongs to the class I aldolases and catalyzes a reversible aldol reaction between acetaldehyde and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to generate 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate. DERA is unique in catalyzing the aldol reaction between two aldehydes as both the aldol donor and acceptor components. Its broad substrate specificity is an attractive characteristic for the production of a variety of stereospecific materials (5Barbas III, C.F. Wang Y.F. Wong C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 2013-2014Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The enzyme has high potential utility as an environmentally benign alternative to chiral transition metal catalysis of the asymmetric aldol reaction (6Machajewski T.D. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 1352-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). However, the practical application of DERA is still not successful because of its low stability.Since DERA was first described by Racker (7Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 196: 347-365Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), who reported the presence of DERA in mammalian tissue as well as in Escherichia coliand Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a number of the enzymes from eucaryotes and bacteria have been studied and characterized (8Feingold D.S. Hoffee P.A. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 330Google Scholar,9Valentin-Hansen P. Boetius F. Hammer-Jespersen K. Svendsen I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite its wide distribution, the physiological role of the enzyme still remains obscure: nothing is known to date about its role in eucaryotes, whereas in bacterial cells, it has been proposed to function in the catabolism of deoxyribonucleosides (10Munch-Petersen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Blank J. Hoffee P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). InBacillus cereus, the enzyme has been reported to play a key role in the utilization of the pentose moiety of exogenous nucleosides (12Tozzi M.G. Sgarrella F. Barsacchi D. Ipata P.L. Biochem. Int. 1984; 9: 319-325PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sgarrella F. Del Corso A. Tozzi M.G. Camici M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1118: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli, the gene encoding DERA belongs to the deo regulon that contains four genes encoding enzymes involved in nucleoside catabolism (11Blank J. Hoffee P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Valentin-Hansen P. Hammer-Jespersen K. Buxton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 133: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The presence of DERA has not been described so far in Archaea, the third domain of life.Recently, much attention has been paid to the isolation and characterization of enzymes from hyperthermophilic Archaea because the organisms have high potentiality as a new source of much more stable enzymes than the counterparts of mesophiles. A gene (open reading frame identification number APE2437) encoding a DERA homolog has been identified in the aerobic hyperthermophilic Archaea A. pernix via genome sequencing (15Kawarabayasi Y. Hino Y. Horikawa H. Yamazaki S. Haikawa Y. Jin-no K. Takahashi M. Sekine M. Baba S. Ankai A. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Fukui S. Nagai Y. Nishijima K. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Masuda S. Funahashi T.

In preliminary studies, we performed the cloning and expression of APE2437 in E. coli. However, no functional products could be obtained. We purified the native enzyme from A. pernix; analyzed the N-terminal amino acid sequence; and identified that TTG, which is present at 126 bp upstream from the 5′ terminus of the predicted open reading frame, is the proper initial codon. In this study, we succeeded in the expression of the gene and purification and characterization of A. pernix DERA. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of the enzyme at 2.0-Å resolution and revealed that it has a unique tetrameric structure that might contribute to the high stability. We present here the first report of the characterization and crystal structure of hyperthermophilic DERA. These are essential steps in the effort to comprehend its function and stabilizing mechanisms and also to achieve the practical application of DERA. Aldolases catalyze carbon–carbon bond formation and cleavage and are attractive as synthetic catalysts due to their ability to produce stereospecific carbohydrates (1Wong C.H. Halcomb R.L. Ichikawa Y. Kajimoto T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 412-432Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). They are divided into two major classes based on the mode of stabilization of reaction intermediates. Class I and II aldolases employ a Schiff base mechanism (2Gefflaut T. Blonski C. Perie J. Willson M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 301-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Morse D.E. Tsolas O. Lai C.Y. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 213-253Google Scholar) and a divalent metal ion for intermediate stabilization (4Morse D.E. Horecker B.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1968; 31: 125-181PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. 2-Deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA1; EC 4.1.2.4) belongs to the class I aldolases and catalyzes a reversible aldol reaction between acetaldehyde and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to generate 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate. DERA is unique in catalyzing the aldol reaction between two aldehydes as both the aldol donor and acceptor components. Its broad substrate specificity is an attractive characteristic for the production of a variety of stereospecific materials (5Barbas III, C.F. Wang Y.F. Wong C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 2013-2014Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The enzyme has high potential utility as an environmentally benign alternative to chiral transition metal catalysis of the asymmetric aldol reaction (6Machajewski T.D. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 1352-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). However, the practical application of DERA is still not successful because of its low stability. Since DERA was first described by Racker (7Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 196: 347-365Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), who reported the presence of DERA in mammalian tissue as well as in Escherichia coliand Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a number of the enzymes from eucaryotes and bacteria have been studied and characterized (8Feingold D.S. Hoffee P.A. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 330Google Scholar,9Valentin-Hansen P. Boetius F. Hammer-Jespersen K. Svendsen I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite its wide distribution, the physiological role of the enzyme still remains obscure: nothing is known to date about its role in eucaryotes, whereas in bacterial cells, it has been proposed to function in the catabolism of deoxyribonucleosides (10Munch-Petersen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Blank J. Hoffee P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). InBacillus cereus, the enzyme has been reported to play a key role in the utilization of the pentose moiety of exogenous nucleosides (12Tozzi M.G. Sgarrella F. Barsacchi D. Ipata P.L. Biochem. Int. 1984; 9: 319-325PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sgarrella F. Del Corso A. Tozzi M.G. Camici M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1118: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli, the gene encoding DERA belongs to the deo regulon that contains four genes encoding enzymes involved in nucleoside catabolism (11Blank J. Hoffee P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Valentin-Hansen P. Hammer-Jespersen K. Buxton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 133: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The presence of DERA has not been described so far in Archaea, the third domain of life. Recently, much attention has been paid to the isolation and characterization of enzymes from hyperthermophilic Archaea because the organisms have high potentiality as a new source of much more stable enzymes than the counterparts of mesophiles. A gene (open reading frame identification number APE2437) encoding a DERA homolog has been identified in the aerobic hyperthermophilic Archaea A. pernix via genome sequencing (15Kawarabayasi Y. Hino Y. Horikawa H. Yamazaki S. Haikawa Y. Jin-no K. Takahashi M. Sekine M. Baba S. Ankai A. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Fukui S. Nagai Y. Nishijima K. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Masuda S. Funahashi T.

The cyclin D-dependent kinase Cdk4 promotes progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is deregulated in many human tumors. The tumor suppressor protein p16INK4A (p16) forms a complex with Cdk4 and inhibits kinase activity. Here we report that p16 is phosphorylated, and the phosphorylated form of p16 is preferentially associated with Cdk4 in normal human fibroblasts. We mapped phosphorylation sites on exogenously overexpressed p16 to serines 7, 8, 140, and 152 and found that endogenous p16 associated with Cdk4 is phosphorylated at serine 152. All mapped phosphorylation sites lie outside of the conserved kinase-binding domain of p16 but in regions of the protein affected by mutations in familial and sporadic cancer.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). An active Cdk holoenzyme consists of a catalytic kinase subunit associated with a regulatory cyclin partner (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Cdk4 promotes progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle in response to extracellular growth signals (2Matsushime H.

The D-type cyclins promote Cdk4 activity; however, cellular cyclin D and Cdk4 associate only in response to additional growth factor-dependent signaling events (3Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5178) Google Scholar, 4LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Such events include the recruitment of assembly proteins such as p21CIP1 (p21) and p27KIP1(p27) to the Cdk4 complex (3Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5178) Google Scholar, 4LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of an active cyclin D·Cdk4 complex is a highly regulated event (3Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5178) Google Scholar). p16 is a specific inhibitor of the D-type Cdks (5Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar). p16 association with Cdk4 results in dissociation of the D-cyclin and other assembly factors such that an inactive p16·Cdk4 complex contains no other proteins (6Parry D. Mahony D. Wills K. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast to the assembly of an active Cdk4 complex, current models presume that the assembly of an inactive p16·Cdk4 complex is regulated only by the abundance of the two proteins (3Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5178) Google Scholar). Post-translational regulation of either p16 or a p16·Cdk4 complex has not been described. Furthermore, past studies have determined that p16 is not phosphorylated (7Thullberg M. Bartkova J. Khan S. Hansen K. Ronnstrand L. Lukas J. Strauss M. Bartek J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we report that p16 is phosphorylated and map the phosphorylation sites to regions of the protein outside of the kinase-binding domain. We show that phosphorylation site mutants of p16 associate with Cdk4 as wild type p16 but that the phosphorylated form of p16 is selectively associated with Cdk4 in normal human fibroblasts. Our results suggest novel post-translational regulation of p16 activity. WI-38 and U2OS cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). WI-38 cells were used at passage 3–5. U2OS cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild type p16 and all Cdk4 plasmids have been described elsewhere (8Koh J. Enders G.H. Dynlacht B.D. Harlow E. Nature. 1995; 375: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). p16 phosphorylation site mutants were constructed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). For 35S labeling, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Hyclone). The medium was aspirated, and fresh medium was added containing 0.2mCi/ml Easy Tag Express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were labeled for 3 h before lysis and immunoprecipitation. For [32P]orthophosphate labeling, cells were washed twice in phosphate-free DMEM and incubated for 30 min in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. The medium was aspirated and replaced with medium containing 1mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were incubated for 4 h prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in ELB (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol containing one complete miniprotease inhibitor tablet/10 ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The cells were incubated for 10 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibody: p16 (JC-4; Ref. 9Dai C.Y. Furth E.E. Mick R. Koh J. Takayama T. Niitsu Y. Enders G.H. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 929-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), Cdk4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology H-22), Myc tag (9E10 clone, laboratory stock), or a combination of normal mouse serum and rabbit serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Antibody complexes were captured with protein G-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences). All immunoprecipitations were washed three times in ELB prior to further manipulation. For phosphatase treatment of the Cdk4 immunoprecipitate (IP) (Fig. 1 A), the Cdk4 IP was washed twice in supplied phosphatase buffer prior to incubation with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. For blots, IPs were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore). The membranes were probed as directed using a combination of JC-2 and JC-8 to detect p16 (9Dai C.Y. Furth E.E. Mick R. Koh J. Takayama T. Niitsu Y. Enders G.H. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 929-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cdk4 was detected with Santa Cruz Biotechnology H-22. IPs were washed twice in water to remove salts. Bound proteins were eluted by vortexing gently for 20 min in 2-D buffer (160 μl total volume, 2-D buffer contained 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Chaps, and 0.2% Biolytes, pH 5–8 (Bio-Rad)). 125 μl of the reaction mixture was loaded onto a pH 5–8 2-D strip (Bio-Rad) and focused according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following focusing, the strip was reduced, alkylated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as instructed. Proteins from the resulting gel were transferred to Immobilon-P, and the labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Identity of the proteins was confirmed by blotting. The remaining volume of sample in 2-D buffer was separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as recommended on a Hunter Thin Layer Chromatography peptide mapping system (C.B.S. Scientific). Separation in the first dimension was performed at pH 1.9 and in the second at pH 3.5 (10Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Separation of phosphorylated peptides by HPLC was performed as described previously (10Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylated p16 was immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE. Labeled p16 was excised from the gel and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). The resulting tryptic peptides were separated by HPLC over a Sephasil Peptide C8 column (AmershamBiosciences). For HPLC, buffer A was 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B was 50% acetonitrile, 0.057% trifluoroacetic acid. A gradient of 0–70% buffer B was run over 30 column volumes followed by elution with 100% buffer B for 5 column volumes (column volume was 1.65 ml). Scintillation counting of the resulting fractions was performed with a Wallac 1409 DSA liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Normal human fibroblasts (WI-38 cells) were labeled with35S-protein labeling mix, and either p16 or Cdk4 was immunoprecipitated. A single protein of approximate molecular mass 16 kDa was present in each IP but not in control reactions (Fig. 1 A, top). The identity of this protein was confirmed as p16 by Western blot (Fig.1 B). When separated by isoelectric focusing, two major populations of p16 were present in these cells. Of the two populations, a single species was associated with Cdk4 (Fig. 1 A, compare IP : p16 to IP : cdk4). Upon alignment, the species appeared to be the more acidic form of p16. To test whether the form of p16 associated with Cdk4 was phosphorylated, the Cdk4 IP was treated with λ-phosphatase for 30 min prior to separation. Treatment with phosphatase caused the appearance of a second, less acidic form of p16. These results suggested that a phosphorylated form of p16 is associated with Cdk4 in WI-38 cells. To confirm phosphorylation of p16, WI-38 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. p16 recovered from these lysates had incorporated 32P (Fig. 1 B, lower panel), demonstrating that p16 is a phosphoprotein. Moreover, p16 recovered in the Cdk4 IP was greatly enriched for phospho-p16. This was not due to increased recovery of p16 since the abundance of p16 in the Cdk4 IP was lower by Western blot. The reason for incomplete recovery of p16 in the p16 IP is unclear, but it is possible that phosphorylation results in decreased availability of the epitope (11Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Together with the isoelectric focusing results from Fig. 1 A, these data demonstrate that a phosphorylated form of p16 is preferentially associated with Cdk4 in cultured normal human fibroblasts. p16 is expressed at low levels in early passage WI-38 cells. We thus mapped phosphorylation sites on exogenous p16 to obtain sufficient protein for analysis. Myc-tagged p16 was overexpressed in p16-null U2OS cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line. The cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and exogenous p16 was isolated via the Myc tag. We found that exogenous p16 was exclusively serine-phosphorylated (Fig.2 A) just like endogenous p16 (data not shown). The labeled protein was digested with trypsin following separation by SDS-PAGE. The peptide digests were then separated by HPLC. An acetonitrile gradient was used to elute proteins from a C8 column so that larger, more hydrophobic peptides tend to elute later in the run. Scintillation counting of each fraction following the separation demonstrated the presence of three distinct phosphopeptides (Fig. 2 B, top panel). Fractions containing each labeled peptide were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to Edman degradation. Scintillation counting of the amino acid released following each round of degradation allowed identification of the phosphorylation sites in overexpressed p16. Each of the three labeled peptides contained different phosphorylation sites. These sites were mapped as serines 7 and 8, serine 140, and serine 152 (for mapping details and data, see Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). We believe that both serine 7 and serine 8 can be phosphorylated because mutating either residue to alanine did not completely abrogate phosphorylation of this peptide. However, a p16 mutant lacking the eight N-terminal amino acids did not yield a corresponding N-terminal phosphopeptide. Similarly mutation of serine 152 to alanine abolished the presence of the serine 152 peak. The peak corresponding to serine 140 maps to a partial digestion product. The appearance of this peak was variable, probably due to the efficiency of digestion. We believe the completely digested peptide containing phosphorylated serine 140 does not bind the column. However, serine 140 is the only amino acid in p16 that is capable of being phosphorylated and maps correctly to a potential tryptic peptide following Edman degradation. We then asked which of these sites were phosphorylated on endogenous p16. p16 isolated from 32P-labeled WI-38 cells was digested and assayed for phosphorylation as above. We detected a single reproducible peak following labeling and digestion of endogenous p16 with trypsin (Fig. 2 B, middle panel). This peak eluted in the fractions corresponding to phosphoserine 152 on exogenous p16 (Fig. 2 B, upper panel) and eluted very close to an artificially synthesized phosphopeptide similar to the observed tryptic peptide (not shown). This peak was also present, even enriched, in p16 isolated by co-immunoprecipitation with Cdk4. We cannot rule out serine 140 phosphorylation in these IPs since the site maps to a partial tryptic digestion product. Similarly we could not rule out that other residues are phosphorylated at low levels, below the detection limit in our assay due to the low signal. However, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we detect only two major species of p16 in WI-38 cells. Of particular interest was the location of the phosphorylation sites in human p16 (Fig. 3 A). These sites lie outside of the conserved kinase-binding region of p16 (12Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The four ankyrin repeats that form the core structural unit of p16 are highly conserved between species; however, the regions surrounding the mapped phosphorylation sites are not conserved. The lack of conservation would suggest either that p16 phosphorylation is not important or that human p16 has acquired characteristics not shared between species. The correlation between p16 phosphorylation and Cdk4 association suggests the latter. In fact, at least two reports suggest functional differences between mouse and human p16 (13Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4338-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Brookes S. Rowe J. Ruas M. Llanos S. Clark P.A. Lomax M. James M.C. Vatcheva R. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Parry D. Gruis N. Smit N. Bergman W. Peters G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphorylation sites on p16 are required for Cdk4 association, we mutated each of the sites to alanine, treating the adjacent serines 7 and 8 as a single site (p16 S7A/S8A). We expressed these mutants in p16-null U2OS cells at varying levels and compared association with Cdk4 (Fig. 3 B). In the experiment shown, the cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing untagged p16 constructs driven by a retroviral long terminal repeat. In our experiments, these vectors yield lower expression than the more commonly used cytomegalovirus promoter (data not shown). To ensure transfection of equal cell numbers, the amount of total DNA was held at a constant 2 μg, consisting of increasing amounts of p16 DNA together with the appropriate amount of empty vector. Even when expressed at low levels, each p16 mutant was present in a Cdk4 IP at levels comparable to wild type p16. Moreover, a Myc-tagged p16 construct consisting of only amino acids 9–139 of the protein and lacking all phosphorylation sites still associates with Cdk4 and inhibits cell cycle progression, although the construct appears less stable than wild type p16 (data not shown). These results indicate that phosphorylation of p16 does not result in increased association with Cdk4. We have shown that p16 is phosphorylated and that the phosphorylated form of p16 is preferentially associated with Cdk4 in normal human fibroblasts. We have mapped phosphorylation sites on exogenous p16 to regions outside of the kinase-binding portion of the protein. At least one of these sites, serine 152, is phosphorylated on endogenous p16 in WI-38 cells. We have further shown that p16 phosphorylated at this site is associated with Cdk4 in WI-38 cells. Several models could explain the preferential association of phosphorylated p16 with Cdk4. The first possibility is that phosphorylation of p16 promotes association with Cdk4. The fact that phosphorylation site mutants retain their ability to associate with Cdk4 argues against this model, but these results are derived from overexpression studies in an immortalized cell line and may poorly represent the case in normal human fibroblasts. Studies of p16 mutants in normal fibroblasts are complicated by the presence of wild type p16 and difficulties in regulating delivery of a transgene. The second possibility is that phosphorylation of p16 is a consequence of association with Cdk4. We are currently investigating this hypothesis, and while possibly true, the relationship does not appear simple. Perhaps the most intriguing question is the significance of p16 phosphorylation. Overexpression of p16 does not alter the abundance or the subcellular localization of endogenous Cdk4 (data not shown). One possibility is that phosphorylation of p16 results in stabilization of an inactive p16·Cdk4 complex. p16 has three closely related INK4 family members, p15, p18, and p19 (15Carnero A. Hannon G.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 43-55PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these family members has affinity for Cdk4 equal to that of p16 (6Parry D. Mahony D. Wills K. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Thullberg M. Bartkova J. Khan S. Hansen K. Ronnstrand L. Lukas J. Strauss M. Bartek J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); however, p15, p18, and p19 do not associate stably with Cdk4 in cells in which p21 is expressed (6Parry D. Mahony D. Wills K. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been noted that p15 forms complexes with Cdk4 only if it has access to the kinase prior to p27 and that p15 cannot disrupt preformed p27-containing complexes (16Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A regulatory mechanism that actively assembles or stabilizes a phospho-p16·Cdk4 complex could explain why p16 appears to be the selective Cdk4 inhibitor in cells expressing p21 and p27. The phosphorylation sites mapped in human p16 are poor substrates for known kinases, including Cdks, which require an (S/T)P motif (25Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We believe that Cdk4 does not phosphorylate p16 because 1) the mapped sites are poor Cdk4 substrates, 2) levels of p16 phosphorylation remain high even in the presence of a kinase-dead form of Cdk4, and 3) Cdk4 does not phosphorylate p16 in vitro(data not shown). It will be of interest to identify the kinases responsible for p16 phosphorylation and determine the role these kinases might play in cell cycle regulation. The phosphorylation sites mapped in human p16 could explain mutational events associated with cancer progression. Alteration of the gene encoding p16 is among the most common mutations in human cancer, and many cases of familial melanoma are associated with inactivation of this gene (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The majority of mutations abrogate the ability of p16 to associate with its cognate kinase and simultaneously disrupt the coding region of an unrelated tumor suppressor, p14ARF (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Of note, however, are mutations that affect specifically p16 and do not alter the affinity of p16 for Cdk4 (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The effects of these mutations remain unclear despite the fact that at least one such alteration is associated with familial melanoma (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). This mutation is a duplication of the 24-base pair region comprising the initial eight amino acids of p16 including the serines 7/8 potential phosphorylation sites (18Walker G.J. Hussussian C.J. Flores J.F. Glendening J.M. Haluska F.G. Dracopoli N.C. Hayward N.K. Fountain J.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Harland M. Meloni R. Gruis N.

Deletion of the same eight amino acids has also been noted as a tumor-associated mutation (20Kumar R. Lundh Rozell B. Louhelainen J. Hemminki K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Komiya A. Suzuki H. Aida S. Yatani R. Shimazaki J. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the mutant p16 cDNAs behave like wild type p16 in previously described assays for function (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Similar data have been reported concerning mutations at the C terminus of p16 (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). One mutation affects splicing of p16 and results in an exchange of the C-terminal four amino acids DIPD for the amino acids GED (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 22Hussussian C.J. Struewing J.P. Goldstein A.M. Higgins P.A. Ally D.S. Sheahan M.D. Clark Jr., W.H. Tucker M.A. Dracopoli N.C.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6200-6209PubMed Google Scholar). A separate tumor-derived mutation eliminates the p16 stop codon and extends the C terminus by 13 amino acids (24Castellano M. Pollock P.M. Walters M.K. Sparrow L.E. Down L.M. Gabrielli B.G. Parsons P.G. Hayward N.K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4868-4875PubMed Google Scholar). Since the proteins encoded by these cDNAs are not defective in Cdk4 association, it has been difficult to explain why these mutations would be associated with cancer (17Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). All of the above listed mutations affect regions of p16 harboring the mapped phosphorylation sites. While the consequences of p16 phosphorylation remain unclear, two observations support a role for p16 phosphorylation in protein function. First, phosphorylated p16 is selectively associated with Cdk4 in normal human fibroblasts. Second, phosphorylated regions of the protein are found mutated in cancer, and these mutations do not affect known functions of the protein. That such tumor-derived p16 mutants behave normally in known assays for function suggests that novel assays must be developed to discern behavior differences for p16 phosphorylation site mutants. Elucidation of the mechanistic nature by which p16 phosphorylation affects function will be of paramount interest in understanding how p16 regulates Cdk4 activity and acts as a tumor suppressor.

https://openalex.org/W2146651848,"Chemotaxis is the consequence of environmental factors engaging their receptors to initiate signaling cascades. However, the biochemical mechanisms controlling this phenomenon are not clear. We employed an in vitro modified Boyden 48-well chemotaxis migration system to characterize the role of signal transducers in type IV collagen (CIV) induced A2058 human melanoma cell migration. Using specific pharmacological inhibitors and a series of dominant-negative and constitutively active signaling proteins, we show that Ras and Rac GTPases, PI-3K, and PKC participate in cell migration mediated by β1 integrins. Collagen also induces a time- dependent degradation of IκB-α and an increase in nuclear translocation of NF-κB which is dependent on PKC pathway. More importantly, collagen-stimulated melanoma cell migration directly correlated with an increase in NF-κB transactivation. Furthermore, CIV induced an increase in β1 integrin mRNA levels. Specific NF-κB inhibitors Helenalin and SN-50 inhibited melanoma cell migration to collagen, indicating a novel requirement for NF-κB transactivation in cell chemotaxis mediated by β1 integrin signals. These results describe signal transduction events that are initiated by type IV collagen through β1 integrins and demonstrate an important role for NF-κB in regulating melanoma chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1990665465,"Abstract Traditionally the consequences of activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by an agonist are studied using biochemical assays. In this study we use live cells and take advantage of a G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir3.1+3.2A) that is activated by the direct binding of Gβγ subunit to the channel complex to report, in real-time, using the patch clamp technique the activity of the “ternary complex” of agonist/receptor/G-protein. This analysis is further facilitated by the use of pertussis toxin-resistant fluorescent and non-fluorescent Gαi/o subunits and a series of HEK293 cell lines stably expressing both channel and receptors (including the adenosine A1 receptor, the adrenergic α2A receptor, the dopamine D2S receptor, the M4 muscarinic receptor, and the dimeric GABA-B1b/2 receptor). We systematically analyzed the contribution of the various inputs to the observed kinetic response of channel activation. Our studies indicate that the combination of agonist, GPCR, and G-protein isoform uniquely specify the behavior of these channels and thus support the importance of the whole ternary complex at a kinetic level."
https://openalex.org/W1988546996,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation is a useful technique to detect in vivo direct interaction between any transcription factor and its binding site on genomic DNA. We applied this skill to identify the direct target gene for EWS/ATF-1 by coupling with a GFP reporter assay. This novel approach isolated 62 of cloned DNA fragments responding upon EWS/ATF-1 expression and 16 of 62 clones included putative ATF-1 binding sites. Further analysis revealed that six of the cloned fragments included possible regulatory regions of ATM, GPP34, ARNT2, NKX6.1, NYD-SP28 and POSH. Most of these clones upregulated reporter activity by overexpression of EWS/ATF-1, suggesting that putative ATF-1 binding sites in these clones are functional elements for ATF-1 in vivo. Consistently, endogenous expression of these genes was upregulated by EWS/ATF-1. Interestingly, the clone containing the promoter region of POSH, which is known to be a strong inducer of apoptosis, repressed reporter activity by overexpression of EWS/ATF-1. Correspondingly, EWS/ATF-1 expression decreased endogenous POSH expression, suggesting that six isolated genes may be involved in direct regulation by EWS/ATF-1. Moreover, induction of POSH brought apoptotic cell death to KAS, the clear cell sarcoma (CCS) cell line, suggesting that repressed expression of POSH in CCS may be relevant to the normal signaling pathway in apoptosis."

The molecular mechanism by which TM improves the catalytic efficiency of thrombin toward protein C is not known. Molecular modeling of the protein C activation based on the crystal structure of thrombin in complex with the epidermal growth factor-like domains 4, 5, and 6 of TM (TM456) predicts that the binding of TM56 to exosite 1 of thrombin positions TM4 so that a negatively charged region on this domain juxtaposes a positively charged region of protein C. It has been hypothesized that electrostatic interactions between these oppositely charged residues of TM4 and protein C facilitate a proper docking of the substrate into the catalytic pocket of thrombin. To test this hypothesis, we have constructed several mutants of TM456 and protein C in which charges of the putative interacting residues on both TM4 (Asp/Glu) and protein C (Lys/Arg) have been reversed.

It can also down-regulate its own production by forming a complex with thrombomodulin (TM)1 on the surface of endothelial cells (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Upon interaction with TM, thrombin can no longer clot fibrinogen but, instead, rapidly activates protein C to activated protein C (6Esmon C.T. Thromb.

Activated protein C is a vitamin K-dependent plasma serine protease that can shut down the coagulation cascade by degrading factors Va and VIIIa by limited proteolysis (8Walker F.J. Sexton P.W.

Structural and functional data have indicated that TM binds to exosite 1 of thrombin to change the specificity of thrombin from a coagulant to an anticoagulant enzyme (10Ye J. Liu L. Esmon C.T.

Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The occupancy of exosite 1 by fibrinogen, the thrombin receptor on platelets and cofactors V and VIII is required for the recognition and efficient activation of these molecules by thrombin in the clotting cascade (3Fenton II, J.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,16Vu T.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

Thus, the binding of TM to exosite 1 competitively blocks the interaction of thrombin with these procoagulant proteins. It has been demonstrated that the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains 5 and 6 of TM to exosite 1 is sufficient to block all coagulant properties of thrombin; however, for catalyzing the activation of protein C, the fourth EGF domain of TM (TM456) is also required for its cofactor function (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Ye J. Liu L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium plays a key role in protein C activation by the thrombin-TM complex. Using Gla-domainless forms of protein C, it has been demonstrated that the Ca2+-binding site critical for activation of protein C by the thrombin-TM complex is located in the 70–80-loop of the substrate (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11701-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar)). This is the same site in trypsin that is also known to bind Ca2+ (21Bode W. Schwager P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 693-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Occupancy of this site by Ca2+is a prerequisite for the ability of TM to catalyze the rapid activation protein C by thrombin (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11701-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of Ca2+ to this site of protein C is inhibitory for activation by thrombin in the absence of TM (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11701-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the binding of Ca2+ to this site of protein C is associated with a conformational change in the activation peptide of the substrate and that the Ca2+-stabilized conformer of the activation peptide is complementary for the active site pocket of thrombin in the presence of TM but noncomplementary in the absence of the cofactor (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism by which TM456 improves the catalytic efficiency of thrombin toward protein C in the presence of Ca2+ is not known. Previously, it has been hypothesized that TM may function by inducing allosteric changes in the structure of residues in the extended binding pocket of thrombin (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that the TM-altered conformer of thrombin optimally recognizes the Ca2+-altered conformer of protein C (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of thrombin in complex with TM456 was resolved (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, structural data did not indicate any allosteric changes in the active site pocket of thrombin upon binding to the TM fragment (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of protein C activation, based on the structure of the complex, suggested that binding of the TM5 domain of the cofactor to exosite 1 of thrombin positions the TM4 domain so that a negatively charged region on this domain juxtaposes a positively charged exosite of protein C (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Several electrostatic interactions between these oppositely charged regions are postulated to facilitate a proper docking of protein C into the catalytic pocket of thrombin. Based on this model, it has been hypothesized that “substrate presentation” is the primary mechanism by which TM may function (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A previous study proposed a similar function for TM in protein C activation by thrombin (22Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine the validity of this molecular model by a mutagenesis approach, we developed a bacterial periplasmic expression system for TM456 and constructed several mutants of TM456 in which the negative charges of five residues in TM4 (Glu346, Asp349, Glu357, Glu382, and Glu374) and two residues (Asp398 and Asp400) in the interface between TM4 and TM5 were reversed by substituting each residue with a Lys in separate constructs. In addition, a double mutant of TM456 containing Glu346 → Arg and Asp349 → Lys substitutions was constructed and expressed in the same system. Then the positive charges of basic residues of the protein C exosite including Lys62, Lys63, Arg74, Arg75, and Lys78 were reversed by substituting these residues individually or in a combination of two with Glu in a mammalian expression/purification vector system. The protein C mutants were prepared in Gla-domainless forms and expressed in HEK293 cells as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic characterization of these mutant molecules by this compensatory mutagenesis approach supports the molecular model that the TM4 domain of TM456 in the complex interacts with the basic exosite of protein C. Moreover, analysis of results suggest that the 70–80-loop of protein C must be stabilized by the Ca2+ ion before it can productively interact with TM4. This accounts for the unique Ca2+ dependence of protein C activation by thrombin in the presence of TM. The wild type and charge reversal mutants of TM456 including Asp349 (D349K), Glu346/Asp349 (E346R,D349K), Glu357(E357K), Glu374 (E374K), Glu382 (E382K), Arg385 (R385E), Asp398 (D398K), and Asp400 (D400K) were prepared by PCR methods and expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli using the pIN-III-pelB expression/purification vector system as described previously (24Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant protein C derivatives were constructed in Gla-domainless forms (GD-PC) as described previously (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The charge reversal mutants of GD-PC including Lys62(K62E), Lys63 (K63E), Lys62 and Lys63 (K62E,K63E), Arg74 (R74E), Arg75 (R75E), Lys78 (K78E), and Arg74 and Arg75 (R74E,R75E) were prepared by PCR methods and expressed in HEK293 cells using RSV-PL4 expression/purification system as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both mammalian and bacterial expression vectors contain the sequence of a 12-residue epitope for the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4, for purification. Thus, both GD-PC and TM456 derivatives were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 antibody linked to Affi-gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TM456 derivatives were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column developed with 30-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.6m NaCl and 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as described for the purification of the mammalian TM456 (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accuracies of all mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to their expression. The initial rates of GD-PC activation by thrombin were measured in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, and 2.5 mmCa2+ in both the absence and the presence of TM456. In the absence of TM456, the time course of activation of each GD-PC derivative was studied by incubating 1 μM substrate with 50 nm thrombin at room temperature. At each time point (5–80 min), samples of reactions were transferred to TBS buffer containing 500 μg/ml human antithrombin to inhibit thrombin activity. At this concentration of antithrombin, the activity of thrombin was rapidly inhibited, whereas the amidolytic activity of active GD-PC remained stable for more than 120 min. The amidolytic activities of active GD-PC derivatives in the activation reactions were monitored by hydrolysis of 400 μm Spectrozyme PCa (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) in the TBS buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% PEG 8000. The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature in a V max kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The concentration of active protein C derivatives in reaction mixtures was determined by reference to standard curves that were prepared by total activation of GD-PC derivatives with excess thrombin at the time of experiments. This was accomplished by total activation of 1 μm protein C with 10 nm thrombin in complex with 100 nm TM456 and 2.5 mm Ca2+ for 90 min at 37 °C. Under these experimental conditions, the wild type zymogen was completely activated in less than 30 min. The GD-PC mutants, which were resistant to activation by the thrombin-TM456 complex in the presence of Ca2+, were totally activated with thrombin alone in 1 mm EDTA as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, 1 μmof each protein C derivative in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA was activated with 50 nm thrombin for 4 h at 37 °C. Time course analysis of the activation reactions indicated that all GD-PC derivatives were totally activated under these conditions. The ability of TM456 derivatives to bind thrombin (K d(app) values) as well as to function as a cofactor to enhance the catalytic efficiency of thrombin in activation of the GD-PC derivatives (k cat andK m values) were evaluated. TheK d(app) values were determined from the cofactor dependence of the initial rate of the activation of a subsaturating concentration of GD-PC (1 μm) in the presence of a fixed concentration of TM456 (∼5 nm) and increasing concentrations of thrombin (1–60 nm) as described (25Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K d(app) values were estimated from the saturable dependence of the GD-PC activation rates on thrombin concentration using a hyperbolic equation as described (25Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cofactor dependence of the initial rate of activation also allowed an accurate determination of the concentration of TM456 derivatives, since TM456 devoid from the chondroitin sulfate moiety binds to thrombin with a 1:1 stoichiometry (26Ye J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2373-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of the initial rate of protein C activation in the presence of TM456 derivatives was determined by incubating each GD-PC derivative (1 μM) with thrombin (1–50 nm) in complex with saturating concentrations of each TM456 derivative (>10 ×K d(app) values). Under these experimental conditions, the concentrations of the thrombin-TM456 complexes were in proximity to the concentration of free thrombin. After inhibition of thrombin activity by antithrombin, the initial rate of activation was measured from the rate of activated protein C generation as described above. When a detailed kinetic analysis was done to determine values for K m andk cat of protein C activation, the initial rates of activation were measured as a function of the GD-PC concentration with 1 nm thrombin in complex with a saturating concentration of TM456 as described above. Wild type and mutant GD-PC derivatives were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity on the HPC4 immunoaffinity column as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE analysis of zymogens indicated that protein C derivatives were expressed as two closely migrating subforms that are glycosylation variants observed previously with this protein (23Rezaie A.R.

TM456 derivatives were expressed in the periplasmic space of the XL1-B strain of E. coli using the pIN-III-pelB expression/purification vector system as described (24Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The relative positions of the mutant residues in the fourth epidermal growth factor domain of TM are schematically shown in Fig.1 A. TM456 expressed in this system contains a 12-residue epitope for the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 at its N-terminal domain for an easy purification. The periplasmic extract was prepared by a hypotonic shock and passed through the HPC4 column in the presence of Ca2+ as described (24Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The column was extensively washed with TBS containing 1 m NaCl and 2.5 mm Ca2+ followed by elution with TBS containing 5 mm EDTA as described (24Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The HPC4 eluates were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis under nonreducing conditions suggested that all TM456 derivatives had been purified to homogeneity, migrating as single bands with expected apparent molecular masses of ∼15 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Wild type forms of both mammalian and periplasmic TM456 exhibited comparable cofactor activities (within 80%) as determined by protein C activation assays described below. The initial rates of thrombin-catalyzed wild type and mutant GD-PC activation were studied in both the absence and presence of TM456. GD-PC is known to contain a single Ca2+-binding site with an affinity of ∼50 μm, which is located in the protease domain of protein C in a loop consisting of residues Glu70–Glu80(19Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the binding of Ca2+ to this loop of protein C is inhibitory for activation by thrombin in the absence of TM (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the metal ion is an obligatory cofactor for activation by thrombin in the presence of the cofactor (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since several residues of the 70–80-loop were targeted for the mutagenesis study, it was essential to evaluate the extent to which the interaction of these mutants with Ca2+ has been altered. Thus, the initial rates of GD-PC activation by thrombin were studied as a function of varying Ca2+ concentrations. To simplify the comparisons of the Ca2+ dependence of activations, the data were normalized to maximal inhibition values as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the Ca2+ ion inhibited the activation of all GD-PC derivatives with the exceptions of R75E and R74E,R75E with a similar half-maximal value of 30–40 μm (see legend of Fig. 2). However, these values were elevated ∼2–3-fold for the R75E and R74E,R75E mutants. Since the half-maximal values for the activation of the R74E mutant were not affected, the altered effect of Ca2+ in the thrombin activation of the double mutant R74E,R75E is also probably due to the R75E mutation. Next, the time course of the initial rates of GD-PC activation by thrombin alone or by the thrombin-TM456 complex was studied at saturating concentration of Ca2+ (2.5 mm). As shown in Fig. 3 A, thrombin activated all GD-PC derivatives with comparable or improved initial rates. The greatest improvement (∼6–7-fold) was observed for the thrombin activation of the R74E,R75E double mutant. A detailed kinetic analysis was not possible, since protein C exhibits aK m of greater than 60 μm for thrombin in the presence of Ca2+ (29Esmon N.L. DeBault L.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5548-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to activation by thrombin alone, the TM-dependent activations of the GD-PC derivatives were all impaired at varying degrees. Under conditions described in the legend to Fig. 3, no TM456-dependent activation by thrombin was detected for the R74E and R75E mutants of GD-PC, and the rates were impaired ∼2-fold for K63E and K78E and ∼5-fold for the K62E and K62E,K63E mutants (Fig. 3 B). These results suggested that the basic residues of both 60- and 70–80-loops are critical for the thrombin activation of protein C in the presence of TM. It should be noted that in addition to these residues, it is known that basic residues of the 39-loop (Lys37–Lys39) are also required for the TM-dependent protein C activation by thrombin (30Gerlitz B. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22285-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we found that the activation of a triple GD-PC K37E,K38E,K39E mutant by thrombin alone was normal in both EDTA and Ca2+, but it was severely impaired in the presence of TM456 (data not shown). The initial rates of wild type and mutant GD-PC activation by thrombin in complex with different TM456 derivatives were measured as described above. As shown in Fig.4, relative to wild type TM456, the cofactor activities of all TM456 mutants in catalyzing the thrombin activation of wild type GD-PC were impaired. The impairments ranged from a maximum of 90–95% for the E357K, D398K, and D400K mutants to a minimum of 50–60% for the E374K and R385E mutants of TM456. These results appear to indicate that charged residues under study in TM4 play a role in the cofactor function of TM in enhancing the thrombin activation of protein C. This is consistent with the literature (25Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for the preparation of the R385E mutant of TM456 was that in the previous molecular model of protein C activation it was proposed that the interaction of Arg385 of TM4 with a basic residue of the 70–80-loop of protein C (particularly Glu80) might be responsible for the unique Ca2+ dependence of activation (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, the initial rate of wild type GD-PC activation by thrombin in complex with saturating concentrations of TM456 derivatives were studied as a function of varying concentrations of Ca2+. The metal ion enhanced the rate of GD-PC activation by thrombin in complex with wild type TM456 by an order of magnitude withK d(app) of ∼20 μmat room temperature (data not shown). Interestingly, however, no Ca2+ dependence of GD-PC activation was observed by thrombin in complex with D349K, E357K, D398K, and D400K mutants of TM456. Although a similar K d(app) of ∼20 μm for GD-PC activation by thrombin in complex with other mutants of TM456 was observed, the extent of the cofactor effect of Ca2+ was, nonetheless, reduced to ∼2-fold with these mutants. Similarly, no Ca2+-dependence of activation was observed for the thrombin activation of the R74E and R75E mutants of GD-PC in the presence of wild type TM456. Since the interaction of thrombin with TM456 is not known to be Ca2+-dependent (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it follows that the cofactor defect of TM456 derivatives must primarily be caused by their inability to interact with the Ca2+-stabilized conformer of GD-PC in the complex. Next, the cofactor functions of the TM456 mutants in enhancing the thrombin activation of the compensatory GD-PC mutants were evaluated. Similar to wild type TM456, none of the mutants exhibited any cofactor activity toward thrombin activation of the 70–80-loop mutants of GD-PC (data not shown). However, the cofactor functions of both the D349K and E346R,D349K mutants in enhancing the activation of the compensatory 60-loop mutants of GD-PC were improved (Fig.5, shown for the double mutant only). Relative to activation of wild type GD-PC, the activation of K62E, K63E, and K62E,K63E by the thrombin-TM456 complex were impaired 2–5-fold (Fig. 5). Interestingly, however, the defect in the activation of these mutants by thrombin was restored if the E346R,D349K mutant of TM456 was used as the cofactor in the activation reaction. As shown in Fig. 5, the initial rate of activation of K62E,K63E by thrombin in complex with the double mutant of TM456 was essentially a mirror image of the GD-PC activation rate by thrombin in complex with the wild type TM456. Thus, 100% of the cofactor activity of the Glu346 and Asp349 charge reversal mutants of TM could be restored if compensatory mutations were made in residues of the 60-loop of protein C. These results clearly suggest that TM4 provides a site for interaction with protein C in the activation complex. The cofactor dependence of the initial rate of protein C activation was also used to evaluate the affinities of the TM456 derivatives for interaction with thrombin in the ternary complex. With the wild type GD-PC as a substrate, a K d(app) value of 5.7 nm for the interaction of mammalian TM456 with thrombin was observed, which is consistent with previously reported values in the literature (31Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial T"

These proteins present at their amino-terminal extremity a γ-carboxyglutamic acid containing domain (Gla domain), followed by two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF1 and EGF2) domains, an activation peptide, and a serine protease domain. After vascular damage, the tissue factor-FVIIa (TF-FVIIa) complex activates both FX and FIX. FXa interacts stoichiometrically with tissue pathway inhibitor (TFPI), regulating TF-FVIIa activity by forming the TF-FVIIa-TFPI-FXa quaternary complex.

To investigate the contribution of the Gla and EGF1 domains of FX in these complexes, FX chimeras were produced in which FIX Gla and EGF1 domains substituted the corresponding domains of FX. The affinity of the two chimeras, FX/FIX(Gla) and FX/FIX(EGF1), for the TF-FVIIa complex was markedly reduced compared with that of wild-type-FX (wt-FX) independently of the presence of phospholipids. Furthermore, the association rate constants of preformed FX/FIX(Gla)-TFPI and FX/FIX(EGF1)-TFPI complexes with TF-FVIIa were, respectively, 10- and 5-fold slower than that of wt-FXa-TFPI complex. Finally, the apparent affinity of FVa was 2-fold higher for the chimeras than for wt-FX in the presence of phospholipids and equal in their absence. These data demonstrate that FX Gla and EGF1 domains contain residues, which interact with TF-FVIIa exosites contributing to the formation of the TF-FVIIa-FX and TF-FVIIa-TFPI-FXa complexes.

Human factor X (FX)1 is one of the serine protease zymogens playing a central role in coagulation processes leading to the formation of a fibrin clot. This is illustrated by the behavior of FX as a substrate or as an enzyme in three essential blood coagulation complexes. First, FX is a natural substrate, as well as factor IX (FIX), of the tissue factor-factor VIIa (TF-FVIIa) complex (1Nemerson Y. Gentry R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4020-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) considered as the initial enzyme complex in the cascade following vascular damage. FX activation by TF-FVIIa results from specific cleavage and release of a 52-residue activation peptide. Activated FX (FXa) can generate a tiny amount of thrombin from prothrombin in an extremely inefficient reaction (2Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) binds to TF-FVIIa-FXa to limit the production of FXa and FIXa by TF-FVIIa (3Broze Jr., G.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1987; 69: 150-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sanders N.L. Bajaj S.P. Zivelin A. Rapaport S.I. Blood. 1985; 66: 204-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, once produced, thrombin and the initially formed FXa activate small quantities of factor V (FV) to FVa and factor VIII (FVIII) to FVIIIa (5Smith C.M. Hanahan D.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1830-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki K.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The activation of these two cofactors leads to the formation of two other essential procoagulant complexes, both involving FX, at the surface of procoagulant phospholipids in the presence of calcium ions (9Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FIXa-FVIIIa and FXa-FVa complexes, which convert FX to FXa and prothrombin to thrombin, respectively. These complexes are 105–106-fold more active than the serine proteases devoid of their respective cofactors (10Mertens K. van Wijngaarden A. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and promote the formation of a fibrin clot. FX circulates in blood as a two-chain molecule and has the same modular structure as other vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins such as FVII and FIX (13Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The light chain has 11 amino-terminal glutamyl residues that are post-translationally modified in a vitamin K-dependent reaction to form a γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain or “Gla domain” critical for the binding of calcium ions and phospholipids (14Stenflo J. Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 157-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Gla domain is followed by two domains homologous to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor, considered important for protein-protein interactions (15Appella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The heavy chain is joined to the light chain by a single disulfide bond and contains a 52-amino acid peptide and a trypsin-like serine protease domain (16Titani K. Hermodson M.A. Fujikawa K. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4899-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which forms the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule. Although FXa has substantial sequence similarities and high homologous three-dimensional structure with FVIIa and FIXa (17Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R.

Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), it displays significant differences in substrate specificity and catalytic activity. Furthermore, each protease requires a specific cofactor to express enhanced catalytic activity within the procoagulant complexes of blood coagulation. It is clear that the catalytic specificities of blood coagulation proteases are supported by the carboxyl-terminal half of the enzymes, a trypsin-like serine protease domain (20Kalafatis M. Egan J.O. van't Veer C. Cawthern K.M. Mann K.G. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 241-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The prime role of the serine protease domain has also been demonstrated in the interaction of the blood coagulation proteases with their cofactors. For instance, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the serine protease domain is the most important part of FIXa and FXa in the FIXa-FVIIIa and FXa-FVa interactions, respectively (21Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. Biochem.

However, there is also evidence that Gla- and EGF-like domains may also mediate protein-protein interactions and may consequently be implicated in the assembly of the protein complexes of blood coagulation. For instance, FVIIa multiple residues, distributed over the entire light chain, are in contact with TF (19Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The identification of the FIXa light chain residues directly involved in the interaction with FVIIIa has to be performed, but three different approaches have suggested that the region around residues 85–90 in the linker area between EGF1 and EGF2 might contact residues 1804–1818 of FVIIIa (24Persson K.E.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86 (Abstr. 1359)PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning FX, there is evidence that the light chain of FXa contributes in the interaction of the enzyme with its cofactor (27Hertzberg M.S. Ben-Tal O. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14759-14766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether the Gla and the first EGF domains interact directly with FVa in the prothrombin activation complex or whether they position the catalytic domain at a correct distance above the phospholipid membrane. Several investigations have suggested by studying the effect of mutations in TF that TF-FVIIa complex binds to the Gla domain of FX (29Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Huang Q. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that the first EGF-like domain of FX is required for the activation of the substrate by the TF-FVIIa complex (31Zhong D. Bajaj M.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3622-3631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From all these analyses it has been suggested that the same residues from FX and FIX within the Gla and EGF1 domains are involved in these interactions. In the present study, the contribution of the Gla and first EGF domains in FX-specific reconnaissance by the TF-FVIIa complex and in the prothrombin activation complex was addressed using chimeric recombinant FX containing either the Gla domain or the first EGF domain of FIX. There are two main reasons for the choice of FIX for exchanging FX homologous domains, the structural similarities between the two molecules and their respective cofactors, as well as the high similitude of the blood coagulation reactions in which they participate. The purified recombinant proteins were then compared with normal FX with regard to their activation by TF-FVIIa complex and to their properties as activated serine proteases in the TF-FVIIa-TFPI-FXa and FXa-FVa complexes.

Factor X immunodepleted plasma, Owren-Koller buffer, and rabbit brain thromboplastin-C reagent were purchased from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France). Mouse monoclonal anti-FX antibody KB-FX008 was prepared in our laboratory as described previously (32Meyer D. Baumgartner H.R. Edginton T.S. Br. J. Haematol. 1984; 57: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Meyer D. Zimmerman T.S. Obert B. Edgington T.S. Br. J. Haematol. 1984; 57: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). KB-FX008 was found as being directed against FX protease domain by Western blot. Polyclonal antibodies against FX conjugated or not with horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Dako (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark). Purified human plasma-derived FX (pd-FX), FX-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVV-X), bovine antithrombin III, human prothrombin, human thrombin, and recombinant human TF were obtained from Kordia (Leiden, The Netherlands). TFPI was obtained from American Diagnostica (Andresy, France). Human FVa was purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). High purity recombinant human FVIIa was from Novo Nordisk A/S (NovoSeven®, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). ELISA using anti-FX polyclonal antibodies assayed pd-FX protein. FX was expressed in units, where 1 unit represents the amount in 1 ml of normal human plasma. Recombinant FX proteins and pd-FX were assayed by ELISA employing coated mouse monoclonal antibody KB-FX008. Bound FX proteins were detected using peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal FX antibodies. Proteins were quantified by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using BSA as a standard. Molar concentrations of FXa, and α-thrombin were determined by active site titration (35Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding wt-FX, FX/FIX(Gla), and FX/FIX(EGF1) have been described previously (36Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Cherel G. Boon-Spijker M. Lavergne J.M. Boertjes R. Briquel M.E. de Goede-Bolder A. Goudemand J. Gaillard S. d'Oiron R. Meyer D. Mertens K. Blood. 2001; 98: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as well as the domain borders of the chimeras. The FIX and FX domains are expressed by the chimera names, i.e. FX/FIX(Gla) contains the Gla domain and the hydrophobic stack of FIX and FX/FIX(EGF1) contains the EGF1 domain of FIX. All DNA constructions were expressed by Madin-Darby canine kidney cells maintained in cell factories with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2,5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml vitamin K1, and 1 μg/ml amphotericin B/0.8 μg/ml deoxycholate. FX containing medium was harvested every 48 h. Benzamidine was added to a final concentration of 10 mm,and medium was centrifuged (6,000 × g), passed over cellulose acetate membranes (0.22 μm) to eliminate cell debris, and stored at −80 °C. Conditioned medium was thawed at 37 °C. EDTA was added to a concentration of 5 mm. The medium was diluted to bring the final NaCl concentration to 60 mm. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 30 min with QAE-Sephadex A-50 beads to achieve a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v). Beads were washed before eluting with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm benzamidine. Recombinant FX (ELISA) contained in eluted fraction was then concentrated by precipitation with two successive steps of 40 and 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. Proteins obtained after the second precipitation step were diluted in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl and immediately dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 100 mm NaCl, containing 10 mm benzamidine, and 5 mm EDTA. Insoluble proteins were discarded by centrifugation (6,000 × gfor 30 min). Recombinant FX was purified from the soluble proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal anti-human FX antibody KB-FX008. After adsorption, the antibody column was washed with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 10 mm benzamidine followed by elution of bound recombinant FX with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5), and 10 mmbenzamidine. The protein solution was immediately neutralized with 2m Tris (pH 7.4). Recombinant FX containing fractions were combined and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 10 mm benzamidine. If present, residual contaminants were removed by Q-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, containing 10 mm benzamidine, using a linear NaCl gradient (0.05–1 m) for elution. The eluate was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl and stored at −80 °C. Before any analysis, a final pass over a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl was used to eliminate trace contaminants of FXa that may have been generated during production or purification of the recombinant protein. Purified recombinant FX derivatives were reduced and loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane and stained with Ponceau S. The light chains were excised and sequenced using an Applied Biosystem Procise model 494 sequencer in the sequencing facility of the Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines (Lyon, France). Recombinant FX derivatives and wt-FX were activated by RVV-X (37Kisiel W. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). RVV-X (1 mg) was coupled to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant FX derivatives (1 μm) were incubated with coupled RVV-X (30 nm) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl containing 10 mm CaCl2. After 2 h, the reaction was stopped by addition of 15 mm EDTA. Activated recombinant FX derivatives were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and then with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl and loaded on a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing, bound activated FX was eluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl containing 5 mm benzamidine. Fractions containing FXa were pooled and precipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation. The precipitated proteins were diluted in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl, and the protein solution was immediately dialyzed against the same buffer containing 50% glycerol (v/v) and stored at −20 °C until use. The active site concentrations of activated recombinant FX derivatives were determined by titration with known concentration of antithrombin in the presence of heparin, and an active site-specific assay using biotinyl-ε-aminocaproyl-d-glutamic acid glycylarginine chloromethyl ketone as described previously (28Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Cook B.C. Rudolph A.E. Kurumbail R.G. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23807-23814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Concentrations of activated recombinant FX derivatives and activated wt-FX were found to correlate between the two methods. The activity of non-activated derivatives of FX and wt-FX were functionally characterized in a prothrombin time assay as described previously (40Fair D.S. Edgington T.S. Br. J. Haematol. 1985; 59: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Recombinant FX derivatives or wt-FX were preincubated 5 min at 37 °C in a fibrometer with FX immunodepleted human plasma. Clotting was initiated by the addition of rabbit brain thromboplastin-C reagent and calculated from a standard curve generated with the clotting times versus the dilutions of pooled normal plasma. Recombinant FX derivatives and wt-FX clotting activities were expressed as a percentage of normal activity. Recombinant human TF (2.5 μg) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl containing 10 mm CHAPS was mixed with an equal volume of phospholipid vesicles preparation (PC/PS, 3:1, 2 mm). Phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS, 3:1) of nominal 200 nm diameter were synthesized by the method of membrane extrusion (41MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the relipidated TF was dialyzed at 4 °C against 50 mmTris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl. The preparation was kept under N2 at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks. The functional concentration of the TF preparation in these vesicles was considered to be 300 nm, half of its total concentration (42Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Throughout this paper, unless specified, TF refers to this reconstituted preparation. The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of S-2765 by pd-FXa, wt-FXa, and recombinant FXa derivatives were assayed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 2 mg/ml BSA, and 5 mm CaCl2. Kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis were determined employing an enzyme concentration of 2 nm and various substrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mm. The release ofpara-nitroanilide was monitored at 405 nm at 37 °C in a kinetic microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The apparent K m and k cat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the catalytic efficiencies were expressed as the ratio ofk cat/K m. The rate at which activated recombinant FX derivatives, wt-FXa, or pd-FXa can activate prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of phospholipids as a function of FVa concentrations was compared as described previously with slight modifications (23Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS, 3:1, 30 μm), and 20 pm FXa were incubated for 5 min with various concentrations of FVa (0–1 nm). The reaction was started by the addition of 1 μm prothrombin. The assay was performed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) BSA at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken at specified times, and the reaction was stopped in EDTA (10 mm final). Thrombin formation in each was then determined by measuring the amidolytic activity of the samples toward the synthetic substrate S-2238 (250 μm), in the presence of 15 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor to inhibit amidase activity of FXa. During the assay, less than 5% of prothrombin was converted to thrombin, and thrombin formation was linear. Conversion of substrate was monitored at 405 nm. Concentrations of thrombin generated in the activation reactions were determined from a standard curve prepared from the cleavage rate of S-2238 by known concentrations of thrombin under the same conditions. The comparison of the initial rates of prothrombin activation by FXa derivatives in the presence of subsaturating FVa concentration was performed as follow. In the absence of phospholipids, thrombin formation was initiated by the addition of 10 μmprothrombin to a reaction mixture containing 0.5 nm FXa and 75 nm FVa in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) BSA at 37 °C. In the presence of phospholipids, thrombin formation was initiated by the addition of 1 μmprothrombin to a reaction mixture containing 20 pm FXa, 250 pm FVa, and 30 μm phospholipids in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) BSA at 37 °C. In all experiments, aliquots were removed from the reaction mixtures at specified times and diluted into 10 mm EDTA buffer to stop the reaction. Thrombin concentration was calculated as described above. Activation of recombinant FX derivatives by FVIIa were measured and compared directly to wt-FX activation. The assay was performed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA, and 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C. Initial rates of activation by FVIIa and relipidated human TF were determined as described previously with little modification (43Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 pm FVIIa was added to 60 pmrelipidated TF in the presence of 30 μm phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS, 3:1). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in order to establish a FVIIa-TF complex, and the reaction was started by the addition of various concentrations of FX (0–3 μm). After diverse incubation times, aliquots were taken, diluted in stop solution containing EDTA (10 mm final), and assayed for FXa formation employing the synthetic substrate S-2765 (250 μm). Conversion of substrate was monitored at 405 nm. The concentration of FXa generated in the activation reaction was determined from a standard curve prepared from the cleavage rate of S-2765 by known concentrations of active site titrated FXa under the exact same conditions. Comparison of the initial rates of FXa derivatives activation by TF-FVIIa was performed as follow. In the absence of phospholipids, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 nm FX to a reaction mixture containing 50 nm FVIIa and 250 nm TF solubilized at 37 °C with 5 mm CHAPS in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) BSA. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of the substrate to establish a FVIIa-TF complex. In the presence of phospholipids, the reaction was initiated at 37 °C by addition of 1 μm FX to a mixture containing 8 nm FVIIa and 0.5 nm TF in the presence of 1 mm phospholipids in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, containing 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) BSA. As in the absence of phospholipids, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of the substrate to establish a FVIIa-TF complex. In all experiments, aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at specified times and diluted into 10 mm EDTA buffer to stop the reaction. FXa concentration was calculated as described above. Inhibition of pd-FX activation by TFPI-recombinant FXa derivatives was measured as described previously (44Jesty J. Wun T.C. Lorenz A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12686-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 45Lindhout T. Franssen J. Willems G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 47: 910-915Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 25 pm of relipidated TF was incubated with 8 nmFVIIa for 5 min. FXa"
https://openalex.org/W2081603283,"Previous studies have shown frequent allelic loss on chromosome 13 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We assessed the frequency of allelic loss on chromosome 13q14 and mutations of deleted in cancer 1 (DICE1) (also found on 13q14) in ESCC patients to determine if this candidate tumor suppressor gene has a role in the development of ESCC, and whether this gene was an inactivation target for allelic loss on chromosome 13q14. Initially, we examined allelic loss at five markers flanking DICE1 in 56 ESCC patients from Shanxi Province, China, and then examined the entire coding sequence of this gene for mutations using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand confirmation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, we extended our evaluation to an additional 80 ESCC patients and 232 healthy individuals to confirm the germline variant found in the initial 56 ESCC patients. The frequencies of allelic loss were 71, 58, and 75% for D13S325, D13S757, and D13S887, respectively, in the initial 56 ESCC patients studied. Overall, 73% of informative patients had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for at least one of these three markers. Somatic mutations were identified in three patients (3/56, 5%), and one novel polymorphism was identified in 3% of ESCC patients (4/136) and 3% of healthy individuals (6/232). We conclude that DICE1 mutations occur in ESCC but are infrequent. The candidate tumor suppressor gene corresponding to the frequent allelic loss on chromosome 13q14 in ESCC remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1591294372,"We showed earlier that the kinetic behavior of the α2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase differs from the ubiquitous α1 isoform primarily by a shift in the steady-stateE 1/E 2 equilibrium of α2 in favor of E 1 form(s). The aim of the present study was to identify regions of the α chain that confer the α1/α2 distinct behavior using a mutagenesis and chimera approach. Criteria to assess shifts in conformational equilibrium included (i) K+ sensitivity of Na-ATPase measured at micromolar ATP, under which condition E 2(K+) →E 1 + K+ becomes rate-limiting, (ii) changes in K′ATP for low affinity ATP binding, (iii) vanadate sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase activity, and (iv) the rate of the partial reaction E 1P →E 2P. We first confirmed that interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of α2 that modulate conformational shifts are fundamentally similar to those of α1, suggesting that the predilection of α2 for E 1 state(s) is due to differences in primary structure of the two isoforms. Kinetic behavior of the α1/α2 chimeras indicates that the difference inE 1/E 2 poise of the two isoforms cannot be accounted for by their notably distinct N termini, but rather by the front segment extending from the cytoplasmic N terminus to the C-terminal end of the extracellular loop between transmembranes 3 and 4, with a lesser contribution of the α1/α2 divergent portion within the M4-M5 loop near the ATP binding domain. In addition, we show that the E 1 shift of α2 results primarily from differences in the conformational transition of the dephosphoenzyme, (E 2(K+) →E 1 + K+), rather than phosphoenzyme (E 1P → E 2P).

The Na,K-ATPase or sodium pump is an integral membrane protein complex found in the plasma membrane of virtually all animal cells. It catalyzes the exchange of three intracellular Na+ ions for two extracellular K+ ions using the energy of hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. Consequently, the sodium pump plays an essential role in the maintenance of the electrochemical alkali cation gradients, providing the driving force for the transport of various nutrients into the cell. The Na,K-ATPase is a member of the family of P-type ATPases, which during the course of their catalytic cycle undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a conserved aspartate residue located in the large catalytic loop between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 of the catalytic α subunit. During the catalytic cycle both dephospho- and phosphoenzymes undergo conformational transitions commonly referred to as E 1 ↔E 2 and E 1P ↔E 2P, respectively. In addition to the large catalytic α subunit, the Na,K-ATPase comprises a smaller, highly glycosylated β subunit that is important for the proper folding of α and its insertion into the plasma membrane. At present, four isoforms of α and three isoforms of β have been described, and these are distributed in a tissue- and developmentally dependent manner. The α2 isoform is located primarily in skeletal muscle and in brain, predominantly in glial cells. Our earlier studies indicated that it differs from the ubiquitous α1 subunit primarily in the steady-stateE 1/E 2 equilibrium. Thus, compared with α1, theE 1/E 2 poise of α2 is shifted toward E 1. This shift is reminiscent of the changes in α1 effected by deleting 32 residues from its N terminus (mutant α1M32) which corresponds to theE 1-shifted trypsinized kidney enzyme first described by Jorgensen (1Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 399-415Google Scholar). Except for a modest (≈1.5-fold) increase in K′Na (12Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Google Scholar), α2 resembles α1 with respect to apparent affinity for extracellular K+ when ouabain-sensitive K+ influx is assayed under physiological conditions of ATP concentration. However, marked differences between α2 and α1 become apparent when, at micromolar ATP, theE 2(K+) →→E 1 conversion is rate-limiting. Under these conditions, α2* 1α2* denotes the rat α2 enzyme rendered relatively ouabain-resistant to permit its distinction from the endogenous, ouabain-sensitive HeLa enzyme (6Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Google Scholar). The asterisk is not shown for the α2 mutants. resembles closely the α1M32 mutant. We showed previously (2Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Google Scholar, 3Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Google Scholar) that, compared with α1, both α2* and α1M32 have faster rates of K+ deocclusion as seen in K+ stimulation rather than α1-like inhibition of Na-ATPase activity at 1 μmATP, with a concomitantly lower K′ATP for low affinity ATP binding and decreased (50%) catalytic turnover. One region of marked primary sequence diversity among the otherwise homologous α1, α2*, and α3* isoforms is the N terminus. In previous studies we compared the kinetics of α1/α2 chimeras in which the first 32 residues were interchanged. The results showed that although removal of 32 residues from the N terminus of α1 yields an enzyme with α2*-like kinetics as mentioned above, substitution of the first 32 residues of α1 with those of α2* is without effect. Similarly, substituting the analogous N-terminal sequence of α1 into that of α2* does not dramatically alter the kinetics of α2. It was therefore suggested that either removal of the N terminus, as in the case of α1M32, or alteration of its primary or secondary structure, as in the case of α2*, likely results in a weakening of intramolecular interactions between the N terminus and some other regions of the α protein (2Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Google Scholar). The experiments described in the present study were designed to extend the chimera approach to additional domains of isoform diversity to pinpoint regions that confer the α1/α2 distinct behavior. As a prelude to this analysis, we first show that cytoplasmic interactions that underlie the E 1/E 2conformational transitions seen with α1 (3Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Google Scholar, 4Boxenbaum N. Daly S.E. Javaid Z.Z. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Google Scholar) are notably similar in α2*. The subsequent analysis of α1/α2 chimeras shows that the N-terminal segment encompassing the cytoplasmic N terminus and the first (M2-M3) cytoplasmic loop of α2*, the so-called “Actuator” or A domain (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar) and, to a lesser extent, the most divergent portion of the nucleotide binding or N domain within the large M4-M5 loop, are responsible for the E 1 shift of α2*. All of the mutant and chimeric α's used in this study were derived from the ouabain-insensitive rat α1 and α2* cDNAs previously described by Jewell and Lingrel (6Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Google Scholar). The E231K mutation was introduced into a rat α2* cDNA that had been excised from pRcCMV withHindIII(81, 3282) using PCR amplification with synthetic nucleotides and the TaqPlus polymerase reaction kit (Stratagene). The reaction mixtures were eluted from QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen) and digested with DpnI, EcoRI, and SalI. TheEcoRI(780)-SalI(1202)α2* fragment was gel-purified and ligated into a modified pIBIα2* shuttle vector in place of the wild typeEcoRI-SalI fragment. Clones containing the E231K mutation (G800 → A) were identified by the presence of adenosine at nucleotide 800, and the complete sequence of the substituted fragment was verified before excising the full-length α2E231K cDNA from the shuttle vector and ligating it into pRcCMV (Invitrogen). Orientation of the α2E231K cDNA in pRcCMV was determined by restriction enzyme analysis. The α2M30 mutant was constructed by introducing a 30-residue deletion into the 5′HindIII(66)-EcoRI(780)restriction fragment cassette of the rat α2* cDNA as described previously (2Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Google Scholar). The mutant cassette was then ligated into the rat α2* cDNA in place of the wild type HindIII-EcoRI cassette. The full-length mutant cDNA was released from the shuttle vector by digestion with HindIII(66, 3284) and ligated into the expression plasmid pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and orientation of the cDNA was determined by restriction analysis. Chimeras α2-(1–309)/α1 and α1-(1–311)/α2 were prepared by exchanging 5′ HindIII-BssHII fragments of the two cDNAs. The HindIII site of each cDNA is in the 5′-untranslated region, and the BssHII site splits the codons for Ala-347 in α1 and the corresponding Ala-345 in α2. It should be noted that the two isoforms have identical sequences in the region between residues 311 and 346 of α1. The full-length cDNAs for the chimeric proteins were then excised from the shuttle vectors and cloned into pRcCMV as above. The N-terminal chimera, α2-(1–63)/α1, denoted as α2nt/α1, was prepared using the oligonucleotide-directed technique of Kunkel (7Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). Starting with the 5′SacI (230)-SalI(875)cassette of α1-(1–32)α2 (3Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Google Scholar), nucleotide mutations encoding the α2 amino acid sequence from residue 33 through 63 were introduced. This mutant 5′ cassette was sequenced and ligated into an α1 shuttle vector in place of the wild type cassette, and the full-length chimeric cDNA was transferred into pRcCMV. Because residues 64–94 of rat α2 are naturally identical to residues 66–96 of α1, the entire N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the α2nt/α1 protein has the α2 sequence. The chimera in which the isoform divergent portion within the M4-M5 loop, α2-(427–562)/α1, denoted as α2L/α1, was prepared using the Kunkel (7Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) technique to introduce the α2 sequence into five short segments of the H5-H6 cytoplasmic loop of rat α1. Three of the substituted segments are encoded by nucleotides in theSalI(875)-BamHI(1776)cassette: I, 429–442 α1 replaced by 427–440 α2; II, 457–473 α1 replaced by 455–471 α2; III, 489–499 α1 replaced by 487–496 α2. The other two segments are in theBamHI(1777)-KpnI(2290)cassette: IV, 515–530 α1 replaced by 512–527 α2; and V, 552–565 α1 replaced by 549–562 α2. After sequence verification, the mutated cassettes were ligated into an α1 shuttle vector in place of the wild type cassettes, and the α2L/α1 cDNA was then transferred to pRcCMV. The mutated 5′SacI-SalI cassette used above to prepare α2nt/α1 was also substituted into the α2L/α1 cDNA in place of the wild type cassette to produce α2(nt+L)/α1. HeLa cells were transfected with the pRcCMV-α and pCDNA-α constructs using either the calcium phosphate method (8Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar) or the LipofectAMINE technique (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen), and cells expressing the relatively ouabain-resistant rat α enzymes were selected as previously described (6Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Google Scholar, 9Lane L.K. Feldmann J.M. Flarsheim C.E. Rybczynski C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17930-17934Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing the mutant α enzymes were amplified in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% newborn calf serum, 100 units/mg penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μm ouabain as described previously (2Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Google Scholar). NaI-treated microsomal membranes were prepared from the mutant cells as described earlier (6Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Google Scholar, 9Lane L.K. Feldmann J.M. Flarsheim C.E. Rybczynski C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17930-17934Google Scholar). Protein content was determined with a detergent-modified Lowry assay (10Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Google Scholar). Digestion was carried out at a trypsin/enzyme ratio of 1200 units trypsin/mg of membranes (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, Type II, Sigma) in a buffer comprising 100 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm Tris glycylglycine (pH 7.4) at a final enzyme concentration of 35 μg/ml. Digestion was terminated by adding 10-fold excess (units) soybean trypsin inhibitor (Type I-S, Sigma) in a buffer containing 50 mm choline chloride, 0.2 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm Tris glycylglycine (pH 7.4). Na,K-ATPase activity was measured as the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as previously described (11Blostein R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 171-178Google Scholar). Briefly and unless indicated otherwise, the membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with all reactants added except [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Final concentrations for Na,K-ATPase activity measurements were 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 3 mmMgSO4, 20 mm histidine (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), and 5 μm ouabain (Sigma). 5 mm ouabain was used to determine base-line hydrolysis activity. As in earlier studies and unless indicated otherwise, assays of Na,K-ATPase activity were carried out using 1 mm ATP to maintain close to saturating ATP concentration and maximize sensitivity of assays of the relatively low activity cultured cells (cf.Refs. 3Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Google Scholar, 9Lane L.K. Feldmann J.M. Flarsheim C.E. Rybczynski C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17930-17934Google Scholar, and 12Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Google Scholar). Na-ATPase activity was measured at 1 μm ATP as described previously (2Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Google Scholar), with varying amounts of added KCl and choline chloride to maintain constant chloride (40 mm) concentration. Base-line activity was determined with 40 mm KCl replacing NaCl. For studies of vanadate sensitivity, inorganic orthovanadate (Fisher) solutions were prepared before the experiment and added with the [γ-32P]ATP solution to initiate the reaction. Na,K-ATPase activities obtained at various vanadate concentrations and expressed as the percentage of that obtained in the absence of vanadate were analyzed by fitting the data to a one-compartment model using a nonlinear least-square analysis of a general logistic function, as described elsewhere (13DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Google Scholar). Curve fitting was carried out using the Kaleidagraph computer program (Synergy). Each experiment was carried out at least three times, with one or more chimeras analyzed concurrently with the α2* and α1 isoforms. After formation of E 1P in the presence of high chloride concentration (14Klodos I. Post R.L. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1734-1743Google Scholar), the rate of E 1P →E 2P was determined by measuring the rate of disappearance of total phosphoenzyme after rapid dilution of the salt (to allow “normal” relaxation of E 1P →E 2P) plus the addition of KCl to catalyze rapid hydrolysis of E 2P (14Klodos I. Post R.L. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1734-1743Google Scholar, 15Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Google Scholar). Accordingly, the enzyme was first phosphorylated in medium containing 600 mmNaCl to stabilize E 1P, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 30 s at 0 °C to obtain maximal phosphoenzyme. Dephosphorylation was then initiated by 6-fold dilution with a “chase” medium containing final concentrations of 20 mmKCl, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), which simultaneously lowered the NaCl concentration to 100 mm. Samples were taken for measurement of [32P]E for periods up to 30 s. Background phosphoenzyme levels were obtained by allowing the chase to continue for 60 s. The data were fitted to a first-order decay model using the Kaleidagraph nonlinear fitting program (Synergy). At least two different membrane preparations obtained from at least two different clones were assayed. The data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Each value shown is the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Our earlier studies showed that the steady-stateE 1/E 2 conformational equilibrium of α2*, compared with that of the ubiquitous α1 isoform, is poised toward E 1. In fact, the kinetic behavior of α2* is generally similar to that of mutants of α1 in which the poise is shifted toward E 1. These mutations include a 32-residue deletion of the cytoplasmic N terminus (mutant α1M32) and a Glu-233 → Lys replacement (mutant α1E233K) in the first cytoplasmic loop. Furthermore, the combination of these two mutations of the so-called Actuator domain (mutant α1M32E233K) in α1 results in a remarkably synergistic shift in poise toward E 1 state(s). The findings were interpreted to indicate that interactions between these regions of the Actuator domain (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar) and the catalytic loop are critical for conformational coupling of the Na,K-ATPase (4Boxenbaum N. Daly S.E. Javaid Z.Z. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Google Scholar). Experiments carried out in the present study to address the question of whether cytoplasmic interactions of α2* are analogous to those of α1 are summarized in Fig. 1 and TableI. Expression of α2M30 and α2E231K in HeLa cells yielded functional enzymes capable of supporting cell growth in 1 μm ouabain. Cells transfected with the double mutant α2M30E231K, analogous to α1M32E233K (4Boxenbaum N. Daly S.E. Javaid Z.Z. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Google Scholar), failed to grow even in elevated K+ (cf. Ref. 16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Google Scholar). Therefore, a comparable “mutation” was prepared by enzymatically cleaving the N terminus of α2E231K in the E 1(Na+) conformation with trypsin (cf. Ref. 1Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 399-415Google Scholar). The single mutants and the cleaved α2E231K (α2E231K-Tryp) were then assessed for shifts in the E 1/E 2equilibrium using the following criteria: (i) the effect of K+ on Na-ATPase activity as a measure ofE 2(K+) → E 1(see Ref. 2Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Google Scholar), (ii) K′ATP for low affinity binding to E 2(K+),K′ATP(L), and (iii) sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase activity to inhibition by inorganic orthovanadate.Table IKinetic analysis of cytoplasmic mutants of α1 and α2*α SubunitMaximal K′ effect on Na-ATPase at 1 μm ATP1-aNa-ATPase activity measured at 20 mm NaCl and 1 μm ATP in the presence or absence of 1 mm KCl.Na,K-ATPaseK′ATP(L)IC50 vanadate normalized%μmα1Inhibition405 ± 66 (4)1α1M321-bFrom Daly et al.

Thus, at micromolar ATP concentrations sufficient to saturate only the high affinity phosphorylation site the response of Na-ATPase to K+ is a sensitive means to characterize mutant-specific differences in the K+-deocclusion pathway of the reaction cycle [E 2(K+) →→E 1 + K+] that becomes rate-limiting under these conditions (2Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Google Scholar, 17Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Google Scholar). As shown previously and summarized in Table I (upper panel), a low concentration of K+ (1 mm KCl) inhibits the Na-ATPase activity of α1 but stimulates that of α1M32 and α1E233K with a further and notably synergistic stimulation of the double mutant α1M32E233K. The pattern for α2* cytoplasmic mutants is remarkably similar (see Fig. 1 and the lower panel of Table I). With respect to the α2 mutants, K+ stimulates the Na-ATPase activity of α2M30 and α2E231K, ∼300 and 900%, respectively, and that of α2E231K-Tryp, more than 2000%. In fact, the apparent stimulation may be an underestimation of the true stimulation since trypsinolysis of α2E231K undoubtedly results in a heterogeneous pool of enzyme species that includes untrypsinized enzyme having inherently lower sensitivity to K+ activation. It should be mentioned that trypsinization of α2 in the presence of Na+ increased K+ activation such that α2-Tryp resembled α2M30 (data not shown; cf. tryptic cleavage of α1 described in Ref.18Wierzbicki W. Blostein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 70-74Google Scholar), which is not surprising since the region encompassing the tryptic cleavage site (T2; see Ref. 1Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 399-415Google Scholar) is conserved between α1 and α2. These results suggest that α2M30, α2E231K, and α2E231K-Tryp all shift theE 1/E 2 equilibrium of α2* progressively further toward E 1. As shown in Table I, α2M30, α2E231K, and α2E231K-Tryp also exhibit increased affinities for low affinity ATP binding relative to α2*, with a synergistic effect of the N-terminal deletion and the E231K mutation in the β-strand region of the M2-M3 loop. It should be noted that, as with the K+ stimulation of Na-ATPase activity shown above, the K′ATP(L) of α2E231K-Tryp is an overestimation of the actual value of the double mutant due to the presence of untrypsinized enzyme. To gain further insight into the effects of these mutations on conformational equilibrium, we investigated the sensitivity of the Na,K-ATPase activity of the mutants to inhibition by vanadate. Inorganic orthovanadate is a transition state analog of inorganic phosphate that binds to P-type ATPases in the E 2conformation during steady-state catalysis. Consequently, sensitivity of an enzyme to inhibition by vanadate is a measure of the proportion of enzyme in the E 2 state (19Cantley Jr., L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Google Scholar). As shown by the representative experiment in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table I, α2M30 and α2E231K are both less sensitive to vanadate inhibition than α2*, suggesting that these mutations further shift theE 1/E 2 equilibrium of α2* toward E 1. We were unable to determine accurately the IC50 for vanadate inhibition of α2E231K-Tryp because the residual Na,K-ATPase activity was too low relative to the background (≈15 nmol/mg·min). The above analysis of cytoplasmic mutations of the α2* isoform of the Na,K-ATPase support the notion that interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of α2* that modulate conformational shifts are fundamentally similar to those of α1. The analysis also suggests that it is the α2-specific regions of the A domain and/or the catalytic domain with which A interacts that underlie the predilection of this isoform for theE 1 state(s). Accordingly, an α1/α2 chimera approach was used to address this issue. From a comparison of the primary structure of the cytoplasmic regions of α1 and α2* (Fig. 3 B), it is important to note that the β strand region in the M2-M3 loop of α1 encompassing Glu-233 is highly homologous to that of α2*. In contrast, the two isoforms differ significantly in the primary sequence of their N termini and in the sequence encompassing the ATP binding site in the M4-M5 cytoplasmic loop. Therefore, chimeras were constructed in which the entire N terminus (residues 1–65) and the divergent portion of the nucleotide binding (N) domain in the large M4-M5 loop (residues 429–565) of α1 were substituted with the analogous residues of α2*. It should be noted that our original intent was to investigate 5 individual divergent regions contained within residues 429–565 (see “Experimental Procedures,” cassettes I-V) on the E 1/E 2equilibrium of α1. Because the individual domains showed no effect on the K+ inhibition of Na-ATPase of α1 relevant to the K+ deocclusion pathway, 2L. Segall, L. K. Lane, and R. Blostein, unpublished information. we constructed an α1/α2 chimera where all 5 cassettes of α2* were substituted into α1. Two additional chimeras were constructed. In these chimeras, the first 311 residues of α1, which encompass the entire A domain, are interchanged between α1 and α2* because this region comprises the portion of the cytoplasmic domain that undergoes large rotational displacements duringE 1/E 2 transitions (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar,20Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar). A schematic representation and the designation of the chimeras are illustrated in Fig. 3 A. To assess the effect of these different regions on theE 1/E 2 poise of α1, we first investigated the effect of K+ on Na-ATPase activity measured at micromolar ATP for each of the chimeras as described above. As shown in Fig. 4, the Na-ATPase activities of wild type α1 and chimeras α2nt/α1, 3Chimera abbreviations: α2nt/α1, α2-(1–63)/α1; α2L/α1, α2-(427–562)/α1; α2(nt+L)/α1, α2-(1–63, 427–562)/α1. α2L/α1, and α2(nt+L)/α1 are all inhibited by K+. In contrast, wild type α2* and α2-(1–309)/α1 are stimulated by K+ at least up to 1 mm, consistent with a fasterE 2(K+) → E 1transition and, hence, with a preponderance of theE 1 conformation. It is noteworthy that although the α2nt/α1 construct encompasses the most divergent portion of the primary sequence, it is only upon replacement of the homologous N-terminal segment (residues 1–311) of α1 with that of α2*, chimera α2-(1–309)/α1, that the shift towardE 1 is observed. Fig. 5 shows the determination ofK′ATP(L) using the Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the simple Michaelis-Menten analysis of Na,K-ATPase activity as a function of ATP concentration, with values presented in the inset. Only the α2-(1–309)/α1 chimera, like wild type α2*, showed an increased affinity for ATP. Thus, the K+ stimulation of α2-(1–309)/α1 described in Fig. 4correlates with its increased apparent affinity for ATP, consistent with a shift in the E 1/E 2poise in favor of E 1. Chimeras α2L/α1 and α2(nt+L)/α1 show no difference in K′ATP(L) relative to α1. To further examine the contribution of the various domains to the poise of E 1/E 2, we used vanadate as a conformational probe for E 2 forms as described above. In one set of experiments, chimeras α1-(1–311)/α2 and α2-(1–309)/α1 were analyzed concurrently with α1 and α2* (Fig. 6 A), and in another, the α2L/α1 chimera was compared with α1 and α2* (Fig. 6 B). As shown previously (21Segall L. Daly S.E. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31535-31541Google Scholar), the Na,K-ATPase activity of α2* is ∼25-fold less sensitive to vanadate than α1 (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly, the α1-(1–311)/α2 enzyme is 3.7-fold less sensitive to vanadate than α1 and resembles α1 with respect to K+ inhibition of Na-ATPase andK′ATP(L), whereas α2-(1–309)/α1 is 8.5-fold less vanadate-sensitive than α1 and resembles α2* with respect to K+ activation of Na-ATPase andK′ATP(L). A modest shift in conformational poise is also indicated by the behavior of the α2L/α1 chimera. This replacement of the divergent region of the N domain of α1 by that of α2 reduces the vanadate sensitivity of α1 by a factor of 2.3. In other experiments (not shown) a similar ≈2-fold shift was effected by including the loop insertion of α2* with the α2* N terminus, i.e. a 2-fold higher IC50 for vanadate seen for α2nt/α1 compared with α1, which was further doubled, resulting in"
https://openalex.org/W2034819718,"TEL belongs to a member of the ETS family transcription factors that represses transcription of target genes such as FLI-1. Although TEL is essential for establishing hematopoiesis in neonatal bone marrow, its role in erythroid lineage is not understood. To investigate a role for TEL in erythroid differentiation, we introduced TEL into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Overexpressing wild-type-TEL in MEL cells enhanced differentiation induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide or dimethylsulfoxide, as judged by the increased levels of erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate synthase and beta-globin mRNAs. TEL bound to a corepressor mSin3A through the helix-loop-helix domain. A TEL mutant lacking this domain still bound to the ETS binding site, but lost its transrepressional effect. This mutant completely blocked erythroid differentiation in MEL cells. Moreover, it showed dominant-negative effects over TEL-mediated transcriptional repression and acceleration of erythroid differentiation. Endogenous TEL mRNA was found to increase during the first 3 days in differentiating MEL cells and drastically decrease thereafter. All these data suggest that TEL might play some role in erythroid cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2067481608,"Thiols provide the major intracellular redox milieu and can undergo reversible oxidation and reduction. To understand the role of thiols in redox signaling events, we have studied the effect of N-ethylmaleimide, a specific thiol alkylating agent, on platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Thiol alkylation inhibited PDGF-BB-induced expression of the Fos and Jun family proteins and AP-1 activity in VSMC. Thiol alkylation also inhibited PDGF-BB-induced expression of cyclin A and growth in these cells. In contrast, thiol alkylation enhanced and sustained the effect of PDGF-BB on the activation of the Jak STAT pathway, and this event was correlated with inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase lB activity. Thiol alkylation via inducing the expression of p21(waf1/cip1) in a STAT1- and p53-dependent manner antagonized the downregulation of this cell cycle inhibitory molecule by PDGF-BB. The inhibition of AP-1 and activation of STATs, particularly STAT1, by thiol alkylation correlated with increased production of active caspase 1 and apoptosis in VSMC. Together, these findings suggest a role for thiols in mediating mitogenic and/or apoptotic signaling events in VSMC. These results also show that a sustained change in the intracellular thiol redox state can convert a mitogen into a death promoter."

Furthermore, we show that a C-terminal domain isolated by limited proteolysis is tetrameric in solution, like the full-length protein, and that its loss of structure correlates with dissociation of the TraM tetramer. Unfolding of the individual domains indicates that the N- and C-terminal regions act cooperatively to stabilize the full-length protein.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The two highest affinity sites, sbmA andsbmB, overlap with the two traM promoters and negatively autoregulate the expression of TraM (11Schwab M. Reisenzein H. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Penfold S.S. Simon J. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Abo T. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4466-4474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deleting the oriT region that includes sbmA andsbmB from a mobilizable plasmid decreases its transfer efficiency by 100-fold (14Fu Y.-H. Tsai M.-M. Luo Y. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further deletion of a region includingsbmC, the lowest affinity site, from this plasmid reduces the efficiency of mobilization by another 100-fold (14Fu Y.-H. Tsai M.-M. Luo Y. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In similar experiments with the oriT of F-like plasmid R100, mutations in the site analogous to sbmC inhibited transfer (15Abo T. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that TraM binding at sbmCmay be required for its essential role in conjugal DNA transfer. In addition to binding DNA, TraM associates with the plasmid-encoded inner membrane protein TraD in vitro (16Disque-Kochem C. Dreiseikelmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TraD is believed to be involved in transferring the single-stranded plasmid through the transfer pore to the recipient cell (5Willetts N. Wilkins B. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 24-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to interact withoriT DNA and a membrane protein suggests that TraM may function to tether the plasmid near the site of DNA transfer. It is not clear how the putative tether function of TraM is important in transmitting the mating signal. The TraM tether may be formed in response to the mating signal, implying that the ability of TraM to interact with oriT or TraD is modulated by the mating signal. In vitro, TraM binds to DNA as a tetramer (17Verdino P. Keller W. Strohmaier H. Bischof K. Lindner H. Koraimann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37421-37428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and to the three oriT sites cooperatively (9Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16705-16711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, small changes in the cellular concentration of tetrameric TraM in response to the mating signal could alter the occupancy of the lowest affinity binding site, sbmC. It is unlikely that the concentration of TraM in the cell is increased transcriptionally because expression is negatively autoregulated. Furthermore, conjugation efficiency is not affected by inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis (4Kingsman A. Willetts N. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that transcription and translation are not required for mating signal transmission. We have performed a thermodynamic characterization of TraM oligomerization and stability, a necessary first step toward understanding how TraM might respond to the mating signal. We report the first reversible equilibrium unfolding of TraM; and based on these and other data, we propose that TraM unfolds via a folded monomeric intermediate. Moreover, we show that the DNA-binding and oligomerization activities of TraM cannot be structurally separated. The thermodynamic characteristics of TraM and the interaction between structures that are important for DNA binding and oligomerization suggest a mechanism for regulating the activity of TraM in vivo. Guanidine hydrochloride (GndHCl)1 (Mallinckrodt Chemical Works) solutions were prepared fresh and filtered (0.45 μm). Chromatography supplies and the Gradifrac system were from AmershamBiosciences. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and used without further purification. DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Analysis Facility, mass spectrometry by the Applied Biosystems-Mass Spectrometry Facility, and N-terminal peptide sequencing by the Synthesis and Sequencing Facility, all of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Standard molecular biology procedures were performed as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The bacterial strains used were BL21(DE3) (19Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar), BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen), ER2738 and TB1 (New England Biolabs Inc.), JM109 (20Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar), and DY330 (21Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.-C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). DY330 F′ER was constructed by mating DY330 with F′ strain ER2738. The TraM open reading frame of DY330 F′ERwas replaced with a kanamycin cassette by homologous recombination as described (21Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.-C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) to create DY330 F′ER M::kan. The cassette was amplified by PCR from pET24a+ (Novagen). The TraM open reading frame was amplified from JM109 genomic DNA by PCR with primers that incorporated appropriate restriction sites (22Liang P. Schildbach J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19644-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and cloned intoNdeI/XhoI-digested pET21a+. For pET-TraM, the reverse PCR primer included a stop codon; but for pET-TraM-His6, the primer lacked a stop codon, which allowed for expression with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The N-terminal peptide (pET-NTP) and C-terminal domain (pET-CTD) clones were constructed by removing unwanted sequence by PCR mutagenesis (22Liang P. Schildbach J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19644-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in the addition of an N-terminal methionine to the CTD open reading frame. 2Primer sequences are available upon request. Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) or BL21(DE3)/pLysS. To test for protein overexpression, several colonies were individually transferred to 1 ml of LB medium with 60 μg/ml ampicillin (LB/ampicillin) and grown toA 600 ∼ 0.4. The culture was split, and protein expression was induced in one-half for 3 h by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm, and the other half was kept on ice. Protein expression was assayed by SDS-PAGE, and the reserved portion of the culture that demonstrated the best expression was diluted to 20 ml with LB/ampicillin, regrown to A 600 ∼ 0.5, and then used to inoculate 2 liters of LB/ampicillin. When this culture reached mid-log phase, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. For protein purification, 500-ml cell pellets were resuspended in 25–50 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. The soluble fraction was cleared by centrifugation; ammonium sulfate (0.25 g/ml) was added; and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The remaining soluble protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to saturation and collected by centrifugation. Protein was resuspended in 35 ml of PNE buffer (25 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) with 1 mm DTT and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of the same buffer. TraM and NTP were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Buffer was generally kept on ice, especially for the purification of NTP, to minimize degradation of the protein. Dialyzed samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column equilibrated in PNE buffer with 5 mm DTT (PNED buffer). A 100-ml linear gradient to 2m NaCl was applied. Fractions enriched in the desired protein were pooled, diluted 1:5 with PNED buffer, and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Blue column equilibrated in PNED buffer. A 75-ml linear gradient to 2 m NaCl was applied, and the purity of peak fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE. When necessary, one or both of these two chromatography steps were repeated. The protein in the final pooled fractions was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation when appropriate. Purified protein was dialyzed extensively against PIPES buffer (25 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 150 mmNaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) or phosphate buffer (25 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA). For purification of CTD, dialyzed cell extracts were cleared by filtering (0.45 μm) and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q column equilibrated in PNED buffer. Protein was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient to 2 m NaCl. Enriched fractions were combined and run over a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column followed in series with a 5-ml HiTrap Blue column. The flow-through was collected and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of PNED buffer. The HiTrap Q column step was repeated, and the concentrated protein (3–5 ml) was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 HiPrep 16/60 size-exclusion column equilibrated in PIPES buffer at room temperature and eluted at 0.2 ml/min. TraM-His6 was purified by batch loading the soluble fraction of sonicated cells onto Ni2+-NTA-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.). The column was washed with 5 mm and then 20 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer with 1 mm DTT, and protein was eluted with 600 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer with 1 mm DTT. Imidazole was removed from the protein solution by dialysis. Protein concentration was measured by absorbance at 280 nm with extinction coefficients of 3960m−1 cm−1 for TraM and TraM-His6, 2560 m−1cm−1 for NTP, and 1400 m−1cm−1 for CTD (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Stock buffer solutions were filtered (0.45 μm) before use. Concentrated protein solutions were used within 2 weeks of purification and were centrifuged on the day of the experiment for 1 h at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge using a TLA-55 rotor at 4 °C. Native and unfolded (in 4 m GndHCl) protein samples were diluted to the indicated concentrations immediately prior to the titration. When indicated, sbmA DNA (5′-CGCTAGGGGCGCTGCTAGCGGTGCGT-3′, annealed to its complement) (3Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16705-16711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was included at an equal molar ratio to the TraM tetramer. All solutions were allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before the first measurement was recorded. Protein and DNA concentration remained constant throughout the titration. All data were collected at 37 °C, and titrant was kept at 35 ± 2 °C during the experiment. For titrations monitored by intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence, protein was in PIPES buffer to prevent potential interactions between phosphate and tyrosine (24Cowgill R.W. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence: Concepts. 2. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1976: 441-486Google Scholar, 25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Titrations were monitored with a SLM-AMICO 48000 spectrofluorometer in the L-configuration equipped with a Neslab circulating water bath and magnetic stirrer. Polarizers were set to the magic angle. The sample was excited at 275 nm (4-nm excitation slit width), and emission was monitored at 302 nm (16-nm emission slit width). Each fluorescence intensity measurement is the average of at least 200 data points acquired over 2–5 s, and each data point was averaged five times. The titration was performed manually as described (26Zweifel M.E. Barrick D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14357-14367Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sample was allowed to equilibrate with stirring for at least 2 min before each measurement. Titrations monitored by CD were performed in PIPES or phosphate buffer with similar results. Data from unfolding of full-length TraM were acquired on an Aviv 62A DS spectropolarimeter with a computer-controlled Hamilton Microlab 500 titrator with two 500-μl syringes (27Stites W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Schwehm J.M. Stites W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 150-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The samples were stirred for 90 s, and then data were averaged for 30 s. This was sufficient to achieve equilibrium, as indicated by the stability of the CD signal. Manual titrations were performed on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-348WI thermostat. The procedure was as described for the fluorescence measurements, except that each measurement is the average of 600 data points acquired over 30 s. The S.D. of each measurement is indicated by error bars on the graphs. Spectroscopic data were fit using the nonlinear least-squares analysis curve-fitting function of Kaleidagraph Version 3.51. A signal-weighted two-state model was employed (26Zweifel M.E. Barrick D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14357-14367Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar, 30Greene R.F. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5388-5393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar three-state model was derived to fit the observed spectroscopic signal (Y obs) when appropriate.Y obs is the sum of the fraction of each species (native, f N; intermediate,f I; and unfolded, f U) multiplied by its contribution to the signal (Y N, Y I, andY U) (Equation 1). Yobs=fNYN+f1YI+fUYU=11+K1+K1K2YN+K11+K1+K1K2YI+K1K21+K1+K1K2YUEquation 1 The spectroscopic signal associated with each species (Y N, Y I, andY U) varied linearly with denaturant concentration. K 1 and K 2are equilibrium constants for the first and second steps of the three-state equilibrium, respectively. According to the linear extrapolation model (29Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar), each K can be expressed as a function of the standard state equilibrium constant,K 0, and the m-value. ΔG 0 was calculated from the fitK 0 values. An unfolding curve was determined to exhibit hysteresis if the forward and reverse curves were reproducibly offset greater than the error in the measurement. The dissociation ofsbmA DNA (2.5 μm in PIPES buffer) upon addition of GndHCl was monitored by absorbance at 260 nm with a Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder. DNA was diluted into the buffer at 37 °C and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before each measurement. Protein solutions in PIPES buffer with various concentrations of GndHCl and matching buffer solutions were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The top half of each solution was removed for use in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using absorbance optics and an An-60Ti rotor. All runs were performed at 35 °C and 60,000 rpm in cells with charcoal-filled Epon 12-mm double-sectored centerpieces and sapphire windows. The rotor and cells were prewarmed. Radial absorbance data were collected at 275 nm at a nominal point spacing of 0.003 cm with no averaging in continuous scan mode. Weight average sedimentation coefficients (〈s*20,w〉), extrapolated tot = 0, were calculated with the programDCDT+ Version 1.14 (31Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 32Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Solvent density, viscosity, and the buoyant molecular weight of the protein species were calculated with SEDNTERP Version 1.06 (33Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Data for CTD and NTP were analyzed by fitting to the modified Fujita-Machosham function using the dc/dt mode of SVEDBERG Version 6.39 (32Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 34Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 35Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), which is better suited for small molecules. In all analyses, 14–20 scans were included in the fit. Goodness of fit was evaluated by randomness in residuals, reduced χ2, and visual examination of the fits overlaid onto the experimental data. Regions of the data that showed signs of meniscus effects or that indicated accumulation at the bottom of the cell were excluded from the fits, although, in the figures, the fit values are extended over the entires*20,w range. TraM, preincubated with NTP or CTD, was combined with sbmA DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (22Liang P. Schildbach J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19644-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), except that equilibration was at 37 °C. DY330 F′ER and DY330 F′ER M::kan were transformed with pET21a+ (empty vector), pET-TraM, pET-NTP, or pET-CTD by electroporation. Overnight cultures from single colonies were diluted 1:100 into medium containing all appropriate antibiotics and regrown to mid-log phase. Donor cells (150 μl) were spun down and resuspended in 100 μl of warm LB medium, and then 900 μl of mid-log phase TB1 recipient cells were added. Mating cultures were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C without agitation. Conjugation was interrupted by vigorous vortexing, and then cells were incubated on ice for 10 min. Serial dilutions in cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were plated to select for donors and transconjugants. All mating experiments were repeated with at least three independent donor clones. TraM or TraM-His6 was mixed with trypsin at a molar ratio of 75:1 and incubated at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at hour intervals, and the reactions were stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2 mm. The fragments generated were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15% acrylamide) and visualized by staining with Coomassie to monitor extent of digestion to ensure that both proteins generated the same proteolysis pattern. The C-terminal proteolytic fragments of TraM-His6 were purified after 4 h. The reaction was stopped with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and mixed for 10 min at 4 °C with 25 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose equilibrated in phosphate buffer with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The Ni2+-NTA-agarose was washed once, and bound protein was eluted in phosphate buffer with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 600 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel; stained with Coomassie; and then transferred to Hybond-P membrane (AmershamBiosciences) in 20 mm CAPS (pH 10), 1 mm DTT, and 10% methanol at 300 V for 8 h at 4 °C. Bands were excised from the membrane and subjected to N-terminal peptide sequencing. TraM-His6(5 μm) was combined with 15 μm TraM, NTP, or CTD in 50-μl reactions in PIPES buffer with 10 mm DTT and incubated for at least 30 min at 37 °C. Negative controls included all components except TraM-His6. Each reaction was mixed with 25 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose at room temperature for 5 min; the agarose was washed once with 0.5 ml of PIPES buffer; and then bound protein was eluted in 50 μl of PIPES buffer with 0.5m imidazole. Protein that did not bind to Ni2+-NTA-agarose (flow-through) was compared with retained species by SDS-PAGE. The gels were scanned, and the band intensities were quantitated with the FluorChem imaging system (Version 2.00) controlled by AlphaEase FC software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The background was subtracted from each band, and the coelution efficiency was calculated as the ratio of eluted test protein to TraM-His6 in the same lane. The reversible unfolding reaction of TraM was followed by CD and intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence (Fig. 1). CD is a measure of secondary structure, whereas tyrosine fluorescence can report on close tertiary interactions, hydrogen bonding of the fluorophore, and secondary structure. The GndHCl-induced unfolding transition is biphasic, with an apparent intermediate state populated near 1 m GndHCl. The congruence of the curves when monitoring independent probes is consistent with each transition observed in the unfolding curve being two-state (36Brandts J.F. Hunt L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This suggests that the full unfolding transition is three-state, involving only one intermediate. These experiments were performed at 37 °C because the unfolding transition at 20 °C exhibited pronounced hysteresis (data not shown). The equation describing a three-state model includes too many parameters relative to the number of data points to obtain reliable fits. Therefore, the slope and intercept of the base line at high denaturant concentration were determined by fitting data from this region directly to a linear equation, and these values were fixed during subsequent fitting. It was not necessary to constrain the shorter native base line in this manner. By fitting the constrained model to the CD data, we calculated that the overall stability of 10 μm TraM at 37 °C is 4.7 kcal mol−1. Τhe first transition (ΔG 1 = 2.7 kcal mol−1, m 1 = 3.7 kcal mol−1m−1 GndHCl) results in a greater decrease in free energy than the second transition (ΔG 2 = 2.0 kcal mol−1,m 2 = 1.1 kcal mol m−1GndHCl). The fit of fluorescence data with the three-state model did not converge. This is likely due to a lower signal-to-noise ratio in these data. However, when the ΔG and m-values derived from the CD fits were fixed, the fluorescence data were reasonably well fit by the three-state model (data not shown). Although the unfolding data indicate two transitions in TraM unfolding, we do not know how each transition reflects events of the unfolding pathway. To determine which phase of TraM unfolding involves a change in oligomerization, we performed the unfolding titrations of TraM at protein concentrations of 1–45 μm (Fig.2). 10 μm TraM had a greater molar ellipticity at 222 nm than 1 μm, showing that TraM is stabilized by increasing the protein concentration. Although the offset between the two curves makes them difficult to compare, the first transition began at a slightly lower concentration of denaturant at the lower protein concentration, suggesting that the first transition has shifted. Neither transition of the fluorescence-monitored unfolding was dramatically shifted when the concentration of TraM was raised from 10 to 45 μm. We also did not see a shift in either unfolding transition whensbmA, the highest affinity binding site, was included in the reaction. At this temperature and concentration, the midpoint of the GndHCl-induced dissociation of sbmA is located at ∼0.5m (data not shown). To directly evaluate how the oligomeric nature of TraM changes during unfolding, we performed SV-AUC at different concentrations of denaturant. The data from these experiments can be used to determine the molecular weight of the sedimenting species based on hydrodynamic models and can also be used to monitor changes in oligomerization (37Rosenfeld S.S.

We were not able to perform complementary equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation because TraM aggregation occurred before the sample reached equilibrium. The data for SV-AUC experiments were collected under conditions similar to the unfolding of 45 μm TraM shown in Fig. 2. This was the lowest protein concentration that could be detected with the absorbance optics at 275 n"
