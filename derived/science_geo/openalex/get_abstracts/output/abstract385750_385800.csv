https://openalex.org/W2140095656,"Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best. It is known that individuals near the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner during the course of an outbreak, on average, than those at the periphery. Unfortunately, mapping a whole network to identify central individuals who might be monitored for infection is typically very difficult. We propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global network structure, namely, simply monitoring the friends of randomly selected individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students who were either members of a group of randomly chosen individuals or a group of their friends. Based on clinical diagnoses, the progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 13.9 days (95% C.I. 9.9–16.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16 of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance. The amount of lead time will depend on features of the outbreak and the network at hand. The method could in principle be generalized to other biological, psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks."

In vitro studies using hypoxic culture conditions (< 5% O2) have revealed strong regulatory links between O2 availability and functions of stem and precursor cells1,2,3,4,5,6. Although some stem cells are perivascular, others may occupy hypoxic niches and be regulated by O2 gradients. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a principal mediator of hypoxic adaptations, modulates Wnt/β-catenin signalling in hypoxic embryonic stem (ES) cells by enhancing β-catenin activation and expression of the downstream effectors LEF-1 and TCF-1. This regulation extends to primary cells, including isolated neural stem cells (NSCs), and is not observed in differentiated cells. In vivo, Wnt/β-catenin activity is closely associated with low O2 regions in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus, a key NSC niche7. Hif-1α deletion impairs hippocampal Wnt-dependent processes, including NSC proliferation, differentiation and neuronal maturation. This decline correlates with reduced Wnt/β-catenin signalling in the subgranular zone. O2 availability, therefore, may have a direct role in stem cell regulation through HIF-1α modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2162719351,"Background Combining high strength and elasticity, spider silks are exceptionally tough, i.e., able to absorb massive kinetic energy before breaking. Spider silk is therefore a model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers. There are over 41.000 described species of spiders, most spinning multiple types of silk. Thus we have available some 200.000+ unique silks that may cover an amazing breadth of material properties. To date, however, silks from only a few tens of species have been characterized, most chosen haphazardly as model organisms (Nephila) or simply from researchers' backyards. Are we limited to ‘blindly fishing’ in efforts to discover extraordinary silks? Or, could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties? Methodology We examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy ‘Darwin's bark spider’ (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2.8 m2) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the web to substrates on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m3, with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m3. Thus, C. darwini silk is more than twice tougher than any previously described silk, and over 10 times better than Kevlar®. Caerostris capture spiral silk is similarly exceptionally tough. Conclusions Caerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial. We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history–informed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry."
https://openalex.org/W2014331589,"The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is aberrant in a wide variety of cancers. Downstream effectors of AKT are involved in survival, growth and metabolic-related pathways. In contrast, contradictory data relating to AKT effects on cell motility and invasion, crucial prometastatic processes, have been reported pointing to a potential cell type and isoform type-specific AKT-driven function. By implication, study of AKT signaling should optimally be conducted in an appropriate intracellular environment. Prognosis in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), the aggressive malignancies of mesenchymal origin, is poor, reflecting our modest ability to control metastasis, an effort hampered by lack of insight into molecular mechanisms driving STS progression and dissemination. We examined the impact of the cancer progression-relevant AKT pathway on the mesenchymal tumor cell internal milieu. We demonstrate that AKT1 activation induces STS cell motility and invasiveness at least partially through a novel interaction with the intermediate filament vimentin (Vim). The binding of AKT (tail region) to Vim (head region) results in Vim Ser39 phosphorylation enhancing the ability of Vim to induce motility and invasion while protecting Vim from caspase-induced proteolysis. Moreover, vimentin phosphorylation was shown to enhance tumor and metastasis growth in vivo. Insights into this mesenchymal-related molecular mechanism may facilitate the development of critically lacking therapeutic options for these devastating malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2042698420,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) β subunits (β1 and β2) provide scaffolds for binding α and γ subunits and contain a carbohydrate-binding module important for regulating enzyme activity. We generated C57Bl/6 mice with germline deletion of AMPK β2 (β2 KO) and examined AMPK expression and activity, exercise capacity, metabolic control during muscle contractions, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) sensitivity, and susceptibility to obesity-induced insulin resistance. We find that β2 KO mice are viable and breed normally. β2 KO mice had a reduction in skeletal muscle AMPK α1 and α2 expression despite up-regulation of the β1 isoform. Heart AMPK α2 expression was also reduced but this did not affect resting AMPK α1 or α2 activities. AMPK α1 and α2 activities were not changed in liver, fat, or hypothalamus. AICAR-stimulated glucose uptake but not fatty acid oxidation was impaired in β2 KO mice. During treadmill running β2 KO mice had reduced maximal and endurance exercise capacity, which was associated with lower muscle and heart AMPK activity and reduced levels of muscle and liver glycogen. Reductions in exercise capacity of β2 KO mice were not due to lower muscle mitochondrial content or defects in contraction-stimulated glucose uptake or fatty acid oxidation. When challenged with a high-fat diet β2 KO mice gained more weight and were more susceptible to the development of hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance. In summary these data show that deletion of AMPK β2 reduces AMPK activity in skeletal muscle resulting in impaired exercise capacity and the worsening of diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.

https://openalex.org/W1994378131,"Background The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is an adaptive survival pathway that protects cells from the buildup of misfolded proteins, but under certain circumstances it can lead to apoptosis. ER stress has been causally associated with macrophage apoptosis in advanced atherosclerosis of mice and humans. Because atherosclerosis shares certain features with tuberculosis (TB) with regard to lesional macrophage accumulation, foam cell formation, and apoptosis, we investigated if the ER stress pathway is activated during TB infection. Principal Findings Here we show that ER stress markers such as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP; also known as GADD153), phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (Ire1α) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) are expressed in macrophage-rich areas of granulomas in lungs of mice infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). These areas were also positive for numerous apoptotic cells as assayed by TUNEL. Microarray analysis of human caseous TB granulomas isolated by laser capture microdissection reveal that 73% of genes involved in the UPR are upregulated at the mRNA transcript level. The expression of two ER stress markers, ATF3 and CHOP, were also increased in macrophages of human TB granulomas when assayed by immunohistochemistry. CHOP has been causally associated with ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis. We found that apoptosis was more abundant in granulomas as compared to non-granulomatous tissue isolated from patients with pulmonary TB, and apoptosis correlated with CHOP expression in areas surrounding the centralized areas of caseation. Conclusions In summary, ER stress is induced in macrophages of TB granulomas in areas where apoptotic cells accumulate in mice and humans. Although macrophage apoptosis is generally thought to be beneficial in initially protecting the host from Mtb infection, death of infected macrophages in advanced granulomas might favor dissemination of the bacteria. Therefore future work is needed to determine if ER-stress is causative for apoptosis and plays a role in the host response to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2086061446,"The overexpression of human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1 (APE1/Ref-1), a key enzyme in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway, is often associated with tumor cell resistance to various anticancer drugs. In this study, we examined the molecular basis of transcriptional regulatory (nonrepair) function of APE1 in promoting resistance to certain types of drugs. We have recently shown that APE1 stably interacts with Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), and acts as its coactivator for the expression of multidrug resistance gene MDR1, thereby causing drug resistance. In this study, we show, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time that APE1 is stably associated with the basic transcription factor RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and the coactivator p300 on the endogenous MDR1 promoter. The depletion of APE1 significantly reduces YB-1–p300 recruitment to the promoter, resulting in reduced RNA pol II loading. Drug-induced APE1 acetylation, which is mediated by p300, enhances formation of acetylated APE1 (AcAPE1)–YB-1–p300 complex on the MDR1 promoter. Enhanced recruitment of this complex increases MDR1 promoter-dependent luciferase activity and its endogenous expression. Using APE1-downregulated cells and cells overexpressing wild-type APE1 or its nonacetylable mutant, we have demonstrated that the loss of APE1's acetylation impaired MDR1 activation and sensitizes the cells to cisplatin or etoposide. We have thus established the basis for APE1's acetylation-dependent regulatory function in inducing MDR1-mediated drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2092218251,"Background Doxorubicin is one of the most effective anti-cancer drugs but its use is limited by cumulative cardiotoxicity that restricts lifetime dose. Redox damage is one of the most accepted mechanisms of toxicity, but not fully substantiated. Moreover doxorubicin is not an efficient redox cycling compound due to its low redox potential. Here we used genomic and chemical systems approaches in vivo to investigate the mechanisms of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, and specifically test the hypothesis of redox cycling mediated cardiotoxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were treated with an acute dose of either doxorubicin (DOX) (15 mg/kg) or 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) (25 mg/kg). DMNQ is a more efficient redox cycling agent than DOX but unlike DOX has limited ability to inhibit gene transcription and DNA replication. This allowed specific testing of the redox hypothesis for cardiotoxicity. An acute dose was used to avoid pathophysiological effects in the genomic analysis. However similar data were obtained with a chronic model, but are not specifically presented. All data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Pathway and biochemical analysis of cardiac global gene transcription and mRNA translation data derived at time points from 5 min after an acute exposure in vivo showed a pronounced effect on electron transport chain activity. This led to loss of ATP, increased AMPK expression, mitochondrial genome amplification and activation of caspase 3. No data gathered with either compound indicated general redox damage, though site specific redox damage in mitochondria cannot be entirely discounted. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate the major mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is via damage or inhibition of the electron transport chain and not general redox stress. There is a rapid response at transcriptional and translational level of many of the genes coding for proteins of the electron transport chain complexes. Still though ATP loss occurs with activation caspase 3 and these events probably account for the heart damage."
https://openalex.org/W2091101912,"Crystallographic and biochemical studies have been employed to identify the binding site and mechanism for potentiation of imidazoline binding in human monoamine oxidase B (MAO B). 2-(2-Benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline (2-BFI) inhibits recombinant human MAO B with a K(i) of 8.3 ± 0.6 μM, whereas tranylcypromine-inhibited MAO B binds 2-BFI with a K(d) of 9 ± 2 nM, representing an increase in binding energy Δ(ΔG) of -3.9 kcal/mol. Crystal structures show the imidazoline ligand bound in a site that is distinct from the substrate-binding cavity. Contributions to account for the increase in binding affinity upon tranylcypromine inhibition include a conformational change in the side chain of Gln(206) and a ""closed conformation"" of the side chain of Ile(199), forming a hydrophobic ""sandwich"" with the side chain of Ile(316) on each face of the benzofuran ring of 2-BFI. Data with the I199A mutant of human MAO B and failure to observe a similar binding potentiation with rat MAO B, where Ile(316) is replaced with a Val residue, support an allosteric mechanism where the increased binding affinity of 2-BFI results from a cooperative increase in H-bond strength through formation of a more hydrophobic milieu. These insights should prove valuable in the design of high affinity and specific reversible MAO B inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2101893457,"Household water treatment can improve the microbiological quality of drinking water and may prevent diarrheal diseases. However, current methods of treating water at home have certain shortcomings, and there is evidence of bias in the reported health impact of the intervention in open trial designs.We undertook a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial among 240 households (1,144 persons) in rural Democratic Republic of Congo to assess the field performance, use and effectiveness of a novel filtration device in preventing diarrhea. Households were followed up monthly for 12 months. Filters and placebos were monitored for longevity and for microbiological performance by comparing thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels in influent and effluent water samples. Mean longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was estimated among participants of all ages. Compliance was assessed through self-reported use and presence of water in the top vessel of the device at the time of visit. Over the 12-month follow-up period, data were collected for 11,236 person-weeks of observation (81.8% total possible). After adjusting for clustering within the household, the longitudinal prevalence ratio of diarrhoea was 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.20). The filters achieved a 2.98 log reduction in TTC levels while, for reasons that are unclear, the placebos achieved a 1.05 log reduction (p<0.0001). After 8 months, 68% of intervention households met the study's definition of current users, though most (73% of adults and 95% of children) also reported drinking untreated water the previous day. The filter maintained a constant flow rate over time, though 12.4% of filters were damaged during the course of the study.While the filter was effective in improving water quality, our results provide little evidence that it was protective against diarrhea. The moderate reduction observed nevertheless supports the need for larger studies that measure impact against a neutral placebo.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN03844341."
https://openalex.org/W2034225522,"Class 1 integrons play a role in the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria by facilitating the recruitment of gene cassettes encoding antibiotic resistance genes. 512 E. coli strains sourced from humans (n = 202), animals (n = 304) and the environment (n = 6) were screened for the presence of the intI1 gene. In 31/79 integron positive E. coli strains, the gene cassette regions could not be PCR amplified using standard primers. DNA sequence analysis of 6 serologically diverse strains revealed atypical integrons harboured the dfrA5 cassette gene and only 24 bp of the integron 3′-conserved segment (CS) remained, due to the insertion of IS26. PCR targeting intI1 and IS26 followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis identified the integron-dfrA5-IS26 element in 27 E. coli strains of bovine origin and 4 strains of human origin. Southern hybridization and transformation studies revealed the integron-dfrA5-IS26 gene arrangement was either chromosomally located or plasmid borne. Plasmid location in 4/9 E. coli strains and PCR linkage of Tn21 transposition genes with the intI1 gene in 20/31 strains, suggests this element is readily disseminated by horizontal transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2065970899,"Our previous study revealed that two splicing factors, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and SRp20, were upregulated in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and knockdown of PTB expression inhibited ovarian tumor cell growth and transformation properties. In this report, we show that knockdown of SRp20 expression in ovarian cancer cells also causes substantial inhibition of tumor cell growth and colony formation in soft agar and the extent of such inhibition appeared to correlate with the extent of suppression of SRp20. Massive knockdown of SRp20 expression triggered remarkable apoptosis in these cells. These results suggest that overexpression of SRp20 is required for ovarian tumor cell growth and survival. Immunohistochemical staining for PTB and SRp20 of two specialized tissue microarrays, one containing benign ovarian tumors, borderline/low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors as well as invasive EOC and the other containing invasive EOC ranging from stage I to stage IV disease, reveals that PTB and SRp20 are both expressed differentially between benign tumors and invasive EOC, and between borderline/LMP tumors and invasive EOC. There were more all-negative or mixed staining cases (at least two evaluable section cores per case) in benign tumors than in invasive EOC, whereas there were more all-positive staining cases in invasive EOC than in the other two disease classifications. Among invasive EOC, the majority of cases were stained all positive for both PTB and SRp20, and there were no significant differences in average staining or frequency of positive cancer cells between any of the tumor stages. Therefore, the expression of PTB and SRp20 is associated with malignancy of ovarian tumors but not with stage of invasive EOC."
https://openalex.org/W2003952795,"Nipah virus (NiV) P gene encodes P protein and three accessory proteins (V, C and W). It has been reported that all four P gene products have IFN antagonist activity when the proteins were transiently expressed. However, the role of those accessory proteins in natural infection with NiV remains unknown. We generated recombinant NiVs lacking V, C or W protein, rNiV(V−), rNiV(C−), and rNiV(W−), respectively, to analyze the functions of these proteins in infected cells and the implications in in vivo pathogenicity. All the recombinants grew well in cell culture, although the maximum titers of rNiV(V−) and rNiV(C−) were lower than the other recombinants. The rNiV(V−), rNiV(C−) and rNiV(W−) suppressed the IFN response as well as the parental rNiV, thereby indicating that the lack of each accessory protein does not significantly affect the inhibition of IFN signaling in infected cells. In experimentally infected golden hamsters, rNiV(V−) and rNiV(C−) but not the rNiV(W−) virus showed a significant reduction in virulence. These results suggest that V and C proteins play key roles in NiV pathogenicity, and the roles are independent of their IFN-antagonist activity. This is the first report that identifies the molecular determinants of NiV in pathogenicity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2036051510,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) associate with adaptor molecules (MyD88, Mal/TIRAP, TRAM, and TRIF) to mediate signaling of host-microbial interaction. For instance, TLR4 utilizes the combination of both Mal/TIRAP-MyD88 (MyD88-dependent pathway) and TRAM-TRIF (MyD88-independent pathway). However, TLR5, the specific receptor for flagellin, is known to utilize only MyD88 to elicit inflammatory responses, and an involvement of other adaptor molecules has not been suggested in TLR5-dependent signaling. Here, we found that TRIF is involved in mediating TLR5-induced nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), specifically JNK1/2 and ERK1/2, activation in intestinal epithelial cells. TLR5 activation by flagellin permits the physical interaction between TLR5 and TRIF in human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460), whereas TLR5 does not interact with TRAM upon flagellin stimulation. Both primary intestinal epithelial cells from TRIF-KO mice and TRIF-silenced NCM460 cells significantly reduced flagellin-induced NFκB (p105 and p65), JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 activation compared with control cells. However, p38 activation by flagellin was preserved in these TRIF-deficient cells. TRIF-KO intestinal epithelial cells exhibited substantially reduced inflammatory cytokine (keratinocyte-derived cytokine, macrophage inflammatory protein 3α, and IL-6) expression upon flagellin, whereas control cells from TRIF-WT mice showed robust cytokine expression by flagellin. Compare with TRIF-WT mice, TRIF-KO mice were resistant to in vivo intestinal inflammatory responses: flagellin-mediated exacerbation of colonic inflammation and dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis. We conclude that in addition to MyD88, TRIF mediates TLR5-dependent responses and, thereby regulates inflammatory responses elicited by flagellin/TLR5 engagement.

Upon recognition of microbes, TLRs recruit a single or a combination of adaptor molecule(s) containing a Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain to its cytoplasmic TIR domain. At least four TIR domain-containing adaptors (MyD88, Mal/TIRAP, TRAM, and TRIF) bind to TLRs to mediate TLR-dependent signaling (2Kenny E.F. O'Neill L.A. Cytokine. 2008; 43: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these adaptor molecules associate with IL-1 receptor-associated kinases to mediate the signaling to a member of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family (e.g. TRAF6). Thereby, TLR-induced signaling leads to activation of inhibitor κB kinases and MAPKs to activate transcription factors such as NFκB, activator protein-1, and interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs), followed by inducing a pleiotropic gene expression involved in immune and inflammatory responses (2Kenny E.F.

Our findings suggest that like TLR4 mostly in immune cells, TLR5 utilizes both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways at least in intestinal epithelial cells. Human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460) were cultivated as described previously (9Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol.

TRIF-KO (TRIFLps2/Lps2), C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, and C3H/HeOuJ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were bred and maintained in the animal facilities of the Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine, UCLA, under the approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UCLA. We isolated primary intestinal epithelial cells from mouse small intestine by modifying previously published procedures (17Evans G.S. Flint N. Somers A.S. Eyden B. Potten C.S. J.

Small intestine was dissected out, opened longitudinally, and washed in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing antibiotics (amphotericin B, 25 ng/ml, and penicillin-streptomycin, 100 units/ml). Intestines were cut into small fragments and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 20 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing collagenase XΙa (60 units/ml), dispase (0.02 mg/ml), BSA (2%), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.2 mg/ml). Fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%) was added and vigorously resuspended, followed by harvesting supernatants after 60-s sedimentations in sedimentation DMEM containing sorbitol (10%), FBS (5%), and antibiotics. The epithelial fragments were centrifuged at 300 rpm for 3 min, and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing sorbitol (2%) and FBS (2.5%). Small sheets of intestinal epithelium (organoids) were suspended in DMEM containing FBS (10%) with antibiotics and plated into mouse fibronectin (Innovative Research, Novi, MI) (3 µg/cm2)-coated dishes. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and organoids were attached to a plate in 1–2 days. Cells were then cultivated in medium containing equal volumes of DMEM and Ham's 12 medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), and FBS (10%) with antibiotics, and the medium was replaced every other day. Proliferative and viable cells were spread out from organoids. We were able to cultivate these cells over 4 weeks in culture dishes. The silencing vector expressing shRNA against human MyD88 or TRIF was obtained from InvivoGen. MyD88-KD NCM460 cells were described in our previous publication (14Rhee S.H. Kim H. Moyer M.P.

For TRIF-KD cells, NCM460 cells were stably transfected with human TRIF shRNA expression vector, and individual clones were determined for silenced TRIF expression by immunoblot analysis. For MyD88/TRIF-double knockdown (MyD88/TRIF-2KD) cells, MyD88-KD cells were stably transfected with human TRIF shRNA expression construct. Multiple clones of the cells were obtained, and by immunoblot assay with TRIF antibody, we confirmed that endogenous TRIF expression was successfully knocked down in these cells. The scrambled shRNA control vector was stably transfected into NCM460 cells and used as the control cells. DSS is known to directly disrupt the colonic epithelium causing colitis (19Kitajima S. Takuma S. Morimoto M. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1999; 61: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Four days after DSS administration, flagellin (0.8–1.0 µg/mice) was administered daily by rectal enema for additional 5 days. The survival rate was evaluated as described previously (7Rhee S.H. Im E.

Primary mouse intestinal epithelial cells harvested from mouse small intestine were plated on a mouse fibronectin-coated chamber slide. After 2 weeks of culture, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in methanol-acetone (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: mouse anti-pancytokeratin monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) or mouse anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed and mounted with DAPI mounting solution. Images were visualized with an Axio Imager Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss) and captured with an AxioCam MRm digital camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop. Human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460) were plated in 60-mm dishes (1.5 × 106 cells) and stabilized overnight. Using SuperFect transfect reagent from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmid DNA. A consistent amount of total DNA was kept by adding the empty vector to each transfection. One day after transfection, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer. To generate stably transfected cells, cells were plated in the proper medium containing selecting antibiotics. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the level of the cytokine expression using the appropriate kits from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) by following the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were performed in triplicate, and data are shown as mean ± S.D. These assays were performed as described in our previous publications (9Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J.

Flagellin stimulation allows TLR5 to recruit MyD88 adaptor molecule to its cytoplasmic TIR domain to mediate MyD88-dependent signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (9Rhee S.H. Keates A.C.

To test whether TRIF adaptor molecule, mediating MyD88-independent signaling of TLRs, participates in TLR5-dependent responses in intestinal epithelial cells, we first examined whether TLR5 is able to interact physically with TRIF in response to flagellin. Human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460) were stably transfected with HA-tagged TLR5 expression construct (TLR5-HA) to generate NCM460-TLR5-HA cells because a specific antibody for an immunoprecipitation of endogenous TLR5 protein is not presently available. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis between TLR5-HA and endogenous TRIF or MyD88 showed that flagellin stimulation induced an interaction between TLR5 and TRIF (Fig. 1A) as well as an interaction between TLR5 and MyD88 (Fig. 1B) in NCM460 cells. In the case of TLR4, an adaptor molecule TRAM is recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 prior to interacting with TRIF upon LPS stimulation (5Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T. Chow A. Akira S. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Having found that TLR5 interacts with TRIF in response to flagellin, we next examined whether flagellin stimulation induces the interaction between TLR5 and TRAM. NCM460 cells were co-transfected with TLR5-HA and TRAM-FLAG constructs, followed by flagellin stimulation for co-immunoprecipitation assay. We found that TLR5 did not recruit TRAM upon flagellin stimulation, whereas flagellin stimulation resulted in an evident interaction between TLR5 and MyD88 (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that in addition to interacting with MyD88, TLR5 also recruits TRIF adaptor molecule upon flagellin stimulation. This finding suggests that TRIF physically interacts with TLR5 and thereby participates in mediating TLR5-dependent responses. Intriguingly, we could not observe the phosphorylation of IRF3 in flagellin-treated NCM460 cells, whereas LPS stimulation clearly induces IRF-3 phosphorylation in human monocytes (THP-1) (Fig. 1D). This observation implies that TRIF adaptor in the TLR5-dependent signaling pathways may not be implicated in activating IRF3 as it is elsewhere. The interaction between TLR5 and TRIF upon flagellin prompted us to investigate whether TRIF is involved in mediating TLR5-dependent signaling including NFκB and MAPK activation in intestinal epithelial cells. To study this, using NCM460 cells, we generated MyD88-KD cells as previously reported (14Rhee S.H. Kim H. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18560-18568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As expected, NFκB activation (evaluated by phosphorylation of p105 and p65) by flagellin was reduced in MyD88-KD cells, compared with control cells that were stably transfected with scrambled shRNA encoding construct (Fig. 2A). Similarly, impaired MyD88 expression resulted in reduced MAPK (p38, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2) activation in response to flagellin compared with control cells. To determine whether TRIF is involved in TLR5-induced responses as suggested by flagellin-induced TLR5-TRIF interaction, we generated TRIF-KD NCM460 cells (Fig. 2B). Notably, silencing TRIF expression substantially reduced flagellin-induced NFκB (p105 and p65) activation (Fig. 2B). The activation of JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 by flagellin was also reduced in TRIF-KD cells compared with control cells. However, TRIF-KD and control cells exhibited a similar extent of p38 activation in response to flagellin. Next, we generated MyD88 and TRIF-double knockdown (MyD88/TRIF-2KD) NCM460 cells (Fig. 2C) and tested TLR5-induced signaling. We found that flagellin-stimulated NFκB activation was almost completely abolished in MyD88/TRIF-2KD cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the activation of MAPKs, including JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 was dramatically diminished in MyD88/TRIF-2KD cells compared with control cells. Our data show that the inhibitory levels of NFκB and MAPK activation are much greater in MyD88/TRIF-2KD cells than in MyD88-KD or TRIF-KD cells, indicating that the defect in both MyD88 and TRIF effectively hampers TLR5-dependent signaling. These results indicate a possibility that in addition to MyD88, TRIF may mediate TLR5-induced responses in human colonic epithelial cells. To demonstrate further the involvement of TRIF in TLR5 signaling, we isolated primary intestinal epithelial cells from TRIF-KO, MyD88-KO, and their WT control mice. Intestinal epithelial organoids (small sheets of intestinal epithelium) harvested from mouse small intestine were attached to the surface of fibronectin-coated culture dishes. We observed that proliferative and viable cells were spread out from these organoids (Fig. 3A). In about 2 weeks after plating, most of cells showed typical primary epithelial cell morphology and were developed into compact cobblestoned monolayer. In agreement with potent flagellin responses in various types of epithelial cells (9Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol.

Immunology. 2004; 112: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), these cells from mouse intestine responded to flagellin stimulation, evaluated by the phosphorylation of p65 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 3B). To confirm whether these primary cells are intestinal epithelial cells, we subsequently performed immunofluorescence staining against intestinal epithelial cell markers such as cytokeratin and β-catenin (21Kanaya T. Miyazawa K. Takakura I. Itani W. Watanabe K. Ohwada S. Kitazawa H. Rose M.T. McConochie H.R. Okano H. Yamaguchi T. Aso H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G273-G284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We found that more than 95% of cells in coalesced and confluent or separated and sparse areas were stained with β-catenin and cytokeratin (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that these primary cells possess characteristics of intestinal epithelial cells. Using primary intestinal epithelial cells isolated from MyD88-KO and WT mice, we examined whether MyD88 deficiency is sufficient to block TLR5-induced signaling. Flagellin stimulation induced activation of NFκB and MAPKs in the WT cells (Fig. 3E). As expected, in MyD88-KO cells, NFκB activation by flagellin was dramatically inhibited. Surprisingly, MyD88 deficiency, however, failed to block TLR5-induced MAPK activation completely (Fig. 3E). Rather, JNK1/2 and p38 activation were still detectable in MyD88-KO cells, although the level was significantly decreased. ERK1/2 activation was still relatively robust, albeit slightly reduced in MyD88-KO cells. These results imply that MyD88 deficiency is not sufficient to block TLR5-induced signaling completely. Moreover, our findings also imply that a MyD88-independent pathway should exist to mediate TLR5-induced signaling, which circumvents the absence of MyD88 in TLR5-induced signaling pathways. TRIF adaptor molecule mediates the signaling pathway of TLR4 and TLR3 in a MyD88-independent manner. We show that TLR5 interacts with TRIF upon flagellin stimulation (Fig. 1A), and silencing TRIF expression significantly reduces TLR5-induced responses (Fig. 2B) in human colonic epithelial cells. Based on these findings, using primary intestinal epithelial cells isolated from TRIF-KO and WT mice, we tested whether TRIF is involved in TLR5-induced signaling. Although flagellin stimulation nicely induced the activation of NFκB and MAPKs in WT cells, TRIF-KO cells exhibited dramatically reduced NFκB and MAPKs (specifically JNK1/2 and ERK1/2) activation in response to flagellin (Fig. 3F). In contrast, activation of p38 by flagellin was mostly preserved in TRIF-KO cells compared with WT cells. This result is in agreement with preserved p38 activation in TRIF-KD cells upon flagellin (Fig. 2B). Thus, TLR5-mediated p38 activation appears to be TRIF-independent and seems to be primarily governed by MyD88-dependent pathways. Similarly, Akt phosphorylation by flagellin in TRIF-KO cells is comparable with that of WT cells, whereas it was markedly reduced in MyD88-KO cells. This result suggests that like p38 activation, Akt activation by flagellin should be primarily regulated by MyD88-dependent pathways. This finding is in agreement with our previous study demonstrating that MyD88 mediates the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway of TLR5 (14Rhee S.H. Kim H. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18560-18568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data substantiate that in addition to MyD88, TRIF mediates TLR5-induced responses in intestinal epithelial cells. Although the above results indicate that TRIF mediates TLR5 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells, it may be possible that a potential contaminant (e.g. LPS) probably included in the flagellin preparation would have stimulated TLR5-independent responses and caused remaining MAPK activation in MyD88-KO cells (Fig. 3E). To address this concern, we performed several experiments. First, we isolated primary intestinal epithelial cells from TLR4-null mutant (C3H/HeJ) and their genetic control (C3H/HeOuJ) mice, followed by stimulating these cells with flagellin. We found that the levels of NFκB and MAPK activation by flagellin in TLR4-null cells are similar to those in WT cells (Fig. 4A). Thus, these results indicate that flagellin-induced responses in primary intestinal epithelial cells are not compounded by LPS/TLR4 engagement and exclude a possibility that potential LPS contamination in the flagellin preparation might contribute to NFκB and MAPK activation in the intestinal epithelial cells. Second, to determine whether the response activated by flagellin is specifically mediated by TLR5, we used TLR5-KD NCM460 cells, which have been previously described (13Rhee S.H. Im E. Pothoulakis C. Gastroenterology. 2008; 135: 518-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Rhee S.H. Kim H. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol.

We found that flagellin-induced NFκB activation was dramatically inhibited in TLR5-KD cells, whereas it was markedly induced in WT cells (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the activated signaling by the flagellin preparation is specifically mediated by TLR5. Third, using a NFκB reporter activity assay, we showed that NCM460 cells are potently responsive to TLR5 ligand (flagellin), but nonresponsive to TLR2 (Pam3Cys) or TLR4 (LPS) stimulation (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our data obtained from these three experiments clearly indicate that flagellin-induced responses are"
https://openalex.org/W2039303580,"The essential eukaryotic molecular chaperone Hsp90 operates with the help of different co-chaperones, which regulate its ATPase activity and serve as adaptors to recruit client proteins and other molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70, to the Hsp90 complex. Several Hsp90 and Hsp70 co-chaperones contain the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which interacts with the highly conserved EEVD motif at the C-terminal ends of Hsp90 and Hsp70. The acidic side chains in EEVD interact with a subset of basic residues in the TPR binding pocket called a 'carboxylate clamp'. Since the carboxylate clamp residues are conserved in the TPR domains of known Hsp90/Hsp70 co-chaperones, we carried out an in silico search for TPR proteins in Arabidopsis and rice comprising of at least one three-motif TPR domain with conserved amino acid residues required for Hsp90/Hsp70 binding. This approach identified in Arabidopsis a total of 36 carboxylate clamp (CC)-TPR proteins, including 24 novel proteins, with potential to interact with Hsp90/Hsp70. The newly identified CC-TPR proteins in Arabidopsis and rice contain additional protein domains such as ankyrin, SET, octicosapeptide/Phox/Bem1p (Phox/PB1), DnaJ-like, thioredoxin, FBD and F-box, and protein kinase and U-box, indicating varied functions for these proteins. To provide proof-of-concept of the newly identified CC-TPR proteins for interaction with Hsp90, we demonstrated interaction of AtTPR1 and AtTPR2 with AtHsp90 in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull down assays. These findings indicate that the in silico approach used here successfully identified in a genome-wide context CC-TPR proteins with potential to interact with Hsp90/Hsp70, and further suggest that the Hsp90/Hsp70 system relies on TPR co-chaperones more than it was previously realized."
https://openalex.org/W2089738269,"Chronic ethanol consumption is known as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance; however, there is a great deal of controversy concerning the relationships between alcohol consumption and the development of type 2 diabetes. We investigated the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and whether generated peroxynitrite participates in the impaired glucose homeostasis. Here we show that chronic ethanol feeding decreases the ability of pancreatic β-cells to mediate insulin secretion and ATP production in coordination with the decrease of glucokinase, Glut2, and insulin expression. Specific blockade of ATF3 using siRNA or C-terminally deleted ATF3(ΔC) attenuated ethanol-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis or dysfunction and restored the down-regulation of glucokinase (GCK), insulin, and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 induced by ethanol. GCK inactivation and down-regulation were predominantly mediated by ethanol metabolism-generated peroxynitrite, which were suppressed by the peroxynitrite scavengers N(γ)-monomethyl-L-arginine, uric acid, and deferoxamine but not by the S-nitrosylation inhibitor DTT, indicating that tyrosine nitration is the predominant modification associated with GCK down-regulation and inactivation rather than S-nitrosylation of cysteine. Tyrosine nitration of GCK prevented its association with pBad, and GCK translocation into the mitochondria results in subsequent proteasomal degradation of GCK following ubiquitination. This study identified a novel and efficient pathway by which chronic ethanol consumption may induce GCK down-regulation and inactivation by inducing tyrosine nitration of GCK, resulting in pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and dysfunction. Peroxynitrite-induced ATF3 may also serve as a potent upstream regulator of GCK down-regulation and β-cell apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1987887347,"Constitutive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer results from mutations in pathway components, which frequently coexist with autocrine Wnt signaling or epigenetic silencing of extracellular Wnt antagonists. Among the extracellular Wnt inhibitors, the secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are decoy receptors that contain soluble Wnt-binding frizzled domains. In addition to SFRPs, other endogenous molecules harboring frizzled motifs bind to and inhibit Wnt signaling. One of such molecules is V3Nter, a soluble SFRP-like frizzled polypeptide that binds to Wnt3a and inhibits Wnt signaling and expression of the β-catenin target genes cyclin D1 and c-myc. V3Nter is derived from the cell surface extracellular matrix component collagen XVIII. Here, we used HCT116 human colon cancer cells carrying the ΔS45 activating mutation in one of the alleles of β-catenin to show that V3Nter and SFRP-1 decrease baseline and Wnt3a-induced β-catenin stabilization. Consequently, V3Nter reduces the growth of human colorectal cancer xenografts by specifically controlling cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, without affecting angiogenesis or apoptosis, as shown by decreased [3H]-thymidine (in vitro) or BrdU (in vivo) incorporation, clonogenesis assays, cell cycle analysis and magnetic resonance imaging in living mice. Additionally, V3Nter switches off the β-catenin target gene expression signature in vivo. Moreover, experiments with β-catenin allele-targeted cells showed that the ΔS45 β-catenin allele hampers, but does not abrogate, inhibition of Wnt signaling by SFRP-1 or by the SFRP-like frizzled domain. Finally, neither SFRP-1 nor V3Nter affect β-catenin signaling in SW480 cells carrying nonfunctional Adenomatous polyposis coli. Thus, SFRP-1 and the SFRP-like molecule V3Nter can inhibit tumor growth of β-catenin-activated tumor cells in vivo."

Herein, we report that small interfering (siRNA)-mediated La depletion reduces cell proliferation of different cell lines concomitant with a reduction in cyclin D1 (CCND1) protein. To exclude off-target effects we demonstrate that exogenous La expression in La-depleted cells restores cell proliferation and CCND1 protein levels. In contrast, proliferation of immortalized CCND1 knockout cells is not affected by La depletion, supporting a functional coherence between La, CCND1 and proliferation. Furthermore, we document by reversible in vivo crosslinking and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) immunoprecipitation an association of the La protein with CCND1 messengerRNA and that CCND1 internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation is modulated by La protein level within the cell. In addition, we show elevated La protein expression in cervical cancer tissue and its correlation with aberrant CCND1 protein levels in cervical tumor tissue lysates. In conclusion, this study establishes a role of La in cell proliferation and CCND1 expression and demonstrates for the first time an overexpression of the RNA-binding protein La in solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2000544474,"Estrogen enhances antibody and autoantibody responses through yet to be defined mechanisms. It has been suggested that estrogen up-regulates the expression of activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID), which is critical for antibody class switch DNA recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), through direct activation of this gene. AID, as we have shown, is induced by the HoxC4 homeodomain transcription factor, which binds to a conserved HoxC4/Oct site in the AICDA/Aicda promoter. Here we show that estrogen-estrogen receptor (ER) complexes do not directly activate the AID gene promoter in B cells undergoing CSR. Rather, they bind to three evolutionarily conserved and cooperative estrogen response elements (EREs) we identified in the HOXC4/HoxC4 promoter. By binding to these EREs, ERs synergized with CD154 or LPS and IL-4 signaling to up-regulate HoxC4 expression, thereby inducing AID and CSR without affecting B cell proliferation or plasmacytoid differentiation. Estrogen administration in vivo significantly potentiated CSR and SHM in the specific antibody response to the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl hapten conjugated with chicken γ-globulin. Ablation of HoxC4 (HoxC4−/−) abrogated the estrogen-mediated enhancement of AID gene expression and decreased CSR and SHM. Thus, estrogen enhances AID expression by activating the HOXC4/HoxC4 promoter and inducing the critical AID gene activator, HoxC4."

This plastic phenotype of aggressive cancer cells enables them to express endothelial cell-specific markers and form tube-like structures, a phenotype that has been linked to aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. We demonstrate here that the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β co-receptor endoglin, an endothelial cell marker, is expressed by tumor cells and its expression correlates with tumor cell plasticity in two types of human cancer, Ewing sarcoma and melanoma. Moreover, endoglin expression was significantly associated with worse survival of Ewing sarcoma patients. Endoglin knockdown in tumor cells interferes with tumor cell plasticity and reduces invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Ewing sarcoma and melanoma cells with reduced endoglin levels showed reduced tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that endoglin, while interfering with TGF-β signaling, is required for efficient bone morphogenetic protein, integrin, focal adhesion kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling in order to maintain tumor cell plasticity. The present study delineates an important role of endoglin in tumor cell plasticity and progression of aggressive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2078835223,"The ubiquitously expressed mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) controls cell volume and pH but is also critically involved in complex biological processes like cell adhesion, cell migration, cell proliferation, and mechanosensation. Pathways controlling NHE1 turnover at the plasma membrane, however, are currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that NHE1 undergoes ubiquitylation at the plasma membrane by a process that is unprecedented for a mammalian ion transport protein. This process requires the adapter protein β-arrestin-1 that interacts with both the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 and the NHE1 C terminus. Truncation of NHE1 C terminus to amino acid 550 abolishes binding to β-arrestin-1 and NHE1 ubiquitylation. Overexpression of β-arrestin-1 or of wild type but not ligase-dead Nedd4-1 increases NHE1 ubiquitylation. siRNA-mediated knock-down of Nedd4-1 or β-arrestin-1 reduces NHE1 ubiquitylation and endocytosis leading to increased NHE1 surface levels. Fibroblasts derived from β-arrestin-1 and Nedd4-1 knock-out mice show loss of NHE1 ubiquitylation, increased plasmalemmal NHE1 levels and greatly enhanced NHE1 transport compared with wild-type fibroblasts. These findings reveal Nedd4-1 and β-arrestin-1 as key regulators of NHE1 ubiquitylation, endocytosis, and function. Our data suggest a broader role for β-arrestins in the regulation of membrane ion transport proteins than currently known.

Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) 2The abbreviations used are: NHENa+/H+ exchangerNTAnitrilotriacetic acid. are ion transporters catalyzing the exchange of sodium with protons in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Brett C.L. Donowitz M. Rao R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous mammalian NHE isoform 1 (NHE1) controls cellular volume and pH and is therefore often referred to as the “housekeeping” NHE (2Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In recent years, however, it has become clear that NHE1 is a highly dynamic protein at the plasma membrane with pivotal importance for mammalian biology that extends beyond ion translocation (3Denker S.P.

Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). NHE1 regulates cell shape, adhesion, proliferation and migration (5Putney L.K. Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 527-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Moreover, NHE1 senses mechanical stress directly, thereby serving as a cellular mechanosensor (6Fuster D. Moe O.W. Hilgemann D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10482-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NHE1 is found at sites of focal adhesions in nonpolarized cells and at basolateral membranes in polarized epithelial cells, where it is required for assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions. In migrating cells, NHE1 is endocytosed at the rear end of the cell and enriched at the leading edge of the cell, promoting cell migration by the development of pseudopodial protrusions and retraction at the rear end (7Denker S.P. Barber D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 8Klein M. Seeger P. Schuricht B. Alper S.L. Schwab A. J. Gen.

Barber D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Conversely, up-regulation of NHE1 is associated with increased tumor growth and tumor cell invasion (9Cardone R.A. Casavola V. Reshkin S.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 786-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 10Lagana A. Vadnais J. Le P.U. Nguyen T.N. Laprade R. Nabi I.R. Noël J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of these complex biological processes is thought to require both NHE transport directly as well as anchoring of cytoskeletal elements and scaffolding of signaling molecules by the large, intracellular C terminus of NHE1 (4Baumgartner M. Patel H. Barber D.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Clearly, the dynamics of NHE1 at the plasma membrane mandate rapid and tight regulation of NHE1 turnover. The molecular mechanisms underlying plasmalemmal NHE1 turnover are not known. Na+/H+ exchanger nitrilotriacetic acid. Turnover of eukaryotic ion transport proteins often involves the posttranslational conjugation of one or several ubiquitin residues to target proteins by E3 ubiquitin ligases (11Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This process, called ubiquitylation, typically targets plasmalemmal proteins for internalization by endocytosis, sorting into multivesicular bodies and delivery to lysosomes. So far, involvement of the ubiquitin pathway in the regulation of NHEs has not been explored. In some instances, downregulated proteins interact directly with their cognate E3 ubiquitin ligases through PY motifs (PPXY or LPXY). However, many proteins (including NHE1) lack PY motifs and are not capable of directly binding their E3 ubiquitin ligases (11Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the case of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytokine receptors, β-arrestins function as adaptors linking receptors with their cognate E3 ubiquitin ligases (12Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Sci STKE. 2005; 2005: cm10PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 14Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H.

Here we find that NHE1 turnover at the plasma membrane is regulated by ubiquitylation through a process that is unprecedented for mammalian ion transport proteins, requiring the concerted action of both β-arrestin-1 and Nedd4-1. Our data suggest that Nedd4-1 and β-arrestin-1 are key regulators of NHE1 ubiquitylation, endocytosis, and function. Unless specified otherwise, all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Densitometric quantifications were performed using National Institutes of Health Scion Image software. Statistical analysis was done using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to correct for multiple comparisons, as appropriated. All statistical tests were two-sided and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Transient cDNA and siRNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Octameric, N-terminally tagged HA-ubiquitin and His6-ubiquitin constructs were gifts of M. Treier and described in detail (20Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D.

N-terminally HA-tagged ubiquitin K/R mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of a single wild-type HA-ubiquitin template in pcDNA3.1. Myc-ubiquitin and untagged wild-type and ligase-dead (C867S) Nedd4-1 constructs were a gift of O. Staub (21Blot V. Perugi F. Gay B. Prévost M.C. Briant L. Tangy F. Abriel H. Staub O. Dokhélar M.C.

Rougier. β-arrestin-1 cDNA was obtained from Imagenes and cloned into pMH vector (Roche). Wild-type and truncated versions of NHE1 were cloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-14. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Double-stranded siRNAs targeting human Nedd4-1, Nedd4-2, and β-arrestin-1 were purchased from Qiagen and have been validated in HEK293 cells previously (15Shenoy S.K. Xiao K. Venkataramanan V.

The siRNA sequences (5′-3′) used were: Nedd4-1: UAGAGCCUGGCUGGGUUGUUU; Nedd4-2: AACCACAACACAAAGUCACAG; β-arrestin-1: AGCCUUCUGCGCGGAGAAU. The control non-targeting sequence used was: UCAUCUAAGCUGGCUUUGCTT. Cell surface biotinylation, endo-, and exocytosis assays were essentially conducted as described (24Bobulescu I.A. Dwarakanath V. Zou L. Zhang J. Baum M. Moe O.W. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F685-F691Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For surface biotinylation, cells were rinsed with PBS and surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating cells with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl for 90 min with horizontal motion at 4 °C. After labeling, plates were washed with quenching buffer (PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm glycine) for 20 min at 4 °C, then rinsed once with PBS. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Cell lysates of equivalent amounts of protein were equilibrated overnight with streptavidin-agarose beads at 4 °C. Beads were washed sequentially with solutions A (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) three times, B (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4) and 500 mm NaCl) two times, and C (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4) once. Biotinylated proteins were then released by heating to 95 °C with 2.5× Lämmli buffer. For sequential cell surface biotinylation/immunoprecipitation, monomeric avidin-agarose beads were used which allow, in contrast to streptavidin-agarose beads, elution of biotinylated proteins by excess of free biotin. For this purpose, monomeric avidin beads were pre-washed according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently used to precipitate surface membrane proteins that had been biotinylated before as described above. Beads were washed with solutions A–C as described above with additional two washes with a buffer containing PBS/1% Triton X-100 at the end. Biotinylated proteins were then eluted at 4 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing PBS/1% Triton X-100, 20 mm biotin, fresh protease inhibitors (Roche), 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 10 μm MG132. The resulting bead supernatant was then used for immunoprecipitation experiments. To measure NHE1 endocytosis, cells were surface-labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin instead of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and quenched as described above. Cells were then warmed to 37 °C for 3 h to allow protein trafficking to occur, control cells were kept at 4 °C. After twice washing with TBS, surface biotin was cleaved with the small cell-impermeant reducing agent sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (10 mm MesNa, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% BSA in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6). The biotin bound to endocytosed proteins is protected from MesNa cleavage. After MesNa quenching with iodoacetamide and one wash with TBS, cells were then solubilized in RIPA buffer and biotinylated proteins were retrieved with streptavidin-agarose affinity precipitation as described above. For measurement of NHE1 exocytosis, cells were rinsed with PBS thrice and the apical surface was then exposed to 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-acetate in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 0.15 m NaCl (3 times 40 min at 4 °C) to saturate NHS-reactive sites on the cell surface. After quenching for 20 min (see above for quench conditions), cells were warmed to 37 °C for 3 h to permit protein trafficking, control cells were kept at 4 °C. Cells were then surface-labeled with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and lysed with RIPA buffer. The biotinylated fraction, which represents newly inserted surface proteins, was then affinity-precipitated with streptavidin-agarose, and the precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. MesNa, sulfo-NHS-acetate, sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, monomeric avidin agarose beads, streptavidin-agarose beads and biotin were obtained from Pierce. Purification of His6-ubiquitylated proteins was essentially performed as described by Treier et al. (20Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells grown on 100-mm dishes were lysed in 2 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm imidazole and sonicated to reduce viscosity. Lysate was mixed on a rotor with 50 μl (settled volume) of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 4 h at room temperature. The slurry was applied to Bio-Rad chromatography columns and successively washed with the following: 2 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100; 4 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 5.8), 1% Triton X-100; 2 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100; 4 ml of (6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100:protein buffer) 1:1; 4 ml of (6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100:protein buffer) 1:3; 4 ml of protein buffer; 2 ml of protein buffer plus 10 mm imidazole. Elution was 1 ml of protein buffer plus 200 mm imidazole. Protein buffer was 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The eluate was then trichloroacetic acid/acetone precipitated for further analysis. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting have been described (25Fuster D.G. Bobulescu I.A. Zhang J. Wade J. Moe O.W.

For chemical cross-linking, cells grown on 6-cm dishes were washed 3× with PBS and incubated with 1 mm DTME (Pierce) in PBS containing 10 mm Hepes pH 7.5 at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed 3× with PBS to remove unreacted DTME, lysed with RIPA buffer, and then used for immunoprecipitation experiments.

Cellular lysis buffers always contained fresh protease inhibitors (Roche), 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 10 μm MG132 to prevent ex vivo artifacts. The Lys63-linked polyubiquitin ladder was obtained from Boston Biochem. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min and blocked by 1.5% BSA and 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. Fixed monolayers were incubated with primary antibodies in 1.5% BSA and 5% goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Then, after 3× washing in PBS, cells were incubated with the appropriate Alexa 405-, 488-, or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3× washing in PBS, fixed and stained monolayers were mounted on glass slides. Images were obtained through a Nikon C1 confocal microscope. NHE1 activity was measured fluorometrically using the intracellularly trapped pH-sensitive dye BCECF and intracellular acid loading was achieved using the NH4Cl prepulse technique as described previously (28Alpern R.J.

Cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with 1 μm BCECF-AM and exposed to 25 mm NH4Cl for 15 min in a buffer containing in mm: 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 25 NH4Cl, 30 Hepes titrated to pH 7.4 with NMDG.

Recording was started and after 60 s cells were rapidly exposed to a buffer containing in mm: 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 30 Hepes titrated to pH 7.4 with NMDG. BCECF fluorescence signals (λ excitation: 490 and 440 nm, λ emission: 535 nm) were recorded in a computer-controlled spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax-2, Photon Technology International). The 490/440 nm fluorescence ratio was calibrated to pHi using K+/nigericin (30Nakamura T.Y. Iwata Y. Arai Y. Komamura K. Wakabayashi S. Circ.

All steps of incubation, recording and calibration were performed at 37 °C. Proton flux was calculated as follows: JH+ = βintrinsic × ΔpH/Δt (30Nakamura T.Y. Iwata Y. Arai Y. Komamura K. Wakabayashi S. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Comparisons were always made between cells studied on the same day. As it is currently unknown if NHE1 or any other NHE are ubiquitylated at the plasma membrane, we first tested if plasmalemmal NHE1 is ubiquitylated. NHE1–3xFLAG and HA-ubiquitin constructs or corresponding empty plasmids (pCMV and pMH, respectively) were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. Then, after labeling of plasma membrane proteins by sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin followed by affinity isolation with monomeric avidin agarose beads, biotinylated proteins were eluted with excess of free biotin (for details see supplemental Fig. S1 and “Experimental Procedures”). Eluates were then denatured by boiling in 1% SDS to remove putative ubiquitylated NHE1-associated proteins (17Fouladkou F. Lu C. Jiang C. Zhou L. She Y. Walls J.R. Kawabe H. Brose N. Henkelman R.M.

Rotin D. Biochem. J. 2008; 415: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After this denaturation step, immunoprecipitation was performed with the indicated antibodies in Fig. 1. Using this approach, the mature, plasmalemmal form of NHE1 (∼90–95 kDa) could be specifically isolated and enriched (Fig. 1A, upper left panel). No NHE1 was present in the immunoprecipitate if the initial biotinylation step was omitted (Fig. 1A, upper left panel). After immunoprecipitation of NHE1, ubiquitylation of NHE1 was detected by blotting with an α-HA antibody recognizing transfected HA-ubiquitin (Fig. 1A, lower left panel). Conversely, a high molecular weight smear of NHE1 was detected when ubiquitin was immunoprecipitated followed by immunoblotting for NHE1 (Fig. 1A, upper right panel). To further confirm that NHE1 and not an NHE1-associated protein was ubiquitylated, His6-ubiquitin and NHE1–3xFLAG constructs were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. His6-ubiquitylated proteins were then isolated by Ni-NTA-agarose beads under denaturing conditions in a buffer containing 6 m guanidium-HCl (20Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D.

Fig. 1B demonstrates that a high molecular weight smear of NHE1 could only be detected if NHE1 and ubiquitin constructs were co-expressed but not if the empty vector, NHE1 or ubiquitin constructs were expressed alone. Together, these findings clearly indicate that NHE1 itself and not an NHE1-associated protein is subject to ubiquitylation. The 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, Lys63) all capable of conjugating ubiquitin (33Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Cheng D.

It is the current belief that Lys48-linked chains primarily serve as recognition signal for proteasomal degradation whereas monoubiquitylation and Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation seem to be involved in cellular trafficking (34Rotin D. Kumar S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 35Newton K. Matsumoto M.L. Wertz I.E. Kirkpatrick D.S. Lill J.R. Tan J. Dugger D. Gordon N. Sidhu S.S.

Recent evidence, however, suggests that all non-Lys63-linked chains can target proteins for degradation in eukaryotes (33Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Cheng D. Xie Y. Robert J. Rush J.

We next generated several HA-ubiquitin constructs with arginine replacement of key lysine residues and assessed plasmalemmal NHE1 ubiquitylation. As shown in Fig. 2A, cellular expression levels of the different K/R HA-ubiquitin constructs in HEK293 cells varied greatly. Clearly, however, NHE1 ubiquitylation seemed to be unaffected by arginine replacement of key ubiquitin lysine residues, including Lys11, Lys48, or Lys63 (Fig. 2A, left panel). Although poorly expressed when compared with the wild-type ubiquitin construct, even a ubiquitin construct lacking all seven lysine residues led to a NHE1 ubiquitylation signal (Fig. 2A, right panel). These results suggested that NHE1 is either only multi-monoubiquitylated or both multi-monoubiquitylated and polyubiquitylated. To further differentiate between multi-mono- and polyubiquitylation, we employed two monoclonal α-ubiquitin antibodies with different affinities to monoubiquitin and tested native NHE1 ubiquitylation in untransfected mouse skin fibroblasts derived from NHE1 wild-type and knock-out animals, respectively (19Fuster D. Moe O.W. Hilgemann D.W. J Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Wegierski T. Hill K. Schaefer M. Walz G.

However, whereas the α-ubiquitin antibody P4D1 recognizes both monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains of a ubiquitin ladder, the α-ubiquitin antibody FK1 only recognizes the polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2D, both the P4D1 and FK1 α-ubiquitin antibody detected endogenous ubiquitylated NHE1 in NHE1 wild-type fibroblasts compared with NHE1 knock-out fibroblasts. Together with results obtained with mutant ubiquitin constructs, these findings suggest that NHE1 is subject to both multi-mono- and polyubiquitylation. The large, ∼320 amino acid spanning intracellular C terminus of the 820 amino acid long NHE1 protein contains 27 conserved lysine residues making it a likely target for the attachment of ubiquitin moieties. Whereas the short intracellular NHE1 N terminus does not contain any lysine residues, several short intracellular loops between transmembrane domains also contain conserved lysine residues that would theoretically be accessible to the ubiquitin machinery. To map regions important for NHE1 ubiquitylation, we expressed wild-type (NHE1 WT) or C-terminally truncated (NHE1Δ747, NHE1Δ675, and NHE1Δ550, respectively) constructs in HEK293 cells and assessed surface ubiquitylation (Fig. 3A). NHE1Δ550 lacks most of the intracellular C terminus, including docking sites of a myriad of associated proteins and all known phosphorylation sites (5Putney L.K. Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 527-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3B, whereas ubiquitin signals of appropriate size could be detected for wild-type NHE1, NHE1Δ747, and NHE1Δ675, no specific ubiquitin signal was detected for NHE1Δ550 compared with control, even after long exposure of the blot (Fig. 3B). Together, these findings indicate that the NHE1 C terminus is required for NHE1 ubiquitylation at the plasma membrane. Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 are E3 ligases shown previously to be responsible for the ubiquitylation of several membrane transport proteins (11Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized, that Nedd4-1 or Nedd4-2 could be mediating plasmalemmal ubiquitylation of NHE1. For this purpose, HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting Nedd4-1, Nedd4-2, or control siRNA and plasmalemmal NHE1 ubiquitylation was then assessed (Fig. 4A). Silencing of endogenous Nedd4-1 significantly decreased NHE1 ubiquitylation by ∼ 40% whereas knock-down of the closely related Nedd4-2 isoform led to a small albeit insignificant increase in NHE1 ubiquitylation when compared with control treated cells (Fig. 4B). Typically, > 70% knock-down of Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 was achieved by the respective siRNA"
https://openalex.org/W1991705951,"Diclofenac is one of the oldest anti-inflammatory drugs in use. In addition to its inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX), diclofenac potently inhibits phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), thus yielding a broad anti-inflammatory effect. Since inflammation is an important factor in the development of pancreatic tumors we explored the potential of diclofenac to inhibit tumor growth in mice inoculated with PANCO2 cells orthotopically.We found that diclofenac treatment (30 mg/kg/bw for 11 days) of mice inoculated with PANC02 cells, reduced the tumor weight by 60%, correlating with increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Since this effect was not observed in vitro on cultured PANCO2 cells, we theorized that diclofenac beneficial treatment involved other mediators present in vivo. Indeed, diclofenac drastically decreased tumor vascularization by downregulating VEGF in the tumor and in abdominal cavity fluid. Furthermore, diclofenac directly inhibited vascular sprouting ex vivo. Surprisingly, in contrast to other COX-2 inhibitors, diclofenac increased arginase activity/arginase 1 protein content in tumor stroma cells, peritoneal macrophages and white blood cells by 2.4, 4.8 and 2 fold, respectively. We propose that the subsequent arginine depletion and decrease in NO levels, both in serum and peritoneal cavity, adds to tumor growth inhibition by malnourishment and poor vasculature development.In conclusion, diclofenac shows pronounced antitumoral properties in pancreatic cancer model that can contribute to further treatment development. The ability of diclofenac to induce arginase activity in tumor stroma, peritoneal macrophages and white blood cells provides a tool to study a controversial issue of pro-and antitumoral effects of arginine depletion."
https://openalex.org/W2007000115,"Metastasis is the major reason for breast cancer-related deaths. Although there is a host of indirect evidence for a role of protein kinase C (PKC) α in primary breast cancer growth, its role in the molecular pathways leading to metastasis has not been studied comprehensively. By treating mice with αV5-3, a novel peptide inhibitor selective for PKCα, we were able to determine how PKCα regulates metastasis of mammary cancer cells using a syngeneic and orthotopic model. The primary tumor growth was not affected by αV5-3 treatment. However, the mortality rate was reduced and metastasis in the lung decreased by more than 90% in the αV5-3-treated mice relative to the control-treated mice. αV5-3 treatment reduced intravasation by reducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 activities. αV5-3 treatment also reduced lung seeding of tumor cells and decreased cell migration, effects that were accompanied by a reduction in nuclear factor kappa B activity and cell surface levels of the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4. αV5-3 treatment caused no apparent toxicity in non-tumor-bearing naïve mice. Rather, inhibiting PKCα protected against liver damage and increased the number of immune cells in tumor-bearing mice. Importantly, αV5-3 showed superior efficacy relative to anti-CXCR4 antibody in reducing metastasis in vivo. Together, these data show that pharmacological inhibition of PKCα effectively reduces mammary cancer metastasis by targeting intravasation and lung seeding steps in the metastatic process and suggest that PKCα-specific inhibitors, such as αV5-3, can be used to study the mechanistic roles of PKCα specifically and may provide a safe and effective treatment for the prevention of lung metastasis of breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2065170276,"Some cyclodipeptides are unusual in that their cyclic scaffold is created from activated, amino-acid–loaded tRNA substrates. Structural and biochemical evidence now demonstrates that the enzymes that perform this reaction are homologous to tRNA synthetases and use a covalently bound intermediate. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme Rv2275 catalyzes the formation of cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Tyr) using two molecules of Tyr-tRNATyr as substrates. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of Rv2275 was determined to 2.0-Å resolution, revealing that Rv2275 is structurally related to the class Ic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family of enzymes. Mutagenesis and radioactive labeling suggests a covalent intermediate in which L-tyrosine is transferred from Tyr-tRNATyr to an active site serine (Ser88) by transesterification with Glu233 serving as a critical base, catalyzing dipeptide bond formation."
https://openalex.org/W1970387673,"Background Controlling the pandemic spread of newly emerging diseases requires rapid, targeted allocation of limited resources among nations. Critical, early control steps would be greatly enhanced if the key risk factors can be identified that accurately predict early disease spread immediately after emergence. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H1N1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, as well as other socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in live swine and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which may have contributed to the emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H1N1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen will reach and to countries where lower healthcare resources will likely cause delays in reporting. Our results highlight the benefits, for all parties, when higher income countries provide additional healthcare resources for lower income countries, particularly those that have high air traffic volumes. In particular, international authorities should prioritize aid to those poorest countries where both the risk of emerging infectious diseases and air traffic volume is highest. This strategy will result in earlier detection of pathogens and a reduction in the impact of future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W2129469298,"Hypoxia-elicited adaptations of tumor cells are essential for tumor growth and cancer progression. Although ample evidence exists for a positive correlation between hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and tumor formation, metastasis and bad prognosis, the function of the HIF-α protein stability regulating prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain enzyme PHD2 in carcinogenesis is less well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that downregulation of PHD2 leads to increased tumor growth in a hormone-dependent mammary carcinoma mouse model. Tissue microarray analysis of PHD2 protein expression in 281 clinical samples of human breast cancer showed significantly shorter survival times of patients with low-level PHD2 tumors over a period of 10 years. An angiogenesis-related antibody array identified, amongst others, amphiregulin to be increased in the absence of PHD2 and normalized after PHD2 reconstitution. Cultivation of endothelial cells in conditioned media derived from PHD2-downregulated cells resulted in enhanced tube formation that was blocked by the addition of neutralizing anti-amphiregulin antibodies. Functionally, amphiregulin was regulated on the transcriptional level specifically by HIF-2 but not HIF-1. Our data suggest that PHD2/HIF-2/amphiregulin signaling has a critical role in the regulation of breast tumor progression and propose PHD2 as a potential tumor suppressor in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2026794325,"The chemokine receptor CXCR3 may play a critical role in the growth and metastasis of tumor cells, including renal tumors. It has been shown that CXCR3 has two splice variants with completely opposite functions; CXCR3-A promotes cell proliferation, whereas CXCR3-B inhibits cell growth. We recently demonstrated that the expression of growth-promoting CXCR3-A is up-regulated, and the growth-inhibitory CXCR3-B is markedly down-regulated in human renal cancer tissues; and the overexpression of CXCR3-B in renal cancer cells can significantly inhibit cell proliferation. However, the growth-inhibitory signal(s) through CXCR3-B are not well characterized. Here, we investigated the effector molecule(s) involved in CXCR3-B-mediated signaling events. We found that the overexpression of CXCR3-B in human renal cancer cells (Caki-1) promoted cellular apoptosis as observed by FACS analysis through Annexin-V staining. To examine whether the overexpression of CXCR3-B could alter the expression of any apoptosis-related genes in renal cancer cells, we performed a protein array. We found that CXCR3-B overexpression significantly down-regulated the expression of antiapoptotic heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). By utilizing a HO-1 promoter-luciferase plasmid, we showed that CXCR3-B-mediated down-regulation of HO-1 was controlled at the transcriptional level as observed by luciferase assay. We also demonstrated that the inhibition of HO-1 expression using siRNA promoted apoptosis of renal cancer cells. Finally, we observed that human renal cancer tissues expressing low amounts of CXCR3-B significantly overexpress HO-1 at both mRNA and protein level. Together, we suggest that the overexpression of CXCR3-B may prevent the growth of renal tumors through the inhibition of antiapoptotic HO-1."
https://openalex.org/W2153181528,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) possess high proliferative potential and the capacity for self-renewal with retention of multipotency to differentiate into neuronal and glial cells. NSCs are the source for neurogenesis during central nervous system development from fetal and adult stages. Although the human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate epitope is expressed predominantly in the nervous system and involved in intercellular adhesion, cell migration, and synaptic plasticity, the expression patterns and functional roles of HNK-1-containing glycoconjugates in NSCs have not been fully recognized. We found that HNK-1 was expressed in embryonic mouse NSCs and that this expression was lost during the process of differentiation. Based on proteomics analysis, it was revealed that the HNK-1 epitopes were almost exclusively displayed on an extracellular matrix protein, tenascin-C (TNC), in the mouse embryonic NSCs. Furthermore, the HNK-1 epitope was found to be present only on the largest isoform of the TNC molecules. In addition, the expression of HNK-1 was dependent on expression of the largest TNC variant but not by enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of HNK-1. By knocking down HNK-1 sulfotransferase or TNC by small interfering RNA, we further demonstrated that HNK-1 on TNC was involved in the proliferation of NSCs via modulation of the expression level of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Our finding provides insights into the function of HNK-1 carbohydrate epitopes in NSCs to maintain stemness during neural development."
https://openalex.org/W2077930426,"Background Malaria and schistosomiasis coinfection frequently occurs in tropical countries. This study evaluates the influence of Schistosoma haematobium infection on specific antibody responses and cytokine production to recombinant merozoite surface protein-1-19 (MSP1-19) and schizont extract of Plasmodium falciparum in malaria-infected children. Methodology Specific IgG1 to MSP1-19, as well as IgG1 and IgG3 to schizont extract were significantly increased in coinfected children compared to P. falciparum mono-infected children. Stimulation with MSP1-19 lead to a specific production of both interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), whereas the stimulation with schizont extract produced an IL-10 response only in the coinfected group. Conclusions Our study suggests that schistosomiasis coinfection favours anti-malarial protective antibody responses, which could be associated with the regulation of IL-10 and IFN-γ production and seems to be antigen-dependent. This study demonstrates the importance of infectious status of the population in the evaluation of acquired immunity against malaria and highlights the consequences of a multiple infection environment during clinical trials of anti-malaria vaccine candidates."

Here, we characterized the binding of the terminal complement complex inhibitor complement Factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) and of the C3 convertase regulator Factor H to the streptococcal collagen-like proteins (Scl). CFHR1 and Factor H, but no other member of the Factor H protein family (CFHR2, CFHR3, or CFHR4A), bound to the two streptococcal proteins Scl1.6 and Scl1.55, which are expressed by GAS serotypes M6 and M55. The two human regulators bound to the Scl1 proteins via their conserved C-terminal attachment region, i.e. CFHR1 short consensus repeats 3–5 (SCR3–5) and Factor H SCR18–20. Binding was affected by ionic strength and by heparin. CFHR1 and the C-terminal attachment region of Factor H did not bind to Scl1.1 and Scl2.28 proteins but did bind to intact M1-type and M28-type GAS, which express Scl1.1 and Scl2.28, respectively, thus arguing for the presence of an additional binding mechanism to CFHR1 and Factor H. Furthermore mutations within the C-terminal heparin-binding region and Factor H mutations that are associated with the acute renal disease atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome blocked the interaction with the two streptococcal proteins. Binding of CFHR1 affected the complement regulatory functions of Factor H on the level of the C3 convertase.

On the contrary, type B proteins, represented by M-, M-like, and the fibronectin-binding protein Fba proteins, bind Factor H and FHL-1 via domain SCR7 and do not bind CFHR1. In conclusion, binding of CFHR1 is at the expense of Factor H-mediated regulatory function at the level of C3 convertase and at the gain of a regulator that controls complement at the level of the C5 convertase and formation of the terminal complement complex.

Upon infection of a human host, S. pyogenes, similar to other microbes, is immediately confronted and attacked by the human complement system. This central defense system represents an enzymatic cascade which is initiated via three major pathways, the alternative, the classical, and the lectin pathway. The alternative complement pathway (AP) is activated spontaneously, continuously, and independently of antibodies. Upon activation, a C3 convertase is formed on the surface of an invading microbe; this enzyme cleaves the central complement compound C3 into surface-opsonizing C3b and into the chemotactic and antimicrobial anaphylatoxin C3a (3Zipfel P.F. Reuter M. Int. J. Pept. Res. Ther. 2009; 15: 87-95Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If activation proceeds, a C5 convertase is formed that generates the potent anaphylactic peptide C5a and further initiates the terminal complement complex (TCC), which forms a pore in the membrane of the microbe and leads to target lysis (4Taylor P.

Host cells are generally protected from the damaging effects of alternative complement attack by surface-expressed as well as surface-acquired complement regulators. Factor H is the major soluble regulator of the AP, and this protein is composed of 20 domains termed short consensus repeats (SCR).

Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), which is derived from an alternatively spliced transcript of the Factor H gene, consists of the first seven SCRs including the regulatory region. Both regulators act on the level of the C3 convertase, accelerating the decay of the convertase and acting as cofactors for the C3b-cleaving serine protease Factor I (13Hellwage J. Kühn S.

CFHR1 is a complement inhibitor that inhibits the C5 convertase and blocks formation of the terminal complement complex (17Heinen S. Hartmann A. Lauer N. Wiehl U. Dahse H.M. Schirmer S. Gropp K.

CFHR1 shares the C-terminal surface binding region with Factor H, and the three most C-terminal domains of both proteins display almost 99% identity on the amino acid level. CFHR1 lacks the N-terminal regulatory region of Factor H and consequently lacks regulatory functions on the C3 convertase level. The three regulators, CFHR1, Factor H, and FHL-1, are members of the Factor H protein family that also include four additional Factor H-related proteins (CFHR2–CFHR5). All members of the Factor H protein family share common structural features and are composed exclusively of short consensus repeats, which have high sequence similarities among each other (18Józsi M. Zipfel P.F. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 380-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes expresses several surface proteins that recruit the host complement regulators Factor H, FHL-1, CFHR1, and C4-binding protein (C4BP) to the bacterial surface. This allows the pathogen to control host complement attack, to inactivate complement effector proteins, and consequently to block C3b opsonization and the generation of inflammatory anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), as well as TCC formation and surface deposition. The known streptococcal binding proteins are M-protein, M-like proteins, and fibronectin-binding protein (Fba) (19Jarva H. Jokiranta T.S. Würzner R. Meri S. Mol.

Streptococcal collagen-like (Scl) proteins are expressed by all S. pyogenes M-types and have a conserved domain structure: a C-terminal cell wall membrane-spanning region, with an LPXTG cell wall-binding motif followed by an extracellular collagen-like domain with the repetitive GXY amino acid motif, and an adjacent N-terminal variable domain. The predicted structure indicates a “lollipop-like” domain organization, where the collagen-like domain forms a triple helical stalk and the variable domain folds into a globular head. S. pyogenes expresses two distinct Scl proteins, Scl1 and Scl2. The two bacterial proteins have a rather similar domain organization, but Scl1 includes an additional linker region between the cell wall membrane-spanning region and the collagen-like domain (28Lukomski S.

Binding was observed exclusively for Scl1 of the M6 and M55 serotypes, whereas Scl1 and Scl2 proteins of other serotypes, e.g. Scl1 of M1-type bacteria (Scl1.1), Scl1 and Scl2 of M28-type bacteria (Scl1.28 and Scl2.28), and others (34Caswell C.C.

In contrast, the variable domain of nonbinding Scl proteins Scl1.1 and Scl2.28 have a lower level of identity of 35 and 40%, respectively, when compared with the binding Scl proteins.

Scl1, derived from S. pyogenes serotype M6 and M55 (Scl1.6 and Scl1.55), bind CFHR1 and Factor H, but the binding region within the two host proteins is thus far unknown. In the present study we localized the binding regions in the human CFHR1 and Factor H proteins for Scl1 interaction with the C termini of the two complement regulators by using recombinant deletion fragments. CFHR1 and Factor H compete for binding to both Scl1.6 and Scl1.55, indicating that the two human regulators bind the same epitope(s) within the streptococcal proteins. By peptide spot assays a linear Scl binding sequence with a length of five amino acid residues was identified in SCR4 of CFHR1. This sequence is also conserved in SCR19 of Factor H. In addition, several residues located within SCR20 of Factor H (or SCR5 CFHR1) are also relevant for binding to Scl1.6 and Scl1.55. Based on this unique binding profile for the CFHR1 and Factor H C-terminal regions, Scl1.6 and Scl1.55 proteins represent a new class of streptococcal CFHR1/Factor H-binding proteins. They bind a different region of the Factor H protein as compared with the previously identified streptococcal Factor H-binding proteins M-, M-like, and Fba protein. This difference in recognition and binding is relevant for GAS immune evasion as complement is blocked at multiple levels. Production of recombinant Scl proteins has been reported (30Xu Y. Keene D.R.

Briefly, Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used in cloning experiments, and E. coli BL21 was used for protein expression. E. coli strains harboring plasmid constructs were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium (BD Biosciences) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Recombinant Scl proteins were produced in the E. coli periplasm using the Strep-Tag II expression and purification system (IBA GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). Factor H fragments SCR8–11, SCR11–15, SCR8–20, SCR15–18, SCR15–19, SCR15–20, and SCR19–20, as well as Factor H SCR8–20-based mutant proteins (V1197A, W1183V, R1210C, and R1215G), Factor H SCR15–20-based mutant HepG (R1203E, R1206E, R1210S, K1230S, and R1231A), and Factor H family proteins CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR4A, and FHL-1, were expressed using the baculovirus expression system described previously (42Kühn S.

Briefly, following cultivation of insect cells of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) at 28 °C in protein-free Grace medium (BioWhittaker), cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus. After 9 days the culture supernatant was harvested, and the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The recombinant CFHR1 protein was expressed by using the Pichia pastoris expression system (Invitrogen). The CFHR1-encoding gene was cloned into the pPicZαB vector and subsequently introduced into P. pastoris X33. Expression was induced with 1% methanol. The recombinant protein-containing supernatant was harvested after 4 days of expression and purified by using the FPLC Äkta purifier (GE Healthcare) together with 1 ml nickel-chelating columns (HiTrap HP, GE Healthcare). The purified proteins were concentrated (Amicon Ultra-15), and buffer was changed to 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Lonza). The recombinant Scl proteins Scl1.1, Scl1.6, Scl1.55, and Scl2.28 (10 μg/ml in DPBS) were immobilized overnight at 4 °C onto a microtiter plate (Maxisorb, Nunc). All samples were probed in triplicate. Following washing, plates were blocked with 1× PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Applichem) and 1× Roti-Block (Roth) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times, and the ligand protein, Factor H (Comptech) or CFHR1, respectively, was added with increasing amounts in a range of 0 to 20 μg/ml in DPBS. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, plates were washed extensively with 1× PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma). Bound proteins were detected with polyclonal Factor H antiserum (1:1000, Comptech) and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled anti-goat antibody (1:1000, Dako), each diluted in blocking buffer. Serum-derived CFHR1 was detected with monoclonal CFHR1 antibody JHD10 (1:1000, Prof. Dr. Wallich, Heidelberg University) and a secondary HRP-coupled anti-mouse antibody (1:1000, Dako) (17Heinen S. Hartmann A. Lauer N. Wiehl U. Dahse H.M. Schirmer S. Gropp K. Enghardt T. Wallich R. Halbich S. Mihlan M. Schlotzer-Schrehardt U. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Blood. 2009; 114: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The reaction was developed with the chromogen substrate 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, Dako), and absorbency was measured at 490 nm. For the reverse setting, Factor H, CFHRs, or Factor H fragments (SCR1–7, SCR8–11, SCR11–15, SCR15–20, SCR15–18, and SCR19–20) were immobilized (10 μg/ml), and Scl were used as ligand (15 μg/ml). Bound Scl proteins were detected with anti-Strep-Tag II-HRP. Dependence was measured by using 1× PBS buffer (2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4) with increasing NaCl molarities ranging from 0 to 560 mm for protein diluents, blocking solution, and washing buffer. Factor H and CFHR1 were immobilized (10 μg/ml), and Scl (15 μg/ml) was added. Experiments were performed as described above. Upon immobilization of Scl (10 μg/ml), Factor H or CFHR1 (5 μg/ml) were added to the wells, together with increasing amounts of heparin sodium salt (Fluka) ranging from 0 to 512 μg/ml. A catch ELISA was performed to measure the interaction of Factor H SCR8–20-based mutant proteins with Scl1.6, Scl1.55, and Scl2.28. The mutations were located at positions V1197A, W1183V, R1210C, and R1215G. In addition, a Factor H SCR15–20 fragment (a non-disease-associated protein) was added. This mutant construct harbors amino acid exchanges of five heparin-binding residues, i.e. R1203E, R1206E, R1210S, K1230S, and R1231A, that form a positively charged patch in SCR20. All mutants used in this assay showed impaired heparin and C3b binding. Heparin binding was assayed as described above, with the following modifications. First, a Factor H SCR15–18-specific antiserum was immobilized (1:300 in DPBS) overnight at 4 °C. Following blocking, baculovirus supernatant containing the various mutant proteins was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Two plates were prepared in parallel. The first plate was used to verify equal binding of mutant proteins by adding a polyclonal Factor H antiserum (1:1000, Comptech) and a secondary anti-goat-HRP antibody (1:1000, Dako). The second plate was used to analyze the Scl interaction. Then Scl was added (10 μg/ml) and detected with anti-Strep-Tag II-HRP. This was performed as follows. 25 ml of brain-heart infusion (BHI, Fluka) medium was inoculated with 0.5 ml of an overnight culture of GAS types M1, M6, M28, and M55. The cultures were grown at 37 °C for 4 h until mid-log phase. GAS at 5 × 106 colony-forming units in DPBS were added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Equal attachment was verified by staining bound bacteria with crystal violet in a parallel approach. The ligand proteins were added at 15 μg/ml, and the assay was developed as described above. The M-type-dependent antibody background level was measured and subtracted to compare ligand binding among the serotypes. This was performed by adding different molar ratios of Factor H:CFHR1 (1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 0:1) to immobilized Scl proteins (10 μg/ml). The ELISA was performed as described above. Bound Factor H was detected with a polyclonal rabbit Factor H SCR1–4 antiserum (1:1000) and a secondary anti-rabbit-HRP antiserum (1:1000, Dako). Protein-protein interactions were analyzed by the SPR technique using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB) as described (44Wieland G.D. Nehmann N. Müller D. Eibel H. Siebenlist U. Sühnel J. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3203-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The recombinant Scl proteins (i.e. Scl1.1, Scl1.6, Scl2.28, and Scl1.55) were immobilized on the sensorchip by Strep-Tactin (IBA), which was fixed by standard amine coupling to the surface of a CM5 chip (3000 relative light units). All SPR experiments were performed in DPBS. Forty peptides representing CFHR1 SCR4 and SCR5 (residues 202–330) with a length of 13 amino acids and an overlap of 10 amino acids were synthesized and coupled to a cellulose membrane (JPT, Berlin, Germany). The membranes were treated as described (44Wieland G.D. Nehmann N. Müller D. Eibel H. Siebenlist U. Sühnel J. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3203-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Then 1 μg/ml Scl1.6 or Scl2.28 protein in DPBS was used. Bound protein was detected with 1:1000 anti-Strep-Tag II-HRP antibody. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels. After transfer of the proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Whatman) by semidry blotting, the membranes were blocked with 4% (w/v) dried milk, 1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20 in DPBS (Lonza) overnight at 4 °C. Blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature followed by the corresponding secondary antisera coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. ECL plus solution (GE Healthcare) was used for protein detection, and images were taken using Bio-Imaging Systems MF-ChemiBIS 3.2 (Biostep). GAS types M1, M6, M28, and M55 were grown overnight at 37 °C in 10 ml of brain-heart infusion. Bacteria were washed twice with DPBS, and 1 × 108 GAS colony-forming units/sample were incubated with Factor H SCR15–20 (15 μg/ml), Factor H SCR15–18, CFHR1, or buffer without protein for 30 min at 37 °C. Next, bacteria were washed twice, a polyclonal antiserum (1:100, Comptech) that also detects CFHR1 and Factor H was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Bacteria were washed again, a secondary anti-goat F′ab2 antibody coupled with Alexa 488 (1:100, Invitrogen) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. Bacteria were washed with DPBS and examined by flow cytometry (LSR II, BD Biosciences). Forward and sideward scatter were used to identify bacteria, and 10,000 events were counted. The functional activity of Scl-bound Factor H was analyzed using a cofactor assay. First, Scl1.6, Scl1.55, and Scl2.28 protein (each at 10 μg/ml) was immobilized overnight at 4 °C. After washing (1× PBS and 0.05% Tween 20) and blocking (1× PBS, 2% BSA, and 1× Roti-Block), Factor H was added (15 μg/ml in DPBS), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Wells without Factor H were prepared in parallel to verify Factor H specificity. Next, the plate was washed, and C3b (10 μg/ml in DPBS) together with Factor I (0.7 μg/ml in DPBS) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. C3b cleavage was visualized using a C3-specific antiserum (1:1000, Calbiochem) and a secondary anti-goat-HRP antibody (1:2000, Dako). In addition a cofactor assay was performed to determine the functional relevance of the Factor H and CFHR1 competition upon Scl binding. Various molar ratios of Factor H:CFHR1 (1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 0:1) were added to immobilized Scl proteins (10 μg/ml). C3b cleavage was assayed as described. In addition, competition of CFHR1 and Factor H was followed by ELISA (see “Competition ELISA” above). Scl proteins Scl1.6, Scl1.55, and Scl2.28 or human serum albumin (each at 15 μg/ml) was immobilized for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and blocked, and then CFHR1 and Factor H were added as ligands. CFHR1 and Factor H binding was verified with a polyclonal Factor H antiserum. In parallel, purified TCC compounds (Comptech) diluted in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 144 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA) were added to the wells. C5b6 (3.8 μl, 20 μg/ml) and C7 (5 μl, 20 μg/ml) were adjusted to 40 μl with HEPES buffer and added to the sample. This mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then C8 and C9 (both at 5 μl, 20 μg/ml) were added. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the samples were washed, and surface-deposited TCC was detected using a polyclonal SC5b9 (TCC)-reacting rabbit antiserum (1:1000, Comptech) and a secondary anti-rabbit HRP-coupled serum (Dako). CFHR1, used at increasing amounts (0–2 μm) was incubated together with increasing amounts of Scl1.6, Scl1.55, or Scl2.28 (0–2 μm) in HEPES buffer. Samples were split; one aliquot was analyzed for CFHR1-Scl complex formation, whereas the other part was used in a hemolytic assay. The level of Scl-bound CFHR1 was identified using the catch ELISA described above, with the following modifications. Anti-Strep-Tag II antibody (1:400) was immobilized to bind Scl protein. Samples diluted 1:100 in DPBS were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and bound complexes were detected with a polyclonal CFHR1 antiserum (1:1000) and a secondary HRP-coupled anti-goat antiserum (1:"

We describe the epidemiology of HIV in large urban areas with the highest HIV burden.We used data from national HIV surveillance for 12 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to determine disparities in HIV diagnoses and prevalence and changes over time. Overall, 0.3% to 1% of the MSA populations were living with HIV at the end of 2007. In each MSA, prevalence was >1% among blacks; prevalence was >2% in Miami, New York, and Baltimore. Among Hispanics, prevalence was >1% in New York and Philadelphia. The relative percentage differences in 2007 HIV diagnosis rates, compared to whites, ranged from 239 (San Francisco) to 1239 (Baltimore) for blacks and from 15 (Miami) to 413 (Philadelphia) for Hispanics. The epidemic remains concentrated, with more than 50% of HIV diagnoses in 2007 attributed to male-to-male sexual contact in 7 of the 12 MSAs; heterosexual transmission surpassed or equaled male-to-male sexual transmission in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. Yet in several MSAs, including Baltimore and Washington, DC, AIDS diagnoses increased among men-who-have sex with men in recent years.These data are useful to identify local drivers of the epidemic and to tailor public health efforts for treatment and prevention services for people living with HIV."

Analyzing ballot results from several large countries rather anomalous and yet unexplained distributions have been observed. We identify tactical voting as the driving ingredient for the anomalies and introduce a model to study its effect on plurality elections, characterized by the relative strength of the feedback from polls and the pairwise interaction between individuals in the society. With this model it becomes possible to explain the polarization of votes between two candidates, understand the small margin of victories frequently observed for different elections, and analyze the polls' impact in American, Canadian, and Brazilian ballots. Moreover, the model reproduces, quantitatively, the distribution of votes obtained in the Brazilian mayor elections with two, three, and four candidates."

https://openalex.org/W2030872041,"GLP-1 has a variety of anti-diabetic effects. However, native GLP-1 is not suitable for therapy of diabetes due to its short half-life (t1/2<2 min). To circumvent this, we developed a long-lasting GLP-1 receptor agonist by the fusion of GLP-1 with human IgG2 Fc (GLP-1/hIgG2). ELISA-based receptor binding assay demonstrated that GLP-1/hIgG2 had high binding affinity to the GLP-1R in INS-1 cells (Kd = 13.90±1.52 nM). Upon binding, GLP-1/hIgG2 was rapidly internalized by INS-1 cells in a dynamin-dependent manner. Insulin RIA showed that GLP-1/IgG2 dose-dependently stimulated insulin secretion from INS-1 cells. Pharmacokinetic studies in CD1 mice showed that with intraperitoneal injection (i.p.), the GLP-1/hIgG2 peaked at 30 minutes in circulation and maintained a plateau for >168 h. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) in mice showed that GLP-1/hIgG2 significantly decreased glucose excursion. Furthermore, IPGTT performed on mice one week after a single drug-injection also displayed significantly reduced glucose excursion, indicating that GLP-1/hIgG2 fusion protein has long-lasting effects on the modulation of glucose homeostasis. GLP-1/hIgG2 was found to be effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes in multiple-low-dose streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes in mice. Together, the long-lasting bioactive GLP-1/hIgG2 retains native GLP-1 activities and thus may serve as a potent GLP-1 receptor agonist."
https://openalex.org/W2030088047,"Background Apoptotic cascades may frequently be impaired in tumor cells; therefore, the approaches to circumvent these obstacles emerge as important therapeutic modalities. Methodology/Principal Findings Our novel derivatives of chlorin e6, that is, its amide (compound 2) and boronated amide (compound 5) evoked no dark toxicity and demonstrated a significantly higher photosensitizing efficacy than chlorin e6 against transplanted aggressive tumors such as B16 melanoma and M-1 sarcoma. Compound 5 showed superior therapeutic potency. Illumination with red light of mammalian tumor cells loaded with 0.1 µM of 5 caused rapid (within the initial minutes) necrosis as determined by propidium iodide staining. The laser confocal microscopy-assisted analysis of cell death revealed the following order of events: prior to illumination, 5 accumulated in Golgi cysternae, endoplasmic reticulum and in some (but not all) lysosomes. In response to light, the reactive oxygen species burst was concomitant with the drop of mitochondrial transmembrane electric potential, the dramatic changes of mitochondrial shape and the loss of integrity of mitochondria and lysosomes. Within 3–4 min post illumination, the plasma membrane became permeable for propidium iodide. Compounds 2 and 5 were one order of magnitude more potent than chlorin e6 in photodamage of artificial liposomes monitored in a dye release assay. The latter effect depended on the content of non-saturated lipids; in liposomes consisting of saturated lipids no photodamage was detectable. The increased therapeutic efficacy of 5 compared with 2 was attributed to a striking difference in the ability of these photosensitizers to permeate through hydrophobic membrane interior as evidenced by measurements of voltage jump-induced relaxation of transmembrane current on planar lipid bilayers. Conclusions/Significance The multimembrane photodestruction and cell necrosis induced by photoactivation of 2 and 5 are directly associated with membrane permeabilization caused by lipid photodamage."

https://openalex.org/W1980970302,"Background The effects on cell signalling networks upon blockade of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) using the monoclonal antibody tremelimumab were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with metastatic melanoma. Methodology/Principal Findings Intracellular flow cytometry was used to detect phosphorylated (p) signaling molecules downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) and cytokine receptors. PBMC from tremelimumab-treated patients were characterized by increase in pp38, pSTAT1 and pSTAT3, and decrease in pLck, pERK1/2 and pSTAT5 levels. These changes were noted in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes but also in CD14 monocytes. A divergent pattern of phosphorylation of Zap70, LAT, Akt and STAT6 was noted in patients with or without an objective tumor response. Conclusions/Significance The administration of the CTLA4-blocking antibody tremelimumab to patients with metastatic melanoma influences signaling networks downstream of the TCR and cytokine receptors both in T cells and monocytes. The strong modulation of signaling networks in monocytes suggests that this cell subset may be involved in clinical responses to CTLA4 blockade.

https://openalex.org/W2161425859,"There is striking social variation in the timing of the onset of childbearing in contemporary England, with the mean age at first motherhood about 8 years earlier in the most deprived compared to the least deprived neighbourhoods. However, relatively little is known about how these social differences in reproductive schedule develop in childhood.We studied the development of differences in reproductive schedules, using a cross-sectional survey over 1000 school students aged 9-15 in the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside. Students from more deprived neighbourhoods had earlier ideal ages for parenthood than those from more affluent ones, and these differences were fully apparent by age 11. We found evidence consistent with three mechanisms playing a role in maintaining the socioeconomic gradient. These were: vertical intergenerational transmission (students whose own parents were younger at their birth wanted children younger); oblique intergenerational transmission (students in neighbourhoods where parents were younger in general wanted children earlier); and low parental investment (students who did not feel emotionally supported by their own parents wanted children at a younger age).Our results shed some light on the proximate factors which may be involved in maintaining early childbearing in disadvantaged communities. They help understand why educational initiatives aimed at adolescents tend to have no effect, whereas improving the well-being of poor families with young children may do so. Our results also suggest that there will be considerable intergenerational inertia in the response of reproductive schedules to changing socioecological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2093857726,"Background Proteolytic degradation by plasmin and metalloproteinases is essential for epidermal regeneration in skin wound healing. Plasminogen deficient mice have severely delayed wound closure as have mice simultaneously lacking the two plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). In contrast, individual genetic deficiencies in either uPA or tPA lead to wound healing kinetics with no or only slightly delayed closure of skin wounds. Methodology/Principal Findings To evaluate the therapeutic potential in vivo of a murine neutralizing antibody directed against mouse uPA we investigated the efficacy in skin wound healing of tPA-deficient mice. Systemic administration of the anti-mouse uPA monoclonal antibody, mU1, to tPA-deficient mice caused a dose-dependent delay of skin wound closure almost similar to the delayed kinetics observed in uPA;tPA double-deficient mice. Analysis of wound extracts showed diminished levels of plasmin in the mU1-treated tPA-deficent mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrin accumulated in the wounds of such mU1-treated tPA-deficent mice and that keratinocyte tongues were aberrant. Together these abnormalities lead to compromised epidermal closure. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of uPA activity with a monoclonal antibody in adult tPA-deficient mice mimics the effect of simultaneous genetic ablation of uPA and tPA. Thus, application of the murine inhibitory mU1 antibody provides a new and highly versatile tool to interfere with uPA-activity in vivo in mouse models of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2053233371,"Sialyltransferases are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of sialoglycoconjugates that catalyze the transfer of sialic residue from its activated form to an oligosaccharidic acceptor. β-Galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferases ST6Gal I and ST6Gal II are the two unique members of the ST6Gal family described in higher vertebrates. The availability of genome sequences enabled the identification of more distantly related invertebrates' st6gal gene sequences and allowed us to propose a scenario of their evolution. Using a phylogenomic approach, we present further evidence of an accelerated evolution of the st6gal1 genes both in their genomic regulatory sequences and in their coding sequence in reptiles, birds, and mammals known as amniotes, whereas st6gal2 genes conserve an ancestral profile of expression throughout vertebrate evolution."

The Unc93b1 protein has been reported to facilitate localization of TLR7 and 9 and is required for TLR3, -7, and -9 signaling. We demonstrate that siRNA knockdown of Unc93b1 reduced the abundance of TLR3 on the cell surface without altering total TLR3 accumulation. In addition, siRNA to Unc93b1 reduced the secretion of the TLR3 ectodomain (T3ECD) into the cell medium. Furthermore, two human single nucleotide polymorphisms that affected herpesvirus and influenza virus encephalopathy as well as a natural isoform generated by alternative splicing were found to be impaired for T3ECD secretion and decreased the abundance of TLR3 on the cell surface. The locations of the SNP P554S and the deletion in the isoform led to the identification of a loop in the TLR3 ectodomain that is required for secretion and a second whose presence decreased secretion. Finally, a truncated protein containing the N-terminal 10 leucine-rich repeats of T3ECD was sufficient for secretion in an Unc93b1-dependent manner.

There are more than 10 known human TLRs that collectively recognize a remarkable variety of ligands (1Kumar H. Kawai T. Akira S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

TLR3, -7, -8, and -9 recognize nucleic acids in endolysosomal compartments, whereas TLR1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 mainly recognize bacterial products and are located primarily on the cell surface (2Barton G.M.

TLR3 binds viral double-stranded (ds) RNAs and dsRNA mimics such as poly(I:C), annealed homopolymers of inosinic acid and cytidylic acid. Like other TLRs, TLR3 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a large N-terminal ectodomain (ECD) for ligand binding, a single transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The TLR3 ectodomain (T3ECD) consists of 23 conserved leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) capped at the termini by cysteine-rich motifs (5Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M.

How TLR3 subcellular localization relates to function is not well understood. TLR7 and TLR9 are recruited from endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi to lysosomes upon ligand stimulation in a process that also involves proteolysis (24Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat.

Herein we documented that T3ECD secretion correlates with the presence of full-length TLR3 on the cell surface and that Unc93b1 is required for secretion as well as affect the cell surface localization of wild-type (WT) TLR3. SNPs associated with human disease susceptibilities decreased T3ECD secretion and the abundance of cell surface-associated TLR3. Interestingly, Loop 1 was found to act to inhibit T3ECD secretion, whereas changes in Loop 2 decreased secretion. The WT TLR3 plasmid was previously described in Sun et al. (8Sun J. Duffy K.E. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J. Masarapu H. Cunningham M. Holzenburg A. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C. J. Biol.

Plasmids containing SNPs were made by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the all constructs containing changes from the WT sequence were determined to ascertain that unintended mutations were not introduced. All primers used are shown in supplemental Table 1. T3ECD was expressed from the pBeth-TLR3ECD-His6 plasmid (8Sun J. Duffy K.E. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J. Masarapu H.

Briefly, cDNA from TLR3 residues 1–703 to which a C-terminal V5 epitope and a His6 tag was appended to a herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter in a vector containing the pcDNA3.1 backbone to generate pBeth-TLR3ECD. T3ECDΔL1 was subcloned into the same vector from TLR3ΔL1. N-L10, N-L11, and N-L12 containing TLR3 residues 1–297, 1–322, and 1–355, respectively, were fused to the sequence coding for residues 660–704 and 6 histidine codons derived from the pBeth-TLR3 plasmid. These three plasmids were made in two steps. First, an XhoI site was created as a silent mutation in codon 694 in pBeth-TLR3ECD to result in pBeth-TLR3ECDx. Fragments encoding N-L10, N-L11, and N-L12 were generated by PCR from T3ECD to contain flanking HindIII and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The DNA fragments treated with these restriction enzymes were ligated to an acceptor plasmid derived from pBeth-TLR3ECDx and linearized with a HindIII and XhoI restriction digestion. The sequence from 5′ of the TLR3 cDNA to codon 660 was replaced in this manipulation. Plasmid N-L12Δ1 was cloned by the same strategy except that T3ECDΔL1 was used as the template to generate the PCR fragment. Plasmids expressing N-L10 + 12 and N-L10 + 12ΔL1 were made by chemical synthesis of the two DNA strands that can encode LRR12 or LRR12 lacking the Δ1 loop sequence that were then digested with XhoI before its ligation to the C terminus of LRR10. The TLR3 isoform (TLR3Δ64) was recreated by annealing chemically synthesized DNA molecules designed to remove the sequence missing in Δ64 and extending from the primers using PfuI. The resulting DNA was the digested with flanking restriction sites and ligated in the backbone generated from pBeth-TLR3. pCMV6-Entry-Unc93b1-Myc-FLAG was from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). Unc93B1 ΔN36 was PCR-amplified using PCR and cloned into the same vector. HEK293T cells were plated in CoStar white 96-well plates in DMEM amended with 10% FBS at 4.4 × 104 cells per well and transfected at ∼85–90% confluency with a mixture of the Lipofectamine 2000 and plasmids pNiFty-Luc, pUNO-huTLR3, or TLR3 mutations and phRL-TK as described in Sun et al.

For assays using IFN-β-Luc or ISRE-luc reporters, the respective plasmids were substituted for pNifty-luc. The transfected cells were induced 18–22 h later by the addition of poly(I:C) to the culture medium to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. The cells harvested for analysis of luciferase 18–20 h after poly(I:C) addition. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were seeded at 1.0 × 105 cells/well in DMEM amended with 10% FBS in a 48-well tissue culture plate or 4.4 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. 6 h later the cells were transfected with siRNA specific to Unc93b1 (Darmacon, Inc.) or ST3GAL4 (Ambion, siRNA ID: s12852) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 24 h before transfection to express TLR3 or TLR3 derivatives. If the cells were examined for TLR3 activation of reporter expression, they were also transfected with the luciferase and Renilla luciferase plasmids as described above. HEK 293T cells and P2.1 cells were plated in 48-well plates in DMEM amended with 10% FBS at 1 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 50 ng of plasmid pUNO-TLR3, pBeth-TLR3ECD, or various plasmids derived from pBeth-TLR3ECD using Lipofectamine 2000. The medium was removed 24 h later and replaced with 150 μl of DMEM medium. The media were harvested after another 24 h, and cells were lysed with the passive lysis buffer (Promega) and sonicated to degrade chromosomal DNA, then subjected to Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of proteins from the culture medium or cell lysate were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) for probing with the anti-TLR3 antibody (R&D systems, catalog #AF1487). The anti-human Unc93b1 antibody was from Sigma (catalog #AV49979). Monoclonal anti-FLAG® M2 peroxidase (HRP) antibody was from Sigma (catalog #A8592). The blots were developed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an ECL-plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown in 6-well collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) at 2 × 106 cells/well. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of the appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Staining of cell surface-associated TLR3 used cells harvested 24 h after transfection and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 3% fetal bovine serum, 0.04% sodium azide) before suspension at 2.0 × 107 cells/ml in FACS buffer. The cells were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human TLR3 mAb (clone TLR3.7 or a negative control mouse IgG1 control antibody (eBioscience) and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark. The cells were washed twice with FACS buffer to remove unbound antibody and then resuspended in FACS buffer. Viaprobe (BD Biosciences) was added to the cultures to exclude dead cells. The samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). Poly(A)-selected mRNAs extracted from actively growing human astrocytes (NHA) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were used for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription and PCR. The primers used are shown in supplemental Table S1. The cDNA product with and without the Δ64 deletion should be ∼700 and 500 base pairs. These were excised from an agarose gel, purified, and subcloned into Invitrogen TOPO pCR4 vector for DNA sequencing. We seek to better understand TLR3 localization in cells and how localization could affect TLR3 function and diseases that could result from improper function. Unc93b1 is likely involved in TLR3 localization as it is required for TLR7 and TLR9 trafficking and the function of TLR3 (31Kim Y.M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.E. Ploegh H.L.

We first attempted to confirm that Unc93b1 contributes to TLR3-dependent signaling in a previously validated reporter assay (8Sun J. Duffy K.E. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with three plasmids, one to express TLR3, a second to constitutively express Renilla luciferase, and a third that can express a firefly luciferase reporter under the control of the ISRE promoter. In the presence of poly(I:C), TLR3 will activate signaling leading to an increase in the firefly luciferase activity. The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activities of the poly(I:C)-induced and mock-induced samples is plotted as -fold induction. The cells to assay TLR3 were also transfected with siRNA specific to Unc93B1 or a control siRNA targeting the sialyltransferase ST3GAL4. The siRNA to Unc93b1 reduced TLR3-dependent expression of the reporters to approximately a third of that of the untreated sample. The control siRNA did not have a comparable effect (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, neither siRNA affected TLR4 signaling with lipopolysaccharide as the agonist (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that Unc93b1 can affect TLR3 signaling in HEK293T cells. Furthermore, the siRNA to Unc93b1 did reduce the level of the Unc93b1 protein detected by Western blot analysis, and there were no obvious effects on the morphology of the cells in all siRNAs tested (Fig. 1C and data not shown). To examine whether Unc93b1 can affect TLR3 localization, HEK293T cells expressing TLR3 were transfected with the Unc93b1-specific or the control siRNA and FACS was used to quantify the amount of TLR3 on the surface of intact cells. An aliquot of the cells were permeabilized with detergent, and the total TLR3 was also quantified. HEK293T cells do not express endogenous TLR3, and transfection to express WT TLR3 resulted in ∼18% of the cells exhibiting TLR3 on the cell surface. Cell surface-associated TLR3 was reduced by the siRNA to Unc93b1 to a mean value of 13.4% in six independent samples (Fig. 1D). Given that the cells were transfected with the siRNAs, the observed reduction of TLR3 on the cell surface likely underestimates the potential effect of the Unc93b1 siRNA. Furthermore, the total amount of TLR3-positive cells in the permeabilized samples was not significantly different in the cells knocked down for Unc93b1 or treated with a nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 1D). Finally, a Western blot detecting TLR3 confirmed the FACS analysis that the siRNA to Unc93b1 does not affect the overall level of TLR3 (supplemental Fig. S1). All of these results demonstrate that Unc93b1 is involved in the localization of TLR3 to the cell surface. We seek to determine whether Unc93b1 can affect the secretion of the TLR3 ectodomain. The effects of the siRNA to Unc93b1 or the control siRNA were examined in HEK293T cells that could secrete T3ECD into the medium. T3ECD secretion was reduced by siRNA to Unc93b1 in a manner dependent on the siRNA concentration (Fig. 2A). The control siRNA did not have this effect. Furthermore, knocking down Unc93b1 did not affect the secretion of matrix metallopeptidase-28 (MMP-28) (Fig. 2B) (35Rodgers U.R. Kevorkian L. Surridge A.K. Waters J.G. Swingler T.E. Culley K. Illman S. Lohi J. Parker A.E. Clark I.M. Matrix Biol. 2009; 28: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, we expressed recombinant Unc93b1 in HEK293T cells from a plasmid and observed that T3ECD secretion was not significantly affected, likely because the endogenous Unc93b1 was sufficient for T3ECD secretion. However, expressing a version of Unc93b1 lacking the first 36 residues (ΔN36) reduced T3ECD secretion and increased the level of T3ECD in the cell-associated materials (Fig. 2C). Δ36 was previously reported to down-regulate TLR9 trafficking and up-regulate TLR7 trafficking (36Fukui R. Saitoh S. Matsumoto F. Kozuka-Hata H. Oyama M. Tabeta K. Beutler B. Miyake K. J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 1339-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Altogether, the effects on the localization of TLR3 and T3ECD correspond to the altered Unc93b1 expression profiles showing that Unc93b1 is important in TLR3 localization. Furthermore, the secretion of T3ECD should provide a useful assay to examine the requirements for TLR3 cell surface localization. Post-translational modifications including glycosylation should be prerequisite to the secretion of T3ECD. In fact, the T3ECD secreted in the medium, and that remained in the cell had distinct electrophoretic mobilities when they were combined and electrophoresed in the same lane (Fig. 3A). Residue Asn-413 was shown to be glycosylated in T3ECD (5Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast, the H539E substitution, which affected ligand binding by T3ECD and abolished TLR3-dependent activation of reporters (6Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A.

https://openalex.org/W2010347687,"Computational methods have been used to find duplicate biomedical publications in MEDLINE. Full text articles are becoming increasingly available, yet the similarities among them have not been systematically studied. Here, we quantitatively investigated the full text similarity of biomedical publications in PubMed Central.72,011 full text articles from PubMed Central (PMC) were parsed to generate three different datasets: full texts, sections, and paragraphs. Text similarity comparisons were performed on these datasets using the text similarity algorithm eTBLAST. We measured the frequency of similar text pairs and compared it among different datasets. We found that high abstract similarity can be used to predict high full text similarity with a specificity of 20.1% (95% CI [17.3%, 23.1%]) and sensitivity of 99.999%. Abstract similarity and full text similarity have a moderate correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.423) when the similarity ratio is above 0.4. Among pairs of articles in PMC, method sections are found to be the most repetitive (frequency of similar pairs, methods: 0.029, introduction: 0.0076, results: 0.0043). In contrast, among a set of manually verified duplicate articles, results are the most repetitive sections (frequency of similar pairs, results: 0.94, methods: 0.89, introduction: 0.82). Repetition of introduction and methods sections is more likely to be committed by the same authors (odds of a highly similar pair having at least one shared author, introduction: 2.31, methods: 1.83, results: 1.03). There is also significantly more similarity in pairs of review articles than in pairs containing one review and one nonreview paper (frequency of similar pairs: 0.0167 and 0.0023, respectively).While quantifying abstract similarity is an effective approach for finding duplicate citations, a comprehensive full text analysis is necessary to uncover all potential duplicate citations in the scientific literature and is helpful when establishing ethical guidelines for scientific publications."
https://openalex.org/W1990232757,"Queen conch (Strombus gigas) reproduction is inhibited in nearshore areas of the Florida Keys, relative to the offshore environment where conchs reproduce successfully. Nearshore reproductive failure is possibly a result of exposure to environmental factors, including heavy metals, which are likely to accumulate close to shore. Metals such as Cu and Zn are detrimental to reproduction in many mollusks.Histology shows gonadal atrophy in nearshore conchs as compared to reproductively healthy offshore conchs. In order to determine molecular mechanisms leading to tissue changes and reproductive failure, a microarray was developed. A normalized cDNA library for queen conch was constructed and sequenced using the 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX pyrosequencer, producing 27,723 assembled contigs and 7,740 annotated transcript sequences. The resulting sequences were used to design the microarray. Microarray analysis of conch testis indicated differential regulation of 255 genes (p<0.01) in nearshore conch, relative to offshore. Changes in expression for three of four transcripts of interest were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated changes in biological processes: respiratory chain (GO:0015992), spermatogenesis (GO:0007283), small GTPase-mediated signal transduction (GO:0007264), and others. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that Zn and possibly Cu were elevated in some nearshore conch tissues.Congruence between testis histology and microarray data suggests that nearshore conch testes regress during the reproductive season, while offshore conch testes develop normally. Possible mechanisms underlying the testis regression observed in queen conch in the nearshore Florida Keys include a disruption of small GTPase (Ras)-mediated signaling in testis development. Additionally, elevated tissue levels of Cu (34.77 ng/mg in testis) and Zn (831.85 ng/mg in digestive gland, 83.96 ng/mg in testis) nearshore are similar to reported levels resulting in reproductive inhibition in other gastropods, indicating that these metals possibly contribute to NS conch reproductive failure."
https://openalex.org/W2030593840,"Nitrogen starvation-mediated reduction of Ypk1 is suggested to suppress translational initiation, possibly in parallel with the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates Ypk1 in nitrogen-starved cells is poorly understood. Here we report that Ypk1 is a novel selective substrate for nitrogen starvation-triggered proteolysis requiring autophagy system. Among various nutrient starvation methods used to elicit autophagy, rapid Ypk1 degradation was specific to nitrogen starvation. In screening genes required for such nitrogen starvation-specific vacuolar proteolysis, we found that autophagy-related degradation of Ypk1 depended on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, which is conventionally thought to function in endosomal trafficking. In microscopic analyses, the disruption of ESCRT subunits resulted in the accumulation of both Ypk1 and autophagosomal Atg8 at a perivacuolar site that was distinct from conventional endosomes. ESCRT machinery was not involved in autophagic flux induced by the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, thus suggesting that ESCRT represents an exclusive mechanism of nitrogen starvation-specific proteolysis of Ypk1. Overall, we propose a novel regulation of Ypk1 that is specific to nitrogen limitation."
https://openalex.org/W2163960969,"Vascular fibrinolytic balance is maintained primarily by interplay of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). Previous research has shown that polymorphisms in genes from the renin-angiotensin (RA), bradykinin, and fibrinolytic systems affect plasma concentrations of both t-PA and PAI-1 through a set of gene-gene interactions. In the present study, we extend this finding by exploring the effects of polymorphisms in genes from these systems on incident cardiovascular disease, explicitly examining two-way interactions in a large population-based study.Data from the population-based PREVEND study in Groningen, The Netherlands (n = 8,138) were analyzed. The effects of the polymorphisms and their interactions on cardiovascular events were analyzed via Cox proportional hazards models. There was no association between five of the six polymorphisms singly and risk of cardiovascular disease. There was a significant main effect for the ACE I/D polymorphism for both dominant and additive coding schemes. There were significant interactions between the following polymorphism pairs even after adjustment for known risk factors: ACE I/D & PAI-1 4G/5G (p = 0.012), BDKRB2 C181T & ACE I/D (p = 0.016), BDKRB2 C58T & ACE I/D (p = 0.025), BDKRB2 exon 1 I/D & AT1R A1166C (p = 0.017), and BDKRB2 C58T & AT1R A1166C (p = 0.015).This study suggests possible interactions between genes from the RA, bradykinin, and fibrinolytic systems on the risk of cardiovascular disease, extending previous research that has demonstrated that interactions among genes from these systems influence plasma concentrations of both t-PA and PAI-1. Further explorations of these interactions are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1986059001,"Wnt proteins are secreted proteins involved in a number of developmental processes including neural development and synaptogenesis. We sought to determine the role of the Drosophila Wnt7b ortholog, Wnt2, using the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Mutations in wnt2 produce an increase in the number of presynaptic branches and a reduction in immunolabeling of the active zone proteins, Bruchpilot and synaptobrevin, at the NMJ. There was no change, however, in immunolabeling for the presynaptic proteins cysteine-string protein (CSP) and synaptotagmin, nor the postsynaptic proteins GluRIIA and DLG at the NMJ. Consistent with the presynaptic defects, wnt2 mutants exhibit approximately a 50% reduction in evoked excitatory junctional currents. Rescue, RNAi, and tissue-specific qRT-PCR experiments indicate that Wnt2 is expressed by the postsynaptic cell where it may serve as a retrograde signal that regulates presynaptic morphology and the localization of presynaptic proteins."
