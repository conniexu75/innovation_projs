https://openalex.org/W3157290391,"In the present study we examined the effect of nanogypsum and Pseudomonas taiwanensis strain BCRC 17751on plant and soil health using conventional and metagenomics approaches. Soil physicochemical properties and agronomical parameters of maize plants were reported to be better when applied with nanogypsum and bacterial inoculum together. When compared to control a significant increase in total bacterial counts, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK) solubilizing bacterial population and soil enzyme activities (fluorescein diacetate, alkaline phosphatase, dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, arylesterase and amylase) was reported in treatments. The metagenomics studies revealed dominance of beneficial bacteria such as Proteobacteria , Bacteriodetes , Planctomycetes , Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae in treated soil. On the other hand some novel bacterial diversity was also reported in treated soil which was evident from presence of taxonomically unclassified sequences. Hence, it can be concluded that combined application of nanogypsum and Pseudomonas taiwanensis in maize help in improving the structure and function of soil which affects the plant health without causing any toxic effect. However, in situ validation of the prescribed treatment is required under field conditions on different crops in order to give maximum benefits to the farmers and the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3157462660,"Laminar fMRI at ultra-high magnetic field strength is typically carried out using the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) contrast. Despite its unrivalled sensitivity to detecting activation, the BOLD contrast is limited in its spatial specificity due to signals stemming from intra-cortical ascending and pial veins. Alternatively, regional changes in perfusion (i.e., cerebral blood flow through tissue) are colocalised to neuronal activation, which can be non-invasively measured using Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) MRI. In addition, ASL provides a quantitative marker of neuronal activation in terms of perfusion signal, which is simultaneously acquired along with the BOLD signal. However, ASL for laminar imaging is challenging due to the lower SNR of the perfusion signal and higher RF power deposition i.e., specific absorption rate (SAR) of ASL sequences. In the present study, we present for the first time in humans, isotropic sub-millimetre spatial resolution functional perfusion images using Flow-sensitive Alternating Inversion Recovery (FAIR) ASL with a 3D-EPI readout at 7 T. We show that robust statistical activation maps can be obtained with perfusion-weighting in a single session. We observed the characteristic BOLD amplitude increase towards the superficial laminae, and, in apparent discrepancy, the relative perfusion profile shows a decrease of the amplitude and the absolute perfusion profile a much smaller increase towards the cortical surface. Considering the draining vein effect on the BOLD signal using model-based spatial “convolution”, we show that the empirically measured perfusion and BOLD profiles are, in fact, consistent with each other. This study demonstrates that laminar perfusion fMRI in humans is feasible at 7 T and that caution must be exercised when interpreting BOLD signal laminar profiles as direct representation of the cortical distribution of neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W3158914246,"Background Multimorbidity is increasing among older adults, but the impact of these recent trends on the extent and complexity of polypharmacy and possible variation by sex remains unknown. We examined sex differences in multimorbidity, polypharmacy (5+ medications) and hyper-polypharmacy (10+ medications) in 2003 vs 2016, and the interactive associations between age, multimorbidity level, and time on polypharmacy measures. Methods and findings We employed a repeated cross-sectional study design with linked health administrative databases for all persons aged ≥66 years eligible for health insurance in Ontario, Canada at the two index dates. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted; models included interaction terms between age, multimorbidity level, and time period to estimate polypharmacy and hyper-polypharmacy probabilities, risk differences and risk ratios for 2016 vs 2003. Multimorbidity, polypharmacy and hyper-polypharmacy increased significantly over the 13 years. At both index dates prevalence estimates for all three were higher in women, but a greater absolute increase in polypharmacy over time was observed in men (6.6% [from 55.7% to 62.3%] vs 0.9% [64.2%-65.1%] for women) though absolute increases in multimorbidity were similar for men and women (6.9% [72.5%-79.4%] vs 6.2% [75.9%-82.1%], respectively). Model findings showed that polypharmacy decreased over time among women aged &lt; 90 years (especially for younger ages and those with fewer conditions), whereas it increased among men at all ages and multimorbidity levels (with larger absolute increases typically at older ages and among those with 4 or fewer conditions). Conclusions There are sex and age differences in the impact of increasing chronic disease burden on changes in measures of multiple medication use among older adults. Though the drivers and health consequences of these trends warrant further investigation, the findings support the heterogeneity and complexity in the evolving association between multimorbidity and polypharmacy measures in older populations."
https://openalex.org/W3083828561,"Fall-risk classification is a challenging but necessary task to enable the recommendation of preventative programs for individuals identified at risk for falling. Existing research has primarily focused on older adults, with no predictive fall-risk models for lower limb amputees, despite their greater likelihood of fall-risk than older adults. In this study, 89 amputees with varying degrees of lower limb amputation were asked if they had fallen in the past 6 months. Those who reported at least one fall were considered a fall risk. Each participant performed a 6 minute walk test (6MWT) with an Android smartphone placed in a holder located on the back of the pelvis. A fall-risk classification method was developed using data from sensors within the smartphone. The Ottawa Hospital Rehabilitation Center Walk Test app captured accelerometer and gyroscope data during the 6MWT. From this data, foot strikes were identified, and 248 features were extracted from the collection of steps. Steps were segmented into turn and straight walking, and four different data sets were created: turn steps, straightaway steps, straightaway and turn steps, and all steps. From these, three feature selection techniques (correlation-based feature selection, relief F, and extra trees classifier ensemble) were used to eliminate redundant or ineffective features. Each feature subset was tested with a random forest classifier and optimized for the best number of trees. The best model used turn data, with three features selected by Correlation-based feature selection (CFS), and used 500 trees in a random forest classifier. The resulting metrics were 81.3% accuracy, 57.2% sensitivity, 94.9% specificity, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.587, and an F1 score of 0.83. Since the outcomes are comparable to metrics achieved by existing clinical tests, the classifier may be viable for use in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3157893249,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a critical membrane transporter in the blood brain barrier (BBB) and is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, previous studies on the ability of P-gp to directly transport the Alzheimer’s associated amyloid-β (Aβ) protein have produced contradictory results. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transport substrate accumulation studies in cell culture, and biochemical activity assays to show that P-gp actively transports Aβ. We observed transport of Aβ40 and Aβ42 monomers by P-gp in explicit MD simulations of a putative catalytic cycle. In in vitro assays with P-gp overexpressing cells, we observed enhanced accumulation of fluorescently labeled Aβ42 in the presence of Tariquidar, a potent P-gp inhibitor. We also showed that Aβ42 stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity of isolated P-gp in nanodiscs. Our findings expand the substrate profile of P-gp, and suggest that P-gp may contribute to the onset and progression of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3159574360,"Sleep is a fundamental biological process that all humans exhibit, and there is much evidence that people suffer adverse health outcomes from insufficient sleep. Despite this evidence, much research demonstrates significant heterogeneity in the amounts that people sleep across cultures. This suggests that despite serving fundamental biological functions, sleep is also subject to cultural influence. Using self-report and actigraphy data we examined sleep among European Canadian, Asian Canadian, and Japanese university students. Significant cultural differences emerged in terms of various parameters of sleep (e.g. sleep time), and beliefs about sleep (e.g. perceived relation between sleep and health). Despite sleeping significantly less than European Canadians, Japanese participants slept less efficiently, yet reported being less tired and having better health. Moreover, relative to European Canadians, Japanese participants perceived a weaker relation between sleep and physical health, and had a significantly shorter ideal amount of sleep. Asian Canadians’ sleep behaviors and attitudes were largely similar to European Canadians suggesting that people acculturate to local cultural sleep norms."
https://openalex.org/W3158344741,"Purpose We sought to describe the association between serum chloride levels and mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed adult patients admitted to our CICU from 2007 to 2015. The association of dyschloremia and hospital mortality was assessed in a multiple variable model including additional confounders, and the association of dyschloremia and post-discharge mortality were assessed using Cox proportional-hazards analysis. Results 9,426 patients with a mean age of 67±15 years (37% females) were included. Admission hypochloremia was present in 1,384 (15%) patients, and hyperchloremia was present in 1,606 (17%) patients. There was a U-shaped relationship between admission chloride and unadjusted hospital mortality, with increased hospital mortality among patients with hypochloremia (unadjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.5–3.6, p&lt;0.001) or hyperchloremia (unadjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6–2.3, p&lt;0.001). After multivariate adjustment, hypochloremia remained associated with higher hospital mortality (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6–2.9, p &lt;0.001). Post-discharge mortality among hospital survivors was higher among patients with admission hypochloremia (adjusted HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.6; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Abnormal serum chloride on admission to the CICU is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, with hypochloremia being a strong independent predictor."
https://openalex.org/W3159900224,"Sand management is essential for enhancing the production in oil and gas reservoirs. The critical total drawdown (CTD) is used as a reliable indicator of the onset of sand production; hence, its accurate prediction is very important. There are many published CTD prediction correlations in literature. However, the accuracy of most of these models is questionable. Therefore, further improvement in CTD prediction is needed for more effective and successful sand control. This article presents a robust and accurate fuzzy logic (FL) model for predicting the CTD. Literature on 23 wells of the North Adriatic Sea was used to develop the model. The used data were split into 70% training sets and 30% testing sets. Trend analysis was conducted to verify that the developed model follows the correct physical behavior trends of the input parameters. Some statistical analyses were performed to check the model’s reliability and accuracy as compared to the published correlations. The results demonstrated that the proposed FL model substantially outperforms the current published correlations and shows higher prediction accuracy. These results were verified using the highest correlation coefficient, the lowest average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE), the lowest maximum error (max. AAPRE), the lowest standard deviation (SD), and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE). Results showed that the lowest AAPRE is 8.6%, whereas the highest correlation coefficient is 0.9947. These values of AAPRE (&lt;10%) indicate that the FL model could predicts the CTD more accurately than other published models (&gt;20% AAPRE). Moreover, further analysis indicated the robustness of the FL model, because it follows the trends of all physical parameters affecting the CTD."
https://openalex.org/W3159903400,"Introduction Neural tube defects affect the brain and the spinal cord of the developing embryo. The defects occur due to incomplete or failure of closure of the neural tube. The condition eventually causes death and lifelong disability. Worldwide, more than 300,000 babies are born with neural tube defects each year. The highest burden is in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, this study aims to identify the risk factors associated with neural tube defects among mothers who gave birth in North Shoa Zone Hospitals. Methods A hospital based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 243 (81 cases and 162 controls) study participants in North Shoa Zone Hospitals. The hospitals were selected using simple random sampling and all cases and randomly selected controls in the selected hospitals were included in the study. The data were collected by using pre-tested structured questionnaire. Results Different factors were identified to have association with neural tube defect. Family annual cash income less than 24000ETB (AOR: 3.73, 95%CI: 1.35, 10.26), history of still birth (AOR: 3.63, 95%CI: 1.03, 12.2), history of abortion (AOR: 6.15, 95%CI: 2.63, 18.56), preconception tea use (AOR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.15, 4.86) and pesticides/chemical exposure (AOR: 5.34, 95%CI: 1.77, 16.05) were positively associated factors. In contrast, preconception care (AOR: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.05, 0.39) and taking iron/folic acid/multivitamin during the current pregnancy (AOR: 0.16, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.33) showed a protective effect. Conclusion Family annual income less than 24000ETB, history of still birth, history of abortion, preconception tea uses and pesticides/chemical exposure were associated factors of neural tube defects. Preconception counseling and screening should be recommended for women who plan for pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3157220043,"Due to limited description of the role and diversity of archaea in WWTPs, the aim of the study was to analyze microbial community structures and diversities with particular regard to Archaea in the samples taken from different stages of the full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant and effluent receiving water (upstream and downstream discharge point). Our study was focused on showing how the treatment processes influenced the Eubacteria and Archaea composition. Alpha and Beta diversity were used to evaluate the microbial diversity changes in the collected samples. Proteobacteria was the largest fraction ranging from 28% to 67% with 56% relative abundance across all samples. Archaea were present in all stages of WWTP ranged from 1 to 8%. Among the Archaea, two groups of methanogens, acetoclastic ( Methanosarcina , Methanosaeta ) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens ( Methanospirillium , Methanoculleus , Methanobrevibacter ) were dominant in the technological stages. The obtained results indicate that the treated wastewater did not significantly affect eubacterial and archaeal composition in receiving water. However, differences in richness, diversity and microbial composition of Eubacteria and Archaea between the wastewater samples taken from the primary and secondary treatment were observed."
https://openalex.org/W3157700507,"The pathogenesis of GC involves the complex networking of multiple signaling pathways; however, the detailed mechanisms of tumorigenesis of GC remains largely unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to explore novel diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for GC. In this study, the levels of hsa_circRNA_100269 in gastric cancer (GC) samples and cells were examined, and its effects on the biological functions of GC cells were elucidated. The levels of hsa_circRNA_100269 in specimens/cell lines were examined using RT-qPCR. Cell models with hsa_circRNA_100269 overexpression or knockdown were generated using lentiviral vectors. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay; cell migratory/invasive activity was evaluated using wound healing/Transwell assay. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry; expression of associated markers involved in cell apoptosis, EMT and the PI3K/Akt signaling were determined by RT-qPCR/immunoblotting. In vivo study was also performed using hsa_circRNA_100269 knockout mice. Our findings revealed downregulation of hsa_circRNA_100269 in GC tissues compared to non-cancerous control. Additionally, the levels of PI3K were remarkably elevated in GC tissues, where hsa_circRNA_100269 and PI3K was negatively correlated. Moreover, the expression of hsa_circRNA_100269 was associated with histology grade and occurrence of metastasis in GC patients. In addition, hsa_circRNA_100269 was downregulated in GC cells compared to normal gastric epithelial cells. Overexpressed hsa_circRNA_100269 notably inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of GC cells, whereas cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase was promoted and cell apoptosis was enhanced. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt signaling was involved in hsa_circRNA_100269-regulated GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and apoptosis. Knockdown of hsa_circRNA_100269 also remarkably induced tumor growth in mouse model. In summary, our findings indicated that the levels of hsa_circRNA_100269 were reduced in GC. Furthermore, hsa_circRNA_100269 could suppress the development of GC by inactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway. More importantly, hsa_circRNA_100269/PI3K/Akt axis may be a novel therapeutic candidate for GC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3158257678,"While antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to be a major public health problem in Pakistan, data regarding trends of resistance among pathogenic bacteria remains scarce, with few studies presenting long-term trends in AMR. This study was therefore designed to analyze long-term AMR trends at a national level in Pakistan. We report here results of a comprehensive analysis of resistance, among pathogens isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), between 2011 and 2015. Susceptibility data was obtained from a local laboratory with collection points all across Pakistan (Chughtai Laboratory). Resistance proportions to most commonly used antimicrobials were calculated for each pathogen over a period of five years. While Acinetobacter species demonstrated highest resistance rates to all tested antimicrobials, a sharp increase in carbapenem resistance was the most noticeable (50%-95%) between 2011–2015. Our results also highlight the presence of third and fourth generation cephalosporins resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in Pakistan. Interestingly, where rise in AMR was being observed in some major invasive pathogens, decreasing resistance trends were observed in Staphylococcus aureus , against commonly used antimicrobials. Overall pathogens isolated from blood and CSF between 2011–2015, showed an increase in resistance towards commonly used antimicrobials."
https://openalex.org/W3158527428,"Background Cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of HIV-related mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, however, screening for cryptococcal antigenemia has not been universally implemented. As a result, data concerning cryptococcal meningitis and antigenemia are sparse, and in Mozambique, the prevalence of both are unknown. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of routinely collected data from a point-of-care cryptococcal antigen screening program at a public hospital in Maputo, Mozambique. HIV-positive patients admitted to the emergency department underwent CD4 count testing; those with pre-defined abnormal vital signs or CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/μL received cryptococcal antigen testing and lumbar punctures if indicated. Patients with CM were admitted to the hospital and treated with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine; their 12-week outcomes were ascertained through review of medical records or telephone contact by program staff made in the routine course of service delivery. Results Among 1,795 patients screened for cryptococcal antigenemia between March 2018—March 2019, 134 (7.5%) were positive. Of patients with cryptococcal antigenemia, 96 (71.6%) were diagnosed with CM, representing 5.4% of all screened patients. Treatment outcomes were available for 87 CM patients: 24 patients (27.6%) died during induction treatment and 63 (72.4%) survived until discharge; of these, 38 (60.3%) remained in care, 9 (14.3%) died, and 16 (25.3%) were lost-to follow-up at 12 weeks. Conclusions We found a high prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia and meningitis among patients screened at an emergency department in Maputo, Mozambique. High mortality during and after induction therapy demonstrate missed opportunities for earlier detection of cryptococcal antigenemia, even as point-of-care screening and rapid assessment in an emergency room offer potential to improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3159186555,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of individuals needing hospital admission has sometimes exceeded the availability of hospital beds. Since hospitalization can have detrimental effects on older individuals, preference has been given to younger patients. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of hospitalization for elderly affected by COVID-19. We hypothesized that their mortality decreases when there is greater access to hospitals. Methods This study examined 1902 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to three large hospitals in Milan, Italy. Overall mortality data for Milan from the same period was retrieved. Based on emergency department (ED) data, both peak and off-peak phases were identified. The percentage of elderly patients admitted to EDs during these two phases were compared by calculating the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of the individuals younger than, versus older than, 80 years. Results The median age of the patients hospitalized during the peak phase was lower than the median age during the off-peak phase (64 vs. 75 years, respectively; p &lt;0.001). However, while the SMR for the younger patients was lower during the off-peak phase (1.98, 95% CI: 1.72–2.29 versus 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25–1.58, respectively), the SMR was similar between both phases for the elderly patients (2.28, 95% CI: 2.07–2.52 versus 2.48, 95% CI: 2.32–2.65, respectively). Conclusions Greater access to hospitals during an off-peak phase did not affect the mortality rate of COVID-19-positive elderly patients in Milan. This finding, if confirmed in other settings, should influence future decisions regarding resource management of health care organizations."
https://openalex.org/W3159928349,"The hypothesis of a general psychopathology factor that underpins all common forms of mental disorders has been gaining momentum in contemporary clinical research and is known as the p factor hypothesis. Recently, a semiotic, embodied, and psychoanalytic conceptualisation of the p factor has been proposed called the Harmonium Model, which provides a computational account of such a construct. This research tested the core tenet of the Harmonium model, which is the idea that psychopathology can be conceptualised as due to poorly-modulable cognitive processes, and modelled the concept of Phase Space of Meaning (PSM) at the computational level.Two studies were performed, both based on a simulation design implementing a deep learning model, simulating a cognitive process: a classification task. The level of performance of the task was considered the simulated equivalent to the normality-psychopathology continuum, the dimensionality of the neural network's internal computational dynamics being the simulated equivalent of the PSM's dimensionality.The neural networks' level of performance was shown to be associated with the characteristics of the internal computational dynamics, assumed to be the simulated equivalent of poorly-modulable cognitive processes.Findings supported the hypothesis. They showed that the neural network's low performance was a matter of the combination of predicted characteristics of the neural networks' internal computational dynamics. Implications, limitations, and further research directions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3158085074,"The linden tree ( Tilia spp.) is a popular tree for landscaping and urban environments in central and northwest European countries, and it is one of the most popular in cities in Poland. Ectomycorrhizal fungi form a symbiosis with many urban tree species and protect the host plant from heavy metals and against salinity. The aim of this study was to characterise the ECM fungal community of urban linden trees along the tree damage gradient. The study was performed on two sites located in the centre of the city of Gdańsk, in northern Poland. The vitality assessment of urban linden trees was made according to Roloff’s classification. Tree damage classes were related to soil characteristics using principal component analysis. The five ectomycorrhizal fungal species were shared among all four tree damage classes, and Cenococcum geophilum was found to be the most abundant and frequent ectomycorrhizal fungal species in each class. Soil samples collected in the vicinity of trees belonging to the R0 class had significantly lower pH Na, Cl and Pb content than other soils. Our knowledge of ectomycorrhizal communities in urban areas is still limited, and these findings provide new insights into ectomycorrhizal distribution patterns in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3158165387,"Background Hospital readmissions place a major burden on patients and health care systems worldwide, but little is known about patterns and timing of readmissions in Germany. Methods We used German health insurance claims (AOK, 2011–2016) of patients ≥ 65 years hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), a composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or atrial fibrillation (S/AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or osteoporosis to identify hospital readmissions within 30 or 90 days. Readmissions were classified into all-cause, specific, and non-specific and their characteristics were analyzed. Results Within 30 and 90 days, about 14–22% and 27–41% index admissions were readmitted for any reason, respectively. HF and S/AF contributed most index cases, and HF and COPD accounted for most all-cause readmissions. Distributions and ratios of specific to non-specific readmissions were disease-specific with highest specific readmissions rates among COPD and AMI. Conclusion German claims are well-suited to investigate readmission causes if longer periods than 30 days are evaluated. Conditions closely related with the primary disease are the most frequent readmission causes, but multiple comorbidities among readmitted cases suggest that a multidisciplinary care approach should be implemented vigorously addressing comorbidities already during the index hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W3158307471,"We have previously used the genetic diversity available in common inbred mouse strains to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for the differences in angiogenic response using the corneal micropocket neovascularization (CoNV) assay. Employing a mouse genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, the region on chromosome 15 containing Basp1 was identified as being significantly associated with angiogenesis in inbred strains. Here, we developed a unique strategy to determine and verify the role of BASP1 in angiogenic pathways. Basp1 expression in cornea had a strong correlation with a haplotype shared by mouse strains with varied angiogenic phenotypes. In addition, inhibition of BASP1 demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect in both primary mouse brain endothelial and human microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) migration. To investigate its role in vivo, we knocked out basp1 in transgenic kdrl:zsGreen zebrafish embryos using a widely adopted CRISPR-Cas9 system. These embryos had severely disrupted vessel formation compared to control siblings. We further show that basp1 promotes angiogenesis by upregulating β-catenin gene and the Dll4/Notch1 signaling pathway. These results, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first in vivo evidence to indicate the role of Basp1 as an angiogenesis-regulating gene and opens the potential therapeutic avenues for a wide variety of systemic angiogenesis-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3158478197,"Background Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) 15–19 years of age are a growing proportion of all people living with HIV globally and the population includes adolescents with vertically acquired HIV (AVH) and behaviorally acquired HIV (ABH). Methods We conducted a survey to measure sociodemographic characteristics, educational status, health history, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among a convenience sample of ALHIV at three government health facilities in 2019 in Nampula, Mozambique. ALHIV 15–19 years on ART, including females attending antenatal care, were eligible. Routine HIV care data were extracted from medical charts. Classification of ALHIV by mode of transmission was based on medical charts and survey data. ALHIV who initiated ART &lt;15 years or reported no sex were considered AVH; all others ABH. Frequencies were compared by sex, and within sex, by mode of transmission (AVH vs. ABH) using Chi-square, Fishers exact tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results Among 208 ALHIV, 143 (69%) were female and median age was 18 years [interquartile range (IQR) 16–19]. Just over half of ALHIV (53%) were in or had completed secondary or higher levels of education; the most common reason for not being in school reported by 36% of females was pregnancy or having a child. Of all ALHIV, 122 (59%) had VL data, 62% of whom were &lt;1000 copies/mL. Almost half (46%) of ALHIV reported missing ARVs ≥ 1 day in the past month (62% of males vs. 39% of females; p = 0.003). Just over half (58%) of ALHIV in relationships had disclosed their HIV status: 13% of males vs. 69% of females (p&lt;0.001). Among sexually active males, 61% reported using a condom at last sex compared to 26% of females (p&lt;0.001). Among female ALHIV, 50 (35%) were AVH and 93 (65%) were ABH, 67% of whom were not in school compared to 16% of ABH, (p&lt;0.001). Discussion Data from our study underscore the high level of deprivation among ALHIV enrolled in HIV care in Mozambique, as well as important disparities by sex and mode of transmission. These data can inform the development of effective interventions for this complex and important population."
https://openalex.org/W3159105699,"Assays measuring cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood have widespread potential in modern medicine. However, a comprehensive understanding of cfDNA dynamics in healthy individuals is required to assist in the design of assays that maximise the signal driven by pathological changes, while excluding fluctuations that are part of healthy physiological processes. The menstrual cycle involves major remodelling of endometrial tissue and associated apoptosis, yet there has been little investigation of the impact of the menstrual cycle on cfDNA levels. Paired plasma samples were collected from 40 healthy women on menstruating (M) and non-menstruating (NM) days of their cycle. We measured total cfDNA by targeting ALU repetitive sequences and measured endothelial-derived cfDNA by methylation-specific qPCR targeting an endothelium-unique unmethylated CDH5 DNA region. CfDNA integrity and endothelial cfDNA concentration, but not total cfDNA, are consistent across time between NM and M. No significant changes in total (ALU-115 p = 0.273; ALU-247 p = 0.385) or endothelial cell specific (p = 0.301) cfDNA were observed, leading to the conclusion that menstrual status at the time of diagnostic blood collection should not have a significant impact on the quantitation of total cfDNA and methylation-based cancer assays."
https://openalex.org/W3159109114,"Objective The aim of this study is to systematically analyze the transcriptional sequencing data of cervical cancer (CC) to find an Tumor microenvironment (TME) prognostic marker to predict the survival of CC patients. Methods The expression profiles and clinical follow-up information of CC were downloaded from the TCGA and GEO. The RNA-seq data of TCGA-CESC samples were used for CIBERSORT analysis to evaluate the penetration pattern of TME in 285 patients, and construct TMEscore. Other data sets were used to validate and evaluate TMEscore model. Further, survival analysis of TMEscore related DEGs was done to select prognosis genes. Functional enrichment and PPI networks analysis were performed on prognosis genes. Results The TMEscore model has relatively good results in TCGA-CESC ( HR = 2.47,95% CI = 1.49–4.11), TCGA-CESC HPV infection samples ( HR = 2.13,95% CI = 1–4.51), GSE52903 ( HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.06–6.6), GSE44001 ( HR = 2.1, 95% CI = 0.99–4.43). Patients with high/low TMEscore have significant difference in prognosis ( log-rank test , P = 0.00025), and the main difference between high TMEscore subtypes and low TMEscore subtypes is immune function-related pathways. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival curves found out a list of identified prognosis genes (n = 86) which interestingly show significant enrichment in immune-related functions. Finally, PPI network analysis shows that highly related nodes such as CD3D, CD3E, CD8A, CD27 in the module may become new targets of CC immunotherapy. Conclusions TMEscore may become a new prognostic indicator predicting the survival of CC patients. The prognostic genes (n = 86) may help provide new strategies for tumor immunotherapy."

Self-collection of anal swabs may facilitate HPV molecular testing in anal cancer screening, especially in high-risk groups, and yet it is not adequately studied. We evaluated level of agreement between self-collected anal swabs (SCAS) and clinician-collected anal swabs (CCAS) when used for HPV genotyping. We also described the anal HPV genotype distribution and HIV/HPV coinfection.We performed a cross sectional study with participants from a visual-inspection-with-acetic-acid and cervicography (VIAC) clinic, in Harare, Zimbabwe. In a clinic setting, the women aged ≥18 years provided anal swabs in duplicate; first CCAS and then SCAS immediately after. HPV detection and genotyping were performed using next generation amplicon sequencing of a 450bp region of the HPV L1 gene. Level of agreement of HPV genotypes between CCAS and SCAS was calculated using the kappa statistic. McNemar tests were used to evaluate agreement in the proportion of genotypes detected by either method.Three-hundred women provided 600 samples for HPV genotyping. HPV genotypes were detected in 25% of SCAS and in 22% of CCAS. The most common genotypes with CCAS were HPV52, HPV62 and HPV70 and with SCAS were HPV62, HPV44, HPV52, HPV53 and HPV68. Total HPV genotypes detected in CCAS were more than those detected in SCAS, 32 versus 27. The agreement of HPV genotypes between the two methods was 0.55 in kappa value (k). The test of proportions using McNemar gave a Chi-square value of 0.75 (p = 0.39). Multiple HPV infections were detected in 28/75 and 29/67 women for CCAS and SCAS respectively.SCAS and CCAS anal swabs showed moderate agreement, with no statistically significant difference in the proportion of genotypes detected by either methods. Although the differences between the two methods were not statistically significant, CCAS detected more HPV genotypes than SCAS and more HPV infections were detected in SCAS than in CCAS. Our data suggest that self-collected anal swabs can be used as an alternative to clinician-collected anal swabs for HPV genotyping."
https://openalex.org/W3157142404,"The discovery and development of novel pharmaceuticals is an area of active research mainly due to the large investments required and long payback times. As of 2016, the development of a novel drug candidate required up to $ USD 2.6 billion in investment for only 10% rate of approval by the FDA. To help decreasing the costs associated with the process, a number of in silico approaches have been developed with relatively low success due to limited predicting performance. Here, we introduced a machine learning-based algorithm as an alternative for a more accurate search of new pharmacological candidates, which takes advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for active molecule prediction within large databases. Our approach, termed PharmaNet was implemented here to search for ligands against specific cell receptors within 102 targets of the DUD-E database, which contains 22886 active molecules. PharmaNet comprises three main phases. First, a SMILES representation of the molecule is converted into a raw molecular image . Second, a convolutional encoder processes the data to obtain a fingerprint molecular image that is finally analyzed by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This approach enables precise predictions of the molecules’ target on the basis of the feature extraction, the sequence analysis and the relevant information filtered out throughout the process. Molecule Target prediction is a highly unbalanced detection problem and therefore, we propose that an adequate evaluation metric of performance is the area under the Normalized Average Precision (NAP) curve. PharmaNet largely surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method with 97.7% in the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and 65.5% in the NAP curve. We obtained a perfect performance for human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is a potential target for antimicrobial and anticancer treatments. We decided to test PharmaNet for activity prediction against FPPS by searching in the CHEMBL data set. We obtained three (3) potential inhibitors that were further validated through both molecular docking and in silico toxicity prediction. Most importantly, one of this candidates, CHEMBL2007613, was predicted as a potential antiviral due to its involvement on the PCDH17 pathway, which has been reported to be related to viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W3158221988,"This paper explores the ratio of the mass in the inflection point over asymptotic mass for 81 nestlings of blue tits and great tits from an urban parkland in Warsaw, Poland (growth data from literature). We computed the ratios using the Bertalanffy-Pütter model, because this model was more flexible with respect to the ratios than the traditional models. For them, there were a-priori restrictions on the possible range of the ratios. (Further, as the Bertalanffy-Pütter model generalizes the traditional models, its fit to the data was necessarily better.) For six birds there was no inflection point (we set the ratio to 0), for 19 birds the ratio was between 0 and 0.368 (lowest ratio attainable for the Richards model), for 48 birds it was above 0.5 (fixed ratio of logistic growth), and for the remaining eight birds it was in between; the maximal observed ratio was 0.835. With these ratios we were able to detect small variations in avian growth due to slight differences in the environment: Our results indicate that blue tits grew more slowly (had a lower ratio) in the presence of light pollution and modified impervious substrate, a finding that would not have been possible had we used traditional growth curve analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3158302680,"Although the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is altered in most multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, gadolinium enhancement is seen only in acute lesions. In this study, we aimed to investigate gadolinium-induced changes in T 1 relaxation time in MS lesions on 7-tesla (7T) MRI as a means to quantify BBB breakdown in non-enhancing MS lesions. Forty-seven participants with MS underwent 7T MRI of the brain with a magnitude-prepared rapid acquisition of 2 gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence before and after contrast. Subtraction of pre- and post-contrast T 1 maps was used to measure T 1 relaxation time change (ΔT 1 ) from gadolinium. ΔT 1 values were interrogated in enhancing white matter lesions (ELs), non-enhancing white matter lesions (NELs), and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and metrics were compared to clinical data. ΔT 1 was measurable in NELs (median: -0.139 (-0.304, 0.174) seconds; p &lt; 0.001) and was negligible in NAWM (median: -0.001 (-0.036, 0.155) seconds; p = 0.516). Median ΔT 1 in NELs correlated with disability as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (rho = -0.331, p = 0.026). Multiple measures of NEL ΔT 1 variability also correlated with EDSS. NEL ΔT 1 values were greater and more variable in patients with progressive forms of MS and greater in those not on MS treatment. Measurement of the changes in T 1 relaxation time caused by contrast on 7T MP2RAGE reveals clinically relevant evidence of BBB breakdown in NELs in MS. This data suggests that NEL ΔT 1 should be evaluated further as a potential biomarker of persistently disrupted BBB in MS."
https://openalex.org/W3158411238,"The microbial communities play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning through interactions among individuals and taxonomic groups in a highly dynamic marine ecosystem. The structure and functioning of the microbial communities are often influenced by the changes in the surrounding environment. Monitoring the microbial diversity of the marine ecosystem helps to understand spatial patterns of microbial community and changes due to season, climate, and various drivers of biological diversity. Kuwait is characterized by an arid environment with a high degree of temperature variation during summer and winter. Our understanding of spatial distribution patterns of microbial communities, their diversity, and the influence of human activities on the degree of changes in the diversity of the microbial community in Kuwait territorial waters remain unclear. In this study, we employed 18S rRNA sequencing to explore marine microalgal community composition and dynamics in seawater samples collected from Kuwait waters over two seasonal cycles across six locations. A total of 448,184 sequences across 36 replicates corresponding to 12 samples from six stations were obtained. The quality-filtered sequences were clustered into 1,293 representative sequences, which were then classified into different eukaryotic taxa. This study reveals that the phytoplankton community in Kuwait waters is diverse and shows significant variations among different taxa during summer and winter. Dinoflagellates and diatoms were the most abundant season-dependent microalgae taxa in Kuwait waters. Alexandrium and Pyrophacus were abundant in summer, whereas Gonyaulax was abundant during the winter. The abundance of Coscinodiscus and Navicula , of the diatom genera, were also dependent upon both seasonal and possible anthropogenic factors. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a sequencing-based approach, which could be used to improve the accuracy of quantitative eukaryotic microbial community profiles."
https://openalex.org/W3159848115,"Coral reefs protect islands, coastal areas, and their inhabitants from storm waves and provide essential goods and services to millions of people worldwide. Yet contemporary rates of ocean warming and local disturbances are jeopardizing the reef-building capacity of coral reefs to keep up with rapid rates of sea-level rise. This study compared the reef-building capacity of shallow-water habitats at 142 sites across a potential thermal-stress gradient in the tropical Pacific Ocean. We sought to determine the extent to which habitat differences and environmental variables potentially affect rates of net carbonate production. In general, outer-exposed reefs and lagoonal-patch reefs had higher rates of net carbonate production than nearshore reefs. The study found that thermal anomalies, particularly the intensity of thermal-stress events, play a significant role in reducing net carbonate production—evident as a diminishing trend of net carbonate production from the western to the central tropical Pacific Ocean. The results also showed a latent spatial effect along the same gradient, not explained by thermal stress, suggesting that reefs in the western tropical Pacific Ocean are potentially enhanced by the proximity of reefs in the Coral Triangle—an effect that diminishes with increasing distance and isolation."
https://openalex.org/W3157479271,"Understanding the dynamics by which urban areas attract visitors is important in today’s cities that are continuously increasing in population towards higher densities. Identifying services that relate to highly attractive districts is useful to make policies regarding the placement of such places. Thus, we present a framework for classifying districts in cities by their attractiveness to daily commuters and relating Points of Interests (POIs) types to districts’ attraction patterns. We used Origin-Destination matrices (ODs) mined from cell phone data that capture the flow of trips between each pair of places in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We define the attraction profile for a place based on three main statistical features: The number of visitors a place received, the distribution of distance traveled by visitors on the road network, and the spatial spread of locations from where trips started. We used a hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify all places in the city by their features of attraction. We discovered three main types of Urban Attractors in Riyadh during the morning period: G lobal, which are significant places in the city, D owntown, which contains the central business district, and Residential attractors. In addition, we uncovered what makes districts possess certain attraction patterns. We used a statistical significance testing approach to quantify the relationship between Points of Interests (POIs) types (services) and the patterns of Urban Attractors detected."
https://openalex.org/W3158003150,"Background Male partners have a considerable role in influencing women’s contraceptive decision making to reduce the chance of unintended pregnancy. Most studies are focused on women’s knowledge and barriers for emergency contraception (EC) use. There is limited research on this topic from the male perspective. This study aimed to gather baseline data on men’s knowledge, attitudes and barriers about EC. Methods Descriptive analytic cross-sectional study was conducted from Dec 2019 –May 2020 at the King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH); a teaching facility with general and subspecialty medical services in King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a structured pretested questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. Descriptive statistics and Chi square tests were used. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to find significant predictors for EC awareness and use. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 461 participants completed the questionnaire (response rate 86%). The majority (82%) of the participants were unaware of EC; with only 18% having some knowledge. Knowledgeable men had positive attitudes (73.5%) about EC as compared to non- knowledgeable ones (55.0%). Factors found to be associated with less knowledge of EC were cultural [0.46, 95%CI 0.22. 0.96] and religious unacceptability [OR 0.51, 95%CI 0.29, 0.89)]. Higher level of education [OR 1.83, 95%CI 0.94, 3.53] was associated with more knowledge regarding EC. The study showed that correct information about using contraceptives within 3 days of unprotected sex [OR 4.96, 95%CI 1.81, 13.60]; availability without prescription [OR 5.06, 95%CI 1.68, 15.30], EC advertisement [OR 4.84, 95%CI 0.96, 24.27] and receipt of information from family/friends [OR 18.50, 95%CI 5.19, 65.93] were factors that contributed to men using EC. Conclusion The current knowledge of EC among men is limited. Social determinants affect these levels of knowledge, as well as the usage of EC. Factors that were associated with the use of ECPs were correct knowledge, advertisement, availability and receipt of information from family/friends. The findings highlight the need to educate men on this important topic to avoid unintended pregnancy, keeping in view cultural and social values. Future qualitative studies are needed to understand the male perspective."

Bombus pauloensis is a widely distributed species in South America, that recently began to be managed and commercialized in this region. The movement of colonies within or between countries may favor the dissemination of parasites and pathogens, putting into risk while populations of B . pauloensis and other native species. In this study, wild B . pauloensis queens and workers, and laboratory reared workers were screened for the presence of phoretic mites, internal parasites (microsporidia, protists, nematodes and parasitoids) and RNA viruses (Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Deformed wing virus (DWV), Acute paralysis virus (ABCV) and Sacbrood virus (SBV)). Bumble bee queens showed the highest number of mite species, and it was the only group where Conopidae and S . bombi were detected. In the case of microsporidia, a higher prevalence of N . ceranae was detected in field workers. Finally, the bumble bees presented the four RNA viruses studied for A . mellifera , in proportions similar to those previously reported in this species. Those results highlight the risks of spillover among the different species of pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W3158639378,"Background Globally, approximately 9 million neonates develop perinatal asphyxia annually of which about 1.2 million die. Majority of the morbidity and mortality occur in Low and middle-income countries. However, little is known about the current trend in incidence, and the factors affecting mortality from hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), in Nigeria. Objective We assessed the trends in incidence and fatality rates and evaluated the predictors of mortality among babies admitted with HIE over five years at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Methods A temporal trend analysis and retrospective cohort study of HIE affected babies admitted to the neonatal unit of a Nigerian Teaching Hospital was conducted. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the babies and their mothers were extracted from the neonatal unit records. Kaplan-Meir plots and Multivariable Cox proportional hazard ratio was used to evaluate the survival experienced using Stata version 16 (StataCorp USA) statistical software. Results The median age of the newborns at admission was 26.5 (10–53.5) hours and the male to female ratio was 2.1:1. About one-fifth (20.8%) and nearly half (47.8%) were admitted within 6 hours and 24 hours of life respectively, while majority (84%) of the infants were out-born. The prevalence and fatality rate of HIE in our study was 7.1% and 25.3% respectively. The annual incidence of HIE among the hospital admissions declined by 1.4% per annum while the annual fatality rate increased by 10.3% per annum from 2015 to 2019. About 15.7% died within 24 hours of admission. The hazard of death was related to the severity of HIE (p = 0.001), antenatal booking status of the mother (p = 0.01) and place of delivery (p = 0.03). Conclusion The case fatality rate of HIE is high and increasing at our centre and mainly driven by the pattern of admission of HIE cases among outborn babies. Thus, community level interventions including skilled birth attendants at delivery, newborn resuscitation trainings for healthcare personnel and capacity building for specialized care should be intensified to reduce the burden of HIE."
https://openalex.org/W3158720664,"Understanding the genetic background of complex diseases requires the expansion of studies beyond univariate associations. Therefore, it is important to use interaction assessments of risk factors in order to discover whether, and how genetic risk variants act together on disease development. The principle of interaction analysis is to explore the magnitude of the combined effect of risk factors on disease causation. In this study, we use simulations to investigate different scenarios of causation to show how the magnitude of the effect of two risk factors interact. We mainly focus on the two most commonly used interaction models, the additive and multiplicative risk scales, since there is often confusion regarding their use and interpretation. Our results show that the combined effect is multiplicative when two risk factors are involved in the same chain of events, an interaction called synergism. Synergism is often described as a deviation from additivity, which is a broader term. Our results also confirm that it is often relevant to estimate additive effect relationships, because they correspond to independent risk factors at low disease prevalence. Importantly, we evaluate the threshold of more than two required risk factors for disease causation, called the multifactorial threshold model. We found a simple mathematical relationship (square root) between the threshold and an additive-to-multiplicative linear effect scale (AMLES), where 0 corresponds to an additive effect and 1 to a multiplicative. We propose AMLES as a metric that could be used to test different effects relationships at the same time, given that it can simultaneously reveal additive, multiplicative and intermediate risk effects relationships. Finally, the utility of our simulation study was demonstrated using real data by analyzing and interpreting gene-gene interaction odds ratios from a rheumatoid arthritis case-control cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3159064806,"Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels have been associated with disease and survival status in septic humans and dogs. To date, studies investigating cfDNA levels in association with critical illness in foals are lacking. We hypothesized that cfDNA would be detectable in the plasma of foals, that septic and sick-nonseptic foals would have significantly higher cfDNA levels compared to healthy foals, and that increased cfDNA levels would be associated with non-survival. Animals used include 80 foals of 10 days of age or less admitted to a tertiary referral center between January and July, 2020 were stratified into three categories: healthy (n = 34), sick non-septic (n = 11) and septic (n = 35) based on specific criteria. This was a prospective clinical study. Blood was collected from critically ill foals at admission or born in hospital for cfDNA quantification and blood culture. Previously published sepsis score (SS) and neonatal SIRS score (NSIRS) were also calculated. SS, NSIRS, blood culture status and cfDNA concentrations were evaluated to predict survival. Continuous variables between groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s post hoc test. Comparisons between two groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U -test or Spearman rank for correlations. The performance of cfDNA, sepsis score and NSIRS score to predict survival was assessed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis including area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity using cutoffs. Plasma cfDNA was detectable in all foals. No significant differences in cfDNA concentration were detected between healthy foals and septic foals ( P = 0.65) or healthy foals and sick non-septic foals ( P = 0.88). There was no significant association between cfDNA and culture status, SS, NSIRS or foal survival. SS (AUC 0.85) and NSIRS (AUC 0.83) were superior to cfDNA (AUC 0.64) in predicting survival. Although cfDNA was detectable in foal plasma, it offers negligible utility to diagnose sepsis or predict survival in critical illness in neonates."

https://openalex.org/W3157646393,"This paper explores whether artificial ground-mobile systems exhibit a consistent regularity of relation among mass, power, and speed, similar to that which exists for biological organisms. To this end, we investigate an empirical allometric formula proposed in the 1980s for estimating the mechanical power expended by an organism of a given mass to move at a given speed, applicable over several orders of magnitude of mass, for a broad range of species, to determine if a comparable regularity applies to a range of vehicles. We show empirically that not only does a similar regularity apply to a wide variety of mobile systems; moreover, the formula is essentially the same, describing organisms and systems ranging from a roach (1 g) to a battle tank (35,000 kg). We also show that for very heavy vehicles (35,000–100,000,000 kg), the formula takes a qualitatively different form. These findings point to a fundamental similarity between biological and artificial locomotion that transcends great differences in morphology, mechanisms, materials, and behaviors. To illustrate the utility of this allometric relation, we investigate the significant extent to which ground robotic systems exhibit a higher cost of transport than either organisms or conventional vehicles, and discuss ways to overcome inefficiencies."

During January-February 2020 we examined the standpoints of medical managers and administrative directors from the private and public health hospitals on patient-physician trust, using a structured questionnaire. Thirty-six managers in public and private hospitals (24 from the public sector and 12 from the private sector) responded to the survey. Managers in the private sector rated trust higher in comparison to managers in the public sector, including trust related to patient satisfaction, professionalism and accountability. Managers from public hospitals gave higher scores to the need for patient education and shared responsibility prior to medical procedures. Administrative directors gave higher scores to various dimensions of trust and autonomy while medical managers gave higher scores to economic considerations. Trust is a fundamental component of the healthcare system and may be used to improve the provision and quality of care by analyzing standpoints and comparable continuous monitoring. Differences in position, education and training influence the perception of trust among managers in the health system. This survey may allow policy makers and opinion leaders to continue building and maintaining trust between patients and care providers."
https://openalex.org/W3159277068,"Objectives This study evaluates the effect of Community Anti-retroviral Groups on Immunologic, Virologic and clinical outcomes of stable Antiretroviral Therapy patients in Nigeria. Method A cohort of 251 eligible adults (≥18 years) on first-line ART for at least 6 months with CD4 counts &gt;200 cells/mm3 and viral load &lt;1000 c/ml were devolved from 10 healthcare facilities to 51 community antiretroviral therapy groups. Baseline immunologic, virologic and clinical parameters were collected and community antiretroviral therapy group patients were followed up for a year after which Human Immunodeficiency Virus treatment outcomes at the baseline and a year after follow-up were compared using paired sample t-test. All the analyses were performed in STATA version 14. Result Out of the 251 stable antiretroviral therapy adults enrolled, 186 (75.3%) were female, 52 (22.7%) had attained post-secondary education and the mean age of participants was 38 years (SD: 9.5). Also, 66 (27.9%) were employed while 125 (52.7%) were self-employed and 46(19.41%) unemployed. 246 (98.0%) of the participants were retained in care. While there was no statistically significant change in the CD4 counts (456cells/mm3 vs 481cells/mm3 P-0.489) and Log 10 viral load (3.54c/ml vs 3.69c/ml P-0.359) after one year of devolvement into the community, we observed a significant increase in body weight (60.8 vs 65, P-0.01). Conclusion This study demonstrates that community antiretroviral therapy has a potential of maintaining optimum treatment outcomes while improving adherence and retention, and reducing the burden of HIV treatment on the health facility. This study provides baseline information for further research and vital information for HIV program implementers planning to decentralize the management of stable antiretroviral therapy clients."

Design From February 2017 to December 2019, a total 458 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy or surgery of benign prostatic hyperplasia agreed to research of Del-1 protein. We prospectively compared and analyzed the Del-1 protein and prostate specific antigen (PSA) in relation to the patients’ demographic and clinicopathological characteristics. Results Mean age was 68.86±8.55 years. Mean PSA and Del-1 protein was 21.72±89.37, 0.099±0.145, respectively. Two hundred seventy-six (60.3%) patients were diagnosed as PCa. Among them, 181 patients underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). There were significant differences in Del-1 protein between benign and PCa group (0.066±0.131 vs 0.121±0.149, respectively, p&lt;0.001). When we set the cut-off value of del-1 protein as 0.120, in patients with 3≤PSA≤8, positive predictive value and specificity of Del-1 protein (≥0.120) for predicting PCa were 88.9% (56/63) and 93.5% (101/108), respectively. Among 181 patients who underwent RP, there were significant differences in Del-1 protein according to stage (pT2 vs pT3a vs ≥pT3b) (0.113±0.078, 0.171±0.121, 0.227±0.161, respectively, p&lt;0.001) and to Gleason score (6 (3+3) or 7 (3+4) vs 7 (4+3) or 8 (4+4) vs 9 or 10) (0.134±0.103, 0.150±0.109, 0.212±0.178, respectively, P = 0.044). Multivariate analysis showed that PSA, Del-1 protein and high Gleason score (≥9) were the independent prognostic factors for predicting higher pT stage (≥3b). Furthermore, age, PSA and Del-1 protein were independent prognostic factors for predicting significant PCa. Conclusion Patients with PCa showed higher expression of Del-1 protein than benign patients. Del-1 protein increased with the stage and Gleason score of PCa.

https://openalex.org/W3157995809,"A range of surgical techniques and osteochondral interventions have been developed for early stage chondral/osteochondral repair interventions in the knee however, methods for functional, pre-clinical assessment of these therapies are limited. In this study, a method for simulating physiological loading and motion in the porcine patellofemoral joint was developed using a 6-axis simulator. As an example of how the method can be used, the influence of surgical positioning of osteochondral allografts in the patella on cartilage wear, deformation and damage and graft stability was investigated in this porcine patellofemoral joint model. The functional performance of allografts implanted either optimally (flush with the cartilage surface) or 1 mm proud of the cartilage surface was compared to a positive control (stainless steel pin implanted 1 mm proud of the cartilage surface), a negative control (no intervention) and a defect model. Allografts implanted flush with the surrounding cartilage could restore the articulating surface of the patella resulting in low wear, damage and deformation of the opposing cartilage surface, similar to that of the negative control group. Implanting the graft proud of the patella surface resulted in cartilage lesions on the femoral trochlea (ICRS grade 2) and a cartilage volume difference of 2.0 ± 3.9 mm3; the positive controls resulted in more severe lesions, a higher volume difference (14.2 ± 7.4 mm3) which in some cases exposed subchondral bone (ICRS grade 4). Defects in the patella caused deformation of the opposing cartilage surface. All grafts implanted in the patella subsided over the duration of the study. This study demonstrated a method that can be used to evaluate osteochondral repair strategies in the patellofemoral joint applying physiological loading and motions."

https://openalex.org/W3158566599,"Water deficit limits plant growth and development, resulting in quality loss of horticultural crops. However, there is limited information on gene regulation and signaling pathways related to water deficit stress response at multiple time points. The objective of this research was to investigate global gene expression patterns under water deficit stress to provide an insight into how petunia ( Petunia × hybrida ‘Mitchell Diploid’) responded in the process of stress. Nine-week-old petunias were irrigated daily or placed under water stress by withholding water. Stressed plants reduced stomatal conductance after five days of water deficit, indicating they perceived stress and initiated stress response mechanisms. To analyze transcriptomic changes at the early stage of water deficit, leaf tissue samples were collected 1, 3, and 5 days after water was withheld for RNA sequencing. Under water deficit stress, 154, 3611, and 980 genes were upregulated and 41, 2806, and 253 genes were downregulated on day 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that redox homeostasis processes through sulfur and glutathione metabolism pathways, and hormone signal transduction, especially abscisic acid and ethylene, were enriched under water deficit stress. Thirty-four transcription factor families were identified, including members of AP2/ERF, NAC, MYB-related, C2H2, and bZIP families, and TFs in AP2/ERF family was the most abundant in petunia. Interestingly, only one member of GRFs was upregulated on day 1, while most of TFs were differentially expressed on day 3 and/or 5. The transcriptome data from this research will provide valuable molecular resources for understanding the early stages of water stress-responsive networks as well as engineering petunia with enhanced water stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3158828885,"Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman, is an ectoparasitic mite of honey bees, Apis mellifera L., that has been considered a major cause of colony losses. Synthetic miticides have been developed and registered to manage this ectoparasite, however, resistance to registered pyrethroid and organophosphate Varroacides have already been reported in Canada. To test toxicity of miticides, current contact-based bioassay methods are designed to evaluate mites and bees separately, however, these methods are unlikely to give an accurate depiction of how miticides interact at the colony level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a bioassay cage for testing the toxicity of miticides on honey bees and Varroa mites simultaneously using amitraz as a reference chemical. A 800 mL polypropylene plastic cage holding 100–150 bees was designed and officially named “Apiarium”. A comparison of the effects of three subsequent dilutions of amitraz was conducted on: Varroa mites placed in glass vials, honey bees in glass Mason jars, and Varroa- infested bees in Apiariums. Our results indicated cumulative Varroa mortality was dose-dependent in the Apiarium after 4 h and 24 h assessments. Apiarium and glass vial treatments at 24 h also had high mite mortality and a positive polynomial regression between Varroa mortality and amitraz dose rates. Moreover, chemical application in the Apiarium was less toxic for bees compared to the Mason jar method. Considering these results, the Apiarium bioassay provides a simple, cheap and reliable method for simultaneous chemical screening on V . destructor and A . mellifera . Furthermore, as mites and bees are tested together, the Apiarium simulates a colony-like environment that provides a necessary bridge between laboratory bioassay testing and full field experimentation. The versatility of the Apiarium allows researchers to test a multitude of different honey bee bioassay experiments including miticide screening, delivery methods for chemical products, or development of new mite resistance-testing methodology."
https://openalex.org/W3158948631,"Background Most studies on chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and amniocentesis risks have not evaluated pregnancies with low risk for genetic diseases; therefore, the efficacy and safety of CMA and amniocentesis in this population are unclear. This study aimed to examine the benefits and risks of prenatal genetic diagnostic tests in pregnancies having low risk for chromosomal diseases. Methods and findings In this retrospective study, we used clinical data from a large database of 30,830 singleton pregnancies at gestational age 16–23 weeks who underwent amniocentesis for karyotyping with or without CMA. We collected socio-demographic, medical and obstetric information, along with prenatal screening, CMA and karyotyping results. Fetal loss events were also analysed. CMA was performed in 5,837 pregnancies with normal karyotype (CMA cohort). In this cohort, 4,174 women had normal prenatal screening results and the risk for identifying genetic abnormalities with &gt;10% risk for intellectual disability by CMA was 1:102, with no significant difference between maternal age groups. The overall post-amniocentesis fetal loss rate was 1:1,401 for the entire cohort (n = 30,830) and 1:1,945 for the CMA cohort (n = 5,837). The main limitation of this study is the relatively short follow-up of 3 weeks, which may not have been sufficient for detecting all fetal loss events. Conclusion The low risk for post-amniocentesis fetal loss, compared to the rate of severe genetic abnormalities detected by CMA, suggests that even pregnant women with normal prenatal screening results should consider amniocentesis with CMA."
https://openalex.org/W3159061215,"Purpose To evaluate dual-energy CT (DE) and dedicated metal artifact reduction algorithms (iMAR) during CT-guided biopsy in comparison to single-energy CT (SE). Methods A trocar was placed in the liver of six pigs. CT acquisitions were performed with SE and dose equivalent DE at four dose levels(1.7–13.5mGy). Iterative reconstructions were performed with and without iMAR. ROIs were placed in four positions e.g. at the trocar tip(TROCAR) and liver parenchyma adjacent to the trocar tip(LIVER-1) by two independent observers for quantitative analysis using CT numbers, noise, SNR and CNR. Qualitative image analysis was performed regarding overall image quality and artifacts generated by iMAR. Results There were no significant differences in CT numbers between DE and SE at TROCAR and LIVER-1 irrespective of iMAR. iMAR significantly reduced metal artifacts at LIVER-1 for all exposure settings for DE and SE(p = 0.02-0.04), but not at TROCAR. SNR, CNR and noise were comparable for DE and SE. SNR was best for high dose levels of 6.7/13.5mGy. Mean difference in the Blant-Altman analysis was -8.43 to 0.36. Cohen’s kappa for qualitative interreader-agreement was 0.901. Conclusions iMAR independently reduced metal artifacts more effectively and efficiently than CT acquisition in DE at any dose setting and its application is feasible during CT-guided liver biopsy."
https://openalex.org/W3159871646,"As the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is thought to be caused mainly by the excessive aggregation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ). However, a growing number of studies have found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the onset and progression of AD. The present study aimed to probe the neuroprotective effect of high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) for SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. By looking in a systematic way into the frequency- and amplitude-dependent neuroprotective effect of pulsed electric field (PEF), the study finds that H-LIPEF at 200 Hz produces the optimal protective effect for SH-SY5Y cells. The underlying mechanisms were confirmed to be due to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the downstream prosurvival and antioxidant proteins. Because the electric field can be modified to focus on specific area in a non-contact manner, the study suggests that H-LIPEF holds great potential for treating NDDs, whose effect can be further augmented with the administering of drugs or natural compounds at the same time."
https://openalex.org/W3157798893,"Background The construction sector is one of the most stable growth industries in the world. However, many studies have suggested an association between occupational exposure in civil construction and lung cancer risk. Thus, this study aims to assess lung cancer risk in civil construction workers occupationally exposed to physical and chemical agents through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods/design Studies will be identified by searching PUBMED, Embase, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE and the reference list of included articles. Eligible study designs will be cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies that report occupational exposure to physical or chemical agents and lung cancer risk through mortality or incidence outcomes. A meta-analysis will be used to combine odds ratios (ORs) from case-control studies and relative risks (RR) from cohort studies. Two reviewers will independently screen articles, extract data, and assess scientific quality using standardized forms and ROBINS-E tool if available. Otherwise, the New-Castle Ottawa rating scale will be used. Any of those will also be used in combination with the GRADE approach for quality of evidence. Overall risk estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be obtained using the random-effects model meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Discussion This review will identify and synthesize studies investigating the association between occupational exposure in the construction industry and lung cancer. The findings will help governmental entities and researchers with evidence-based decision-making because they will integrate and validate the evidence on construction workers’ health effects due to occupational exposure.

https://openalex.org/W3157995447,"This paper expands the previous research on management equity incentives (MEIs) and stock price crash risk by distinguishing between the ""gold watch"" region and the ""golden handcuff"" regions in MEIs. By using an estimation of the gold watch region and the golden handcuff regions based on 6,675 annual observations of China’s A-share listed companies, the stock price crash risk is found to be negatively correlated with MEIs in the golden handcuff regions (0–10%, 30%-100%) and is positively correlated with MEIs in the gold watch region (10%-30%). A further investigation of the mediating effects of peer effects on MEIs and the stock price crash risk reveals that peer effects have a partial mediation effect at the level of peer managers’ shareholding and mediate the relationship between MEIs and the stock price crash risk."
https://openalex.org/W3158194245,"Background Major depressive disorder with psychotic features (MDDPsy), compared to nonpsychotic MDD, involves an increased risk of suicide and failure to achieve treatment response. Symptom scales can be useful to assess patients with MDDPsy. The aim of the present study was to validate French versions of the Delusion Assessment Scale (DAS) and Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS). Methods One hundred patients were included. The scales were filled out by psychiatrists. Data from participants who accepted a second interview were used for inter-judge reliability. The scalability and psychometric properties of both scales were assessed. Results Data from 94 patients were used. Owing to low score variability between patients, the predefined threshold for scalability (≥0.40) was not reached for both scales. Factorial analysis of the DAS identified five factors, different from those of the original version. Five factors were also identified in the PDAS, of which two comprised items from the HDRS and the other three items from the BPRS. Floor and ceiling effects were observed in both scales, due in part to the construction of certain subscales. Unlike the PDAS, the DAS had good internal consistency. Multiple correlations were observed between the DAS dimensions but none between those of the PDAS. Both scales showed good inter-judge reliability. Convergent validity analyses showed correlations with HDRS, BPRS and CGI. Limitations Inter-judge reliability was calculated from a relatively small number of volunteers. Conclusions The good psychometric properties of the French versions of the DAS and PDAS could help in assessing MDDPsy, in particular its psychotic features, and hence improve response to treatment and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3158319336,"The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ-B) is an instrument that allows the experiences around fear of childbirth to be examined after the birth. It is currently the most widely used to measure different aspects related to the fear of childbirth and enables healthcare and additional assistance to women after birth to be adapted according to their needs. The objective of this study was to translate the W-DEQ-B into Spanish and analyse its reliability and validity. The study was carried out in two phases: (1) transcultural adaption of the questionnaire to Spanish and (2) a transversal study in a sample of 190 postpartum women from Sexual and Reproductive Health Clinics in the province of Barcelona (Spain). The psychometric properties were examined in terms of reliability (internal consistency and temporal stability) and construct validity (confirmatory factorial analysis [CFA] and exploratory factorial analysis [EFA]). The results of the CFA did not confirm unidimensionality of the W-DEQ-B questionnaire. The EFA suggested four very similar, but not identical, dimensions to those obtained in other studies in which the W-DEQ-B has been evaluated. Both the Cronbach’s alpha and the omega coefficient were adequate for the total questionnaire and for each of the four dimensions. The results of this study confirm that the W-DEQ-B is multi-dimensional. In the Spanish version of the W-DEQ-B-Sp four dimensions have been identified that allow the experiences around fear of childbirth to be examined after the birth. The Spanish version of the WDEQ-B (WDEQ-B-Sp) is reliable and valid for the measurement of fear of childbirth in clinical practice and for use in future research."
https://openalex.org/W3158421868,"On the basis of the spatial panel data of 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, this study uses a mixed geographically weighted regression model to explore the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of the rural (permanent) population in Jiangxi Province, China. Results show that residents in the county area have a significant spatial positive autocorrelation, especially in the lake and mountain areas and the global Moran’ I index is more than 0.05. The influence of social and economic factors presents spatial homogeneity. The effect of urbanization and per capita disposable income is negative, whereas that of agricultural output value and rural electricity consumption is positive. The influence of climate factors presents spatial heterogeneity. The influence coefficient of rainfall in 2015 ranges from [-0.061, 0.133], which has a negative effect on the southwest mountain areas and a positive effect on the northeast lake areas., The influence coefficient of temperature in 2015 ranges from [-0.110, 0.094], which has a positive effect on the southwest mountain areas and a negative effect on the northeast lake areas. The influence coefficients of wind speed and relative humidity range from [-0.090, 0.153] and [-0.069, 0.130] in 2015 respectively, which further reinforce this effect. Therefore, scholars should pay attention to the universal adaptability of economic and social factors. Moreover, they should consider the spatial difference of climatic factors to promote urbanization following the local conditions. Finally, policymakers and concerned non-governmental institutions should fully understand the sensitivity of the rural population in underdeveloped mountain areas to climate factors to promote their rational distribution."
