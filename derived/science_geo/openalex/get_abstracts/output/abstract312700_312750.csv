https://openalex.org/W2026024887,"New fossils of giant, flightless penguinlike birds have been found in late Oligocene and early Miocene rocks in Japan and in the state of Washington. These birds belong to the order Pelecaniformes, in the extinct family Plotopteridae, previously known by a single fragment of bone from California. Hindlimb and pelvic morphology is most similar to that of Recent anhingas, but the wing is paddlelike and remarkably convergent toward penguins and flightless auks. Both the Plotopteridae and the giant penguins became extinct by the middle Miocene, possibly because of competition from seals and porpoises."
https://openalex.org/W1964723096,"""Split-brain"" cats with midsagittal section of the optic chiasm and the corpus callosum are able to transfer interocularly a simple brightness discrimination although they are unable to transfer a pattern discrimination. This strongly suggests that the interocular transfer of a simple brightness discrimination is mediated subcallosally."
https://openalex.org/W2057637292,"As a result of the generation of neutrons in nuclear tests and their subsequent reaction with nitrogen in the atmosphere, considerable man-made C/sup 14/ has been added to the earth's dynamic carbon reservoir. On the basis of the measured neutron yield per unit energy release and on the assumption that about two-thirds of the C/sup 14/ produced falls back as calcium carbonate, Libby has estimated that 10 x 10/sup 27/ atoms of C/sup 14/ have been introduced into the atmosphere as C0/sub 2/. Rafter and Fergusson have shown that the C/sup 14/ concentration in Southern Hemisphere tropospheric CO/sub 2/ has been increasing 2.1 percent per year since 1955. For the Northern Hemisphere, de Vries has suggested an increase of 4.3 percent between 1953 and 1957. The results of Munnich and Vogel point to an increase of about 3.2 percent per year for central Europe and 2 percent per year in South Africa over the period from 1954 to 1957. Considerable interest has been aroused in the possible genetic effects of this increase in the C/sup 14/ concentration ecent data related to this increase are presented together with a brief discussion of the probable distribution of bomb C/sup 14/ within themore » dynamic carbon reservoir.

https://openalex.org/W1970285714,Combined annealing experiments and observations by transmission electron microscopy show that in natural pigeonite crystals antiphase domains coarsen approximately according to a rate law in which the tenth power of the average domain size is proportional to time. This result suggests that certain cations (possibly Ca(2+)) were segregated preferentially onto the antiphase boundaries. The domain size in samples quenched from above the high-low transformation temperature is large and apparently independent of annealing time and temperature. It appears that large domains can be generated either by very fast or by very slow cooling; thus the estimation of geological cooling rates from the sizes of antiphase domains in natural samples becomes rather difficult.

This layer is ultrastructurally, and generally mineralogically, different from the underlying foliated calcite, and is named the ligostracum."
https://openalex.org/W2068753818,Conventional carbon-14 dating by means of gas proportional counters has been extended to samples containing as little as 10 milligrams of carbon. The accuracy of the dating procedure has been checked by dating sequoia tree-ring samples of the 1st century A.D. and B.C. and an oak tree-ring sample of the 19th century A.D.

These adaptations favor the mite's dispersal. Hypopi are attracted to the pupa by a volatile substance and cluster on the anterior end, from which the fly emerges."

https://openalex.org/W2087481535,"The mucociliary urn cell complex of the marine coelomate Sipunculus nudus secretes mucus 4 to 5 minutes after being exposed to Lotus tetragonolobus and Ricinus communis I agglutinins. Surface binding of both lectins is confined to the secretory area of the urn cell complex and, like the release of mucus, is inhibited by the specific saccharides L-fucose and D-galactose or by incubation in L-fucosidase and D-galactosidase. Mucus secretion may therefore be initiated by the interaction of mucus-releasing stimuli with fucosyl or galactosyl residues of specific membrane receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2037781473,"Solar availability for space heating on coldest-weather days has been determined from an analysis of SOLMET data tapes. The tapes contain hourly readings of insolation and ambient temperature over the period from 1953 through 1975. Scatter diagrams of insolation versus heating degree-days, compiled on a daily basis, indicate a wide variation in the insolation level, even during coldest-weather periods. For all but one of the eight sites studied, the peak-day backup energy requirement of the solar system was in excess of 85 percent of the peak-day energy requirement of the conventional (nonsolar) heating system."

https://openalex.org/W2080538771,"EVIDENCE for the formation of active hydrogen from its positive ion in an acid has been negative. The reports of the latest workers in this field, Wendt and Landauer (Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc. 42, 930 : 1920) show that there are certain difficulties to be met. The main one is to eliminate the moisture that accompanies a rapid evolution of hydrogen and at the same time not to destroy the active hydrogen if any were formed. If the velocity of the gas stream were too low, the active component would decay before reaching the sulphur. Then if the velocity were too high the moisture carried over would form a protecting film on the powdered sulphur and prevent the reaction between the two to form hydrogen sulphide."
