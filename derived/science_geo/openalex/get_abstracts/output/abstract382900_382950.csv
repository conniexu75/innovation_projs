https://openalex.org/W1991660337,"The NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2 was initially identified as a mediator of replicative lifespan in budding yeast and was subsequently shown to modulate longevity in worms and flies. Its mammalian homologue, SIRT1, seems to have evolved complex systemic roles in cardiac function, DNA repair and genomic stability. Recent studies suggest a functional relevance of SIRT1 in normal brain physiology and neurological disorders. However, it is unknown if SIRT1 has a role in higher-order brain functions. We report that SIRT1 modulates synaptic plasticity and memory formation via a microRNA-mediated mechanism. Activation of SIRT1 enhances, whereas its loss-of-function impairs, synaptic plasticity. Surprisingly, these effects were mediated via post-transcriptional regulation of cAMP response binding protein (CREB) expression by a brain-specific microRNA, miR-134. SIRT1 normally functions to limit expression of miR-134 via a repressor complex containing the transcription factor YY1, and unchecked miR-134 expression following SIRT1 deficiency results in the downregulated expression of CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), thereby impairing synaptic plasticity. These findings demonstrate a new role for SIRT1 in cognition and a previously unknown microRNA-based mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates these processes. Furthermore, these results describe a separate branch of SIRT1 signalling, in which SIRT1 has a direct role in regulating normal brain function in a manner that is disparate from its cell survival functions, demonstrating its value as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of central nervous system disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2008263877,"Local field potentials and the underlying endogenous electric fields (EFs) are traditionally considered to be epiphenomena of structured neuronal network activity. Recently, however, externally applied EFs have been shown to modulate pharmacologically evoked network activity in rodent hippocampus. In contrast, very little is known about the role of endogenous EFs during physiological activity states in neocortex. Here, we used the neocortical slow oscillation in vitro as a model system to show that weak sinusoidal and naturalistic EFs enhance and entrain physiological neocortical network activity with an amplitude threshold within the range of in vivo endogenous field strengths. Modulation of network activity by positive and negative feedback fields based on the network activity in real-time provide direct evidence for a feedback loop between neuronal activity and endogenous EF. This significant susceptibility of active networks to EFs that only cause small changes in membrane potential in individual neurons suggests that endogenous EFs could guide neocortical network activity."
https://openalex.org/W2065059951,"Behçet's disease is a genetically complex disease of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent inflammatory attacks affecting the orogenital mucosa, eyes and skin. We performed a genome-wide association study with 311,459 SNPs in 1,215 individuals with Behçet's disease (cases) and 1,278 healthy controls from Turkey. We confirmed the known association of Behçet's disease with HLA-B*51 and identified a second, independent association within the MHC Class I region. We also identified an association at IL10 (rs1518111, P = 1.88 x 10(-8)). Using a meta-analysis with an additional five cohorts from Turkey, the Middle East, Europe and Asia, comprising a total of 2,430 cases and 2,660 controls, we identified associations at IL10 (rs1518111, P = 3.54 x 10(-18), odds ratio = 1.45, 95% CI 1.34-1.58) and the IL23R-IL12RB2 locus (rs924080, P = 6.69 x 10(-9), OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39). The disease-associated IL10 variant (the rs1518111 A allele) was associated with diminished mRNA expression and low protein production."

We now report that ipRGCs are more abundant and diverse than previously appreciated, project more widely within the brain, and can support spatial visual perception. A Cre-based melanopsin reporter mouse line revealed at least five subtypes of ipRGCs with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. Collectively, these cells project beyond the known brain targets of ipRGCs to heavily innervate the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, retinotopically organized nuclei mediating object localization and discrimination. Mice lacking classical rod-cone photoreception, and thus entirely dependent on melanopsin for light detection, were able to discriminate grating stimuli from equiluminant gray and had measurable visual acuity. Thus, nonclassical retinal photoreception occurs within diverse cell types and influences circuits and functions encompassing luminance as well as spatial information.

These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) combine their direct, melanopsin-based photoresponses with signals derived from rods and cones and convey these directly to a subset of retinal targets in the brain.

Other variants of ipRGCs have been reported, some with cell bodies displaced to the inner nuclear layer and others with bistratified dendritic arbors (sometimes called “type III cells” and here termed M3 cells) (Hattar et al., 2002Hattar S.

The photosensitivity and brain projections of these newer cell types are less well characterized than those of M1 ipRGCs. The identification of new subtypes of melanopsin cells raises the prospect that the ipRGC retinal diversity extends to new innervation of brain targets for supporting other light-dependent physiological functions. To characterize the diversity of melanopsin cells in morphology, electrophysiology, and brain targets, we made knock-in mice (Opn4Cre) that express the Cre recombinase in place of the melanopsin (Opn4) open reading frame (Figures S1A and S1B). The Opn4Cre system allows the manipulation of loxP-flanked target genes selectively in melanopsin-expressing cells (Hatori et al., 2008Hatori M. Le H. Vollmers C. Keding S.R. Tanaka N. Buch T. Waisman A. Schmedt C. Jegla T. Panda S. Inducible ablation of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells reveals their central role in non-image forming visual responses.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To visualize cells that express the CRE protein, we mated Opn4Cre mice to one of two Cre-dependent reporter lines that use the same strong promoter (β-actin promoter and CMV enhancer; CAG) to drive the reporter gene expression (Figures S1C and S1D). Cre-mediated recombination triggers expression of placental alkaline phosphatase in one of these lines (Z/AP; Lobe et al., 1999Lobe C.G. Koop K.E. Kreppner W. Lomeli H. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Z/AP, a double reporter for cre-mediated recombination.Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the other line (Z/EG; Novak et al., 2000Novak A. Guo C. Yang W. Nagy A. Lobe C.G. Z/EG, a double reporter mouse line that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein upon Cre-mediated excision.Genesis. 2000; 28: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In both reporter lines, a small percentage of ganglion cells were labeled with the reporter protein (Figures 1A and 1B ) and labeled dendrites arborized both in the inner and outer sublaminae of the IPL (Figure 1A), as expected from the laminar distribution of melanopsin protein (Provencio et al., 2002Provencio I. Rollag M.D. Castrucci A.M. Photoreceptive net in the mammalian retina. This mesh of cells may explain how some blind mice can still tell day from night.Nature. 2002; 415: 493Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Since similar knock-in strategies have successfully expressed several transgenes in ipRGCs (Guler et al., 2008Guler A.D. Ecker J.L. Lall G.S. Haq S. Altimus C.M. Liao H.W. Barnard A.R. Cahill H. Badea T.C. Zhao H. et al.Melanopsin cells are the principal conduits for rod-cone input to non-image-forming vision.Nature. 2008; 453: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, Hattar et al., 2002Hattar S. Liao H.W. Takao M. Berson D.M. Yau K.W. Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells: architecture, projections, and intrinsic photosensitivity.Science. 2002; 295: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the majority of melanopsin-immunoreactive cells expressed the reporter proteins, indicating that the reporter line consistently identifies melanopsin-expressing cells (Figure 1C–1H). However, many ganglion cells lacking melanopsin immunoreactivity also expressed the marker, as observed in a previous publication using another Opn4Cre line (Hatori et al., 2008Hatori M. Le H. Vollmers C. Keding S.R. Tanaka N. Buch T. Waisman A. Schmedt C. Jegla T. Panda S. Inducible ablation of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells reveals their central role in non-image forming visual responses.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The total number of cells expressing the reporter proteins greatly exceeded prior estimates of melanopsin-expressing neurons. For example, in Opn4Cre/+; Z/AP mice, we counted 2058 ± 141 cells per retina (n = 4), two to three times more cells than exhibit antimelanopsin immunostaining (Lin et al., 2008Lin B. Koizumi A. Tanaka N. Panda S. Masland R.H. Restoration of visual function in retinal degeneration mice by ectopic expression of melanopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Liao H.W. Takao M. Berson D.M. Yau K.W.

Neurol. 2006; 497: 326-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of EGFP-positive ganglion cells in Opn4Cre/+; Z/EG mice, in the presence of synaptic blockers, revealed that nearly all (46 of 51 cells tested; 90%) were intrinsically photosensitive (Figures 2 and S2), even when they lacked detectable melanopsin immunoreactivity (Figures 2H and 2I). Under pharmacological blockade of retinal synapses, these cells exhibited sluggish, persistent light responses, characteristic of melanopsin-based phototransduction (Wong et al., 2005Wong K.Y.

Photoreceptor adaptation in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.Neuron. 2005; 48: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Wong et al., 2007Wong K.Y. Dunn F.A. Graham D.M. Berson D.M. Synaptic influences on rat ganglion-cell photoreceptors.J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A small minority of EGFP-labeled cells lacked demonstrable intrinsic photosensitivity (5 of 51 cells; 10%), but exhibited brisk synaptically driven light responses (data not shown). Such cells either may have leaky expression or may have transiently expressed melanopsin during development; this would have triggered permanent expression of the marker proteins, since after Cre-mediated excision of the stop codon, marker protein expression is regulated solely by the promoter of the reporter transgene (Figures S1C and S1D). We also detected the marker proteins in a small percentage of rods and cones; these were melanopsin immunonegative (Figures 1C–1H). Their labeling by the marker proteins could be either due to leaky or transient expression of Cre or because the Cre system is more sensitive than immunohistochemistry for detecting melanopsin expression. The finding may be linked to melanopsin-like immunoreactivity in a very few human cones (Dkhissi-Benyahya et al., 2006Dkhissi-Benyahya O. Rieux C. Hut R.A. Cooper H.M. Immunohistochemical evidence of a melanopsin cone in human retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We used dye filling to visualize the morphology of the reporter-labeled cells that were intrinsically photosensitive. Labeled cells included not only the previously characterized M1 and M2 ipRGCs, but also several new morphologically distinct ganglion cell types (Figure 2 and S2). M1 ipRGCs had sparsely branching monostratified dendritic ramifications in the outermost IPL, had an average dendritic field diameter of 350 ± 87 μm (mean ± SD; n = 12), and cell body diameter of 15.6 ± 2.4 μm (n = 7; Figure 2A). M2 ipRGCs had relatively large radiate dendritic arbors (Figure 2B) stratifying within the inner half of the IPL (ON sublayer). Dendritic field diameters (324 ± 30 μm; mean ± SD; n = 4) were similar in size to those of M1 ipRGCs, but the arbors were more orderly, with more regular branching angles and more uniform dendritic density within the field (Figure 3A ). The cell bodies of M2 ipRGCs were slightly larger on average than those of M1 cells (17.4 ± 1.7 μm; n = 5). All M1 and M2 ipRGCs tested were melanopsin immunopositive (Figures 2D–2G; n = 15 M1 and 11 M2). Though both subtypes invariably exhibited an intrinsic light response (Figures 2J and 2K), the response in M1 ipRGCs was an order of magnitude larger than that of the M2 ipRGCs with a shorter latency to peak (Figures 2J, S3A, and S3B), confirming an earlier report (Schmidt and Kofuji, 2009Schmidt T.M. Kofuji P. Functional and morphological differences among intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We encountered at least two additional subtypes of intrinsically photosensitive cells among the EGFP-positive ganglion cells that were melanopsin immunonegative (Figures 2H and 2I and Figure S2; data not shown). One type resembled an ON alpha ganglion cell (Figure 2C, n = 6), with a large soma (17.1–22.3 μm diameter; n = 3) and a large radiate dendritic arbor (302–444 μm diameter; n = 3) monostratifying in the ON sublayer. These cells exhibited weak intrinsic light responses (Figure 2L; peak photocurrent of 18.5 ± 11.4 pA; n = 4). We provisionally term these alpha-like cells “M4,” (reserving “M3” for the bistratified ipRGCs). The second type of EGFP-positive but melanopsin-immunonegative ipRGC also stratified in the ON sublayer of the IPL but could be distinguished from both M2 and alpha-like M4 ipRGCs by its relatively compact, highly branched dendritic arbor (Figure S2A; diameter: 149–217 μm; n = 3). Of the eight cells of this group that were tested, seven were intrinsically photosensitive, although as with the M2 and M4 ipRGCs, these responses were much weaker (peak photocurrents 12.9 ± 4 pA, Figure S2B) than those of M1 ipRGCs. We provisionally term these smaller field bushy type neurons “M5 cells.” The M2 and M4 ipRGCs are the least readily distinguished, because both have large radiate dendritic arbors stratifying in the ON sublayer. To clarify the morphological distinctions between them, we filled dozens of EGFP-positive RGCs by intracellular dye injection with sharp electrodes, an efficient method for high-quality filling. We reconstructed the somadendritic profiles of all well-filled cells with wide-field dendritic arbors limited to the inner IPL (thus excluding M1, M3 [bistratified], and M5 cells). Dye filled cells could be readily divided into M2 and M4 subtypes (Figure 3). Drawings of representative examples show that M2 cells had dendritic arbors that were sparser and slightly smaller than those of M4 cells (Figure 3). By comparison with M4 cells, M2 cells had fewer branchpoints (Figure 3C), less total dendritic length (Figure 3B), and smaller dendritic-field diameters (Figure 3C). Their axons also appeared consistently finer than those of M4 cells. We encountered three additional EGFP-positive cells that were intrinsically photosensitive but lacked detectable melanopsin immunoreactivity. These were not easily grouped with any of the subtypes described above; all had relatively weak intrinsic light responses (<20 pA) and bushy, highly branched dendrites. Our failure to detect melanopsin in these unclassified cells or in the M4 and M5 ipRGCs is presumably because their expression of the pigment is very low and because both the Cre labeling system and electrophysiological recordings of photoresponses detect it with greater sensitivity than does immunofluorescence. All of the ipRGC cell types also exhibited synaptically mediated excitatory influences from rods and/or cones, as reflected by brisk light responses that were abolished by blockade of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (Figures S3C–S3F). In order to trace the axons of the new types of melanopsin cells to their brain targets, we used the Opn4Cre/+; Z/AP mouse, which uses the same promoter as the Z/EG line (Figures S1C and S1D). Placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) is expressed in the plasma membrane of tagged cells, including their axons, where it can be visualized by histochemical staining. In the retina, the AP staining was similar to that observed with EGFP labeling in the Opn4Cre/+; Z/EG (Figure 1), with similar cell numbers and morphological subtypes. We examined the distribution of AP-positive axons in the brain to obtain an overview of the central projections of all ipRGCs. Labeled axons were evident in the optic nerve, chiasm and tract as well as in a number of central visual nuclei (Figures 4A–4E ). Before attributing all such axonal labeling to retinofugal fibers, however, we had to consider nonretinal sources, since AP was expressed in a limited number of neurons distributed in the cerebral cortex, diencephalon, and brainstem (Figures S4F and S4G). We examined brain sections from mice in which both eyes had been removed 3 weeks earlier, sufficient time to ensure virtually complete degeneration of retinofugal axons (Figure S4). Essentially no AP staining remained within the retinorecipient nuclei in these animals (Figures S4A–S4E), whereas cellular and axonal labeling persisted in most nonvisual areas (Figures S4F and S4G). Therefore, all fiber labeling within visual nuclei arises from AP-positive retinal ganglion cells. Labeled retinofugal fibers terminated in all of the previously established targets of melanopsin-expressing RGCs (Baver et al., 2008Baver S.B. Pickard G.E. Sollars P.J.

The most comprehensive prior description of the projections of melanopsin-expressing RGCs was based on a reporter mouse (Opn4tau-LacZ) in which a gene coding for the tau signal peptide fused to β-galactosidase was targeted to the melanopsin (Opn4) gene locus (Hattar et al., 2006Hattar S.

In contrast, at least five ganglion-cell types express AP in the Opn4Cre/+; Z/AP line by virtue of melanopsin-driven Cre-mediated recombination including displaced and bistratified ipRGCs. Comparing labeled fiber distributions between the Opn4tau-LacZ/+ and Opn4Cre/+; Z/AP thus provides important clues to the central targets of non-M1 melanopsin cells. Therefore, we stained coronal brain sections from Opn4tau-LacZ/+ and Opn4Cre/+; Z/AP and compared the distribution of axons labeled by the reporter proteins in several retinorecipient nuclei of the brain (Figures 4A–4E). With the more sensitive Cre-dependent AP labeling, we find much more extensive axonal labeling in the dLGN (especially ventromedially; Figure 5), the core of the OPN, the posterior pretectal nucleus, and the superior colliculus (SC) than that of LacZ line (Hattar et al., 2006Hattar S.

This aberrant lipid load results from tumor-induced elevation of the scavenger receptor Msr1 on dendritic cells, and it can be targeted therapeutically to improve the efficiency of anticancer vaccines. Dendritic cells (DCs), a type of professional antigen-presenting cells, are responsible for initiation and maintenance of immune responses. Here we report that a substantial proportion of DCs in tumor-bearing mice and people with cancer have high amounts of triglycerides as compared with DCs from tumor-free mice and healthy individuals. In our studies, lipid accumulation in DCs was caused by increased uptake of extracellular lipids due to upregulation of scavenger receptor A. DCs with high lipid content were not able to effectively stimulate allogeneic T cells or present tumor-associated antigens. DCs with high and normal lipid levels did not differ in expression of major histocompatibility complex and co-stimulatory molecules. However, lipid-laden DCs had a reduced capacity to process antigens. Pharmacological normalization of lipid abundance in DCs with an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase restored the functional activity of DCs and substantially enhanced the effects of cancer vaccines. These findings suggest that immune responses in cancer can be improved by manipulating the lipid levels in DCs."

Ohm et al. report the sequence of the genetically tractable species Schizophyllum commune and identify genes involved in the formation of fruiting bodies and the degradation of lignocellulose. Much remains to be learned about the biology of mushroom-forming fungi, which are an important source of food, secondary metabolites and industrial enzymes. The wood-degrading fungus Schizophyllum commune is both a genetically tractable model for studying mushroom development and a likely source of enzymes capable of efficient degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. Comparative analyses of its 38.5-megabase genome, which encodes 13,210 predicted genes, reveal the species's unique wood-degrading machinery. One-third of the 471 genes predicted to encode transcription factors are differentially expressed during sexual development of S. commune. Whereas inactivation of one of these, fst4, prevented mushroom formation, inactivation of another, fst3, resulted in more, albeit smaller, mushrooms than in the wild-type fungus. Antisense transcripts may also have a role in the formation of fruiting bodies. Better insight into the mechanisms underlying mushroom formation should affect commercial production of mushrooms and their industrial use for producing enzymes and pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2052094075,"The functional relationship and cross-regulation between autophagy and apoptosis is complex. In this study we show that the high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a redox-sensitive regulator of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis. In cancer cells, anticancer agents enhanced autophagy and apoptosis, as well as HMGB1 release. HMGB1 release may be a prosurvival signal for residual cells after various cytotoxic cancer treatments. Diminished HMGB1 by short hairpin RNA transfection or inhibition of HMGB1 release by ethyl pyruvate or other small molecules led predominantly to apoptosis and decreased autophagy in stressed cancer cells. In this setting, reducible HMGB1 binds to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs), but not to Toll-like receptor 4, induces Beclin1-dependent autophagy and promotes tumor resistance to alkylators (melphalan), tubulin disrupting agents (paclitaxel), DNA crosslinkers (ultraviolet light) and DNA intercalators (oxaliplatin or adriamycin). On the contrary, oxidized HMGB1 increases the cytotoxicity of these agents and induces apoptosis mediated by the caspase-9/-3 intrinsic pathway. HMGB1 release, as well as its redox state, thus links autophagy and apoptosis, representing a suitable target when coupled with conventional tumor treatments."

Here we report that the PHD and Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein, PHF8, while using multiple substrates, including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1 demethylase. PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on interaction with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction with E2F1, HCF-1 (also known as HCFC1) and SET1A (also known as SETD1A), at least in part, by removing the repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated gene promoters. Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin in prophase is apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1 during early mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin II loading process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in two non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits, N-CAPD3 and N-CAPG2 (also known as NCAPD3 and NCAPG2, respectively), are capable of recognizing H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrates a significant overlap of condensin II and H4K20me1 sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, the identification and characterization of an H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8, has revealed an intimate link between this enzyme and two distinct events in cell cycle progression."

More recently, there has been a surge in research devoted to understanding the contributions of left lateral parietal cortex (LLPC) to memory retrieval (for review, see Wagner et al., 2005Wagner A.D.

The multitude of processing descriptions arising from studies in these domains suggests that distinct regions in parietal cortex might subserve unique functional contributions. As Devlin and Poldrack, 2007Devlin J.T. Poldrack R.A. In praise of tedious anatomy.Neuroimage. 2007; 37: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar have argued, the success of functional neuroimaging is contingent on the ability to accurately and precisely map function to underlying neuroanatomy. The primary goal of the current study is to better define divisions that exist within LLPC. As a means of identifying potential distinctions, we use a combined resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) approach. The fMRI data includes studies related to memory retrieval, which will be used to leverage the distinctions seen with rs-fcMRI-based analyses and to better understand how specific LLPC regions contribute to this domain. Determining the functional-neuroanatomical correlates of memory retrieval has driven a considerable amount of work in cognitive neuroscience. In particular, a great deal of research has been aimed at understanding how humans distinguish between previously experienced information (“old”) and that which is novel (“new”) (Henson et al., 2000Henson R.N. Rugg M.D. Shallice T. Dolan R.J. Confidence in recognition memory for words: Dissociating right prefrontal roles in episodic retrieval.J. Cogn.

Functional dissociation among components of remembering: Control, perceived oldness, and content.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3869-3880PubMed Google Scholar). Using fMRI, researchers have classified a set of regions in the brain that tend to be more active when human subjects correctly identify an item as old (“hit”) than when a given item is correctly identified as being new (“correct rejection”). This difference in activation has come to be called the “retrieval success effect” and is present in a highly distributed set of brain regions. The most common regions showing retrieval success effects are in lateral parietal cortex (Simons et al., 2008Simons J.S. Peers P.V. Hwang D.Y. Ally B.A. Fletcher P.C. Budson A.E. Is the parietal lobe necessary for recollection in humans?.Neuropsychologia. 2008; 46: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and though this differential activation is typically bilateral, the most robust effects include a large expanse of LLPC (McDermott et al., 2009McDermott K.B. Szpunar K.K. Christ S.E. Laboratory-based and autobiographical retrieval tasks differ substantially in their neural substrates.Neuropsychologia. 2009; 47: 2290-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A number of laboratories (Cabeza et al., 2008Cabeza R. Ciaramelli E. Olson I.R. Moscovitch M. The parietal cortex and episodic memory: an attentional account.Nat. Rev.

Rugg M.D. Memory retrieval and the parietal cortex: a review of evidence from a dual-process perspective.Neuropsychologia. 2008; 46: 1787-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) have begun exploring the role of LLPC contributions to memory retrieval by performing metaanalyses in which data from large numbers of studies involving a variety of different retrieval tasks are analyzed in a common stereotactic space. The anatomical location of foci within LLPC can be differentiated on the basis of responses in paradigms contrasting recollection and familiarity, or source and item memory, as well as a number of other tasks in which old and new information is embedded. A consistent finding across these studies is the presence of a dorsal-ventral distinction in LLPC that appears to dissociate regions near intraparietal sulcus (IPS) involved in familiarity judgments (dorsal), and regions near angular gyrus involved in recollection (ventral) (Henson et al., 1999Henson R.N. Rugg M.D. Shallice T. Josephs O. Dolan R.J. Recollection and familiarity in recognition memory: an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3962-3972PubMed Google Scholar, Wheeler and Buckner, 2004Wheeler M.E. Buckner R.L. Functional-anatomic correlates of remembering and knowing.Neuroimage. 2004; 21: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Mapping estimates of recollection and familiarity onto distinct regions of LLPC represents one way in which the functional neuroanatomy underlying separate types of processing can be distinguished. However, even within the domain of memory retrieval, this distinction does not represent an extensive view of possible parcellations of LLPC. Further, a failure to incorporate “nonretrieval” related accounts of parietal mechanisms could result in an incomplete description of boundaries that exist within LLPC. A deeper understanding of the processing roles of LLPC is likely to be bolstered by the ability to apply objective parcellation schemes using a variety of analysis techniques. One such technique, rs-fcMRI boundary mapping, is based on the observation that rs-fcMRI can dissociate regions within the cortex using edge-detection algorithms (Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.L. Fair D.A. Dosenbach N.U. Miezin F.M. Dierker D. Van Essen D.C. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Defining functional areas in individual human brains using resting functional connectivity MRI.Neuroimage. 2008; 41: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This procedure uses a seed-based approach (Biswal et al., 1995Biswal B. Yetkin F. Haughton V. Hyde J. Functional connectivity in the motor cortex of resting human brain using echo-planar MRI.Magn. Reson. Med. 1995; 34: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (6358) Google Scholar, Fox et al., 2005Fox M.D. Snyder A.Z. Vincent J.L. Corbetta M. Van Essen D.C. Raichle M.E. The human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anticorrelated functional networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9673-9678Crossref PubMed Scopus (5608) Google Scholar) to identify regions whose rs-fcMRI-derived time course is significantly correlated with the time course of the seed location. The result is a whole-brain correlation map that indicates the degree of correlation between the seed and all other voxels in the brain. Specifically, the technique developed in Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.L. Fair D.A. Dosenbach N.U. Miezin F.M. Dierker D. Van Essen D.C. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Defining functional areas in individual human brains using resting functional connectivity MRI.Neuroimage. 2008; 41: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar detects transitions between whole-brain correlation maps of nearby cortical seeds, and translates these abrupt transitions into boundaries between cortical regions. A key concept underlying this approach that will be underscored by the present report is that global brain relationships can facilitate the parcellation of anatomically adjacent pieces of cortex. The current study begins with such rs-fcMRI boundary mapping to identify “correlationally” distinct regions in LLPC. These regions then serve as a launching point from which to probe a set of recognition memory fMRI studies for distinctions within LLPC. We find that LLPC regions divide along anatomical lines into an anterior group that does not display retrieval success effects, and a posterior group that does. These findings are augmented with large-scale network analysis of rs-fcMRI signal correlations between LLPC regions and regions located outside of LLPC using tools from graph theory. This analysis confirms the anterior/posterior distinction and divides the retrieval success regions into four groups embedded in distinct whole-brain rs-fcMRI networks. This final LLPC parcellation scheme is then corroborated by demonstrating that within the distinct whole-brain networks, the task-evoked signals shown by LLPC regions are shared by distinct sets of regions outside of LLPC. The results presented here can be viewed as the application of multiple analyses to two distinct imaging methodologies (fMRI and rs-fcMRI) both locally (within LLPC) and for distributed sets of regions (large-scale cortical networks) (Figure 1). In order to parcellate LLPC and investigate its functional properties, an understanding of the local topography and heterogeneity is a critical starting point. The discovery that boundaries can be defined on the basis of abrupt changes in whole-brain rs-fcMRI maps (Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.L. Fair D.A. Dosenbach N.U. Miezin F.M. Dierker D. Van Essen D.C. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Defining functional areas in individual human brains using resting functional connectivity MRI.Neuroimage. 2008; 41: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) provided a method (rs-fcMRI boundary mapping) by which to place regions of interest (ROI) in locations where rs-fcMRI maps are relatively stable and interrogate their function. For the purposes of this experiment, a 27 × 27 grid of small spherical foci (6 mm diameter) was generated over the extent of LLPC (Figure 2A ) using Caret software (Van Essen et al., 2001Van Essen D.C. Dickson J. Harwell J. Hanlon D. Anderson C.H. Drury H.A. An integrated software suite for surface-based analyses of cerebral cortex.J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 2001; 8: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The grid extended outside of traditional bounds of parietal cortex to decrease the chance that any functional borders near the anatomical boundaries of LLPC would go undetected. (A) A square patch of 729 spherical foci (6 mm diameter, 27 × 27 grid, spaced 6 mm apart) was created using Caret software (Van Essen et al., 2001Van Essen D.C. Dickson J. Harwell J. Hanlon D. Anderson C.H. Drury H.A. An integrated software suite for surface-based analyses of cerebral cortex.J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 2001; 8: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) and is shown here on an inflated cortical surface rendering. The surface is rotated to allow better visualization of LLPC. A, anterior; P, posterior; L, lateral; M, medial. (B) rs-fcMRI boundary map indicating the likelihood of a border at each seed. “Cooler” colors represent stable rs-fcMRI patterns, whereas “hotter” colors represent high border likelihood, i.e., rapidly changing rs-fcMRI patterns.

The blue circle indicates regions of interest (ROI) located within LLPC. (D) Unprojected data from (C) allowing better visualization of borders. Gray dots represent ROIs with those circled in blue indicating regions located within LLPC. For orientation purposes, the grid contains anatomical labels that roughly correspond to these locations on the cortical surface. SMG, supramarginal gyrus; SPL, superior parietal lobule; IPS, intraparietal sulcus. The resulting rs-fcMRI boundary map that depicts the boundary likelihood at any given focus in the patch is shown in Figure 2B. “Hot” and “cool” colors indicate high and low probabilities, respectively, of the existence of a boundary. The apparent centers of the bounded regions in LLPC were obtained by inverting the map such that “hot” colors now indicated rs-fcMRI map consistency between nearby seeds (Figures 2C and 2D). ROIs were defined as 10 mm diameter spheres at peak locations using 2D peak-finding algorithms. This resulted in 25 ROIs across the grid. Ten of the defined ROIs were outside of parietal cortex and were excluded from further analyses, leaving 15 LLPC ROIs as the targets of additional investigation. We next applied these LLPC ROIs to a number of studies that contained a contrast of “old” versus “new” items and performed a metaanalysis (Table 1). Only the seven more posterior ROIs showed consistent retrieval success effects (Figure 3A , green circles), defining a strong functional boundary between region sets. Additional details can be found in the published manuscripts listed in the table. (A) ROIs circled in green indicate those that showed retrieval success effects across the eight studies that comprised the metaanalysis, while ROIs circled in red did not. The thick black line indicates this distinction. ROIs are displayed on inflated cortical surface renderings of the human brain using Caret software.

Previously, it was speculated that retrieval success regions may be divided through the examination of differential time course dynamics in adjacent regions and that this would be critical in determining an appropriate level of parcellation in LLPC (Wheeler and Buckner, 2004Wheeler M.E. Buckner R.L. Functional-anatomic correlates of remembering and knowing.Neuroimage. 2004; 21: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we extracted time courses from three LLPC ROIs near those investigated in Wheeler and Buckner, 2004Wheeler M.E. Buckner R.L. Functional-anatomic correlates of remembering and knowing.Neuroimage. 2004; 21: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar located in posterior middle intraparietal sulcus (pmIPS), posterior inferior parietal lobule (pIPL), and angular gyrus (AG) (Figures 3B–3D) to determine whether there was a difference in their profiles. A region × time repeated-measures ANOVA with three levels of region and 14 levels of time (seven time points each for hit and cr) showed a significant interaction effect (F(12,84) = 17.35, p < 0.001). Post-hoc analyses revealed a significant region × time interaction for all three pairwise comparisons of time courses including pmIPS versus pIPL (F(12,84) = 13.13, p < 0.001), pmIPS versus AG (F(12,84) = 28.43, p < 0.001), and pIPL versus AG (F(12,84) = 6.99, p < 0.001). Although there is a clear statistical dissociation between IPS and AG time courses (Figures 3B and 3D), the time course in pIPL (Figure 3C) does resemble an average of IPS and AG time courses. Thus, while the time course in pIPL may reflect a truly distinct signal, the possibility exists that this is simply an artifact of the spatial averaging of the signals from pmIPS and AG. The close proximity of these regions poses problems as we attempt to draw functional distinctions. The question of how to resolve this ambiguity motivated, in part, the remaining analyses (Table 2). Significant statistical effects (p < 0.05) are shown in bold text. X, Y, and Z values correspond to stereotactic coordinates in MNI space. Since the initial definition of the LLPC regions was driven by differences in whole-brain rs-fcMRI relationships, one avenue toward addressing this ambiguity is to interrogate the whole-brain relationships of specific regions of LLPC. In other words, which regions outside of LLPC are most strongly functionally connected to each of the LLPC regions (the region's “neighborhood”), and do regions in different neighborhoods show distinct functional time courses? If an LLPC region, such as pIPL, possesses a functional (fMRI), task-evoked time course reflecting some functional process, do other regions in its neighborhood share similar functional time courses? The following sections aim to provide answers to these questions through the exploration of relationships of LLPC regions to regions elsewhere in the brain. The next step is to define sets of regions that are related to LLPC regions using rs-fcMRI data. Although rs-fcMRI boundary mapping and subsequent peak-finding algorithms can separate adjacent cortex into distinct regions based on underlying differences in rs-fcMRI correlation maps, they do not reveal what the actual underlying differences are that drive these spatial distinctions. To explore these differences, we generated rs-fcMRI “neighborhoods,” defined as the sets of regions most highly correlated with each of the 15 LLPC ROIs. Figure 4A shows an example neighborhood derived from a seed location in left AG, one of the LLPC ROIs examined in the previous analysis (see Figure 3D). For a given seed location, the 15 most correlated regions were included to ensure a manageable aggregate set from all LLPC ROIs (see Experimental Procedures section on rs-fcMRI “Neighborhood” generation). It is important to note that since boundaries indicate abrupt change in whole-brain rs-fcMRI maps, adjacent regions will likely contain different, but potentially overlapping, sets of neighbors. Figure 4B depicts the seed maps for all 15 LLPC ROIs and a portion of the identified neighbors for each ROI on the left lateral surface of the cortex. Neighbors that appeared in more than one seed map were consolidated to eliminate overlap (see Experimental Procedures), resulting in 87 final neighbors that spanned the cortex and cerebellum (Figure 4C, cerebellum not shown). The 87 neighbors and 15 LLPC ROIs formed a collection of 102 ROIs, which could then be viewed as a network of 102 nodes related to each other by rs-fcMRI correlations. The next set of analyses was aimed at understanding this network, and in particular, whether distinct groupings or “modules” existed within the network, which might provide further distinctions between the LLPC ROIs. Tools from graph theory have become instrumental in determining structure within large-scale brain networks (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009Bullmore E. Sporns O. Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (6330) Google Scholar, Sporns and Zwi, 2004Sporns O. Zwi J.D. The small world of the cerebral cortex.Neuroinformatics. 2004; 2: 145-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Networks are collections of items (nodes) possessing pairwise relations (edges) between each item, and community-detection analyses can decompose networks into functionally related subsets of nodes called “communities” or “modules.” For example, a person's social network might include a module of coworkers, a module of relatives, and a module of teammates, each of which is richly connected internally, but possesses few connections to other modules. To assess the underlying grouping of our LLPC ROIs and their neighbors, community detection analysis using modularity optimization (Newman, 2006Newman M.E. Modularity and community structure in networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8577-8582Crossref PubMed Scopus (6372) Google Scholar) was performed on the matrix of pairwise rs-fcMRI correlations between the 102 ROIs. Modularity optimization separated the ROIs derived from the neighborhood analysis into four distinct sets of regions, or modules (Figure 5; Figure S1, available online). The supramarginal gyrus (SMG) module (blue, Figures 5A and 5B; Table 3) included regions in bilateral SMG, anterior and posterior insula, frontal operculum, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and supplementary motor area (SMA). The superior parietal lobule (SPL) module (orange, Figures 5A and 5B; Table 3) contained regions in bilateral SPL, putative human “frontal eye fields” (FEF), anterior IPS, and postcentral gyrus. The IPS module (brown, Figures 5A and 5B; Table 4) included regions in bilateral IPS, dorsal frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior PFC (aPFC), and lateral temporal cortex. The AG module (light purple, Figures 5A and 5B; Table 4) consisted of regions in bilateral AG, posterior cingulate, medial PFC (mPFC), superior frontal gyrus (FG), ventrolateral PFC, anterior lateral temporal cortex, posterior IPL, and right cerebellum.Table 3Regions Belonging to the SPL and SMG Modules and Their Corresponding Submodule AssignmentRegionXYZModuleSubmoduleR lateral anterior IPS (1)55−2042SPLSPL/FEFR FEF (2)26−455SPLSPL/FEFR SPL (3)25−5164SPLSPL/FEFR anterior IPS (4)42−3351SPLSPL/FEFL FEF (5)−27−755SPLSPL/FEFR FEF (6)25−1569SPLSPL/FEFL FEF (7)−18−1063SPLSPL/FEFL SPL (8)−17−4768SPLSPL/FEFR SPL (9)35−3762SPLSPL/FEFR SPL (10)14−4660SPLSPL/FEFL anterior IPS (11)−44−2556SPLSPL/FEFR postcentral gyrus (12)39−1760SPLSPL/FEFR SPL (13)18−3360SPLSPL/FEFL medial anterior IPS (14)−40−3747SPLSPL/FEFL lateral anterior IPS (15)−55−2838SPLSPL/FEFL SPL (16)−24−5862SPLSPL/FEFL SPL (17)−29−4465SPLSPL/FEFL anterior IPS (18)−36−4154SPLSPL/FEFR SMA (19)9−1152SPLSMA/dACCL SMA (20)−1−152SMGSMA/dACCL dorsal anterior cingulate (21)−5837SMGSMA/dACCR SMA (22)2−664SMGSMA/dACCR SMA (23)8359SMGSMA/dACCR dorsal anterior cingulate (24)11628SMGSMA/dACCR pre-SMA (25)5642SMGSMA/dACCL anterior IPL (26)−60−4044SMGSMG/insulaL inferior frontal (27)−47−113SMGSMG/insulaR inferior frontal (28)39−213SMGSMG/insulaR middle insula (29)3952SMGSMG/insulaR inferior frontal (30)6073SMGSMG/insulaL anterior insula (31)−31175SMGSMG/insulaR anterior insula (32)36207SMGSMG/insulaR SMG (33)65−2425SMGSMG/insulaL middle insula (34)−402−1SMGSMG/insulaL inferior frontal (35)−5665SMGSMG/insulaR inferior frontal (36)5108SMGSMG/insulaR inferior frontal (37)581611SMGSMG/insulaR anterior PFC (38)354932SMGSMG/insulaR SMG (39)68−3930SMGSMG/insulaL posterior insula (40)−36−16−4SMGSMG/insulaL inferior frontal (41)−56−1612SMGSMG/insulaL inferior frontal (42)−51−2222SMGSMG/insulaR inferior frontal (43)4512−4SMGSMG/insulaR SMG (44)53−3426SMGSMG/insulaL SMG (45)−56−4231SMGSMG/insulaL SMG (46)−63−2926SMGSMG/insulaX, Y, and Z values correspond to stereotactic coordinates in MNI space.

https://openalex.org/W2086578831,"Hydrogen bonds between backbone amides are common in folded proteins. Here, we show that an intimate interaction between backbone amides also arises from the delocalization of a lone pair of electrons (n) from an oxygen atom to the antibonding orbital (pi*) of the subsequent carbonyl group. Natural bond orbital analysis predicted significant n-->pi* interactions in certain regions of the Ramachandran plot. These predictions were validated by a statistical analysis of a large, non-redundant subset of protein structures determined to high resolution. The correlation between these two independent studies is striking. Moreover, the n-->pi* interactions are abundant and especially prevalent in common secondary structures such as alpha-, 3(10)- and polyproline II helices and twisted beta-sheets. In addition to their evident effects on protein structure and stability, n-->pi* interactions could have important roles in protein folding and function, and merit inclusion in computational force fields."

To demonstrate their presence in native tissues, we developed a time-resolved FRET strategy that is based on receptor labeling with selective fluorescent ligands. Specific FRET signals were observed with four different receptors expressed in cell lines, consistent with their dimeric or oligomeric nature in these transfected cells. More notably, the comparison between FRET signals measured with sets of fluorescent agonists and antagonists was consistent with an asymmetric relationship of the two protomers in an activated GPCR dimer. Finally, we applied the strategy to native tissues and succeeded in demonstrating the presence of oxytocin receptor dimers and/or oligomers in mammary gland."

https://openalex.org/W1980496921,"X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a complex human disease that causes intellectual disability. Causal mutations have been found in approximately 90 X-linked genes; however, molecular and biological functions of many of these genetically defined XLMR genes remain unknown. PHF8 (PHD (plant homeo domain) finger protein 8) is a JmjC domain-containing protein and its mutations have been found in patients with XLMR and craniofacial deformities. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8 as the first mono-methyl histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1) demethylase, with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2. PHF8 is located around the transcription start sites (TSS) of approximately 7,000 RefSeq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions (non-TSS). PHF8 depletion resulted in upregulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the TSS and H3K9me2 in the non-TSS sites, respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene expression, which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic domains. Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8 catalytic function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish brain and jaw development, thus providing a potentially relevant biological context for understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8 patients. Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supports a model whereby PHF8 regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw development in part by directly regulating the expression of the homeodomain transcription factor MSX1/MSXB, which functions downstream of multiple signalling and developmental pathways. Our findings indicate that an imbalance of histone methylation dynamics has a critical role in XLMR."
https://openalex.org/W2022057141,"Within dendritic spines, actin is presumed to anchor receptors in the postsynaptic density and play numerous roles regulating synaptic transmission. However, the submicron dimensions of spines have hindered examination of actin dynamics within them and prevented live-cell discrimination of perisynaptic actin filaments. Using photoactivated localization microscopy, we measured movement of individual actin molecules within living spines. Velocity of single actin molecules along filaments, an index of filament polymerization rate, was highly heterogeneous within individual spines. Most strikingly, molecular velocity was elevated in discrete, well-separated foci occurring not principally at the spine tip, but in subdomains throughout the spine, including the neck. Whereas actin velocity on filaments at the synapse was substantially elevated, at the endocytic zone there was no enhanced polymerization activity. We conclude that actin subserves spatially diverse, independently regulated processes throughout spines. Perisynaptic actin forms a uniquely dynamic structure well suited for direct, active regulation of the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2076153463,"Tissue-specific stem cells are maintained through signals from their niche. In Drosophila testis, niche-mediated STAT1/2 signals regulate germline stem cells adhesion to their niche, whereas somatic stem cells govern their self-renewal through BMP signalling. Adults maintain tissue-specific stem cells through niche signals. A model for niche function is the Drosophila melanogaster testis, where a small cluster of cells called the hub produce locally available signals that allow only adjacent cells to self-renew. We show here that the principal signalling pathway implicated in this niche, chemokine activation of STAT1,2, does not primarily regulate self-renewal of germline stem cells (GSCs), but rather governs GSC adhesion to hub cells. In fact, GSC renewal does not require hub cell contact, as GSCs can be renewed solely by contact with the second resident stem cell population, somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs), and this involves BMP signalling. These data suggest a modified paradigm whereby the hub cells function as architects of the stem cell environment, drawing into proximity cellular components necessary for niche function. Self-renewal functions are shared by the hub cells and the CySCs. This work also reconciles key differences in GSC renewal between Drosophila testis and ovary niches, and highlights how a niche can coordinate the production of distinct lineages by having one stem cell type rely on a second."
https://openalex.org/W2090388015,"Rap1 is a component of the shelterin complex at mammalian telomeres, but its in vivo role in telomere biology has remained largely unknown to date. Here we show that Rap1 deficiency is dispensable for telomere capping but leads to increased telomere recombination and fragility. We generated cells and mice deleted for Rap1; mice with Rap1 deletion in stratified epithelia were viable but had shorter telomeres and developed skin hyperpigmentation in adulthood. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultrahigh-throughput sequencing, we found that Rap1 binds to both telomeres and to extratelomeric sites through the (TTAGGG)(2) consensus motif. Extratelomeric Rap1-binding sites were enriched at subtelomeric regions, in agreement with preferential deregulation of subtelomeric genes in Rap1-deficient cells. More than 70% of extratelomeric Rap1-binding sites were in the vicinity of genes, and 31% of the genes deregulated in Rap1-null cells contained Rap1-binding sites, suggesting a role for Rap1 in transcriptional control. These findings place a telomere protein at the interface between telomere function and transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2051911325,"Top-down signals from frontal cortex are thought to be important in cognitive control of sensory processing. To explore this interaction, we compared activity in ferret frontal cortex and primary auditory cortex (A1) during auditory and visual tasks requiring discrimination between classes of reference and target stimuli. Frontal cortex responses were behaviorally gated, selectively encoded the timing and invariant behavioral meaning of target stimuli, could be rapid in onset, and sometimes persisted for hours following behavior. These results are consistent with earlier findings in A1 that attention triggered rapid, selective, persistent, task-related changes in spectrotemporal receptive fields. Simultaneously recorded local field potentials revealed behaviorally gated changes in inter-areal coherence that were selectively modulated between frontal cortex and focal regions of A1 that were responsive to target sounds. These results suggest that A1 and frontal cortex dynamically establish a functional connection during auditory behavior that shapes the flow of sensory information and maintains a persistent trace of recent task-relevant stimulus features."

One system, broadly characterizable as “model-based,” relies on internally generated expectations of action outcomes, while the other, “model-free” system uses learned (cached) values of situation-action associations. This distinction between different decision-making systems has been demonstrated behaviorally (e.g., stimulus-response versus response-outcome learning [Balleine and Dickinson, 1998Balleine B.W.

In rodent navigation studies, lesion and inactivation studies have shown that the model-based system (as engaged by place navigation) depends on hippocampal integrity, while the model-free system (as engaged by response navigation) depends on dorsal striatal integrity (Packard and McGaugh, 1996Packard M.G. McGaugh J.L. Inactivation of hippocampus or caudate nucleus with lidocaine differentially affects expression of place and response learning.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1996; 65: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar); ventral striatum may play a role in both systems (Atallah et al., 2007Atallah H.E. Lopez-Paniagua D. Rudy J.W. O'Reilly R.C. Separate neural substrates for skill learning and performance in the ventral and dorsal striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Computationally, the model-based system is thought to rely on world knowledge in order to generate specific expectations about the outcomes of actions, which may range from anticipating the outcome of a simple lever press to mental simulation or planning over extended spatial maps or Tower of London puzzles (Shallice, 1982Shallice T. Specific impairments of planning.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 298: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). While this process may be computationally expensive, it allows for adaptive behavior in novel situations and under changing goals. In contrast, a typical model-free system associates actions with values, reflecting how well each action has turned out in the past. This system is efficient but also inflexible because cached action values reflect past experience rather than current goals (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D. Niv Y. Dayan P.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, Niv et al., 2006Niv Y. Joel D. Dayan P. A normative perspective on motivation.Trends Cogn.

Thus, computational theories of decision making have suggested potential information processing differences that capture the behavioral and anatomical distinctions between model-based and model-free decision-making systems. However, in order to reveal the mechanisms actually used in the brain to specifically support these different decision-making algorithms, it is necessary to compare neural activity between structures on a task that engages both systems. The multiple-T task is a spatial decision task that engages different decision-making strategies (Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2002Schmitzer-Torbert N. Redish A.D. Development of path stereotypy in a single day in rats on a multiple-T maze.Arch. Ital. Biol. 2002; 140: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar). On this task, Johnson and Redish, 2007Johnson A. Redish A.D. Neural ensembles in CA3 transiently encode paths forward of the animal at a decision point.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12176-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar found that ensembles of hippocampal neurons transiently represented locations ahead of the animal, sweeping down one arm of the maze, then another, before the animal made its choice. Such “lookahead” operations are a critical element of model-based decision making. However, given that dorsal striatum can represent locations as well (Wiener, 1993Wiener S.I. Spatial and behavioral correlates of striatal neurons in rats performing a self-initiated navigation task.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3802-3817PubMed Google Scholar, Yeshenko et al., 2004Yeshenko O. Guazzelli A. Mizumori S.J.Y. Context-dependent reorganization of spatial and movement representations by simultaneously recorded hippocampal and striatal neurons during performance of allocentric and egocentric tasks.Behav. Neurosci. 2004; 118: 751-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an important question is whether this property is in fact unique to the hippocampus. Similarly, slow changes in dorsal striatal firing patterns (Barnes et al., 2005Barnes T.D. Kubota Y. Hu D. Jin D.Z. Graybiel A.M. Activity of striatal neurons reflects dynamic encoding and recoding of procedural memories.Nature. 2005; 437: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) demonstrate reorganization that could support gradual model-free learning. However, slow changes have also been observed in the hippocampus (Mehta et al., 1997Mehta M.R. Barnes C.A. McNaughton B.L. Experience-dependent, asymmetric expansion of hippocampal place fields.Proc.

Long-term plasticity in hippocampal place-cell representation of environmental geometry.Nature. 2002; 416: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), so in the absence of direct comparison it is not clear if such effects are specific to how dorsal striatum operates. Finally, van der Meer and Redish, 2009van der Meer M.A.A. Redish A.D. Covert expectation-of-reward in rat ventral striatum at decision points.Front. Integr. Neurosci. 2009; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar found ventral striatal firing patterns relevant to roles in both model-free and model-based decision making, such as anticipatory “ramping” and covert activation of reward-responsive neurons at decision points. However, it is not known if dorsal striatal neurons show ramping or reward activation at decision points. Thus, in order to determine which of these information processing mechanisms are unique to these areas—a requirement if we are to understand the neural basis of their distinct behavioral roles—we compared the firing properties of dorsal striatal, ventral striatal, and hippocampal neurons on the multiple-T task. Because several of these analyses require large neural ensembles, we used three different groups of animals, one for each structure. The data sets used here include data used in previously published work (dorsal striatum: Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2004Schmitzer-Torbert N. Redish A.D. Neuronal activity in the rodent dorsal striatum in sequential navigation: separation of spatial and reward responses on the multiple T task.J.

Neural ensembles in CA3 transiently encode paths forward of the animal at a decision point.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12176-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, here we use a comparative approach applying the same, new analyses to each structure, allowing direct comparisons and the identification of a triple dissociation in information processing mechanisms. We recorded 1646, 2323, and 1473 spike trains from 98, 96, and 31 recording sessions from dorsal striatum, ventral striatum, and hippocampus, respectively, as rats (n = 5 each for dorsal and ventral striatum, n = 6 for hippocampus) performed the multiple-T task (Figure 1A ). On this task, three low-cost choice points (T1–T3) with dead ends on one side were followed by a high-cost choice (T4) between the left or right “return rail,” with only one side rewarded during any given session. Although rats were trained on the task prior to electrode implant surgery, both the rewarded side (left or right choice at T4) as well as the correct sequence of preceding turns (T1–T3) could be varied from day to day, such that the rats started out uncertain about the correct choices at the beginning of each session. Rats rapidly learned to choose the rewarded side, reaching asymptotic performance (>90%) within ten laps (Figure 1C) with each group improving at a comparable rate (Figure S1A). Coincident with this rapid performance increase, rats exhibited pausing behavior at the high-cost choice point (T4) during early laps, looking back and forth between left and right before making their choice (a hippocampus-dependent behavior known as vicarious trial and error, or VTE [Tolman, 1938Tolman E. The determiners of behavior at a choice point.Psychol. Rev. 1938; 45: 1-35Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Hu and Amsel, 1995Hu D. Amsel A. A simple test of the vicarious trial-and-error hypothesis of hippocampal function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5506-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar]). Pausing was absent at a control choice point (T2; Figures 1B and S1B). Following this initial VTE phase, choice performance reached asymptote, yet lap times continued to decrease (Figure 1C, inset), indicating a change in behavior beyond choice performance (Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2002Schmitzer-Torbert N. Redish A.D. Development of path stereotypy in a single day in rats on a multiple-T maze.Arch. Ital. Biol. 2002; 140: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar). These behavioral characteristics indicate the engagement of different decision-making strategies within single recording sessions. As both striatum and hippocampus are known to contain different cell types (Ranck, 1973Ranck Jr., J.B. Studies on single neurons in dorsal hippocampal formation and septum in unrestrained rats. I.

Consistent with previous reports, putative hippocampal pyramidal neurons tended to show spatially focused firing fields (“place fields” [O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O'Keefe J. Dostrovsky J. The hippocampus as a spatial map. Preliminary evidence from unit activity in the freely-moving rat.Brain Res. 1971; 34: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar]), while phasically firing neurons (PFNs; putative medium spiny neurons) in both striatal subregions exhibited a wider range of firing correlates, including maze-related activity and responsiveness to reward (Lavoie and Mizumori, 1994Lavoie A.M.

Breck J.T. Eichenbaum H. Striatal versus hippocampal representations during win-stay maze performance.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In order to examine differences between the three structures at the population level, we plotted the average firing rates for putative pyramidal neurons or PFNs in each of the three structures over the track (Figure 2A ; interneurons, Figure S2B). Dorsal striatal PFNs were most active on the sequence of turns (S-T4), especially between T3 and T4, and least active on the bottom return rail (F2-S). Ventral striatal PFNs showed a ramping up of activity through the turn sequence, dropping off sharply at the first reward site. Hippocampal pyramidal neuron firing rates were relatively uniform over the track (Levene's test for uniformity, see Table S1), although a decrease between the two reward sites was visible, which may reflect effects of low running speed (pyramidal cells in hippocampus are sensitive to running speed [McNaughton et al., 1983McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. O'Keefe J. The contributions of position, direction, and velocity to single unit activity in the hippocampus of freely-moving rats.Exp. Brain Res. 1983; 52: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar]). Because increases in population firing rate at a given location can result from (1) an increase in the number of cells that have fields there and (2) increased firing rates at that location, we also plotted the distribution of peak firing locations (Figure 2B). Both striatal subregions showed a clear increase in the number of active cells at the reward sites, reflecting a population of reward-responsive neurons absent from hippocampus. In dorsal striatum, a decline in the number of firing fields was visible after the navigation sequence, while hippocampal firing fields were more uniformly distributed (χ2 test, see Table S1). These characteristics support a distinction in information processing in which dorsal striatum emphasized the turn sequence (consistent with situation-action encoding), ventral striatum showed a ramp (consistent with representation of motivationally relevant information), and hippocampus represented the track relatively uniformly (consistent with a spatial, map-like representation). The above comparison suggests underlying differences in neural coding but does not reveal how informative these codes are. To address this, we measured the extent to which neural ensembles in the three structures contained information about location on the track. A Bayesian ensemble decoding algorithm was applied, which computes a probability distribution over the track given the numbers of spikes fired by each neuron within a given time window (Zhang et al., 1998Zhang K. Ginzburg I. McNaughton B.L. Sejnowski T.J. Interpreting neuronal population activity by reconstruction: unified framework with application to hippocampal place cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1017-1044PubMed Google Scholar; Figure S3). The average probability (over all time windows) at the rat's actual location was used as a measure of decoding accuracy: it indicates how good the ensemble is at representing the rat's actual location. Given the spatial modulation of firing rates on the track, we asked whether, at the ensemble level, certain parts of the track could be decoded more accurately than others. To account for differences in decoding accuracy between recording sessions and structures (explored in the next section), we normalized the decoding accuracy distribution over the track (Figure 2C). Dorsal striatal decoding accuracy was best on the sequence of choice points (T1–T4), as well as the reward sites, but poor on the return segment (F2–T1). For hippocampus, the relatively uniform decoding accuracy was in agreement with its spatial firing rate distribution (Levene's test for uniformity, see Table S3). In contrast, ventral striatal decoding accuracy did not change over the sequence of turns as the firing rate distribution did. Thus, on the ensemble level, dorsal striatal decoding accuracy focused on the turn sequence on the track as well as the reward sites, while hippocampal decoding accuracy was most uniform, and ventral striatum highlighted the reward sites only. The preceding analysis normalized differences in decoding accuracy between sessions and structures. However, such differences can be informative when comparing neural coding properties between structures: we would like to ask “how well” each structure represents location on the track. In distributed representations, decoding accuracy depends on ensemble size (Zhang et al., 1998Zhang K. Ginzburg I. McNaughton B.L. Sejnowski T.J. Interpreting neuronal population activity by reconstruction: unified framework with application to hippocampal place cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1017-1044PubMed Google Scholar, Stanley et al., 1999Stanley G.B. Li F.F. Dan Y. Reconstruction of natural scenes from ensemble responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus.J.

Srinivasan M.A. Nicolelis M.A. Real-time prediction of hand trajectory by ensembles of cortical neurons in primates.Nature. 2000; 408: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Thus, comparing decoding accuracy between sessions or structures with different ensemble sizes centers on the extent to which accuracy increases as a function of ensemble size (“coding efficiency”). We therefore used a neuron dropping procedure (Wessberg et al., 2000Wessberg J. Stambaugh C.R. Kralik J.D. Beck P.D. Laubach M. Chapin J.K. Kim J. Biggs S.J.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4207-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to sample random subsets of ensembles (see Experimental Procedures) in order to plot overall decoding accuracy as a function of number of cells for the three structures (Figure 2D). Between structures, spatial decoding accuracy changed differentially as a function of the number of cells in the ensemble (two-factor ANOVA, structure × ensemble size interaction, F(2;1) = 200.05; p < 10−10). Dorsal striatal ensembles were the most efficient (steepest slope; two-factor ANOVA for dorsal striatum and hippocampus, structure × ensemble size interaction, F(1,1) = 7.72,p = 0.0058) while in ventral striatum, spatial decoding accuracy increased the least with ensemble size, and hippocampus fell in between. Previous studies have found slow changes (across days) in the distribution of dorsal striatal firing rates on a different T-maze task (Barnes et al., 2005Barnes T.D. Kubota Y. Hu D. Jin D.Z. Graybiel A.M. Activity of striatal neurons reflects dynamic encoding and recoding of procedural memories.Nature. 2005; 437: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). While within single sessions, we did not find evidence for systematic changes in dorsal striatal firing rates (Figure S2A), spatial decoding accuracy can vary independently of firing rate (compare Figures 2A and 2C) raising the possibility of reorganization with experience at the ensemble level. Thus, we asked how spatial coding efficiency changed over laps for the three structures. Decoding efficiency changed differentially between the three structures (Figure 2E; overall structure × lap interaction, F(2,1) = 11.84, p < 10−10): in ventral striatum, there was no evidence of a change over laps, while dorsal striatum showed the strongest increase. This analysis relies on accurate estimation of the slope of decoding accuracy as a function of the number of cells (verified in Figure S2C). To control for the possibility that behavioral differences between the groups of animals influenced these results, we used a multiple regression analysis to identify behavioral variables that explained a significant amount of variance in decoding efficiency and subtracted the best fits based on these variables from the data (running speed, distance from an idealized path through the maze, and proportion of correct choices; see Figure S2B); this did not affect the pattern of results. Thus, with experience, dorsal striatum showed the strongest increase in coding efficiency, while hippocampus showed a modest amount, and ventral striatum showed none. These results suggest the presence of a dynamic reorganization process in dorsal striatum that comes to reflect the structure of the task with experience (Nakahara et al., 2002Nakahara H. Amari S.

Decoding provides access to representational content, allowing analysis of not just how much information a given ensemble contains but also of what that information actually is (Schneidman et al., 2003Schneidman E. Bialek W. Berry 2nd, M.J. Synergy, redundancy, and independence in population codes.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11539-11553PubMed Google Scholar). Johnson and Redish, 2007Johnson A. Redish A.D. Neural ensembles in CA3 transiently encode paths forward of the animal at a decision point.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12176-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar found that as rats paused at the final choice point, hippocampal representations of space swept ahead of the animal, down one arm of the maze and then the other, before the rat made its choice. It is presently not known if other areas in which spatial information is present, such as dorsal striatum, exhibit a similar effect. To investigate this, we applied the decoding algorithm to data from all three structures, using a 20 ms time window. Note that unlike the analysis in Johnson and Redish, 2007Johnson A. Redish A.D. Neural ensembles in CA3 transiently encode paths forward of the animal at a decision point.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12176-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, this method is “memoryless,” treating each time window as independent. For all passes through the final choice point, the proportion of the decoded probability distribution that fell either ahead or behind the choice point (Figure 3A ) was plotted as a function of lap. While for all three structures the decoding probability to the choice point itself increased over the first ten laps (data not shown), for dorsal striatum (top panel) decoding to both the behind and ahead zones was marginally increased in this same period, indicating a nonspecific improvement in decoding accuracy. In contrast, ventral striatum and hippocampus showed a different pattern, where decoding ahead of, but not behind, the animal was high during early laps (two-factor ANOVA, lap-decoding zone interaction, smallest F(1,1) = 4.69,p = 0.031). This is not compatible with a nonspecific decoding improvement: instead, it suggests that during early laps there is increased representation of locations ahead of the animal. We did not find evidence for such events in dorsal striatum, neither when averaged across sessions (two-factor ANOVA, lap-decoding zone interaction, F(1,1) = 1.78, p = 0.18) nor upon visual inspection of decoding during individual passes through the choice point. Thus, even though dorsal striatal position encoding is at least as good as that in hippocampus on this task (Figure 2D), it did not selectively represent locations ahead of the animal at the choice point. To assess whether lookahead in hippocampus (and ventral striatum) was specific to the final choice point, we repeated the same analysis for passes through turn 2, a low-cost choice point (Figure 3B). At this point, decoding ahead of the animal during early laps was much diminished, no longer reaching significance for eithe"

Here we examined the synaptic function of hyaluronic acid (HA), a major component of the extracellular matrix. Enzymatic removal of HA with hyaluronidase reduced nifedipine-sensitive whole-cell Ca(2+) currents, decreased Ca(2+) transients mediated by L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (L-VDCCs) in postsynaptic dendritic shafts and spines, and abolished an L-VDCC-dependent component of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. Adding exogenous HA, either by bath perfusion or via local delivery near recorded synapses, completely rescued this LTP component. In a heterologous expression system, exogenous HA rapidly increased currents mediated by Ca(v)1.2, but not Ca(v)1.3, subunit-containing L-VDCCs, whereas intrahippocampal injection of hyaluronidase impaired contextual fear conditioning. Our observations unveil a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the perisynaptic extracellular matrix influences use-dependent synaptic plasticity through regulation of dendritic Ca(2+) channels."

To investigate the underlying mechanisms of this process, we analyzed the activity of dopamine neurons and one of their major sources of input, neurons in the lateral habenula, while animals anticipated upcoming behavioral tasks. We found that lateral habenula and dopamine neurons anticipated tasks in two distinct manners. First, neurons encoded the timing distribution of upcoming tasks through gradual changes in their tonic activity. This tonic signal encoded rewarding tasks in preference to punishing tasks and was correlated with classic phasic coding of motivational value. Second, neurons transmitted a phasic signal marking the time when a task began. This phasic signal encoded rewarding and punishing tasks in similar manners, as though reflecting motivational salience. Our data suggest that the habenula-dopamine pathway motivates anticipation through a combination of tonic reward-related and phasic salience-related signals."

We determined that Dixdc1 functionally interacts with DISC1 to regulate neural progenitor proliferation by co-modulating Wnt-GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling. However, DISC1 and Dixdc1 do not regulate migration via this pathway. During neuronal migration, we discovered that phosphorylation of Dixdc1 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) facilitates its interaction with the DISC1-binding partner Ndel1. Furthermore, Dixdc1 phosphorylation and its interaction with DISC1/Ndel1 in vivo is required for neuronal migration.

Here, we show that HSF1 is required for the cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) oncogene responsible for aggressive breast tumors. Upon expression of HER2, untransformed human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells underwent neoplastic transformation, formed foci in culture and tumors in nude mouse xenografts. However, expression of HER2 in MCF-10A cells with knockdown of HSF1 did not cause either foci formation or tumor growth in xenografts. The antitumorigenic effect of downregulation of HSF1 was associated with HER2-induced accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and decrease in the mitotic regulator survivin, which resulted in growth inhibition and cell senescence. In fact, either knockout of p21 or overexpression of survivin alleviated these effects of HSF1 knockdown. The proliferation of certain human HER2-positive breast cancer lines also requires HSF1, as its knockdown led to upregulation of p21 and/or decrease in survivin, precipitating growth arrest. Similar effects were observed with a small-molecular-weight inhibitor of the heat-shock response NZ28. The effects of HSF1 knockdown on the growth arrest and senescence of HER2-expressing cells were associated with downregulation of heat-shock protein (Hsp)72 and Hsp27. Therefore, HSF1 is critical for proliferation of HER2-expressing cells, most likely because it maintains the levels of HSPs, which in turn control regulators of senescence p21 and survivin."

This includes synaptic vesicles tightly localized to active zones, resistance to the slow Ca2+ buffer EGTA and a reduced number of Ca2+ channels required to trigger single fusion events.

Here we show, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid analysis, that PBK/TOPK physically interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 through its DNA-binding (DBD) domain in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells that express wild-type p53. PBK also binds to p53 mutants carrying five common point mutations in the DBD domain. The PBK-p53 interaction appears to downmodulate p53 transactivation function as indicated by PBK/TOPK knockdown experiments, which show upregulated expression of the key p53 target gene and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in HCT116 cells, particularly after genotoxic damage from doxorubicin. Furthermore, stable PBK/TOPK knockdown cell lines (derived from HCT116 and MCF-7 cells) showed increased apoptosis, G(2)/M arrest and slower growth as compared to stable empty vector-transfected control cell lines. Gene microarray studies identified additional p53 target genes involved in apoptosis or cell cycling, which were differentially regulated by PBK knockdown. Together, these data suggest that increased levels of PBK/TOPK may contribute to tumor cell development and progression through suppression of p53 function and consequent reductions in the cell-cycle regulatory proteins such as p21. PBK/TOPK may therefore be a valid target for antineoplastic kinase inhibitors to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and growth suppression."

https://openalex.org/W1995828194,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) where aberrant signaling downstream of this receptor contributes to tumor growth. EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) is the most commonly altered form of EGFR and contains a truncated ligand-binding domain. We previously reported that EGFRvIII is expressed in up to 40% of HNSCC tumors where it is associated with increased proliferation, tumor growth and chemoresistance to antitumor drugs including the EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Cetuximab was FDA-approved in 2006 for HNSCC but has not been shown to prevent invasion or metastasis. This study was undertaken to evaluate the mechanisms of EGFRvIII-mediated cell motility and invasion in HNSCC. We found that EGFRvIII induced HNSCC cell migration and invasion in conjunction with increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, which was not abrogated by cetuximab treatment. Further investigation showed that EGF-induced expression of the STAT3 target gene HIF1-α, was abolished by cetuximab in HNSCC cells expressing wild-type EGFR under hypoxic conditions, but not in EGFRvIII-expressing HNSCC cells. These results suggest that EGFRvIII mediates HNSCC cell migration and invasion by increased STAT3 activation and induction of HIF1-α, which contribute to cetuximab resistance in EGFRvIII-expressing HNSCC tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1968912036,"Alternatively spliced beta-neurexins (beta-NRXs) and neuroligins (NLs) are thought to have distinct extracellular binding affinities, potentially providing a beta-NRX/NL synaptic recognition code. We utilized surface plasmon resonance to measure binding affinities between all combinations of alternatively spliced beta-NRX 1-3 and NL 1-3 ectodomains. Binding was observed for all beta-NRX/NL pairs. The presence of the NL1 B splice insertion lowers beta-NRX binding affinity by approximately 2-fold, while beta-NRX splice insertion 4 has small effects that do not synergize with NL splicing. New structures of glycosylated beta-NRXs 1 and 2 containing splice insertion 4 reveal that the insertion forms a new beta strand that replaces the beta10 strand, leaving the NL binding site intact. This helps to explain the limited effect of splice insert 4 on NRX/NL binding affinities. These results provide new structural insights and quantitative binding information to help determine whether and how splice isoform choice plays a role in beta-NRX/NL-mediated synaptic recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2025706888,"It has not been determined yet whether the ERK-MAPK pathway regulates longevity of metazoans. Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans ERK cascade promotes longevity through the two longevity-promoting transcription factors, SKN-1 and DAF-16. We find that RNAi of three genes, which constitute the ERK cascade (lin-45/RAF1, mek-2/MEK1/2, and mpk-1/ERK1/2), results in reduction of life span. Moreover, RNAi of lip-1, the gene encoding a MAPK phosphatase that inactivates MPK-1, increases life span. Epistasis analyses show that the ERK (MPK-1) cascade-mediated life span extension requires SKN-1, whose function is mediated, at least partly, through DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like signaling. MPK-1 phosphorylates SKN-1 on the key sites that are required for SKN-1 nuclear accumulation. Our results also show that one mechanism by which SKN-1 regulates insulin-like signaling is through the regulation of expression of insulin-like peptides.

Our findings thus identify a novel ERK-MAPK-mediated signaling pathway that promotes longevity. Recent genetic studies in a variety of model organisms are beginning to reveal the signal transduction networks capable of regulating life span. The insulin-like signaling pathway plays a central role in these networks. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is required for life span extension by a mutation in daf-2, the insulin-like receptor (1Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 2Lee R.Y. Hench J. Ruvkun G. Curr.

Recently, the longevity-promoting transcription factor SKN-1 has been shown to be inhibited by the insulin-like signaling pathway (4Tullet J.M. Hertweck M. An J.H. Baker J. Hwang J.Y. Liu S.

However, it has not been fully elucidated how the insulin-like signaling pathway interacts with the other distinct signaling pathways to regulate longevity. The ERK-MAPK cascades are evolutionarily conserved signaling modules in eukaryotic cells and transduce signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. These cascades control diverse cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation (5Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 6Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 7Pearson G. Robinson F.

Biochem. 2004; 135: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that increasing nuclear ERK activity can extend replicative life span of diploid human cells (9Tresini M. Lorenzini A. Torres C. Cristofalo V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4136-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report has shown that the increase in life span in mice lacking type 5 adenylyl cyclase correlates with increased ERK-MAPK signaling and that overexpression of mammalian ERK2 increases the chronological life span of yeast (10Yan L. Vatner D.E. O'Connor J.P. Ivessa A. Ge H. Chen W. Hirotani S. Ishikawa Y. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Cell. 2007; 130: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined yet whether the ERK-MAPK cascade promotes longevity of metazoans. In addition, molecular mechanisms by which ERK signaling regulates longevity have remained unclear. Here, we show that the ERK (MPK-1) cascade functions to extend life span in C. elegans. Our analyses show that ERK signaling acts through SKN-1 to regulate the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like signaling and that MPK-1 phosphorylates SKN-1 on the key sites that are required for SKN-1 nuclear accumulation. Moreover, our data suggest that SKN-1 is involved in the regulation of life span through repression of expression of insulin-like peptides. Thus, our results demonstrate a role of the ERK signaling pathway in extending longevity and define its underlying mechanism. All strains were maintained at 20 °C on nematode growth medium as described previously (11Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double mutant daf-2(e1370);skn-1(zu67) was created by mating skn-1(zu67)/+ males with daf-2(e1370) hermaphrodites. Both daf-2 and skn-1 mutations were confirmed by sequencing. All strains used are listed in supplemental Table S1. We used BLAST Search in the WormBase site and NCBI Blast in the NCBI site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to identify the C. elegans homologs of the mammalian MAPK, RSK, MAPKAPK, or MNK. To construct RNAi clones, the cDNAs of the genes were amplified by RT-PCR. In the case of the skn-1 RNAi clone, sequences specific for the first three exons of skn-1c were amplified. The cDNA fragments were then inserted into the pPD129.36 RNAi feeding vector. To construct Pmpk-1a::Venus, a 4185-bp fragment of the sequence upstream of the ATG start site followed by 46 bp of the first exon of mpk-1a, was amplified by PCR and inserted into pPD-Venus. To construct the Myc-MPK-1 mammalian expression vector, the cDNA sequence of mpk-1a was amplified by PCR and inserted into the mammalian expression vector (pCS4-Myc). The GST-SKN-1 WT and SA bacterial expression vectors were described previously (12Inoue H. Hisamoto N. An J.H. Oliveira R.P. Nishida E. Blackwell T.K. Matsumoto K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. RNAi was performed essentially as described previously (13Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2RESEARCH0002Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The RNAi clones were transformed into the HT115 strain, and the bacteria were grown with ampicillin (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and tetracycline (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). On the following days, cultures were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and seeded onto agar plates containing ampicillin, tetracycline, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Fourth larval stage animals or young adults were picked to RNAi plates containing 5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) to prevent the growth of progeny. Worms were tapped every 2–4 days and were scored as dead when they did not move after repeated taps with a pick. After scoring, they were transferred to new plates. Worms that crawled off the plate, that exploded, and that died as bags of worms (i.e. died from internal hatching) were excluded from analysis. The p value was calculated by Student's t test unless otherwise stated. The life span assay using the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Promega) was performed on the agar plates containing 1.25 μl/ml DMSO with or without 12.5 μm U0126 at final concentrations. In the assay with U0126 or using daf-2;skn-1 double mutant worms, the HT115 strain harboring pPD129.36 empty vector was used. All the experiments were carried out at 20 °C unless otherwise stated. The glp-4(bn2ts) strain was cultured at 25 °C from the egg stage to prevent germ line development. The plasmid containing Pmpk-1a::Venus was injected, in combination with the rol-6 morphologic marker plasmid pRF4, into the distal gonad of young adult N2 hermaphrodites at a concentration of 50 ng/μl for each plasmid. Transgenic animals were identified by their characteristic movement (roller phenotype). Worms were anesthetized with sodium azide and observed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Fluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy images were taken with an AxioCam MRm cooled charge-coupled device camera (Carl Zeiss). Transfection into 293T cells was carried out by PEI (Polyscience Inc.). For immunoprecipitation, supernatants from 293T cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc antibody A14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Bacterially expressed GST-SKN-1 was purified and used as a substrate for Myc-MPK-1. To assess kinase activity of Myc-MPK-1, immunoprecipitates were incubated with GST-SKN-1 and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 25 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated GST-SKN-1 was visualized by BAS-2500 (Fuji Film). For immunoblotting, anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), anti-phospho-ERK antibody M8159 (Sigma), and anti-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling) were used. Total RNA was isolated from N2 worms treated with RNAi for 4 days from young adult stage using Sepasol-RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), followed by quantitative real time PCR using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) (Roche Applied Science), and normalized to rpa-1 (the ribosomal protein rp21c). p value was calculated by Student's t test. In C. elegans, the ERK-MAPK cascade, which consists of LIN-45 (a C. elegans ortholog of mammalian RAF1), MEK-2 (a C. elegans ortholog of mammalian MEK1/2), and MPK-1(a C. elegans ortholog of mammalian ERK1/2), is required for multiple developmental events (14Sundaram M.V. Wormbook (C. elegans Research Community, ed).doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.80.1Date: 2006Google Scholar). We examined the effect of RNAi inactivation of the three genes, lin-45, mek-2, and mpk-1, on the life span of worms. Recently, it was reported that RNAi inactivation of mpk-1 during larval development significantly reduced life span due to a vulva-less phenotype (15Xue H. Xian B. Dong D. Xia K. Zhu S. Zhang Z. Hou L. Zhang Q. Zhang Y. Han J.D. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Then, to avoid possible developmental defects, we performed RNAi from the young adult stage. Our measurements show that RNAi inactivation of the three genes significantly reduces life span (Fig. 1A; Table 1). We then tested the effect of the well known MEK inhibitor U0126 on the life span of worms. The worms treated with U0126 lived significantly shorter than the worms treated with the vehicle DMSO (Fig. 1B). It is also known that U0126 inhibits the activation of ERK5 and mTORC1 as well as ERK1/2 (16Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 17Fukazawa H. Noguchi K. Murakami Y. Uehara Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 5: 303-309Google Scholar). However, unlike RNAi of mpk-1, RNAi of sma-5, a C. elegans homolog of ERK5, did not affect life span (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S2). Moreover, it has been shown that inhibiting C. elegans TOR (let-363) extends life span (18Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Zhang Y. Kovacs A.L. Orosz L. Müller F. Nature. 2003; 426: 620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can conclude that U0126 reduces life span through inhibiting the ERK (MPK-1) pathway. These data strongly suggest that the C. elegans ERK (MPK-1) cascade functions to extend life span.TABLE 1Life span dataView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)a p values were calculated by Student's t test.b The % mean life span of worms treated with DMSO or U0126 was compared with that of animals treated with no agents, which was examined at the same time.c The % mean life span of lip-1(zh15) worms was compared with that of N2, which was examined at the same time.d p values were calculated by log rank (Mantel-Cox) test.e The % mean life span of daf-2;skn-1 worms was compared with that of daf-2, which was examined at the same time.

We reasoned that if the ERK cascade functions to extend life span, RNAi of an MPK-1 (ERK1/2)-inactivating phosphatase should extend life span. To test this idea, we then performed RNAi of lip-1, as it is well established that MPK-1 is inactivated by the dual specificity phosphatase LIP-1, which is the C. elegans homolog of mammalian MKP-3 (14Sundaram M.V. Wormbook (C. elegans Research Community, ed).doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.80.1Date: 2006Google Scholar). RNAi of lip-1 resulted in significant life span extension (Fig. 1C). In addition, lip-1(zh15) worms, lip-1 null mutants, lived longer than wild-type (N2) worms (Fig. 1D). From these data, we can conclude that the ERK-MAPK cascade functions to extend life span in C. elegans (Fig. 1E). In C. elegans, the ERK (MPK-1) cascade is shown to be involved in germ line development (14Sundaram M.V. Wormbook (C. elegans Research Community, ed).doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.80.1Date: 2006Google Scholar), and lip-1 is also required for the normal extent of germ line proliferation (19Lee M.H. Hook B. Lamont L.B. Wickens M. Kimble J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the life span of C. elegans can be extended by a mutation that prevents germ line development (20Arantes-Oliveira N. Apfeld J. Dillin A. Kenyon C. Science. 2002; 295: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Then it was possible that MPK-1 could regulate longevity through the changes in germ line development. However, RNAi inactivation of mpk-1 shortened the life span of germ line-defective glp-4(bn2ts) worms (Fig. 2), indicating that the MPK-1 cascade functions to extend life span in C. elegans, independently of its role in germ line development. Recent studies have demonstrated that the JNK MAPK cascade plays an important role in the regulation of life span of C. elegans (21Oh S.W. Mukhopadhyay A. Svrzikapa N. Jiang F. Davis R.J. Tissenbaum H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4494-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and that the p38 MAPK cascade contributes to both the pathogen resistance and the enhanced longevity of daf-2 mutants (22Troemel E.R. Chu S.W. Reinke V. Lee S.S. Ausubel F.M. Kim D.H. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e183Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that several distinct MAPK cascades might play distinct and overlapping roles in controlling longevity in C. elegans. As to ERK-MAPK signaling in mammals, increased levels of p-ERK are found in long lived caloric restricted mice (23Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Shack S. Wang X.T. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), Snell dwarf mice (24Madsen M.A. Hsieh C.C. Boylston W.H. Flurkey K. Harrison D. Papaconstantinou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and mice in which type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) is knocked out (10Yan L. Vatner D.E. O'Connor J.P. Ivessa A. Ge H. Chen W. Hirotani S. Ishikawa Y. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Cell. 2007; 130: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Increasing ERK signaling is also shown to extend the replicative life span of human cells (9Tresini M. Lorenzini A. Torres C. Cristofalo V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4136-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that the ERK-MAPK cascade plays a critical role in promoting longevity in diverse organisms. Several transcription factors and protein kinases are known to function downstream of ERK-MAPK (25Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether these potential ERK targets mediate the life span-extending function of MPK-1. First, we tested lin-1 (a C. elegans ortholog of mammalian Elk1) and lin-31 (a C. elegans ortholog of mammalian FoxB2), the two known downstream transcription factors of the MPK-1 cascade during vulval development (14Sundaram M.V. Wormbook (C. elegans Research Community, ed).doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.80.1Date: 2006Google Scholar). Unlike RNAi of mpk-1, RNAi of lin-1 or lin-31 did not affect life span (Table 2). In C. elegans, there are two homologs of mammalian RSK (rskn-1 and rskn-2), one homolog of MAPKAPK2 (K08F8.1), one homolog of MAPKAPK3 (mak-2), and one homolog of MNK (mnk-1) (26Manning G. Wormbook (C. elegans Research Community, ed).doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.60.1Date: 2005Google Scholar). RSK, MAPKAPK2, MAPKAPK3, and MNK are well known downstream kinases, which are activated by ERK-MAPK. RNAi of each of these five genes did not cause reduction of life span (Table 2). These results indicate that each of these known effectors of ERK-MAPK is not sufficient to mediate the longevity-promoting function of MPK-1, and they ay suggest that there is another downstream target of MPK-1.TABLE 2Effect of RNAi inactivation of several potential ERK (MPK-1) target genes on life spanCosmidGeneHomolog% of control life spannp valueNo. of trialsC37F5.1lin-1Elk1100390.7721K10G6.1lin-31FoxB2100440.6391T01H8.1rskn-1RSK100450.7731C54G4.1rskn-2RSK103450.2671K08F8.1MAPKAPK2101460.6001C44C8.6mak-2MAPKAPK3104370.1881R166.5mnk-1MNK1102370.4541 Open table in a new tab The FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 plays a central role in life span regulation (1Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 3Kenyon C. Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). To test whether the ERK-MAPK (MPK-1) cascade-mediated life span regulation requires DAF-16, we examined the effect of RNAi of lin-45, mek-2, or mpk-1 on the life span in daf-16(mgDf50) worms, which lack DAF-16. RNAi of these genes did not significantly reduce life span in daf-16(mgDf50) (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that DAF-16 is required for MPK-1 signaling-mediated life span regulation. The effects of DAF-16 on longevity are modulated by a number of its regulators, such as BAR-1, a C. elegans homolog of β-catenin (27Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), SIR-2.1 (28Berdichevsky A. Viswanathan M. Horvitz H.R. Guarente L. Cell. 2006; 125: 1165-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and HSF-1, a C. elegans heat-shock transcription factor (29Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). We then tested whether the life span reduction caused by RNAi inactivation of mpk-1 is dependent upon the presence of bar-1, sir-2.1, or hsf-1. RNAi of mpk-1 significantly reduced the mean life span in bar-1(ga80), sir-2.1(ok434), and hsf-1(sy441) worms (Fig. 3B, right), suggesting that ERK-MAPK signaling regulates life span through DAF-16, but independently of bar-1, sir-2.1, or hsf-1. The NF-E2 stress-response transcription factor SKN-1 has been shown to be required for normal life span and stress resistance in C. elegans (12Inoue H. Hisamoto N. An J.H. Oliveira R.P. Nishida E. Blackwell T.K. Matsumoto K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 30An J.H. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1882-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway is reported to be required for nuclear translocation of Nrf2, a mammalian homolog of SKN-1 (31Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Toxicol. Sci. 2003; 73: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We then considered the possibility that SKN-1 is involved in MPK-1-mediated life span regulation. To test this idea, we examined the effect of RNAi of mpk-1 on the life span in skn-1(zu67) worms, which lack SKN-1A and -C isoforms, or in skn-1(zu135) worms, which lack all isoforms of SKN-1. In both skn-1(zu67) (Fig. 3B) and skn-1(zu135) (Fig. 3C) worms, RNAi of mpk-1 did not cause significant life span reduction. Therefore, SKN-1 is required for MPK-1 to regulate life span. In our life span measurements, RNAi of skn-1, which targeted skn-1a and -c isoforms, reduced the life span of N2 worms significantly (by about 20%) (Fig. 3D), consistent with the shorter life span of skn-1 mutant worms. In contrast, the same skn-1 RNAi treatment failed to reduce the life span of daf-16(mgDf50) worms (Fig. 3D). Moreover, RNAi of daf-16 significantly reduced the life span of skn-1(zu67) worms (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that DAF-16 is required for SKN-1 to extend life span. It is therefore likely that MPK-1 signaling-mediated life span extension requires SKN-1, whose function is mediated, at least partly, through DAF-16. The mpk-1 gene encodes two transcripts, mpk-1a and mpk-1b (32Lackner M.R. Kornfeld K. Miller L.M. Horvitz H.R. Kim S.K.

It has been reported that GFP driven from the promoter region of mpk-1b is expressed in the pharyngeal-intestinal valve and nervous system (34McKay S.J. Johnsen R. Khattra J. Asano J. Baillie D.L. Chan S. Dube N. Fang L. Goszczynski B. Ha E. Halfnight E. Hollebakken R. Huang P. Hung K. Jensen V. Jones S.J. Kai H. Li D. Mah A. Marra M. McGhee J. Newbury R. Pouzyrev A. Riddle D.L. Sonnhammer E.

To identify the tissues in which mpk-1a is expressed, we constructed Pmpk-1a::Venus, in which the 4.2-kbp upstream region of mpk-1a is fused to Venus, the yellow fluorescent protein. Pmpk-1a::Venus was expressed in many types of tissues, including the nervous system, body wall muscle, posterior intestine, and rectum (Fig. 4A). The Pmpk-1a::Venus signals in the posterior intestine remained constant as worms aged, whereas the number of Pmpk-1a::Venus-expressing cells of the other tissues was decreased. SKN-1 is shown to be expressed in the two ASI neurons and intestine (30An J.H. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1882-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that MPK-1 acts directly on SKN-1 inside cells, such as intestinal cells. In response to oxidative stress, PMK-1, a C. elegans homolog of mammalian p38 MAPK, directly phosphorylates SKN-1 at Ser-74 and Ser-340, leading to SKN-1 translocation into intestinal nuclei (12Inoue H. Hisamoto N. An J.H. Oliveira R.P. Nishida E. Blackwell T.K. Matsumoto K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We then considered the possibility that MPK-1 also directly phosphorylates SKN-1 at these key residues. To test this possibility, we first examined whether SKN-1 serves as a substrate for MPK-1 in vitro. Myc-tagged MPK-1 was expressed in 293T cells, together with or without FLAG-tagged MEK SDSE, which is a constitutively active form of MEK1 and was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. Myc-MPK-1 was activated by MEK SDSE, as detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Fig. 4B). GST-fused SKN-1C was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified (GST-SKN-1 WT). In vitro kinase assays showed that GST-SKN-1 WT was phosphorylated by activated MPK-1 but not by unactivated MPK-1 (Fig. 4B, 1st and 5th lanes). Next, to determine whether MPK-1 phosphorylates SKN-1 on Ser-74 and Ser-340, we used a mutant of SKN-1, in which both residues were replaced by alanine (GST-SKN-1 SA). GST-SKN-1 SA was not phosphorylated by activated MPK-1 (Fig. 4B, 6th lane). These data suggest that MPK-1, when activated, directly phosphorylates SKN-1 on the key sites required for SKN-1 nuclear translocation. It is thus likely that MPK-1 functions to extend life span by phosphorylating SKN-1 and inducing its nuclear translocation in intestinal cells. It has recently been reported that PMK-1 p38 MAPK signaling is required for SKN-1 nuclear accumulation that is stimulated when insulin-like signaling is reduced (4Tullet J.M. Hertweck M. An J.H. Baker J. Hwang J.Y. Liu S. Oliveira R.P. Baumeister R. Blackwell T.K. Cell. 2008; 132: 1025-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Then we examined the effect of pmk-1 RNAi on life span and found that pmk-1 RNAi did not reduce life span significantly (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S2) (22Troemel E.R. Chu S.W. Reinke V. Lee S.S. Ausubel F.M. Kim D.H. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e183Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that pmk-1 null mutant worms do not live shorter life spans than wild-type worms (35Liberati N.T. Fitzgerald K.A. Kim D.H. Feinbaum R. Golenbock D.T. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6593-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that MPK-1 signaling, but not PMK-1 p38 MAPK signaling, is required for SKN-1 nuclear accumulation when insulin-like signaling is operating. DAF-16 is negatively regulated by the DAF-2/insulin-like signaling pathway (2Lee R.Y. Hench J. Ruvkun G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1950-1957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which MPK-1 or SKN-1 interacts with the DAF-2/insulin-like signaling pathway, we examined the effect of inhibition of mpk-1 or skn-1 on the life span in daf-2(e1370) worms, in which DAF-2 activity is greatly reduced. The RNAi of mpk-1 or skn-1 did not reduce the life span of daf-2(e1370) worms (Fig. 5A). In addition, we engineered a daf-2(e1370);skn-1(zu67) double mutant and found that skn-1(zu67) did not suppress the long life span of daf-2(e1370) (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that MPK-1 and SKN-1 might act upstream of DAF-2. We therefore considered the possibility that SKN-1 regulates the expression of insulin-like peptides. To test this idea, we investigated the effect of RNAi inactivation of skn-1 on the expression levels of insulin-like peptides. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that ins-39 was reproducibly and significantly up-regulated by skn-1 RNAi (Fig. 5C). In addition, daf-28 was likely to be up-regulated by skn-1 RNAi. To date, only a few of the insulin-like peptides have been investigated for their function. It has already been demonstrated that daf-28 acts as a DAF-2 agonist (36Li W. Kennedy S.G. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 844-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In fact, RNAi inactivation of daf-28 reproducibly extended life span with statistical significance in N2 worms (Fig. 5D), consistent with the previous finding of the long life span of daf-28 mutant worms (36Li W. Kennedy S.G. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 844-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Whether ins-39 acts as an agonist or an antagonist has been unknown. RNAi of ins-39 resulted in a small, but statistically significant, life span extension (Fig. 5D), suggesting that ins-39 also acts as a DAF-2 agonist in life span regulation. Taken together, our data suggest that one mechanism by which the transcription factor SKN-1 promotes longevity is through transcriptional repression of several insulin-like genes, which act as a DAF-2 agonist, such as ins-39 and daf-28. It has been shown that DAF-28 is expressed in many types of tissues, including intestine and ASI chemosensory neurons (36Li W. Kennedy S.G. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 844-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Moreover, SKN-1 is known to be expressed in intestine and ASI neurons (30An J.H. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1882-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In addition, our results show that MPK-1 is expressed in intestine and the nervous system. Thus, MPK-1 may modulate the expression of insulin-like peptides through SKN-1 in intestine and ASI. Recently, it has been reported that SKN-1 nuclear translocation is inhibited by DAF-2 downstream kinases (4Tullet J.M. Hertweck M. An J.H. Baker J. Hwang J.Y. Liu S. Oliveira R.P. Baumeister R. Blackwell T.K. Cell. 2008; 132: 1025-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). These findings, together with our result that SKN-1 represses the expression of insulin-like peptides, suggest a positive feedback pathway, in which SKN-1 should play a key role in extending life span (Fig. 5E). In this model, if DAF-2 activity is reduced, SKN-1 will be activated through SKN-1 nuclear accumulation, leading to the reduction of insulin-like peptides, which in turn will further reduce the DAF-2 activity, resulting in life span extension. All daf-2 mutations previously reported are hypomorphic alleles and are categorized into two classes, class 1 and 2 (37Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 38Gems D. Sutton A.J. Sundermeyer M.L. Albert P.S. King K.V. Edgley M.L. Larsen P.L. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 129-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In daf-2 mutant worms with weaker defects, SKN-1 inactivation-induced increase in insulin-like peptides would activate the remaining DAF-2 activity, resulting in the reduction of the longevity in the daf-2 worms. This is consistent with the finding that the longevity in the class 1 daf-2 mutant e1368 is suppressed by skn-1 mutation (4Tullet J.M. Hertweck M. An J.H. Baker J. Hwang J.Y. Liu S. Oliveira R.P. Baumeister R. Blackwell T.K. Cell. 2008; 132: 1025-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in daf-2 worms with more severe phenotypes, the insulin-like peptides induced by SKN-1 inactivation would fail to activate DAF-2, resulting in little or no effect on the longevity in the daf-2 worms. In agreement with this model, the results of Tullet et al. (4Tullet J.M. Hertweck M. An J.H. Baker J. Hwang J.Y. Liu S. Oliveira R.P. Baumeister R. Blackwell T.K. Cell. 2008; 132: 1025-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), as well as ours, in fact show that skn-1 RNAi and skn-1 mutations fail to suppress the longevity in the class 2 daf-2 mutant e1370 (4Tullet J.M.

In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time that the ERK-MAPK cascade promotes longevity of metazoans, and it identifies a novel ERK-mediated signaling pathway that promotes longevity in C. elegans. As ERK-MAPK signaling, insulin-like signaling, and SKN-1 transcription factors are all evolutionarily conserved, the identified signaling pathway that regulates longevity in C. elegans may be functioning in the regulation of age-related phenomena in diverse organisms. C. elegans strains were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health NCRR.

https://openalex.org/W2078980183,"The neuronal repellent SLIT2 is repressed in a number of cancer types primarily through promoter hypermethylation. SLIT2, however, has not been studied in prostate cancer. Through genome-wide location analysis we identified SLIT2 as a target of polycomb group (PcG) protein EZH2. The EZH2-containing polycomb repressive complexes bound to the SLIT2 promoter inhibiting its expression. SLIT2 was downregulated in a majority of metastatic prostate tumors, showing a negative correlation with EZH2. This repressed expression could be restored by methylation inhibitors or EZH2-suppressing compounds. In addition, a low level of SLIT2 expression was associated with aggressive prostate, breast and lung cancers. Functional assays showed that SLIT2 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Thus, this study showed for the first time the epigenetic silencing of SLIT2 in prostate tumors, and supported SLIT2 as a potential biomarker for aggressive solid tumors. Importantly, PcG-mediated repression may serve as a precursor for the silencing of SLIT2 by DNA methylation in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2064336559,"The cell polarity regulator, human Scribble (hScrib), is a potential tumour suppressor whose loss is a frequent event in late-stage cancer development. Little is yet known about the mode of action of hScrib, although recent reports suggest its role in the regulation of cell signalling. In this study we show that hScrib is a direct regulator of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In human keratinocytes, loss of hScrib results in elevated phospho-ERK levels and concomitant increased nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK. We also show that hScrib interacts with ERK through two well-conserved kinase interaction motif (KIM) docking sites, both of which are also required for ERK-induced phosphorylation of hScrib on two distinct residues. Although wild-type hScrib can downregulate activation of ERK and oncogenic Ras co-transforming activity, an hScrib mutant that lacks the carboxy terminal KIM docking site has no such effects. These results provide a clear mechanistic explanation of how hScrib can regulate ERK signalling and begin to explain how loss of hScrib during cancer development can contribute to disease progression."

The specificity of iron/copper inhibition of NEILs is indicated by a lack of similar inhibition of OGG1, which also indicated that the inhibition is due to metal binding to the enzymes and not DNA. Fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance studies show submicromolar binding of copper/iron to NEILs but not OGG1. Furthermore, Fe(II) inhibits the interaction of NEIL1 with downstream base excision repair proteins DNA polymerase β and flap endonuclease-1 by 4–6-fold. These results indicate that iron/copper overload in the neurodegenerative diseases could act as a double-edged sword by both increasing oxidative genome damage and preventing their repair.

https://openalex.org/W1974673851,"Inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt), which catalyzes the final step in the post-translational C-terminal processing of prenylated proteins, suppresses tumor cell growth and induces cell death. Icmt inhibition by either a small molecule inhibitor termed as cysmethynil or inhibitory RNA induces marked autophagy leading to cell death. HepG2 cells were used to investigate the function of autophagy in tumor cell death. Suppression of autophagy, either pharmacologically or through knockdown of the autophagy essential proteins, Atg5 or Atg1, inhibits not only cysmethynil-induced autophagy, but also apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The dependence of cysmethynil-induced apoptosis on autophagy was further shown using autophagy-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Atg5(-/-) MEF cells were found to be resistant to cysmethynil-induced apoptosis, whereas wild-type MEFs showed high sensitivity to apoptosis induction. These data indicate that inhibition of Icmt can elicit cell death through two linked mechanisms, autophagy and apoptosis, and that autophagy can be an active player upstream of apoptosis in cell types capable of apoptotic cell death, such as HepG2 and MEFs. Further, treatment of mice-bearing HepG2-derived tumors with cysmethynil resulted in marked inhibition of tumor growth; analysis of tumor tissue from these mice revealed markers consistent with autophagy induction and cell growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1997257060,"In metastatic cancer cells, the process of invasion is regulated by several transcription factors that induce changes required for migration and resistance to apoptosis. Slug (SNAI2, Snail2) is involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition in physiological and in pathological contexts. We show here that in embryonic kidney, colon carcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia-blast crisis, and in neuroblastoma cells, expression of Slug is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myb via Myb binding sites in the 5'-flanking region and in the first intron of the slug gene. In embryonic kidney and neuroblastoma cells, c-Myb induced vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin expression and membrane ruffling via actin polymerization consistent with the acquisition of a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Furthermore, down-regulation of endogenous c-Myb levels in colon carcinoma cells led to increased expression of E-cadherin and reduced levels of vimentin. Some of these changes are predominantly Slug-dependent as Slug silencing via RNA interference (RNAi) reverts the cells to a quasi-parental condition. Changes in gene expression and morphology induced by c-Myb-activated Slug correlated with increased ability to migrate (embryonic kidney) and to invade through a Matrigel membrane (embryonic kidney, colon carcinoma, neuroblastoma). c-Myb-dependent Slug expression was also essential for the homing of chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells to the bone marrow. In summary, we show here that the proto-oncogene c-Myb controls Slug transcription in tumor cells of different origin. Such a regulatory pathway contributes to the acquisition of invasive properties that are important for the metastatic process."

Antiport activity requires hetero-oligomeric complexes of all six or seven hydrophobic Mrp proteins (MrpA-MrpG). Here, a panel of site-directed mutants in conserved or proposed motif residues was made in the Mrp Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiporter from an alkaliphilic Bacillus. The mutant operons were expressed in antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli KNabc and assessed for antiport properties, support of sodium resistance, membrane levels of each Mrp protein, and presence of monomeric and dimeric Mrp complexes. Antiport did not depend on a VFF motif or a conserved tyrosine pair, but a role for a conserved histidine in a potential quinone binding site of MrpA was supported. The importance of several acidic residues for antiport was confirmed, and the importance of additional residues was demonstrated (e.g. three lysine residues conserved across MrpA, MrpD, and membrane-bound respiratory Complex I subunits (NuoL/M/N)). The results extended indications that MrpE is required for normal membrane levels of other Mrp proteins and for complex formation. Moreover, mutations in several other Mrp proteins lead to greatly reduced membrane levels of MrpE. Thus, changes in either of the two Mrp modules, MrpA-MrpD and MrpE-MrpG, influence the other. Two mutants, MrpB-P37G and MrpC-Q70A, showed a normal phenotype but lacked the MrpA-MrpG monomeric complex while retaining the dimeric hetero-oligomeric complex. Finally, MrpG-P81A and MrpG-P81G mutants exhibited no antiport activity but supported sodium resistance and a low [Na(+)](in). Such mutants could be used to screen hypothesized but uncharacterized sodium efflux functions of Mrp apart from Na(+) (Li(+))/H(+) antiport."

The functional effects of N30C-PLB, PLB3, and PLB4 on Ca2+-ATPase activity and E1∼P formation were correlated with their binding interactions with SERCA2a measured by chemical cross-linking.

Increasingly higher Ca2+ concentrations were also required to dissociate N30C-PLB, PLB3, and PLB4 from D351A, demonstrating directly that PLB antagonizes Ca2+ binding. Finally, the specific conformation of E2 (Ca2+-free state of SERCA2a) that binds PLB was investigated using the Ca2+-pump inhibitors thapsigargin and vanadate.

It is generally accepted that PLB inhibits Ca2+-ATPase activity by decreasing the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme, with little or no effect on maximal velocity (Vmax) measured at saturating Ca2+ concentration (1Simmerman H.K.

PLB inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity is reversed by phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 and Thr17 in response to β-adrenergic stimulation, dramatically increasing the rate of Ca2+ uptake into the SR, and enhancing the rates of cardiac relaxation and contraction (1Simmerman H.K.

Yet despite its prominent role in regulating cardiac function, the precise molecular mechanism of PLB inhibition remains unclear. PLB exists as a population of homopentamers and monomers in the SR membrane, the monomer being the active form responsible for Ca2+-ATPase inhibition (3Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M.

According to this model, PLB stabilizes the low Ca2+ affinity E2 conformation of the Ca2+ pump and blocks the transition to E1, the conformation required for high-affinity Ca2+ binding and ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1). Thus SERCA2a with PLB bound cannot bind Ca2+ and is catalytically inactive, and PLB must completely dissociate before the enzyme can transition to E1 and initiate Ca2+ transport. By antagonizing formation of E1, PLB significantly decreases the fraction of Ca2+ pumps available to transport Ca2+ at subsaturating Ca2+ concentration. This is manifested as a decrease in the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase, the hallmark of PLB inhibition (1Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).Ideally, to test the idea that PLB competes with Ca2+ for binding to SERCA2a, Ca2+ binding assays would be used to directly determine whether a population of Ca2+ pumps expressed alone and free from PLB bind Ca2+ with higher affinity than a population of Ca2+ pumps co-expressed with PLB. Unfortunately, accurate measurement of Ca2+ binding affinity with 45Ca2+ requires relatively high expression levels of the Ca2+-ATPase (13Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is difficult to achieve in recombinant systems (14Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As an alternative, we have demonstrated that the Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme is accurately estimated by assaying Ca2+ inhibition of PLB cross-linking to SERCA2a (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For example, N30C of PLB cross-links to Lys328 of SERCA2a with the heterobifunctional cross-linker KMUS, and PLB cross-linking is inhibited by micromolar Ca2+ concentration over the same concentration range (Ki ∼ 0.3 μm) as enzyme activation occurs (KCa ∼ 0.3 μm). However, because cross-linking assays cannot be used to assess the Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a expressed alone, the direct effect of PLB on Ca2+ affinity has yet to be determined. To overcome this limitation, here we compared the effects of a series of cross-linkable PLB mutants of increasing inhibitory strength on Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+ pump. If PLB competes with Ca2+ for binding to the Ca2+-ATPase, then as PLB becomes a stronger inhibitor of enzyme activity, higher concentrations of Ca2+ should be required to dissociate it from the Ca2+ pump.Earlier mutagenesis studies showed that the inhibitory function of PLB was enhanced by point mutations that either increased PLB monomer formation by destabilizing the PLB pentamer (e.g. L37A (3Kimura Y.

As these gain-of-function PLB mutants increased the KCa of enzyme activation more than wild-type PLB, they were termed “supershifters” (3Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-16064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the present study, supershifting mutations were combined with the cross-linking mutation, N30C, to create two new PLB mutants, PLB3 (N27A,N30C,L37A-PLB) and PLB4 (N27A,N30C,L37A,V49G-PLB) (Fig. 2). PLB3 and PLB4 are predicted to be strongly inhibitory compared with N30C-PLB (which has a normal inhibitory strength (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)), while remaining cross-linkable to the Ca2+ pump, thus allowing their physical interactions with SERCA2a to be measured simultaneously with their functional effects on enzyme activity. These cross-linkable PLB mutants of increasing inhibitory potency were used to demonstrate directly that PLB decreases the actual Ca2+ binding affinity of the enzyme. Our results indicate that PLB supershifters act by stabilizing a single conformation of SERCA2a, the nucleotide-bound E2 state, forming a ternary complex (E2·ATP·PLB) that is highly resistant to traditional Ca2+ pump inhibitors like TG and vanadate, which also act at E2 (18Sagara Y.

Using these cross-linkable PLB mutants, new insights were gained on the effect of PLB on the Ca2+ affinity and Vmax of the enzyme, the binding affinity of PLB for the Ca2+ pump, and the specific conformation of SERCA2a required for PLB binding.Effect of PLB on Ca2+ Binding Affinity and VmaxThe hallmark of PLB regulation of SERCA2a is its ability to decrease the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase, while having little or no effect on the Vmax of the enzyme measured at saturating Ca2+ concentration (1Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). However, whether PLB increases the KCa of Ca2+-ATPase activation by decreasing the actual Ca2+ binding affinity of the enzyme (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Chen Z. Akin B.L. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 78: 1306-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or by affecting one or more catalytic steps in the reaction cycle (23Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 267: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) has remained unclear. Here we addressed this question directly, using cross-linkable PLB mutants of increasing inhibitory potency (PLB4 > PLB3 > N30C-PLB). We showed that successively higher Ca2+ concentrations were required to both activate the enzyme co-expressed with N30C-PLB, PLB3, and PLB4 and to dissociate N30C-PLB, PLB3, and PLB4 from the Ca2+ pump. Moreover, there was a direct correlation between the degree of PLB binding to SERCA2a and the extent of PLB inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity at all Ca2+ concentrations tested with all three PLB mutants (Fig. 4C). These results strongly suggest that PLB competes with Ca2+ for binding to the Ca2+-ATPase, and that SERCA2a with PLB bound is catalytically inactive. Competition between PLB and Ca2+ for binding to SERCA2a was confirmed using the Ca2+ pump mutant D351A, which retains Ca2+ binding, but cannot hydrolyze ATP. Progressively higher Ca2+ concentrations were also required to dissociate the increasingly potent PLB mutants from D351A. Thus at each Ca2+ concentration tested, progressively more E2·PLB was formed by the increasingly inhibitory PLB mutants, meaning that less E1 was available for Ca2+ binding (Fig. 7D). Therefore, by stabilizing the enzyme in a Ca2+-free state, PLB decreases Ca2+ binding to the pump and alters the kinetics of enzyme activation by Ca2+.We also confirmed that PLB molecules of normal inhibitory strength (N30C-PLB) do not significantly affect the Vmax of the Ca2+-ATPase (1Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This is contrary to conclusions of several recent studies in which PLB was reported to either decrease (22Waggoner J.R. Huffman J. Froehlich J.P. Mahaney J.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or increase (20Reddy L.G. Cornea R.L. Winters D.L. McKenna E. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4585-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Trieber C.A. Douglas J.L. Afara M. Young H.S.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) the Vmax of the Ca2+-ATPase. Using our viral constructs and the 2D12 antibody, Waggoner et al. (22Waggoner J.R. Huffman J. Froehlich J.P. Mahaney J.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) recently noted a modest reduction (∼20%) in the Vmax of SERCA2a co-expressed with wild-type PLB compared with SERCA2a expressed alone. This is in disagreement with an earlier study in which no effect on Vmax was noted (37Mahaney J.E. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1306-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We believe that the modest reduction in Vmax observed by Waggoner et al. (22Waggoner J.R. Huffman J. Froehlich J.P. Mahaney J.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is more apparent than real. Fig. 4A points out that when Ca2+-ATPase activities are carefully corrected for Ca2+ pump expression levels, there is little or no inhibition of the enzyme at saturating Ca2+ concentrations when SERCA2a is co-expressed with PLB mutants of normal inhibitory potency (N30C-PLB). Moreover, this relief of Ca2+-ATPase inhibition at saturating Ca2+ concentration is entirely consistent with the complete dissociation of N30C-PLB from SERCA2a observed at 1–2 μm Ca2+ by chemical cross-linking (Fig. 4B). The studies in which wild-type PLB and some other PLB mutants were reported to actually increase the Vmax of the Ca2+-ATPase were all conducted with the purified rabbit skeletal muscle enzyme co-reconstituted with purified PLB from detergent solution (20Reddy L.G. Cornea R.L. Winters D.L. McKenna E. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4585-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Trieber C.A. Douglas J.L. Afara M. Young H.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this case, it is possible that enzyme protection by PLB during the reconstitution process may have artifactually affected the results, as was recently suggested (23Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Regardless, in multiple studies using cellular expression systems, no increase in Vmax by PLB has been noted (1Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).The results shown here illustrate how PLB is perfectly poised to regulate cardiac contractile kinetics in intact myocardium (Fig. 4). Ca2+ concentrations within the cardiomyocyte range from nanomolar to 1–2 μm (38Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and the affinity of PLB for SERCA2a allows it to associate and dissociate from the enzyme over the same Ca2+ concentration range at which contractile force develops. At low cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations at which myofilament contractile force is low, the affinity of PLB for the Ca2+ pump is high and enzyme inhibition by PLB is substantial, but still reversible by phosphorylation by protein kinase A (1Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) or by the 2D12 antibody (39Sham J.S. Jones L.R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1344-H1349PubMed Google Scholar). At high Ca2+ concentrations yielding peak contractile force, PLB is completely dissociated from the Ca2+ pump and the enzyme is maximally active. However, for the supershifting PLB mutants the situation is different. By virtue of their very high binding affinities for SERCA2a, the supershifters remain significantly bound to the Ca2+ pump and continue to inhibit the enzyme at Ca2+ concentrations that are normally saturating. At Ca2+ concentrations high enough to dissociate these potent PLB molecules from the Ca2+ pump (10–200 μm Ca2+) (Fig. 4), significant back inhibition of the enzyme occurs. Thus, maximal Ca2+-ATPase activity can never be realized when SERCA2a is co-expressed with potent PLB supershifters, even after phosphorylation of PLB by protein kinase A or after addition of the 2D12 antibody. This may explain why transgenic mice overexpressing the most potent PLB supershifters develop heart failure and premature death (16Haghighi K. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Brittsan A.G. Yatani A. Lester J.W. Zhai J. Kimura Y. Dorn 2nd, G.W. MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. J. Biol.

In an earlier study, MacIntosh et al. (24McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) used 8-N3-TNP-ATP photolabeling to measure the Ca2+ and ATP binding affinities of D351A (rabbit skeletal isoform) expressed in COS membranes. The authors found that relative to wild-type Ca2+-ATPase, D351A had an extraordinarily high affinity for both Ca2+ (>10-fold increase) and ATP (20–100-fold increase) (24McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). They postulated that Ala substitution at Asp351 significantly increases the ATP affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase by relieving electrostatic repulsion between the γ-phosphate of ATP and Asp351 of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, they proposed that mutationally induced conformational changes at the site of ATP binding within the cytoplasmic head group were transmitted to the Ca2+ binding sites located at the membrane, substantially increasing the Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme. The very high ATP affinity of D351A, but not the high Ca2+ affinity, was confirmed in a subsequent study by Marchand et al. (25Marchand A. Winther A.M. Holm P.J. Olesen C. Montigny C. Arnou B.

In this later report, ATP and Ca2+ binding affinities were determined for the purified enzyme in detergent solution.Here, using PLB cross-linking to estimate Ca2+ affinity, we also noted an extremely high Ca2+ affinity for D351A, this time using the cardiac muscle isoform (SERCA2a). Our results indicate that D351A has a Ca2+ affinity at least 10 times higher than wild-type SERCA2a (Fig. 7A). This result is consistent with the earlier findings of MacIntosh et al. (24McIntosh D.B.

It is well known that non-ionic detergents like C12E8 and dodecylmaltoside substantially decrease the Ca2+ binding affinity of SERCA pumps (40Watanabe T. Lewis D. Nakamoto R. Kurzmack M.

Activation of p38MAPK and p53 following these stresses helps protect cells against cancer development by initiating apoptosis. The duration of p38MAPK and p53 activation is regulated by the WIP1 phosphatase. BRCA1-IRIS triggers WIP1 expression in a p53-dependent and -independent manner. BRCA1-IRIS triggers the expression and cytoplasmic localization of the mRNA stabilization and translation inducer, HuR, that binds p53 and PPM1D mRNA. Hence, BRCA1-IRIS overexpression inactivates p38MAPK and/or p53 by upregulating WIP1 expression. BRCA1-IRIS abrogation of the homeostatic balance maintained by the p38MAPK-p53-WIP1 pathway suppressed cell death induced by a lethal dose of short-wavelength UV light, and high dosage of etoposide or H(2)O(2), and allowed cells to survive and proliferate post geno-/cell-toxic stresses. This mechanism represents a new link between geno-/cell-toxic stress and aggressive breast cancer formation in p53 wild-type cells."

A large international consortium reports in Nature on the diversity of genomic changes in families with autism spectrum disorders. Inherited and de novo mutations affecting many genes were discovered implicating disruption to postsynaptic and cellular signaling processes. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) embrace a combination of behavioral phenotypes impacting on cognitive, social, and motor functions. The genetic basis of ASD, originally revealed in twin and family studies, is now being investigated on a genome-wide level using recent technological advances, resulting in the discovery of a multiplicity of putative driver mutations in neuronal and neurodevelopmental genes, including postsynaptic genes (Pinto et al., 2010Pinto D. Pagnamenta A.T. Klei L. Anney R. Merico D. Regan R. Conroy J. Magalhaes T.R. Correia C. Abrahams B.S. et al.Nature. 2010; (in press. Published online June 9, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09146Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar [a recent issue of Nature]). Understanding how this complex genetic etiology disrupts biochemical mechanisms and influences the spectrum of behavioral phenotypes in individuals may lead to new therapeutic avenues and insights into the molecular basis of human social interactions. With the inexorable progress toward whole genome sequencing, mutations ranging in size from a single nucleotide to deletions and insertions of contiguous regions will be measured in each and every gene for all diseases. Many rare diseases of the nervous system are caused by a mutation in single genes, and there are “complex” diseases that have their basis in mutations affecting many genes. Prominent among these complex diseases are ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disease (Carroll and Owen, 2009Carroll L.S. Owen M.J. Genome Med. 2009; 1: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). While it is only a matter of time before we have a definitive description of the genomic variation in ASD individuals using whole genome sequencing, an international consortium has reported the genomic variation at a lower resolution in individuals and families with ASD (Pinto et al., 2010Pinto D. Pagnamenta A.T. Klei L. Anney R. Merico D. Regan R. Conroy J. Magalhaes T.R. Correia C. Abrahams B.S. et al.Nature. 2010; (in press. Published online June 9, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09146Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). This report, building on earlier studies, provides new evidence that changes in the function of many genes, arising by rare inherited and de novo mutations, underlie the behavioral phenotypes of ASD. The study surveyed the genome for deletions or insertions (extra copies of genomic DNA) greater than 30 kb in size and asked if ASD cases were different to controls. These are known as copy number variants (CNV) and represent a type of chromosomal rearrangement. Since the 1920s, chromosomal architecture was visualized using DNA staining and microscopy, giving rise to the discipline of cytogenetics, an approach that led to the discovery of the genetic basis of human diseases such as chronic myelogenous leukemia and Down's syndrome. Refinements in techniques including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and oligonucleotide hybridization improved the resolution of cytogenetic assays from tens of megabases to the current levels of ∼20 nucleotides. Unlike FISH, oligonucleotide microarrays allow rapid, efficient, and unbiased genome-wide assays for DNA variation and have fuelled high-resolution linkage and association scans seeking to find the mutational basis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ASD (Craddock et al., 2009Craddock N. Kendler K. Neale M. Nurnberger J. Purcell S. Rietschel M. Perlis R. Santangelo S.L. Schulze T.G. Schulze T. et al.Cross-Disorder Phenotype Group of the Psychiatric GWAS ConsortiumBr. J. Psychiatry. 2009; 195: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Psychiatric GWAS Consortium Coordinating Committee et al., 2009Cichon S. Craddock N. Daly M. Faraone S.V. Gejman P.V. Kelsoe J. Lehner T. Levinson D.F. Moran A. Sklar P. Sullivan P.F. Psychiatric GWAS Consortium Coordinating CommitteeAm. J. Psychiatry. 2009; 166: 540-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The present study used commercial microarrays with one million synthetic oligonucleotides designed to survey all genes and chromosomal regions with representative probes. Genomic DNA from cases and controls was hybridized to the microarrays, and the intensity of the hybridization signal provided a quantification of the number of DNA copies in that part of the genome. Why are CNVs good candidates for pathogenic variants? While polymorphisms in single nucleotides can alter protein structure and function, or influence gene regulation, the number of nucleotides affected by CNVs is much larger (Cheng et al., 2005Cheng Z. Ventura M. She X. Khaitovich P. Graves T. Osoegawa K. Church D. DeJong P. Wilson R.K. Pääbo S. et al.Nature. 2005; 437: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). CNVs are more likely to affect genes, either by insertions or deletions that interrupt protein coding regions, or change gene dosage (and thus levels of mRNA) by duplicating or deleting a copy of the gene. It is worth noting the similarity between CNVs and the favorite tools of the mouse geneticists—transgenic insertion or knockout deletion of whole genes—as both change gene dosage. Moreover, this emphasizes the relevance of mouse models as a tool to verify the functional significance of human CNVs. Before considering how CNVs might result in disease, it is important to remember that the genome is dynamic and constantly evolving, generating variation and diversity, much of which may be without phenotypic consequences. The extent of this diversity was revealed by a catalog of 11,700 CNVs found within normal populations measured using ultra-high density oligonucleotide arrays (Conrad et al., 2010Conrad D.F. Pinto D. Redon R. Feuk L. Gokcumen O. Zhang Y. Aerts J. Andrews T.D. Barnes C. Campbell P. et al.Wellcome Trust Case Control ConsortiumNature. 2010; 464: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Investigating 3432 common CNV regions, a large-scale study of eight common diseases (including bipolar disorder) concluded that common CNVs were unlikely to account for much disease (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium et al., 2010Craddock N. Hurles M.E. Cardin N. Pearson R.D. Plagnol V. Robson S. Vukcevic D. Barnes C. Conrad D.F. Giannoulatou E. et al.Wellcome Trust Case Control ConsortiumNature. 2010; 464: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). This leaves open the possibility that rare CNVs are more pathogenic but also underlines the challenge faced in establishing the functional significance of a CNV. Pinto et al., 2010Pinto D. Pagnamenta A.T. Klei L. Anney R. Merico D. Regan R. Conroy J. Magalhaes T.R. Correia C. Abrahams B.S. et al.Nature. 2010; (in press. Published online June 9, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09146Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar have used a family linkage study design to search the genome of ASD cases for gene disruptions by CNVs that segregate with ASD. They specifically examined those CNVs ≥30 kb in length that were rare (<1% of all individuals) and overlapped protein coding genes. They examined 996 ASD cases including 876 in parent-offspring trios, thus distinguishing inherited from de novo CNVs. CNVs in these trios were also compared with CNVs found in another 1287 normal controls. The average number of genes intersected by CNVs in each control individual was 3.6, giving an indication of the normal genic burden of CNVs. Their first finding was that ASD cases had 19% more affected genes (4.3 genes) than controls. This was statistically significant and stronger for deletions than insertions, suggesting that loss of function of genes is more frequent in ASD. Next, they asked whether these CNVs arose as inherited or de novo events; they found in their trios that 5.7% of cases had a de novo event, reinforcing earlier reports showing de novo mutations arise in complex neuropsychiatric disorders (Glessner et al., 2009Glessner J.T. Wang K. Cai G. Korvatska O. Kim C.E. Wood S. Zhang H. Estes A. Brune C.W. Bradfield J.P. et al.Nature. 2009; 459: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). This is an interesting and as yet unexplained phenomenon, which could reflect differences in mutation rate or genomic stability. A fundamental limitation on analysis of rare and de novo variants is the rarity of these events. For example, SHANK2, SynGAP, and DLGAP2 involvements in ASD were only supported by variants in one or two cases each. Despite the lack of formal statistical significance, however, the authors cite the fact that mutations in these proteins, their interacting partners, or their paralogs have been implicated before in ASD or mental retardation (Durand et al., 2007Durand C.M. Betancur C. Boeckers T.M. Bockmann J. Chaste P. Fauchereau F. Nygren G. Rastam M. Gillberg I.C. Anckarsäter H. et al.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, Hamdan et al., 2009Hamdan F.F. Gauthier J. Spiegelman D. Noreau A. Yang Y. Pellerin S. Dobrzeniecka S. Côté M. Perreau-Linck E. Perreault-Linck E. et al.Synapse to Disease GroupN. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Romorini et al., 2004Romorini S. Piccoli G. Jiang M. Grossano P. Tonna N. Passafaro M. Zhang M. Sala C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9391-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which helps to build the case for their relevance. As shown in Figure 1, they highlight SHANK2, SynGAP1, and DLGAP2, which interact in postsynaptic complexes with MAGUK (membrane associated guanylate kinase) proteins (PSD-95/DLG4, SAP102/DLG3, PSD-93/DLG2). MAGUKs also bind glutamate receptors (NMDA, AMPA, metabotropic) and Neuroligins, which in turn bind Neurexins, among other proteins. De novo CNVs disrupting Neurexin1 exons were detected in four ASD cases. Several of these additional interacting proteins were earlier implicated in other human cognitive disorders: mental retardation (SAP102/DLG3; SynGAP), ASD (SHANK3), and schizophrenia (PSD93/DLG2, DLGAP1). Additional support for the functional relevance of CNVs in these proteins comes from the observation that cognition is altered in knockout mouse models of SynGAP, SHANK1, and DLGAP3. One of the attractions of a model where rare mutations affect different proteins in the same multiprotein complex is that although a particular gene may be disrupted by only one CNV in a whole study, and thus fail to reach statistical significance, independent mutations in functionally interacting subsets of brain proteins may yet point the way to a biochemical mechanism for the disease. In addition, varying phenotypes due to mutations of different interacting proteins can help define the genetic underpinnings of the “spectrum” of related phenotypes. A detailed study of the specific endophenotypes of individuals with the mutations in SynGAP, SHANK, and DLGAP2 and other interacting proteins may shed light on the molecular basis of these ASD endophenotypes and their relationship to schizophrenia and other diseases. Although there is accumulating and compelling evidence that ASDs involve postsynaptic complexes, inspection of genic content of other de novo events reveals putative disruption of proteins found in the nucleus: NFIA is a transcriptional activator; CHD2 is a sequence-selective DNA binding helicase; RBL2 maintains chromatin configuration. It may be that ASD involves both nuclear and synaptic pathology due to some functional interconnection between these proteins. Another approach to the data was an enrichment analysis of rare variants with respect to several short gene lists constructed from the studies of others. This approach was useful, because it groups variants that by themselves are insignificantly associated with the disease and answer the question: are these data in agreement with those of others? One such list the authors used was an “autism implicated” list containing the 46 best candidate regions so far identified by others: 4.3% of cases in the present study had rare CNVs impacting genes in this list, compared to 2.3% of controls. Even though this may seem like a small proportion of the cases, it may be an underestimate resulting from limitations in the microarray method, which future resequencing of these genes will clarify. In an attempt to find known biochemical pathways or processes targeted by the CNVs, a gene set enrichment analysis was also performed using gene sets compiled from the Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, and other sources. Among 3493 gene-sets tested, only 76 exhibited enrichment, and then only in deletions, suggesting as before that deletions are more likely to cause functional disruption than insertions. Enriched sets included kinase activity, GTPase/Ras signaling, cell proliferation, cell projection, and motility, which generally point to signal transduction and growth related processes. Interestingly, although the tested gene sets included neurotransmitters and their receptors, these were not enriched by the ASD CNVs, suggesting ASD is less a disorder of neurotransmitters and more a disorder of intracellular signaling processes. Complex genetic disorders of the nervous system pose a range of special problems, some of which are illustrated by this study, and we believe will require new approaches. The fact that many genomic changes underpin ASD, schizophrenia, bipolar, and other complex genetic disorders, illustrates the need for research strategies that emphasize the function of sets of genes. The involvement of sets of genes in biochemical machines, such as postsynaptic signaling complexes (Fernández et al., 2009Fernández E. Collins M.O. Uren R.T. Kopanitsa M.V. Komiyama N.H. Croning M.D. Zografos L. Armstrong J.D. Choudhary J.S. Grant S.G. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 269Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or networks (Pocklington et al., 2006Pocklington A.J. Cumiskey M. Armstrong J.D. Grant S.G. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; (2006, 0023)PubMed Google Scholar) may reduce the statistical complexity of these investigations and offer clues to the underlying etiology of these diseases. How these networks are altered by the range of mutations could be tested with suitable model systems, which will always need to include behavioral models since the diseases manifest as social, cognitive, and motoric changes. In this regard, we see a need for programs of systematic analysis of mouse models in specific and relevant psychological tests that are coordinated with human genetic studies and genome sequencing. As indicated by Pinto et al., 2010Pinto D. Pagnamenta A.T. Klei L. Anney R. Merico D. Regan R. Conroy J. Magalhaes T.R. Correia C. Abrahams B.S. et al.Nature. 2010; (in press. Published online June 9, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09146Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, it will be essential to ask if specific components within the spectrum of autism phenotypes map onto specific genotypes; an endeavor that will require coordinated efforts of clinicians and geneticists. The scale of the genetic complexity, the need to coordinate human genetic studies with mouse genetic models and the need to coordinate clinical studies with genome sequencing suggests that ASD, as well as schizophrenia, bipolar, and other complex diseases, would greatly benefit from coordinated large scale international research programs."
