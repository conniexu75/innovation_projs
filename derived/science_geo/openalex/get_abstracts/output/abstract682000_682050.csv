https://openalex.org/W3202301083,"In gels and elastomers, the role of entanglements on deformation has been studied, but their effects on fracture, fatigue, and friction are less well understood. In this study, we synthesized polymers in which entanglements greatly outnumber cross-links. The dense entanglements enable transmission of tension in a polymer chain along its length and to many other chains. The sparse cross-links prevent the polymer chains from disentangling. These polymers have high toughness, strength, and fatigue resistance. After submersion in water, the polymers swell to equilibrium, and the resulting hydrogels have low hysteresis, low friction, and high wear resistance."

Yet, they are plagued by sluggish kinetics and parasitic reactions. We found a family of methoxyethyl-amine chelants that greatly promote interfacial charge transfer kinetics and suppress side reactions on both the cathode and metal anode through solvation sheath reorganization, thus enabling stable and highly reversible cycling of the RMB and RCB full cells with energy densities of 412 and 471 watt-hours per kilogram, respectively. This work provides a versatile electrolyte design strategy for divalent metal batteries."

To increase vaccination rates, governments across the world are considering the use of monetary incentives. Here we present evidence about the effect of guaranteed payments on COVID-19 vaccination uptake. We ran a large preregistered randomized controlled trial (with 8286 participants) in Sweden and linked the data to population-wide administrative vaccination records. We found that modest monetary payments of 24 US dollars (200 Swedish kronor) increased vaccination rates by 4.2 percentage points (P = 0.005), from a baseline rate of 71.6%. By contrast, behavioral nudges increased stated intentions to become vaccinated but had only small and not statistically significant impacts on vaccination rates. The results highlight the potential of modest monetary incentives to raise vaccination rates."
https://openalex.org/W3202358235,"Dendritic and axonal morphology reflects the input and output of neurons and is a defining feature of neuronal types1,2, yet our knowledge of its diversity remains limited. Here, to systematically examine complete single-neuron morphologies on a brain-wide scale, we established a pipeline encompassing sparse labelling, whole-brain imaging, reconstruction, registration and analysis. We fully reconstructed 1,741 neurons from cortex, claustrum, thalamus, striatum and other brain regions in mice. We identified 11 major projection neuron types with distinct morphological features and corresponding transcriptomic identities. Extensive projectional diversity was found within each of these major types, on the basis of which some types were clustered into more refined subtypes. This diversity follows a set of generalizable principles that govern long-range axonal projections at different levels, including molecular correspondence, divergent or convergent projection, axon termination pattern, regional specificity, topography, and individual cell variability. Although clear concordance with transcriptomic profiles is evident at the level of major projection type, fine-grained morphological diversity often does not readily correlate with transcriptomic subtypes derived from unsupervised clustering, highlighting the need for single-cell cross-modality studies. Overall, our study demonstrates the crucial need for quantitative description of complete single-cell anatomy in cell-type classification, as single-cell morphological diversity reveals a plethora of ways in which different cell types and their individual members may contribute to the configuration and function of their respective circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3202498768,"Single-cell transcriptomics can provide quantitative molecular signatures for large, unbiased samples of the diverse cell types in the brain1-3. With the proliferation of multi-omics datasets, a major challenge is to validate and integrate results into a biological understanding of cell-type organization. Here we generated transcriptomes and epigenomes from more than 500,000 individual cells in the mouse primary motor cortex, a structure that has an evolutionarily conserved role in locomotion. We developed computational and statistical methods to integrate multimodal data and quantitatively validate cell-type reproducibility. The resulting reference atlas-containing over 56 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies and modalities-is a comprehensive molecular and genomic account of the diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex. The atlas includes a population of excitatory neurons that resemble pyramidal cells in layer 4 in other cortical regions4. We further discovered thousands of concordant marker genes and gene regulatory elements for these cell types. Our results highlight the complex molecular regulation of cell types in the brain and will directly enable the design of reagents to target specific cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex for functional analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3204722966,"The neocortex is disproportionately expanded in human compared with mouse1,2, both in its total volume relative to subcortical structures and in the proportion occupied by supragranular layers composed of neurons that selectively make connections within the neocortex and with other telencephalic structures. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human and mouse neocortex show an increased diversity of glutamatergic neuron types in supragranular layers in human neocortex and pronounced gradients as a function of cortical depth3. Here, to probe the functional and anatomical correlates of this transcriptomic diversity, we developed a robust platform combining patch clamp recording, biocytin staining and single-cell RNA-sequencing (Patch-seq) to examine neurosurgically resected human tissues. We demonstrate a strong correspondence between morphological, physiological and transcriptomic phenotypes of five human glutamatergic supragranular neuron types. These were enriched in but not restricted to layers, with one type varying continuously in all phenotypes across layers 2 and 3. The deep portion of layer 3 contained highly distinctive cell types, two of which express a neurofilament protein that labels long-range projection neurons in primates that are selectively depleted in Alzheimer's disease4,5. Together, these results demonstrate the explanatory power of transcriptomic cell-type classification, provide a structural underpinning for increased complexity of cortical function in humans, and implicate discrete transcriptomic neuron types as selectively vulnerable in disease."
https://openalex.org/W3201967841,"The microbiota comprises the microorganisms that live in close contact with the host, with mutual benefit for both counterparts. The contribution of the gut microbiota to the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has not yet been addressed. We found that androgen deprivation in mice and humans promotes the expansion of defined commensal microbiota that contributes to the onset of castration resistance in mice. Specifically, the intestinal microbial community in mice and patients with CRPC was enriched for species capable of converting androgen precursors into active androgens. Ablation of the gut microbiota by antibiotic therapy delayed the emergence of castration resistance even in immunodeficient mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CRPC mice and patients rendered mice harboring prostate cancer resistant to castration. In contrast, tumor growth was controlled by FMT from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients and Prevotella stercorea administration. These results reveal that the commensal gut microbiota contributes to endocrine resistance in CRPC by providing an alternative source of androgens."
https://openalex.org/W3203176450,"The cerebellar cortex is a well-studied brain structure with diverse roles in motor learning, coordination, cognition and autonomic regulation. However, a complete inventory of cerebellar cell types is currently lacking. Here, using recent advances in high-throughput transcriptional profiling1-3, we molecularly define cell types across individual lobules of the adult mouse cerebellum. Purkinje neurons showed considerable regional specialization, with the greatest diversity occurring in the posterior lobules. For several types of cerebellar interneuron, the molecular variation within each type was more continuous, rather than discrete. In particular, for the unipolar brush cells-an interneuron population previously subdivided into discrete populations-the continuous variation in gene expression was associated with a graded continuum of electrophysiological properties. Notably, we found that molecular layer interneurons were composed of two molecularly and functionally distinct types. Both types show a continuum of morphological variation through the thickness of the molecular layer, but electrophysiological recordings revealed marked differences between the two types in spontaneous firing, excitability and electrical coupling. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the cerebellar cortex, and outline a methodological and conceptual framework for the integration of molecular, morphological and physiological ontologies for defining brain cell types."
https://openalex.org/W3204603437,"Orbital data indicate that the youngest volcanic units on the Moon are basalt lavas in Oceanus Procellarum, a region with high levels of the heat-producing elements potassium, thorium, and uranium. The Chang’e-5 mission collected samples of these young lunar basalts and returned them to Earth for laboratory analysis. We measure an age of 1963 ± 57 million years for these lavas and determine their chemical and mineralogical compositions. This age constrains the lunar impact chronology of the inner Solar System and the thermal evolution of the Moon. There is no evidence for high concentrations of heat-producing elements in the deep mantle of the Moon that generated these lavas, so alternate explanations are required for the longevity of lunar magmatism."

The ability to couple the motion of levitated systems to internal degrees of freedom, as well as to external forces and systems, provides opportunities for science and technology. Attractive research directions, ranging from fundamental quantum physics to commercial sensors, have been unlocked by the many recent experimental achievements, including motional ground-state cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle. Here we review the status, challenges, and prospects of levitodynamics, the multidisciplinary research area devoted to understanding, controlling, and using levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuum."
https://openalex.org/W3204585804,"To anchor in seashore habitats, mussels fabricate adhesive byssus fibers that are mechanically reinforced by protein-metal coordination mediated by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). The mechanism by which metal ions are integrated during byssus formation remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the byssus formation process in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, combining traditional and advanced methods to identify how and when metals are incorporated. Mussels store iron and vanadium ions in intracellular metal storage particles (MSPs) complexed with previously unknown catechol-based biomolecules. During adhesive formation, stockpiled secretory vesicles containing concentrated fluid proteins are mixed with MSPs within a microfluidic-like network of interconnected channels where they coalesce, forming protein-metal bonds within the nascent byssus. These findings advance our understanding of metal use in biological materials with implications for next-generation metallopolymers and adhesives."
https://openalex.org/W3202349862,"The human brain is subdivided into distinct anatomical structures, including the neocortex, which in turn encompasses dozens of distinct specialized cortical areas. Early morphogenetic gradients are known to establish early brain regions and cortical areas, but how early patterns result in finer and more discrete spatial differences remains poorly understood1. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile ten major brain structures and six neocortical areas during peak neurogenesis and early gliogenesis. Within the neocortex, we find that early in the second trimester, a large number of genes are differentially expressed across distinct cortical areas in all cell types, including radial glia, the neural progenitors of the cortex. However, the abundance of areal transcriptomic signatures increases as radial glia differentiate into intermediate progenitor cells and ultimately give rise to excitatory neurons. Using an automated, multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization approach, we find that laminar gene-expression patterns are highly dynamic across cortical regions. Together, our data suggest that early cortical areal patterning is defined by strong, mutually exclusive frontal and occipital gene-expression signatures, with resulting gradients giving rise to the specification of areas between these two poles throughout successive developmental timepoints."
https://openalex.org/W3203909927,"The cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop is one of the fundamental network motifs in the brain. Revealing its structural and functional organization is critical to understanding cognition, sensorimotor behaviour, and the natural history of many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Classically, this network is conceptualized to contain three information channels: motor, limbic and associative1-4. Yet this three-channel view cannot explain the myriad functions of the basal ganglia. We previously subdivided the dorsal striatum into 29 functional domains on the basis of the topography of inputs from the entire cortex5. Here we map the multi-synaptic output pathways of these striatal domains through the globus pallidus external part (GPe), substantia nigra reticular part (SNr), thalamic nuclei and cortex. Accordingly, we identify 14 SNr and 36 GPe domains and a direct cortico-SNr projection. The striatonigral direct pathway displays a greater convergence of striatal inputs than the more parallel striatopallidal indirect pathway, although direct and indirect pathways originating from the same striatal domain ultimately converge onto the same postsynaptic SNr neurons. Following the SNr outputs, we delineate six domains in the parafascicular and ventromedial thalamic nuclei. Subsequently, we identify six parallel cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic subnetworks that sequentially transduce specific subsets of cortical information through every elemental node of the cortico-﻿basal ganglia-thalamic loop. Thalamic domains relay this output back to the originating corticostriatal neurons of each subnetwork in a bona fide closed loop."
https://openalex.org/W3202762561,"An essential step toward understanding brain function is to establish a structural framework with cellular resolution on which multi-scale datasets spanning molecules, cells, circuits and systems can be integrated and interpreted1. Here, as part of the collaborative Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we derive a comprehensive cell type-based anatomical description of one exemplar brain structure, the mouse primary motor cortex, upper limb area (MOp-ul). Using genetic and viral labelling, barcoded anatomy resolved by sequencing, single-neuron reconstruction, whole-brain imaging and cloud-based neuroinformatics tools, we delineated the MOp-ul in 3D and refined its sublaminar organization. We defined around two dozen projection neuron types in the MOp-ul and derived an input-output wiring diagram, which will facilitate future analyses of motor control circuitry across molecular, cellular and system levels. This work provides a roadmap towards a comprehensive cellular-resolution description of mammalian brain architecture."
https://openalex.org/W3202798549,"The utility and lifetime of materials made from polymer networks, including hydrogels, depend on their capacity to stretch and resist tearing. In gels and elastomers, those mechanical properties are often limited by the covalent chemical structure of the polymer strands between cross-links, which is typically fixed during the material synthesis. We report polymer networks in which the constituent strands lengthen through force-coupled reactions that are triggered as the strands reach their nominal breaking point. In comparison with networks made from analogous control strands, reactive strand extensions of up to 40% lead to hydrogels that stretch 40 to 50% further and exhibit tear energies that are twice as large. The enhancements are synergistic with those provided by double-network architectures and complement other existing toughening strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3204504083,"The concept of tipping points and critical transitions helps inform our understanding of the catastrophic effects that global change may have on ecosystems, Earth system components, and the whole Earth system. The search for early warning indicators is ongoing, and spatial self-organization has been interpreted as one such signal. Here, we review how spatial self-organization can aid complex systems to evade tipping points and can therefore be a signal of resilience instead. Evading tipping points through various pathways of spatial pattern formation may be relevant for many ecosystems and Earth system components that hitherto have been identified as tipping prone, including for the entire Earth system. We propose a systematic analysis that may reveal the broad range of conditions under which tipping is evaded and resilience emerges."
https://openalex.org/W3204109301,"Abstract The mammalian cerebrum performs high-level sensory perception, motor control and cognitive functions through highly specialized cortical and subcortical structures 1 . Recent surveys of mouse and human brains with single-cell transcriptomics 2–6 and high-throughput imaging technologies 7,8 have uncovered hundreds of neural cell types distributed in different brain regions, but the transcriptional regulatory programs that are responsible for the unique identity and function of each cell type remain unknown. Here we probe the accessible chromatin in more than 800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions that span the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to map the state of 491,818 candidate cis -regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct cell types. We find high specificity of spatial distribution for not only excitatory neurons, but also most classes of inhibitory neurons and a subset of glial cell types. We characterize the gene regulatory sequences associated with the regional specificity within these cell types. We further link a considerable fraction of the cis -regulatory elements to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and predict transcriptional regulators that are involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations. Our results provide a foundation for comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs of the mammalian brain and assist in the interpretation of noncoding risk variants associated with various neurological diseases and traits in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3202970776,"Observations from orbital spacecraft have shown that Jezero crater on Mars contains a prominent fan-shaped body of sedimentary rock deposited at its western margin. The Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater in February 2021. We analyze images taken by the rover in the 3 months after landing. The fan has outcrop faces, which were invisible from orbit, that record the hydrological evolution of Jezero crater. We interpret the presence of inclined strata in these outcrops as evidence of deltas that advanced into a lake. In contrast, the uppermost fan strata are composed of boulder conglomerates, which imply deposition by episodic high-energy floods. This sedimentary succession indicates a transition from sustained hydrologic activity in a persistent lake environment to highly energetic short-duration fluvial flows."
https://openalex.org/W3202866474,"Diverse types of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons mediate the myriad processing streams and output channels of the cerebral cortex1,2, yet all derive from neural progenitors of the embryonic dorsal telencephalon3,4. Here we establish genetic strategies and tools for dissecting and fate-mapping subpopulations of pyramidal neurons on the basis of their developmental and molecular programs. We leverage key transcription factors and effector genes to systematically target temporal patterning programs in progenitors and differentiation programs in postmitotic neurons. We generated over a dozen temporally inducible mouse Cre and Flp knock-in driver lines to enable the combinatorial targeting of major progenitor types and projection classes. Combinatorial strategies confer viral access to subsets of pyramidal neurons defined by developmental origin, marker expression, anatomical location and projection targets. These strategies establish an experimental framework for understanding the hierarchical organization and developmental trajectory of subpopulations of pyramidal neurons that assemble cortical processing networks and output channels."
https://openalex.org/W3204113955,"Symptoms of neurological diseases emerge through the dysfunction of neural circuits whose diffuse and intertwined architectures pose serious challenges for delivering therapies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves Parkinson’s disease symptoms acutely but does not differentiate between neuronal circuits, and its effects decay rapidly if stimulation is discontinued. Recent findings suggest that optogenetic manipulation of distinct neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe) provides long-lasting therapeutic effects in dopamine-depleted (DD) mice. We used synaptic differences to excite parvalbumin-expressing GPe neurons and inhibit lim-homeobox-6–expressing GPe neurons simultaneously using brief bursts of electrical stimulation. In DD mice, circuit-inspired DBS provided long-lasting therapeutic benefits that far exceeded those induced by conventional DBS, extending several hours after stimulation. These results establish the feasibility of transforming knowledge of circuit architecture into translatable therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3176440618,"Policy decisions on COVID-19 interventions should be informed by a local, regional and national understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Epidemic waves may result when restrictions are lifted or poorly adhered to, variants with new phenotypic properties successfully invade, or infection spreads to susceptible subpopulations. Three COVID-19 epidemic waves have been observed in Kenya. Using a mechanistic mathematical model, we explain the first two distinct waves by differences in contact rates in high and low social-economic groups, and the third wave by the introduction of higher-transmissibility variants. Reopening schools led to a minor increase in transmission between the second and third waves. Socioeconomic and urban–rural population structure are critical determinants of viral transmission in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W3204119535,"Abstract Full-length SMART-seq 1 single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to measure gene expression at isoform resolution, making possible the identification of specific isoform markers for different cell types. Used in conjunction with spatial RNA capture and gene-tagging methods, this enables the inference of spatially resolved isoform expression for different cell types. Here, in a comprehensive analysis of 6,160 mouse primary motor cortex cells assayed with SMART-seq, 280,327 cells assayed with MERFISH 2 and 94,162 cells assayed with 10x Genomics sequencing 3 , we find examples of isoform specificity in cell types—including isoform shifts between cell types that are masked in gene-level analysis—as well as examples of transcriptional regulation. Additionally, we show that isoform specificity helps to refine cell types, and that a multi-platform analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data leveraging multiple measurements provides a comprehensive atlas of transcription in the mouse primary motor cortex that improves on the possibilities offered by any single technology."
https://openalex.org/W3202030821,"Topological photonics offers enhanced control over electromagnetic fields by providing a platform for robust trapping and guiding of topological states of light. By combining the strong coupling between topological photons with phonons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we demonstrate a platform to control and guide hybrid states of light and lattice vibrations. The observed topological edge states of phonon-polaritons are found to carry nonzero angular momentum locked to their propagation direction, which enables their robust transport. Thus, these topological quasiparticles enable the funneling of infrared phonons mediated by helical infrared photons along arbitrary pathways and across sharp bends, thereby offering opportunities for applications ranging from Raman and vibrational spectroscopy with structured phonon-polaritons to directional heat dissipation."
https://openalex.org/W3204234479,"Grain boundary velocity has been believed to be correlated to curvature, and this is an important relationship for modeling how polycrystalline materials coarsen during annealing. We determined the velocities and curvatures of approximately 52,000 grain boundaries in a nickel polycrystal using three-dimensional orientation maps measured by high-energy diffraction microscopy before and after annealing at 800°C. Unexpectedly, the grain boundary velocities and curvatures were uncorrelated. Instead, we found strong correlations between the boundary velocity and the five macroscopic parameters that specify grain boundary crystallography. The sensitivity of the velocity to grain boundary crystallography might be the result of defect-mediated grain boundary migration or the anisotropy of the grain boundary energy. The absence of a correlation between velocity and curvature likely results from the constraints imposed by the grain boundary network and implies the need for a new model for grain boundary migration."
https://openalex.org/W3204158522,"Abstract Neuronal cell types are classically defined by their molecular properties, anatomy and functions. Although recent advances in single-cell genomics have led to high-resolution molecular characterization of cell type diversity in the brain 1 , neuronal cell types are often studied out of the context of their anatomical properties. To improve our understanding of the relationship between molecular and anatomical features that define cortical neurons, here we combined retrograde labelling with single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing to link neural epigenomic properties to projections. We examined 11,827 single neocortical neurons from 63 cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical long-distance projections. Our results showed unique epigenetic signatures of projection neurons that correspond to their laminar and regional location and projection patterns. On the basis of their epigenomes, intra-telencephalic cells that project to different cortical targets could be further distinguished, and some layer 5 neurons that project to extra-telencephalic targets (L5 ET) formed separate clusters that aligned with their axonal projections. Such separation varied between cortical areas, which suggests that there are area-specific differences in L5 ET subtypes, which were further validated by anatomical studies. Notably, a population of cortico-cortical projection neurons clustered with L5 ET rather than intra-telencephalic neurons, which suggests that a population of L5 ET cortical neurons projects to both targets. We verified the existence of these neurons by dual retrograde labelling and anterograde tracing of cortico-cortical projection neurons, which revealed axon terminals in extra-telencephalic targets including the thalamus, superior colliculus and pons. These findings highlight the power of single-cell epigenomic approaches to connect the molecular properties of neurons with their anatomical and projection properties."
https://openalex.org/W3202865057,"Recently reported to be effective in patients with lung cancer, KRASG12C inhibitors bind to the inactive, or guanosine diphosphate (GDP)–bound, state of the oncoprotein and require guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis for inhibition. However, KRAS mutations prevent the catalytic arginine of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) from enhancing an otherwise slow hydrolysis rate. If KRAS mutants are indeed insensitive to GAPs, it is unclear how KRASG12C hydrolyzes sufficient GTP to allow inactive state–selective inhibition. Here, we show that RGS3, a GAP previously known for regulating G protein–coupled receptors, can also enhance the GTPase activity of mutant and wild-type KRAS proteins. Our study reveals an unexpected mechanism that inactivates KRAS and explains the vulnerability to emerging clinically effective therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3204888812,"Circadian clocks control gene expression to provide an internal representation of local time. We report reconstitution of a complete cyanobacterial circadian clock in vitro, including the central oscillator, signal transduction pathways, downstream transcription factor, and promoter DNA. The entire system oscillates autonomously and remains phase coherent for many days with a fluorescence-based readout that enables real-time observation of each component simultaneously without user intervention. We identified the molecular basis for loss of cycling in an arrhythmic mutant and explored fundamental mechanisms of timekeeping in the cyanobacterial clock. We find that SasA, a circadian sensor histidine kinase associated with clock output, engages directly with KaiB on the KaiC hexamer to regulate period and amplitude of the central oscillator. SasA uses structural mimicry to cooperatively recruit the rare, fold-switched conformation of KaiB to the KaiC hexamer to form the nighttime repressive complex and enhance rhythmicity of the oscillator, particularly under limiting concentrations of KaiB. Thus, the expanded in vitro clock reveals previously unknown mechanisms by which the circadian system of cyanobacteria maintains the pace and rhythmicity under variable protein concentrations."

We developed a method for quantifying axonal orientations at a resolution of ~15 micrometers. This method is based on the common Nissl staining technique for postmortem histological slices. Nissl staining reveals the spatial organization of glial cells along axons. Using structure tensor analysis, we leveraged this patterned organization to uncover local axonal orientation. We used Nissl-based structure tensor analysis to extract fine details of axonal architecture and demonstrated its applicability in multiple datasets of humans and nonhuman primates. Nissl-based structure tensor analysis can be used to compare fine-grained features of axonal architecture across species and is widely applicable to existing datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3202642817,"Men have a higher risk of death from COVID-19 than women and androgens facilitate entrance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into respiratory epithelial cells. Thus, androgen deprivation therapy may reduce infection rates and improve outcomes for COVID-19. In the spring of 2020, Sweden was highly affected by COVID-19. The aim was to estimate the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on mortality from COVID-19 in men with prevalent prostate cancer by comparing all-cause mortality in the spring of 2020 to that in previous years.Using the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden all men with prostate cancer on March 1 each year in 2015-2020 were followed until June 30 the same year. Exposure to androgen deprivation therapy was ascertained from filled prescriptions for bicalutamide monotherapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH), or bilateral orchidectomy.A total of 9,822 men died in March-June in the years 2015-2020, of whom 5,034 men were on androgen deprivation therapy. There was an excess mortality in 2020 vs previous years in all men. The crude relative mortality rate ratio for 2020 vs 2015-2019 was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.04) in men on GnRH, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.05) in men on bicalutamide monotherapy. After multivariable adjustment these ratios were attenuated to 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.12), respectively. When restricting the analysis to the regions with the highest incidence of COVID-19 or to the time period between 2 April to 10 June when mortality in 2020 was increased >30% compared to previous years, the results were similar to the main analysis.In this large national population-based cohort of men with prevalent prostate cancer, there was no clear evidence in support for an effect of androgen deprivation therapy on COVID-19 mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3201883528,"Aim Several pathophysiological processes are involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and could inform in vivo biomarkers. We assessed an established biomarker panel, validated in Alzheimer’s Disease, in a PD cohort. Methods Longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from PPMI (252 PD, 115 healthy controls, HC) were analyzed at six timepoints (baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months follow-up) using Elecsys® electrochemiluminescence immunoassays to quantify neurofilament light chain (NfL), soluble TREM2 receptor (sTREM2), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), S100, and total α-synuclein (αSyn). Results αSyn was significantly lower in PD (mean 103 pg/ml vs. HC: 127 pg/ml, p&lt;0.01; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.64), while all other biomarkers were not significantly different (AUC NfL: 0.49, sTREM2: 0.54, YKL40: 0.57, GFAP: 0.55, IL-6: 0.53, S100: 0.54, p&gt;0.05) and none showed a significant difference longitudinally. We found significantly higher levels of all these markers between PD patients who developed cognitive decline during follow-up, except for αSyn and IL-6. Conclusion Except for αSyn, the additional biomarkers did not differentiate PD and HC, and none showed longitudinal differences, but most markers predict cognitive decline in PD during follow-up."

We directly imaged the evolution of a specific set of α-phellandrene conformers into the product isomer predicted by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules in real space and time. Our experimental results are in quantitative agreement with nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics simulations, which provide considerable detail of how conformation influences the time scale and quantum efficiency of photoinduced ring-opening reactions."
https://openalex.org/W3204864872,"Aims of this study were: to verify if Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) time series could determine both ventilatory thresholds in individuals with different fitness levels, and to assess the validity of RQA method compared to gas-exchange method (GE). The two thresholds were estimated in thirty young individuals during incremental exercise on cycle-ergometer: Heart rate (HR), Oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) and Workload were measured by the two methods (RQA and GE). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess main effects of methods and methods-by-groups interaction effects for HR, VO 2 and Workload at aerobic (AerT) and anaerobic (AnT) thresholds. Validity of RQA at both thresholds was assessed for HR, VO 2 and Workload by Ordinary Least Products (OLP) regression, Typical Percentage Error (TE), Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland Altman plots. No methods-by-groups interaction effects were detected for HR, VO 2 and Workload at AerT and AnT. The OLP analysis showed that at both thresholds RQA and GE methods had very strong correlations ( r &gt;0.8) in all variables (HR, VO 2 and Workload). Slope and intercept values always included the 1 and the 0, respectively. At AerT the TE ranged from 4.02% (5.48 bpm) to 10.47% (8.53 Watts) (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent (≥0.85). At AnT the TE ranged from 2.53% (3.98 bpm) to 6.64% (7.81 Watts) (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent (≥0.90). Therefore, RQA of HRV time series is a new valid approach to determine both ventilatory thresholds in individuals with different physical fitness levels, it can be used when gas analysis is not possible or not convenient."

Despite existing work that suggests who dehumanizes particular outgroups and who is often dehumanized, the extant literature knows less about why people dehumanize outgroups such as immigrants. The current work takes up this opportunity by examining why people dehumanize immigrants said to be illegal and how measurement format affects dehumanization ratings. Participants ( N = 672) dehumanized such immigrants more if their ratings were made on a slider versus clicking images of hominids, an effect most pronounced for Republicans. Dehumanization was negatively associated with warmth toward illegal immigrants and the perceived unhappiness felt by illegal immigrants from U.S. immigration policies. Finally, most dehumanization is not entirely blatant but instead, captured by virtuous violence and affect as well, suggesting the many ways that dehumanization can manifest as predicted by theory. This work offers a mechanistic account for why people dehumanize immigrants and addresses how survey measurement artifacts (e.g., clicking on images of hominids vs. using a slider) affect dehumanization rates. We discuss how these data extend dehumanization theory and inform empirical research."
https://openalex.org/W3203467158,"Background Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria among pregnant women with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), is one of the three recommended interventions for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) in sub-Sahara Africa. The World Health Organisation recommended in 2012 that SP be given at each scheduled ANC visit except during the first trimester and can be given a dose every month until the time of delivery, to ensure that a high proportion of women receive at least three doses of SP during pregnancy. Despite implementation of this policy, Ghana did not attain the target of 100% access to IPTp-SP by 2015. Additionally, negative outcomes of malaria infection in pregnancy are still recurring. This ethnographic study explored how health system, individual and socio-cultural factors influence IPTp-SP uptake in two Ghanaian regions. Methods The study design was ethnographic, employing non-participant observation, case studies and in depth interviews in 8 health facilities and 8 communities, from April 2018 to March 2019, in two Ghanaian regions. Recommended ethical procedures were observed. Results Health system factors such as organization of antenatal care (ANC) services and strategies employed by health workers to administer SP contributed to initial uptake. Women’s trust in the health care system contributed to continued uptake. Inadequate information provided to women accessing ANC, stock-outs and fees charged for ANC services reduced access to IPTp-SP. Socio-cultural factor such as encouragement from social networks influenced utilization of ANC services and IPTp-SP uptake. Individual factors such as refusing to take SP, skipping ANC appointments and initiating ANC attendance late affected uptake. Conclusion Health system, socio-cultural and individual factors influence uptake of optimum doses of IPTp-SP. Consequently, interventions that aim at addressing IPTp-SP uptake should focus on regular and sufficient supply of SP to health facilities, effective implementation of free ANC, provision of appropriate and adequate information to women and community outreach programmes to encourage early and regular ANC visits."
https://openalex.org/W3203641435,"Tuberculosis (TB), a contagious disease mainly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M . tb ), Mycobacterium bovis ( M . bovis ), and Mycobacterium caprae ( M . caprae ), poses a major global threat to the health of humans and many species of animals. Developing an ante-mortem detection technique for different species would be of significance in improving the surveillance employing a One Health strategy. To achieve this goal, a universal indirect ELISA was established for serologically detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection for multiple live hosts by using a fusion protein of MPB70, MPB83, ESAT6, and CFP10 common in M . tb , M . bovis , and M . caprae as the coating antigen (MMEC) and HRP-labeled fusion protein A and G as a secondary antibody. After testing the known positive and negative sera, the receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to decide the cut-off values. Then, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of MMEC/AG-iELISA were determined as 100.00% (95% CI: 96.90%, 100.00%) and 100.00% (95% CI: 98.44%, 100.00%) for M . bovis infection of cattle, 100.00% (95% CI: 95.00%, 100.00%) and 100.0% (95% CI: 96.80%, 100.00%) for M . bovis infection of sheep, 90.74% (95% CI: 80.09%, 95.98%) and 98.63% (95% CI: 95.14%, 99.76%) for M . bovis infection of cervids, 100.00% (95% CI: 15.81%, 100.00%) and 98.81% (95% CI: 93.54%, 99.97%) for M . bovis infection of monkeys, 100.00% (95% CI: 86.82%, 100.00%) and 94.85% (95% CI: 91.22%, 97.03%) for M . tb infection of humans. Furthermore, this MMEC/AG-iELISA likely detects M . caprae infection in roe deer. Thus this method has a promising application in serological TB surveillance for multiple animal species thereby providing evidence for taking further action in TB control."

https://openalex.org/W3203017314,"Uncontrolled urban growth detracts from healthy urban development. Understanding urban development trends and predicting future urban spatial states is of great practical significance. In order to comprehensively analyze urbanization and its effect on vegetation cover, we extracted urban development trends from time series DMSP/OLS NTL and NDVI data from 2000 to 2015, using a linear model fitting method. Six urban development trend types were identified by clustering the linear model parameters. The identified trend types were found to accurately reflect the on-ground conditions and changes in the Jinan area. For example, a high-density, stable urban type was found in the city center while a stable dense vegetation type was found in the mountains to the south. The SLEUTH model was used for urban growth simulation under three scenarios built on the urban development analysis results. The simulation results project a gentle urban growth trend from 2015 to 2030, demonstrating the prospects for urban growth from the perspective of environmental protection and conservative urban development."
https://openalex.org/W3204448360,"Introduction There has been an increase in global health courses at medical universities in high-income countries. Their effect on students, however, is poorly understood. In 2016 an elective global surgery course was introduced for medical students at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. The course includes a theoretical module in Sweden and a two-week clinical rotation in Uganda. The present study aimed to assess the format and determine its effect on students’ knowledge of global surgery and approach towards patients of non-Swedish origin. Method A mixed-methods design was used. Semi-structured case-based interviews were conducted individually with 18 students and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Examination scores and the course evaluation were analysed with Kruskal Wallis one-way analysis of variance, Pearson’s Chi-square and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test as appropriate. Results The course was appreciated and students reported gained insights and interest in global surgery. Students’ ability to reason about global surgery issues was improved after the course. Students considered complicating aspects in the meeting with patients of non-Swedish origin. Students with abroad clinical experience felt less compelled to act on preconceptions. Discussion The global surgery course at Karolinska Institutet is appreciated and students gained valuable knowledge. The case-based interviews acted as a catalyst for reflection and showed that students felt insecure as they lacked knowledge about globally common surgical conditions and struggled with generalized preconceptions of patients of non-Swedish origin. To further support students to integrate theoretical knowledge and professional development, we suggest the introduction of problem-based learning. Conclusion The ability of the course to inspire students’ commitment to global surgery is promising as this engagement is the key to reaching the goal of equitable health globally. Offering such courses is a step towards inspiring and recruiting the future clinicians and researchers needed for expanding the field of global surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3204665768,"Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is becoming a major public health problem globally; it is clear that the burden of MetS is rapidly increasing the rates of non-communicable diseases (NCD). In Ethiopia studies done so far have shown a large disparity in magnitude of the prevalence of MetS and were mainly institution-based studies. Therefore, this study assess the prevalence of MetS among adults who are residing in Gondar city using Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) assessment tool. The findings are imperative to developing and strengthening national NCD prevention and control programs. Methods This study was conducted in Gondar city Northwest Ethiopia in 2018. It employs a community-based cross-sectional study design among 3,227 individuals 18 years of age or older. Data was collected using the WHO stepwise tool, lipid profile, blood pressure (BP), waist circumference (WC) body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose levels (FG), and anthropometric measurements. The prevalence estimation was made along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The Kappa statistic was used to analyze the statistical agreement between ATP III and IDF definitions of the MetS. Stratified analysis was also performed for description and analysis components using ATP III and IDF as an outcome. Result Of the total study participants (3227), 3059 (94.8%) were included in the final analysis and 52.5% were female. The mean (±SD) age of the study participant was 40.8 years (16.2 ±SD). The overall prevalence of MetS using ATP III was 11.2% [95%CI: 10.1, 12.3] and using IDF was 11.9% [95%CI: 10.8, 13.2]. The sex-specific proportion was high in females rather than males irrespective of the criteria. The overall level of agreement between ATP III and IDF prevalence was 91.7% and the Kappa statistics was 0.594. Older age, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, being female, born in an urban area, consumption of an alcoholic drink in the preceding 30 days, and non-fasting practice was significantly associated with MetS. Conclusion and recommendation There was a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome among females than males irrespective of metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria. This also shows good agreement between ATP III and IDF. Being female, urban birthplace, frequent alcohol consumption in the last 30 days, and non-fasting practice are factors associated with higher rates of metabolic syndrome. Hence, awareness campaigns, physical exercise, and nutrition education intervention should be undertaken to promote health behavioral practice."
https://openalex.org/W3202711653,"Background Type III interferon, or interferon lambda (IFNλ) is a crucial antiviral cytokine induced by influenza infection. While IFNλ is important for anti-viral host defense, published data demonstrate that IFNλ is pathogenic during influenza/bacterial super-infection. It is known that polymorphisms in specific IFNλ genes affect influenza responses, but the effect of IFNλ subtypes on bacterial super-infection is unknown. Methods Using an established model of influenza, Staphylococcus aureus super-infection, we studied IFNλ3 -/- and control mice to model a physiologically relevant reduction in IFNλ and to address its role in super-infection. Results Surprisingly, IFNλ3 -/- mice did not have significantly lower total IFNλ than co-housed controls, and displayed no change in viral or bacterial clearance. Importantly, both control and IFNλ3 -/- mice displayed a positive correlation between viral burden and total IFNλ in the bronchoalveolar lavage during influenza/bacterial super-infection, suggesting that higher influenza viral burden drives a similar total IFNλ response regardless of IFNλ3 gene integrity. Interestingly, total IFNλ levels positively correlated with bacterial burden, while viral burden and bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity did not. Conclusions These data suggest IFNλ2 can compensate for IFNλ3 to mount an effective antiviral and defense, revealing a functional redundancy in these highly similar IFNλ subtypes. Further, the IFNλ response to influenza, as opposed to changes in cellular inflammation or viral load, significantly correlates with susceptibility to bacterial super-infection. Moreover, the IFNλ response is regulated and involves redundant subtypes, suggesting it is of high importance to pulmonary pathogen defense."

https://openalex.org/W3202850025,"Rapid development of intelligent information equipment accelerates the expansion of mobile social network. Speed of information spreading is gradually growing, there are lots of changes in the scale and mode of information spreading. But the basic communication network is not developed and not mature, when online information platforms breakdown sometimes it happens to be when important information appears. Therefore, the research is done to solve these occasion problems, help network information platform filter hot news and discuss the reason that hot news exists longer than other news in the Internet. In this paper, a multiple information propagation model incorporating both local information environment and people's limited attention is proposed based on Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model. Two new concepts are introduced into the model: heat rate and popular rate, to measure the local information influence power and people's limited attention to information respectively, which are key factors determining node state transformation instead of fixed probability. In order to analyze the influence from limited attention, a situation is designed that several pieces of information are popular successively. The theoretical analysis shows that the early popular information gets more attention than the later popular information, and more attention makes it easier to spread. Besides, numerical simulation is conducted in both uniform network and scale-free network. The simulation results show that the early popular information is less vulnerable to the increase of information acceptance threshold and more sensitive to the decrease of information rejection threshold than the later popular information. Moreover, the model can also be used in the case of large amount of information transmission without adding too much complexity. Reasons are given in the research that the top hot news exists very much longer than the other ones, and latter news which have same influence as top news are hard to get the same focus. Meanwhile, results in the research can provide some ways for the other researches in the related fields. They also help related information platforms to filter and push news and referable strategies to maintain hot news."

https://openalex.org/W3202431758,"Background Montbretins are rare specialized metabolites found in montbretia ( Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora ) corms. Montbretin A (MbA) is of particular interest as a novel therapeutic for type-2 diabetes and obesity. There is no scalable production system for this complex acylated flavonol glycoside. MbA biosynthesis has been reconstructed in Nicotiana benthamiana using montbretia genes for the assembly of MbA from its various different building blocks. However, in addition to smaller amounts of MbA, the therapeutically inactive montbretin B (MbB) was the major product of this metabolic engineering effort. MbA and MbB differ in a single hydroxyl group of their acyl side chains, which are derived from caffeoyl-CoA and coumaroyl-CoA, respectively. Biosynthesis of both MbA and MbB also require coumaroyl-CoA for the formation of the myricetin core. Caffeoyl-CoA and coumaroyl-CoA are formed in the central phenylpropanoid pathway by acyl activating enzymes (AAEs) known as 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligases (4CLs). Here we investigated a small family of montbretia AAEs and 4CLs, and their possible contribution to montbretin biosynthesis. Results Transcriptome analysis for gene expression patterns related to montbretin biosynthesis identified eight different montbretia AAEs belonging to four different clades. Enzyme characterization identified 4CL activity for two clade IV members, Cc4CL1 and Cc4CL2, converting different hydroxycinnamic acids into the corresponding CoA thioesters. Both enzymes preferred coumaric acid over caffeic acid as a substrate in vitro . While expression of montbretia AAEs did not enhance MbA biosynthesis in N . benthamiana , we demonstrated that both Cc4CLs can be used to activate coumaric and caffeic acid towards flavanone biosynthesis in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). Conclusions Montbretia expresses two functional 4CLs, but neither of them is specific for the formation of caffeoyl-CoA. Based on differential expression analysis and phylogeny Cc4CL1 is most likely involved in MbA biosynthesis, while Cc4CL2 may contribute to lignin biosynthesis. Both Cc4CLs can be used for flavanone production to support metabolic engineering of MbA in yeast."

However, the molecular epidemiology and risk factors for S . aureus colonization among residents and staff in nursing homes (NHs) in China remain unclear. A multicenter study was conducted in three NHs in Shanghai between September 2019 and October 2019. We explored the prevalence, molecular epidemiology, and risk factors for S . aureus colonization. All S . aureus isolates were characterized based on antimicrobial resistance, virulence genes, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcus protein A ( spa ) typing, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC mec ) typing. NH records were examined for potential risk factors for S . aureus colonization. S . aureus and methicillin-resistant S . aureus (MRSA) isolates were detected in 109 (100 residents and 9 staff, 19.8%, 109/551) and 28 (24 residents and 4 staff, 5.1%, 28/551) subjects among 496 residents and 55 staff screened, respectively. Compared to methicillin-susceptible S . aureus isolates, all 30 MRSA isolates had higher resistance rates to most antibiotics except minocycline, rifampicin, linezolid, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. Sequence type (ST) 1 (21.3%) was the most common sequence type, and t127 (20.5%) was the most common spa type among 122 S . aureus isolates. SCC mec type I (70%) was the dominant clone among all MRSA isolates. CC1 (26/122, 21.3%) was the predominant complex clone (CC), followed by CC398 (25/122, 20.5%), CC5 (20/122, 16.4%) and CC188 (18/122, 14.8%). Female sex (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.04–2.79; P = 0.036) and invasive devices (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.26–3.81; P = 0.006) were independently associated with S . aureus colonization."
https://openalex.org/W2534055076,"Recent restoration efforts for the native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida , are commonly motivated by potential return of oyster-associated ecosystem services, including increased water filtration. The potential impact of such restoration on another species of ecological concern, eelgrass, Zostera marina , is unclear, but has been hypothesized to be positive if oyster filter feeding increases light penetration to eelgrass. For two years after construction of an oyster restoration project, we assessed the response of adjacent eelgrass (impact) compared to control and reference eelgrass beds by monitoring changes in light intensity, eelgrass shoot density, biomass, leaf morphometrics, and epiphyte load. We observed lower light intensity consistently over time, including prior to restoration, near the constructed oyster bed relative to the control and one of the reference locations. We also observed minor variations between control and impact eelgrass morphology and density. However, the changes observed were not outside the range of natural variation expected in this system, based upon comparisons to reference eelgrass beds, nor were they detrimental. This limited impact to eelgrass may be due in part to the incorporation of a buffer distance between the restored oyster bed and the existing eelgrass bed, which may have dampened both positive and negative impacts. These findings provide evidence that Olympia oyster restoration and eelgrass conservation goals can be compatible and occur simultaneously."
