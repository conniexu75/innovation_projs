https://openalex.org/W2108724455,"Lentiviral delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (lenti-GDNF) was tested for its trophic effects upon degenerating nigrostriatal neurons in nonhuman primate models of Parkinson's disease (PD). We injected lenti-GDNF into the striatum and substantia nigra of nonlesioned aged rhesus monkeys or young adult rhesus monkeys treated 1 week prior with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Extensive GDNF expression with anterograde and retrograde transport was seen in all animals. In aged monkeys, lenti-GDNF augmented dopaminergic function. In MPTP-treated monkeys, lenti-GDNF reversed functional deficits and completely prevented nigrostriatal degeneration. Additionally, lenti-GDNF injections to intact rhesus monkeys revealed long-term gene expression (8 months). In MPTP-treated monkeys, lenti-GDNF treatment reversed motor deficits in a hand-reach task. These data indicate that GDNF delivery using a lentiviral vector system can prevent nigrostriatal degeneration and induce regeneration in primate models of PD and might be a viable therapeutic strategy for PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2108183232,"Microwave spectroscopy experiments have been performed on two quantum levels of a macroscopic superconducting loop with three Josephson junctions. Level repulsion of the ground state and first excited state is found where two classical persistent-current states with opposite polarity are degenerate, indicating symmetric and antisymmetric quantum superpositions of macroscopic states. The two classical states have persistent currents of 0.5 microampere and correspond to the center-of-mass motion of millions of Cooper pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2051320963,"Osteoprotegerin-ligand (OPGL) is a key osteoclast differentiation/activation factor essential for bone remodeling. We report that mice lacking OPGL or its receptor RANK fail to form lobulo-alveolar mammary structures during pregnancy, resulting in death of newborns. Transplantation and OPGL-rescue experiments in opgl-/- and rank-/- pregnant females showed that OPGL acts directly on RANK-expressing mammary epithelial cells. The effects of OPGL are autonomous to epithelial cells. The mammary gland defect in female opgl-/- mice is characterized by enhanced apoptosis and failures in proliferation and PKB activation in lobulo-alveolar buds that can be reversed by recombinant OPGL treatment. These data provide a novel paradigm in mammary gland development and an evolutionary rationale for hormonal regulation and gender bias of osteoporosis in females."
https://openalex.org/W2037257739,"In animal cells, duplication of centrosomes and DNA is coordinated. Since CDK2/cyclin E triggers initiation of both events, activation of CDK2/cyclin E is thought to link these two events. We identified nucleophosmin (NPM/B23) as a substrate of CDK2/cyclin E in centrosome duplication. NPM/B23 associates specifically with unduplicated centrosomes, and NPM/B23 dissociates from centrosomes by CDK2/cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation. An anti-NPM/B23 antibody, which blocks this phosphorylation, suppresses the initiation of centrosome duplication in vivo. Moreover, expression of a nonphosphorylatable mutant NPM/ B23 in cells effectively blocks centrosome duplication. Thus, NPM/B23 is a target of CDK2/cyclin E in the initiation of centrosome duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2095393268,"The protein N-WASP [a homolog to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)] regulates actin polymerization by stimulating the actin-nucleating activity of the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex. N-WASP is tightly regulated by multiple signals: Only costimulation by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) yields potent polymerization. We found that regulation requires N-WASP's constitutively active output domain (VCA) and two regulatory domains: a Cdc42-binding domain and a previously undescribed PIP(2)-binding domain. In the absence of stimuli, the regulatory modules together hold the VCA-Arp2/3 complex in an inactive ""closed"" conformation. In this state, both the Cdc42- and PIP2-binding sites are masked. Binding of either input destabilizes the closed state and enhances binding of the other input. This cooperative activation mechanism shows how combinations of simple binding domains can be used to integrate and amplify coincident signals."
https://openalex.org/W2021768020,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) activate gene transcription by binding to specific enhancer elements and recruiting coactivators of the p160 family to promoters of target genes. The p160 coactivators in turn enhance transcription by recruiting secondary coactivators, including histone acetyltransferases such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), as well as the recently identified protein methyltransferase, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). In the current study, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), another arginine-specific protein methyltransferase that shares a region of high homology with CARM1, was also found to act as a coactivator for NRs. PRMT1, like CARM1, bound to the C-terminal AD2 activation domain of p160 coactivators and thereby enhanced the activity of NRs in transient transfection assays. The shape of the graphs of reporter gene activity versus the amounts of CARM1 or PRMT1 expression vector indicated a cooperative relationship between coactivator concentration and activity. Moreover, CARM1 and PRMT1 acted in a synergistic manner to enhance reporter gene activation by both hormone-dependent and orphan NRs. The synergy was most evident at low levels of transfected NR expression vectors, where activation of reporter genes was almost completely dependent on the presence of NR and all three exogenously supplied coactivators, i.e. GRIP1, CARM1, and PRMT1. In contrast, with the higher levels of NR expression vectors typically used in transient transfection assays, NR activity was much less dependent on the combination of coactivators, suggesting that target gene activation occurs by different mechanisms at high versus low cellular concentrations of NR. Because multiple coactivators are presumably required to mediate transcriptional activation of native genes in vivo, the low-NR conditions may provide a more physiologically relevant assay for coactivator function.

NRs contain a highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) in the central region of the polypeptide chain that binds specific enhancer elements in the promoters of target genes. Activation of transcription is directed by two transcriptional activation domains: AF-1, located in the N-terminal end, and AF-2, located within the C-terminal hormone-binding domain (7Kumar V.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation involves two general mechanisms. Alteration of the chromatin structure around the promoter by ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and histone modification facilitates the recruitment of the RNA polymerase II transcription preinitiation complex (11Gregory P.D. Horz W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 13Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The NRs also make direct or indirect physical contact with components of the transcription preinitiation complex (14Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 8288-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Activation is accomplished with the help of complexes of coactivator proteins that bind to the activation domains of the NRs (13Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

A growing list of potential coactivators has been defined primarily by virtue of their ability to enhance the function of NRs in transient transfection experiments (13Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 16Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Among the most well characterized of NR coactivators are a family of three related 160-kDa proteins called the p160 coactivators (SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF2, and pCIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB1/TRAM1). The p160 coactivators contain a cluster of three conserved NR box motifs (L XXLL, where L is leucine and X is any amino acid), located approximately in the middle of the ∼1400-amino acid polypeptide chain. The NR boxes bind to NR AF-2 regions by fitting into a conserved hydrophobic cleft on the surface of essentially all NRs that act as transcriptional activators (20Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L.

In addition, the C terminus of the p160 coactivators binds to the AF-1 regions of some but not all NRs (23Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Edwards D.P.

After binding to the activated NR through at least one of these two NR interaction domains, the p160 coactivators propagate the activating signal through at least two activation domains, AD1 and AD2, which act by recruiting a number of secondary coactivator proteins. AD1, located near amino acid 1000, binds p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), two related proteins that bind to and serve as coactivators for a large number of DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins, including NRs (26Chen H.

Mullen T.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). CBP and p300 can acetylate histones and have been associated with chromatin remodeling (29Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In addition, their ability to acetylate nonhistone proteins (30Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) suggest that they contribute to transcriptional activation through multiple molecular mechanisms. For example, CBP and p300 associate with p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), another coactivator with protein acetyltransferase activity (26Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). They also interact with components of the basal transcription machinery and thus may help to recruit the transcription preinitiation complex to the promoter (32Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33Yao T.-P. Ku G. Zhou N. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that AD2, located at the C terminus of p160 proteins, can also transmit the activating signal received from NRs (25Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.-M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The action of AD2 is independent of AD1 and requires neither CBP nor p300. We also identified a novel protein, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), which binds to AD2 and acts as a secondary coactivator for NRs, i.e. its effect on NR function is totally dependent upon the presence of a primary coactivator in the form of a p160 coactivator (34Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). By amino acid sequence homology, CARM1 belongs to a family of previously identified arginine-specific protein methyltransferases, which includes the mammalian proteins, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), PRMT2, and PRMT3, and the yeast protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (RMT1) (34Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). PRMT1 and CARM1 are very different in size, but they share a high degree of sequence homology in the central region, which contains the arginine-specific protein methyltransferase activity (34Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The coactivator function of CARM1 and the homology between CARM1 and PRMT1 led us to test whether PRMT1, like CARM1, can bind to p160 coactivators and function as a coactivator for NRs. We also investigated the functional relationship between PRMT1 and p160 coactivators and the possibility of synergistic enhancement of NR function by p160 coactivators, CARM1, and PRMT1. Proteins with N-terminal hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope tags were expressed in transient mammalian cell transfections and in vitro from pSG5.HA, which has SV40 and T7 promoters (34Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The following proteins were expressed from previously described pSG5.HA derivatives: GRIP1ΔAD1 (full-length GRIP1 with amino acids 1057–1109 deleted) (25Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.-M. Irvine R.A. Webb P.

Vector pSG5.HA-GRIP1Δ ΔAD1/ΔAD2 was constructed using the Promega Gene Editor kit to delete codons 1057–1109 from pSG5.HA-GRIP1Δ ΔAD2, which encodes GRIP1-(5–1121). A polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragment encoding full-length PRMT1 was cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pSG5.HA. The same EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding PRMT1 was cloned into vector pM (CLONTECH) for expression of Gal4DBD-PRMT1 and into pVP16 (CLONTECH) for expression of VP16-PRMT1. Vectors encoding Gal4DBD-GRIP1-(5–1462) (full-length) and Gal4DBD-CARM1 were constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment encoding GRIP1 and an EcoRI-BglII fragment encoding CARM1 into the EcoRI and EcoRI-BamHI sites, respectively, of pM.

GST fusion proteins were isolated from Escherichia coli BL21 (CARM1) or DH5α (other proteins) after induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside for 5 h. Bacterial cells were harvested, resuspended in NETN buffer (100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, and containing 0.5% detergent, either Nonidet P-40 or IGEPAL CA-630). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and GST fusion proteins were isolated by incubation of the supernatant overnight at 4 °C with rotation with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) once with NETN and then twice with NETN containing 0.01% detergent. Proteins to be tested for interaction with GST fusion proteins on the beads were synthesized by transcription and translation in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT-T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The binding assay was conducted by incubating beads containing 1–2 μg of GST or GST fusion protein with slow rotation for 60 min at 4 °C with 10 μl of the in vitrosynthesis reaction in a 100-μl total volume of NETN containing 0.01% detergent. Beads were washed four times by centrifugation with NETN containing 0.01% detergent. GST fusion protein and interacting35S-labeled protein were eluted from beads with Laemmli sample buffer (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. CV-1 cells (45Gluzman Y.

A Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was used as the internal control to monitor for transfection efficiency, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed in the cell lysates as described previously (46Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data shown are the means and standard deviations of results from three transfected cultures. When hormone was required, transfected cells were grown in medium containing charcoal-treated serum (Gemini BioProducts) and 20 nmconcentration of the appropriate hormone for each NR: estradiol for ER, triiodothyronine for TR, or dihydrotestosterone for AR. Because CARM1 binds specifically to the C-terminal region of p160 coactivator GRIP1 (34Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), we tested for a similar binding activity of the homologous protein, PRMT1. When a GST-PRMT1 fusion protein was affixed to glutathione-agarose beads, it specifically bound all three members of the p160 coactivator family (GRIP1, SRC-1a, and ACTR), which were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the p160 coactivators did not bind the control protein, GST. In similar GST pull-down assays, PRMT1 specifically bound the C-terminal AD2 region of GRIP1 (amino acids 1121–1462) (Fig. 2 B), which was previously shown to bind CARM1 (34Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Also, like CARM1, PRMT1 failed to bind an N-terminal fragment of GRIP1 (amino acids 5–765) containing the NR box motifs or a central fragment (amino acids 730–1121) containing NR box III and AD1 (Fig. 2 B). The N-terminal and central fragments thus served as negative controls. GST pull-down assays also revealed specific protein-protein interaction of GST-PRMT1 with three different NRs, i.e. ERα, TRβ1, and AR (Fig. 2 C). The binding was observed in the presence or absence of a 20 nm concentration of the appropriate hormone for each NR. CARM1 was previously shown to function as a secondary coactivator for NRs in transient transfection assays,i.e. it enhanced NR function through its association with the C-terminal AD2 region of p160 coactivators (34Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Because PRMT1 shares extensive sequence homology with CARM1 and can bind to the AD2 region of p160 coactivators and to NRs as well, we tested PRMT1 for coactivator function with ER, TR, and AR. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with an NR expression vector, a corresponding luciferase reporter gene (driven by a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter containing the natural hormone response elements for AR or engineered enhancer elements for ER or TR), and expression vectors for various coactivators. Transfected cells were grown with the appropriate hormone for the NR used, and luciferase activity was determined from the transfected cell extracts. In the presence of a hormone-activated NR and GRIP1, PRMT1 enhanced reporter gene activity (Fig.3). For example, transient expression of AR caused hormone-dependent reporter gene activity (Fig.3 C, histograms 1 and 2), and GRIP1 enhanced that activity 10-fold (histogram 3). Cotransfection of PRMT1 plasmid DNA caused a further 3-fold enhancement (histogram 4). Similar results were seen with ERα and TRβ1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Because PRMT1 bound directly to NRs as well as to p160 coactivators, we tested whether PRMT1 was able to serve as a direct or primary coactivator for NRs,i.e. without exogenously expressed p160 coactivators. In the absence of exogenous GRIP1, the activity observed with hormone-activated NR (Fig. 3, A–C, histogram 2) was enhanced only slightly or not at all by the addition of PRMT1 (histogram 5). In the presence of GRIP1, the enhancement of NR function by PRMT1 was also dependent upon the presence of hormone (compare histograms 6 and 8), indicating that PRMT1 was acting as a coactivator for NRs rather than an independent transcriptional activator. The fact that the activity of PRMT1 depended on the presence of a p160 coactivator indicated that PRMT1, like CARM1, was acting as a secondary coactivator. When fixed amounts of reporter gene, NR vector, and p160 vector were cotransfected with varying amounts of PRMT1 or CARM1 expression vector, both CARM1 and PRMT1 enhanced reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4, A–C, graphs a and b) and had approximately equivalent coactivator effects on NR function. The range of CARM1 and PRMT1 vectors tested produced upward curving graphs, i.e. the slopes of the dose-response curves increased along with the amounts of CARM1 and PRMT1 vector used, suggesting a cooperative relationship between coactivator concentration and activity. When the reporter gene activity was replotted on a logarithmic scale, the data fit straight lines, consistent with a cooperative dose-response curve (Fig. 4 E shows data for AR replotted from Fig. 4 C). Similar coactivator effects of PRMT1 were also observed when other members of the p160 coactivator family, SRC-1a or ACTR, were substituted for GRIP1 (Fig.5, graphs a–c).Figure 5Synergistic activity of PRMT1 and CARM1 in the presence of various p160 coactivators. CV-1 cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of MMTV-LUC, 0.1 μg of pSVAR0, 0.25 μg of expression vector for the indicated p160 coactivator, varied amounts of pSG5.HA-PRMT1, and (for graphs d and e) 0.5 μg of pSG5.HA-CARM1. Data shown are from a single experiment representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because both PRMT1 and CARM1 acted as secondary coactivators for NRs, we tested for additive or synergistic coactivator effects on NR function when both proteins were expressed together with a p160 coactivator in the transient transfection assays. In the presence of the reporter gene, NR, hormone, and GRIP1, varying doses of PRMT1 plasmid DNA were cotransfected with a fixed amount of CARM1 plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and vice versa (Fig. 4, graphs c and d). The effects of combining CARM1 and PRMT1 were synergistic. For example, in transfections with AR, adding 0.5 μg of CARM1 DNA and 0.5 μg of PRMT1 DNA together (Fig. 4 D, histogram 5) caused a synergistic enhancement of activity when compared with the sum of their separate effects at the same doses (histograms 3 and 4). In other words, compared with the activity observed with NR plus GRIP1 and no methyltransferase expression vectors (histogram 2), the increase in activity achieved by the simultaneous addition of CARM1 and PRMT1 (histogram 5 minus histogram 2) was considerably greater than the sum of the enhancements caused by adding CARM1 and PRMT1 in separate assays (histogram 3 minus histogram 2 plus histogram 4 minus histogram 2). Similar synergistic effects were observed for PRMT1 and CARM1 when ERα or TRβ1 was used instead of AR (Fig. 4, A and B, graphs c and d), or when SRC-1a or ACTR was used instead of GRIP1 as the p160 coactivator for AR (Fig. 5,graphs d and e). The synergistic effects of CARM1 and PRMT1 were dependent upon the presence of p160 coactivator and hormone (Fig. 3, compare histograms 7 and 8 with 6). Thus, an activated NR and a p160 coactivator were both required before CARM1 and PRMT1 could enhance reporter gene activity. The coactivator effects of CARM1 and PRMT1, expressed separately or together, were examined at different levels of AR by varying the amount of transfected AR expression vector and fixing the amounts of all coactivator expression vectors (Fig. 6). At lower levels of AR expression vector (0.1 and 0.3 μg), the addition of either CARM1 or PRMT1 without the other (graphs c and d) produced a relatively small enhancement over the activity observed with AR plus GRIP1 (graph b); however, CARM1 and PRMT1 added together (graph e) had a strong synergistic coactivator effect. In contrast, at higher levels of AR expression vector (0.6 and 1.0 μg), CARM1 or PRMT1 each enhanced reporter gene activity (graphs c and d) above the level observed with AR plus GRIP1 (graph b), but adding CARM1 and PRMT1 together produced no further increase (graph e). Because the degree of synergy increased at the low"

Iron homeostasis is typically regulated by cytoplasmic iron binding proteins, but here we describe a signal transduction system (PmrA/PmrB) that responds to extracytoplasmic ferric iron. Iron promoted transcription of PmrA-activated genes and resistance to the antibiotic polymyxin in Salmonella. The PmrB protein bound iron via its periplasmic domain which harbors two copies of the sequence ExxE, a motif present in the Saccharomyces FTR1 iron transporter and in mammalian ferritin light chain. A pmrA mutant was hypersensitive to killing by iron but displayed wild-type resistance to a variety of oxidants, suggesting PmrA/PmrB controls a novel pathway mediating the avoidance of iron toxicity."

In addition to regulating the expression of proximal Ras pathway components, Wg and Dpp coordinate the direct effects of three signal-activated (dTCF, Mad, and Pointed-functioning in the Wg, Dpp, and Ras/MAPK pathways, respectively) and two tissue-restricted (Twist and Tinman) transcription factors on a progenitor identity gene enhancer.

We analyzed the effects of PPARα activation on expression of the brown fat-specific uncoupling protein-1 (ucp-1) gene. Activators of PPARα increased UCP-1 mRNA levels severalfold both in primary brown adipocytes and in brown fat in vivo. Transient transfection assays indicated that the (−4551)UCP1-CAT construct, containing the 5′-regulatory region of the rat ucp-1 gene, was activated by PPARα co-transfection in a dose-dependent manner and this activation was potentiated by Wy 14,643 and retinoid X receptor α. The coactivators CBP and PPARγ-coactivator-1 (PGC-1), which is highly expressed in brown fat, also enhanced the PPARα-dependent regulation of the ucp-1 gene. Deletion and point-mutation mapping analysis indicated that the PPARα-responsive element was located in the upstream enhancer region of the ucp-1 gene. This −2485/−2458 element bound PPARα and PPARγ from brown fat nuclei. Moreover, this element behaved as a promiscuous responsive site to either PPARα or PPARγ activation, and we propose that it mediates ucp-1 gene up-regulation associated with adipogenic differentiation (via PPARγ) or in coordination with gene expression for the fatty acid oxidation machinery required for active thermogenesis (via PPARα).

In addition to ligand selectivity, PPAR subtypes have been involved in different biological functions. PPARα is mostly expressed in tissues with high rates of fatty acid oxidation and peroxisomal metabolism, such as brown fat, liver, or heart (1Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar, 11Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Recent studies of PPARα-null mice have confirmed that PPARα is necessary in vivo for hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone body synthesis during starvation (12Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). PPARδ, which is ubiquitously expressed, seems to be involved in basic lipid metabolism (11Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). High expression of PPARγ is mainly restricted to white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissue (13Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). Hence, in contrast to the role of PPARα in cellular lipid catabolism, PPARγ regulates adipogenesis (i.e. lipid deposition) (13Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar).BAT is a major site for nonshivering thermogenesis in mammals. Its thermogenic capacity relies on the presence of an inner mitochondrial protein uniquely expressed in brown adipocytes, the uncoupling protein (UCP) (15Nicholls D.G. Cunningham S.A. Rial E. Trayhurn P. Nicholls D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Edward Arnold Publishers, London1986: 52-85Google Scholar), now referred to as UCP-1 since the discovery of the more widely expressed UCP-2 and UCP-3 (for review, see Ref. 16Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Brown fat thermogenesis is mainly controlled by norepinephrine released from sympathetic terminals innervating the tissue, although nuclear receptor-mediated pathways have also been described. Thus, activation of PPARγ promotes HIB-1B brown adipocyte differentiation (17Tai T.A.C. Jennermann C. Brown K.K. Oliver B.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Wilkison W.O. Brown H.R. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A.

MacGinnitie M.A. Kovacs L.G. Graves R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3410-3419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that retinoic acid is a powerful inducer of ucp-1 gene transcription, acting through retinoic acid receptors and RXRs (19Alvarez R. de Andrés J. Yubero P. Viñas O.

The 5′-flanking region of the rat ucp-1 gene contains the proximal regulatory promoter, including C/EBP-regulated sites (21Yubero P. Manchado C. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Mampel T. Viñas O. Iglesias R.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A site responsive to PPARγ activators has also been located in the upstream enhancer of the murine ucp-1 gene (18Sears I.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Kovacs L.G. Graves R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3410-3419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).BAT highly coexpresses not only PPARγ and PPARδ subtypes but also PPARα (24Valmaseda A. Carmona M.C. Barberá M.J. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). BAT stores triglycerides but, in contrast to WAT, it uses lipids as oxidative substrates to generate heat. Since PPARα induces the expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes in tissues other than BAT (6Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar), it may do so in BAT in association with thermogenic requirements. Here we report that PPARα activators induce ucp-1 gene expression in brown adipocytes and in BAT in vivo, acting through a PPRE located in the upstream enhancer of the ucp-1 gene that is also responsible for PPARγ-dependent regulation. PPARα is proposed to coordinate the activation of lipid oxidation and thermogenic activity in brown fat.DISCUSSIONHere we have established that PPARα activators regulate the expression of the ucp-1 gene both in primary brown adipocytes and in BAT in vivo. Brown adipocytes differentiated in primary culture were used since they highly coexpress all PPAR subtypes, equally to BAT (24Valmaseda A. Carmona M.C. Barberá M.J. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the HIB-1B brown adipocyte cell line lacks PPARα expression (24Valmaseda A. Carmona M.C. Barberá M.J. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and therefore, the results of previous studies using HIB-1B cells to determine the effects of PPAR activators on the expression of the ucp-1 gene must be viewed with caution. Present results also demonstrate that PPARα induces the rat ucp-1 gene promoter activity upon treatment with its specific ligand Wy 14,643, but it can also activate transcription in the absence of exogenously added ligand. This has been widely described for other PPARα-responsive gene promoters (32Rodrı́guez J.C. Gil-Gómez G. Hegardt F.G. Haro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18767-18772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and could be explained by either the presence of endogenous activators, such as fatty acids or their metabolites, or by ligand-independent activity of these nuclear receptors (40Werman A.

The responsiveness of the ucp-1 gene promoter to PPARα-ligand is increased by co-transfection with expression vectors for either coactivator CBP or PGC-1. Furthermore, the synergistic effect observed when adding both coactivators points to the involvement at the same time of CBP and PGC-1 in coactivating PPARα. In this way, PPARα can interact directly with CBP (41Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and also with PGC-1 (42Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), thus providing multiple contact points to stabilize the complex assembly. Furthermore, CBP can also interact with other transcription factors, such as CREB and C/EBP, known to regulate transcription of the rat ucp-1 gene through its proximal regulatory region (22Yubero P.

This −2485/−2458 region contains a potential PPRE consensus formed by two direct repeats separated by one nucleotide (DR-1). Highly comparable elements are also found in the human and mouse ucp-1 genes (see Fig. 8 A), indicating that these sequences may have an important regulatory role in response to PPARα. In fact, the murine element has been described to mediate PPARγ responsiveness (18Sears I.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Kovacs L.G. Graves R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3410-3419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present results further demonstrate that the −2485/−2458 element in the rat ucp-1 gene behaves as a promiscuous responsive site to either PPARα and PPARγ activation, but not PPARδ. From the analysis of various natural PPREs, it has been reported that the binding strength and functional transactivation for each PPAR subtype on the same PPRE was similar (33Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Only some significant PPARγ specificity was described, and it was related to the 5′-flanking sequence with respect to the DR-1 element, which is essential for PPARα binding (33Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A.

However, present results indicate a similar capacity of PPARα and PPARγ to bind and activate ucp-1 transcription through the UCP1-PPRE. The predominant role of any subtype at any one time may thus depend on: 1) the relative amount of each subtype. For instance, PPARα and PPARγ gene expression in brown adipocytes are under opposite regulation by their ligands and retinoic acid: up-regulation of PPARα but down-regulation of PPARγ (24Valmaseda A. Carmona M.C. Barberá M.J. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 2) Cross-talk with other signaling pathways, like regulation of PPAR transcriptional activity by MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation, which enhances PPARα (44Juge-Aubry C. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) but decreases PPARγ activity (45Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). 3) Ligand availability. Several PPAR ligands have been described to be highly subtype-specific (6Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar), although identification of endogenous ligands and how their synthesis is regulated, is far from being established. 4) Interaction with coregulators. The interaction of PGC-1 with PPARα is ligand-dependent whereas that with PPARγ is not (42Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 30Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). These and other possible events may determine which PPAR subtype activates transcription of ucp-1 in response to brown adipocyte physiological condition, mainly PPARγ in association with differentiation-dependent events or PPARα in coordination with increased lipid catabolism in active BAT.Other PPAR target genes have been described to be induced by both PPARα and γ activators through the same PPRE (39Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 46Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefevre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). However, since they have been studied in tissues such as liver, which highly expresses PPARα but not PPARγ, or WAT, which predominantly expresses PPARγ, tissue-specific regulation has been suggested. In contrast, BAT provides a model to study whether PPAR subtypes specifically regulate a PPRE in a target gene or whether a unique element behaves as a common site, as shown by our present findings in the ucp-1 gene promoter. For instance, the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene is up-regulated by PPARα (in liver) and PPARγ (in WAT) through the same PPRE (46Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefevre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). During BAT differentiation, induction of LPL allows for increased fatty acids delivery to brown adipocytes, which results in triglyceride accumulation, thus promoting the adipocyte phenotype. However, thermogenic stimulus also up-regulates LPL to increase fatty acids uptake, which increases the supply of substrate for oxidation. Expression of LPL mRNA is increased by PPARα and γ activators in differentiated brown adipocytes, 2A. Schlüter, M. Giralt, and F. Villarroya, unpublished observations. suggesting that LPL gene transcription in BAT could be activated by both PPARα and -γ. Other genes, such as the fatty acid transport protein and the acyl-CoA synthetase genes, which also regulate cell uptake of fatty acids, might be similarly regulated in BAT since they are induced by PPARα and -γ activators (39Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 47Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefevre A.M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar).Here we also demonstrate that in vivo activation of PPARα by Wy 14,643 up-regulates UCP-1 mRNA expression in BAT. The effects of the acute administration of this synthetic ligand are higher in those physiological situations (lactating dams and newborn pups at thermoneutrality) in which endogenous PPARα-ligands are expected to be low, in agreement with previous findings that PPARα sensitivity in vivo depends on the status of lipid metabolism (36Pedraza N. Solanes G. Carmona M.C. Iglesias R. Viñas O. Mampel T. Vazquez M. Giralt M. Villarroya F. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1224-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the higher ucp-1 gene responsiveness to acute treatments with PPARα than PPARγ agonists underlines the in vivo significance of PPARα-dependent regulation of ucp-1 gene expression. In contrast, it has been reported that chronic exposure to PPARα or PPARγ activators led to opposite results: long-term oral treatment of rats with Wy 14,643 did not change UCP-1 mRNA levels and thiazolidinedione administration resulted in a slight up-regulation of UCP-1 mRNA (48Kelly L.J. Vicario P.P. Thompson G.M. Candelore M.R. Doebber T.W. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Meurer R. Forrest M.J. Conner M.W. Cascieri M.A. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4920-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This behavior of ucp-1 is similar to other bona fide PPAR-target genes in BAT, which remain unchanged by chronic exposure to PPARα agonists (49Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Positive effects of long-term treatment with thiazolidinediones on ucp-1 gene expression may be a consequence of their reported action promoting overall BAT differentiation (17Tai T.A.C. Jennermann C. Brown K.K. Oliver B.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Wilkison W.O. Brown H.R. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Morris D.C. Graves R.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52 (70): 693Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Activation of BAT thermogenesis has been classically recognized to be mediated by norepinephrine. Among other regulatory effects, there is a cAMP-dependent activation of hormone sensitive-lipase, which rapidly hydrolyzes the stored triglycerides and releases high concentrations of fatty acids. These fatty acids, in addition to be the major substrate for thermogenesis and the inducers of UCP-1 uncoupling activity, may also act as PPAR activators. Accordingly, cold exposure and β-adrenergic stimulation of BAT result in activation of the PPAR pathway (51Guardiola-Diaz H.M. Rehnmark S. Usuda N. Albrektsen T. Feltkamp D. Gustafsson J.A. Alexson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23368-23377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that norepinephrine directly up-regulates transcription of the ucp-1 gene promoter, mainly through a cAMP responsive region in the proximal promoter region (22Yubero P. Barberá M.J. Alvarez R. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the upstream enhancer region of the rat ucp-1gene is also responsive to norepinephrine, although it lacks a defined cAMP responsive region. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for PPARα in mediating this regulation, although the involvement of PPARγ cannot be ruled out. Mutation of the UCP1-PPRE affects the response of the ucp-1 gene promoter to norepinephrine (17Tai T.A.C. Jennermann C. Brown K.K. Oliver B.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Wilkison W.O. Brown H.R. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Morris D.C. Graves R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29909-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 3M. J. Barberà, F. Villarroya, and M. Giralt, unpublished observations. Furthermore, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated in BAT by adrenergic stimulation (52Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This may result in activation of PPARα but inactivation of PPARγ, as discussed above. The coactivator PGC-1 is rapidly induced by cold-exposure through β-adrenergic pathways in BAT (30Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). Present data demonstrate that PGC-1 coactivates PPARα and further increases ucp-1 gene responsiveness to PPARα-ligand dependent activation. Likewise, PGC-1 cooperates with PPARα in the transcriptional control of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes (42Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), and it also induces mitochondrial gene expression by regulating the nuclear respiratory factor system (53Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point to PGC-1/PPARα interaction as playing an important role in mediating changes in gene expression in response to BAT thermogenic requirements. Although basal expression of UCP-1 mRNA in PPARα-null mice has been reported to be unaltered (12Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), as also reported for other bona fidePPAR-target genes in liver (6Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar), further studies are in course to determine whether ucp-1 gene expression is altered in these mice in response to thermogenic stimulus.In conclusion, PPARα directly regulates ucp-1 gene transcription and we propose that this transcriptional regulatory mechanism is a component of the coordinate control of thermogenic and lipid oxidation pathways in active BAT. Recently, PPARα has been implicated in obesity (54Costet P. Legendre C. More J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29577-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and selective PPARα activators have been described to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce WAT mass (55Guerre-Millo M. Gervois P. Raspé E. Madsen L. Poulain P. Derudas B. Herbert J.M. Winegar D.A. Wilson T.M. Fruchart J.C. Berge R.K. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Part of these effects could be due to an increase in energy expenditure in BAT, and the positive action of PPARα on ucp-1 gene expression opens new perspectives on the molecular targets of PPARα involved in mediating these effects. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)1 is a fatty acid-activated transcription factor that plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism (1Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar). PPARα together with PPARγ and PPARδ/β belong to a subgroup of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that heterodimerizes with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors (RXRs) (2Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H.

The PPAR-RXR heterodimer binds to specific response elements (PPREs), which consist of a direct repeat of the consensus half-site motif spaced by one nucleotide (DR-1) (6Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Fatty acids, peroxisome proliferators, and fibrate hypolipidemic drugs can activate PPARα (1Issemann I. Green S.

Phosphorylation by protein kinase A in the presence of ATP activates the CFTR-mediated chloride conductance of the apical membranes. We have identified a novel hydrophilic CFTR binding protein, CAP70, which is also concentrated on the apical surfaces. CAP70 consists of four PDZ domains, three of which are capable of binding to the CFTR C terminus. Linking at least two CFTR molecules via cytoplasmic C-terminal binding by either multivalent CAP70 or a bivalent monoclonal antibody potentiates the CFTR chloride channel activity. Thus, the CFTR channel can be switched to a more active conducting state via a modification of intermolecular CFTR-CFTR contact that is enhanced by an accessory protein."

Locating donor and acceptor molecules at well-defined positions allows the transfer rate to be determined as a function of both mutual separation and cavity length. The results show that the Förster transfer rate depends linearly on the donor emission rate and hence photonic mode density, providing the potential to control energy transfer by modification of the optical environment."

Lipid synthesis is not only essential to cell viability but specificity for bacteria and other infectious organisms can be achieved by taking advantage of the organizational and structural differences that exist in the fatty acid synthetic systems of different organisms.

The dissociated, or type II, fatty-acid synthases exist in bacteria and plants and are composed of a collection of discrete enzymes that each carry out an individual step in the cycles of chain elongation (2Rock C.O.

The type II system has been most extensively studied inEscherichia coli where the three β-ketoacyl-ACP1 synthases have emerged as important regulators of the initiation and elongation steps in the pathway. These enzymes catalyze the Claisen condensation reaction, transferring an acyl primer to malonyl-ACP and thereby creating a β-ketoacyl-ACP that has been lengthened by two carbon units. Two of these synthases are elongation condensing enzymes. Synthase I (FabB) is required for a critical step in the elongation of unsaturated fatty acids. Mutants (fabB) lacking synthase I activity require supplementation with exogenous unsaturated fatty acids to support growth (7Rosenfeld I.S. D'Agnolo G. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol.

Their primary structures are clearly related, and these translate into similar dimeric structures and active site architectures. The structures of the monomers compose an internally duplicated helix-sheet-helix motif, and the active site is located at the convergence of the pseudo dyad-related α-helices at the center of the molecule. The buried active site is accessed by a tunnel that accommodates the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of ACP (and also CoA in the case of FabH). The active site is functionally and architecturally divided into halves, and each half is associated with one of the duplicated motifs (20Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The initial transacylation half-reaction, which attaches the acyl primer to the active site cysteine, is facilitated by an α-helix dipole and an oxyanion hole. The decarboxylation half-reaction, which transfers the acyl primer to malonyl-ACP, is accelerated by the formation of two adjacent hydrogen bonds to the thioester carbonyl of the incoming malonyl-ACP. The hydrogen bond donors are two histidines in the FabB/FabF class and a histidine and an asparagine in the FabH class. Also, the side chain of a conserved phenylalanine promotes the decarboxylation step in both types of enzymes. This scheme is supported by mutagenesis studies of FabH (20Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and differs somewhat from the mechanisms proposed by others (19Qiu X. Janson C.A.

Two natural products inhibit type II fatty acid synthesis by blocking the activity of one or more of the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases. Cerulenin is an irreversible inhibitor of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II (23Vance D.E. Goldberg I. Mitsuhashi O. Bloch K. Omura S. Nomura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Res. Commun. 1988; 53: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cerulenin is not a selective antibacterial because it is also a potent inhibitor of the condensation reaction catalyzed by the mammalian multifunctional (type I) fatty-acid synthase (27Omura S.

However, cerulenin and related compounds have antineoplastic activity (29Kuhajda F.P. Pizer E.S. Li J.N. Mani N.S. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TLM is a unique thiolactone molecule that reversibly inhibits type II, but not type I, fatty-acid synthases (31Hayashi T. Yamamoto O. Sasaki H. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot.

The antibiotic is not toxic to mice and affords significant protection against urinary tract and intraperitoneal bacterial infections (33Miyakawa S. Suzuki K. Noto T. Harada Y. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1982; 35: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TLM is active against Gram-negative anaerobes associated with periodontal disease (34Hamada S. Fujiwara T.

Immunol. 1990; 5: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and exhibits antimycobacterial action by virtue of its inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis (35Slayden R.A. Lee R.E. Armour J.W. Cooper A.M. Orme I.M. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TLM also has activity against malaria (36Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Kang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), extending the potential for using this template as a platform to develop more antimicrobials. We report the structures of the FabB-TLM and FabB-cerulenin complexes, and we identify structural features that define the differences in the biochemical mode of action and target selectivity of the two antibiotics. We have further validated our understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic binding through the mutagenesis of a key residue involved in the protein-drug interaction, and the subsequent assay of the mutant. This work contributes not only to the development of new antibacterials that target the condensation step in type II fatty acid synthesis but also to the understanding of the condensation reaction mechanism. Sources of supplies are as follows: [14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 55.0 Ci/mol) and [14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, 52.0 Ci/mol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; microbiological media from Difco; molecular reagents from Promega; cerulenin and ACP from Sigma; Ni2+-agarose resin from Qiagen; pET vector and expression strains from Novagen; and pCR2.1 vector from Invitrogen. Proteins were quantitated by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated. Acyl-ACP was prepared using an established acyl-ACP synthetase method (14Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

All other supplies were reagent grade or better. The three condensing enzymes of E. coli and malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FadD) were expressed and purified to homogeneity as described previously (13Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Purified enzymes were then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmdithiothreitol, concentrated with an Amicon stirred cell, and stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. A filter disc assay was used to assay FabH activity with [1-14C]acetyl-CoA as described previously (15Choi K.-H. Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays contained 50 μm ACP, 1 mmβ−mercaptoethanol, 45 μm [14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, 52.0 Ci/mol), and 50 μm malonyl-CoA,E. coli FabD (0.3 μg) and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of FabH, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 12 min. A 35-μl aliquot was removed and deposited on a Whatman 3MM filter disc. The discs were washed with three changes (20 ml/disc for 20 min) of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The concentration of the trichloroacetic acid was reduced from 10 to 5 to 1% in each successive wash. The filters were dried and counted in 3 ml of scintillation mixture. FabB and FabF radiochemical assay was performed using the scheme devised by Garwin et al. (11Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using myristoyl-ACP as the substrate. The assays contained 100 μm ACP, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 50 μm[14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity 55 Ci/mol), 100 μm myristoyl-ACP, FabD (0.3 μg of protein), in a final volume of 20 μl. A mixture of ACP, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and the buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure complete reduction ACP, and then the remaining components (except the condensing enzyme) were added. The mixture was then aliquoted into the assay tubes, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of FabB or FabF. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and then 400 μl of reducing agent (0.1m K2HPO4, 0.4 m KCl, 30% tetrahydrofuran, and 5 mg/ml sodium borohydride) was added into the reaction tubes and incubated for 40 min. Finally, 400 μl of toluene was added and vigorously mixed, and 300 μl of upper phase solution was counted in 3 ml of scintillation mixture. Kd values for TLM and the condensing enzymes were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy on a SLM-Amicon 8100 spectrofluorimeter (43Anderson K.S. Sikorski J.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence was measured with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 337 (FabB), 332 (FabF), or 321 nm (FabH). The concentration of each enzyme was 1 μm in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and TLM was titrated in 2-μl aliquots from stock solutions in water. Each curve was corrected for the nominal absorption by TLM at both excitation and emission wavelengths and normalized. Data was then fitted to Equation 1(43Anderson K.S. Sikorski J.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), FC=Fo+(ΔF/2[E])(Kd+[E]+[TLM])−((Kd+[E]+[TLM])2−4[E][TLM])Equation 1 where Fo is the initial fluorescence; ΔF is the change in fluorescence; [E] is the enzyme concentration; and [TLM] is the drug concentration. Each experiment was repeated several times and with the same results. A portion of thefabB gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with two specific primers. The first primer introduced the desired mutation and extended over a unique AgeI site (5′-AAAGCCATGACCGGTAACTCTC-3′). The second primer created aBamHI site downstream of the stop codon (5′-GCAGGATCCGGCGATTGTCAATGATG-3′). The resulting fragment was sequenced to confirm that the mutation had been correctly introduced and then was digested with AgeI and BamHI and cloned into the pET-15b-FabB expression vector that had been digested with the same enzymes. The FabB[H333N] protein was expressed and purified as described above. Both structures were solved using electron density difference maps. Pure FabB protein was dialyzed (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA) and concentrated to 15 mg/ml. The inhibitors (TLM and cerulenin) were added directly to separate aliquots of the protein solution and were gently agitated for 1 h. The ratio of inhibitor molecules to FabB monomers was about 10:1. The FabB-antibiotic complexes were crystallized by the same procedure as followed for the native crystals (21Olsen J.G. Kadziola A. Wettstein-Knowles P. Siggaard-Andersen M. Lindquist Y. Larsen S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Crystals measuring 0.1 × 0.3 × 1.0 mm grew in 1–2 weeks. The crystals were mounted on standard nylon loops, passed through a cryoprotectant of 50% paratone-N, 50% mineral oil and were frozen directly in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100 K using a Nonius FR591 x-ray generator and DIP 2030H detector system. All diffraction data were integrated using the HKL software package (44Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar). Integrated data were merged and scaled using SCALEPACK.

Open table in a new tab All refinements of models against our data were carried out using XPLOR (version 3.851) (45Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). First, the native FabB structure (21Olsen J.G. Kadziola A. Wettstein-Knowles P. Siggaard-Andersen M. Lindquist Y. Larsen S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was refined against our data, and then 2 mFo −DFc maps were calculated using CCP4 programs (46Collaborative Computation Project, N. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). To optimize the maps, the program DM (47Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newslett. on Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) was used to perform histogram matching, solvent flattening, and 4-fold NCS averaging (there are 2 dimers in the asymmetric unit). Maps were examined using the program O (48Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and were determined to be of good quality. Both maps clearly showed the presence of an antibiotic in the active site. The three-dimensional structures of the inhibitors were fit by hand into the electron density of one monomer and then extended by NCS operators into the other sites. For both antibiotics, all four sites showed a good fit between the map and the hand-fit molecule. Waters were picked using XPLOR and were visually inspected for good electron density and for sensible H-bonding geometry. Incorrectly assigned waters were rejected, and some additional waters were added by hand. Full scale refinements using NCS restraints were then performed. The residues to include in NCS restraints were chosen to be those residues not involved in crystal contacts, as determined by the XPLOR script “geomanal” and by a visual inspection of crystal packing. Two to three cycles of refinement followed by manual rebuilding of each model completed the structure determinations. The statistics of the final models are shown in Tables I and II. The relative sensitivities of the condensing enzymes to TLM and cerulenin are known from the inhibition of the pathway in crude cell extracts and from analyses of growth inhibition in genetically modified E. coli strains. However, the activities of the purified enzymes have not been compared using natural substrates. Therefore, we determined the IC50 values for all three condensing enzymes for both TLM and cerulenin (Fig. 1). Each of the three condensing enzymes was inhibited by TLM (Fig. 1 A). Under the in vitro assay conditions employed, FabF was the most sensitive enzyme (IC50 = 6 μm) followed by FabB (IC50 = 25 μm) and FabH, which was considerably less sensitive (IC50 = 110 μm). These data are consistent with genetic experiments that show that overexpression of FabB confers TLM resistance, whereas FabH overexpression does not (49Tsay J.-T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of FabF blocks growth (50Subrahmanyam S. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 180: 4596-4602Google Scholar) precluding a similar experiment with this condensing enzyme. However, since FabF is not essential for the growth of E. coli (11Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FabB is the physiologically relevant TLM target in this bacterium. As expected, both FabB and FabF were inhibited by cerulenin, with FabB being the most sensitive enzyme under our assay conditions (Fig.1 B). Since cerulenin forms an irreversible covalent complex with the FabB and FabF, the differences noted in Fig. 1 Br"
https://openalex.org/W1986461283,"mRNA turnover mediated by the major protein-coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD) of the c-fos proto-oncogene transcript illustrates a functional interplay between mRNA turnover and translation. We show that the function of mCRD depends on its distance from the poly(A) tail. Five mCRD-associated proteins were identified: Unr, a purine-rich RNA binding protein; PABP, a poly(A) binding protein; PAIP-1, a poly(A) binding protein interacting protein; hnRNP D, an AU-rich element binding protein; and NSAP1, an hnRNP R-like protein. These proteins form a multiprotein complex. Overexpression of these proteins stabilized mCRD-containing mRNA by impeding deadenylation. We propose that a bridging complex forms between the poly(A) tail and the mCRD and ribosome transit disrupts or reorganizes the complex, leading to rapid RNA deadenylation and decay."
https://openalex.org/W1878755986,"ProIL-1β is a proinflammatory cytokine that is proteolytically processed to its active form by caspase-1. Upon receipt of a proinflammatory stimulus, an upstream adaptor, RIP2, binds and oligomerizes caspase-1 zymogen, promoting its autoactivation. ICEBERG is a novel protein that inhibits generation of IL-1β by interacting with caspase-1 and preventing its association with RIP2. ICEBERG is induced by proinflammatory stimuli, suggesting that it may be part of a negative feedback loop. Consistent with this, enforced retroviral expression of ICEBERG inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1β generation. The structure of ICEBERG reveals it to be a member of the death-domain-fold superfamily. The distribution of surface charge is complementary to the homologous prodomain of caspase-1, suggesting that charge–charge interactions mediate binding of ICEBERG to the prodomain of caspase-1."
https://openalex.org/W2117547649,"An unusual property of the circadian timekeeping systems of animals is rhythm “splitting,” in which a single daily period of physical activity (usually measured as wheel running) dissociates into two stably coupled components about 12 hours apart; this behavior has been ascribed to a clock composed of two circadian oscillators cycling in antiphase. We analyzed gene expression in the hypothalamic circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), of behaviorally “split” hamsters housed in constant light. The results show that the two oscillators underlying the split condition correspond to the left and right sides of the bilaterally paired SCN."
https://openalex.org/W2056156549,"In marsupials and in extraembryonic tissues of placental mammals, X inactivation is imprinted to occur on the paternal chromosome. Here, we find that imprinting is controlled by the antisense Xist gene, Tsix. Tsix is maternally expressed and mice carrying a Tsix deletion show normal paternal but impaired maternal transmission. Maternal inheritance occurs infrequently, with surviving progeny showing intrauterine growth retardation and reduced fertility. Transmission ratio distortion results from disrupted imprinting and postimplantation loss of mutant embryos. In contrast to effects in embryonic stem cells, deleting Tsix causes ectopic X inactivation in early male embryos and inactivation of both X chromosomes in female embryos, indicating that X chromosome counting cannot override Tsix imprinting. These results highlight differences between imprinted and random X inactivation but show that Tsix regulates both. We propose that an imprinting center lies within Tsix."
https://openalex.org/W1969862105,"How multifunctional signals combine to specify unique cell fates during pattern formation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that together with the transcription factor Lozenge, the nuclear effectors of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways directly regulate D-Pax2 transcription in cone cells of the Drosophila eye disc. Moreover, the specificity of D-Pax2 expression can be altered upon genetic manipulation of these inputs. Thus, a relatively small number of temporally and spatially controlled signals received by a set of pluripotent cells can create the unique combinations of activated transcription factors required to regulate target genes and ultimately specify distinct cell fates within this group. We expect that similar mechanisms may specify pattern formation in vertebrate developmental systems that involve intercellular communication."
https://openalex.org/W2154560913,"Previously it was shown that the HHV-8-encoded chemokine receptor ORF74 shows considerable agonist-independent, constitutive activity giving rise to oncogenic transformation (Arvanitakis, L., Geras-Raaka, E., Varma, A., Gershengorn, M. C., and Cesarman, E. (1997) Nature 385, 347–350). In this study we report that a second viral-encoded chemokine receptor, the human cytomegalovirus-encoded US28, also efficiently signals in an agonist-independent manner. Transient expression of US28 in COS-7 cells leads to the constitutive activation of phospholipase C and NF-κB signaling via Gq/11 protein-dependent pathways. Whereas phospholipase C activation is mediated via Gαq/11 subunits, the activation of NF-κB strongly depends on βγ subunits with a preference for the β2γ1 dimer. The CC chemokines RANTES (regulated on activation, normalT cell expressed andsecreted) and MCP-1 (monocytechemotactic protein-1) act as neutral antagonists at US28, whereas the CX3C chemokine fractalkine acts as a partial inverse agonist with IC50values of 1–5 nm. Our data suggest that a high level of constitutive activity might be a more general characteristic of viral G protein-coupled receptors and that human cytomegalovirus might exploit this G protein-coupled receptor property to modulate the homeostasis of infected cells via the early gene product US28. Previously it was shown that the HHV-8-encoded chemokine receptor ORF74 shows considerable agonist-independent, constitutive activity giving rise to oncogenic transformation (Arvanitakis, L., Geras-Raaka, E., Varma, A., Gershengorn, M.

The CC chemokines RANTES (regulated on activation, normalT cell expressed andsecreted) and MCP-1 (monocytechemotactic protein-1) act as neutral antagonists at US28, whereas the CX3C chemokine fractalkine acts as a partial inverse agonist with IC50values of 1–5 nm. Our data suggest that a high level of constitutive activity might be a more general characteristic of viral G protein-coupled receptors and that human cytomegalovirus might exploit this G protein-coupled receptor property to modulate the homeostasis of infected cells via the early gene product US28. G protein-coupled receptors human cytomegalovirus human herpesvirus human immunodeficiency virus, type I nuclear factor-κB pertussis toxin cytomegalovirus inositol phosphate Viruses have developed a variety of strategies to evade the immune system, among which is the piracy of cellular genes that are central to the host defense system (1Davis-Poynter N.J.

Although constitutive GPCR signaling is now a well accepted paradigm, the actual physiological relevance is still not entirely understood (20Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 157-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As transgenic expression of ORF74 also results in angioproliferative lesions, resembling various symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma (23Yang T.Y. Chen S.C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M.

In this study we report that a second viral-encoded chemokine receptor, the HCMV-encoded GPCR US28, also efficiently signals in an agonist-independent manner. The β-herpesvirus HCMV has been recognized as a risk factor for vascular diseases, like arterial restenosis and atherosclerosis, and causes life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients (24Zhou Y.F.

Heart J. 1999; 138: 476-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the HCMV genome has identified four genes encoding GPCRs, US27, US28, UL33, and UL78 (5Chee M.S. Satchwell S.C. Preddie E. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), of which US28 is expressed early after viral infection (26Vieira J. Schall T.J. Corey L. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8158-8165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). US28 shows the highest homology (33%) to the CC chemokine receptor CCR1 and binds CC chemokines, like RANTES and MCP-1 (6Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W.

Treboute C. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6389-6397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, US28 has been shown to induce vascular smooth muscle cell migration (31Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C.

In this study, we show that upon transient expression in COS-7 cells US28 constitutively couples to phospholipase C and NF-κB via related, though distinct, Gq/11-protein-mediated mechanisms. Our data suggest that a high level of constitutive activity might be a more general characteristic of viral GPCRs and that HCMV might exploit this general GPCR property to modulate the homeostasis of infected cells via the early gene product US28.

COS-7 cells were grown at 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by DEAE-dextran. The total amount of DNA in transfected cells was maintained constant by addition of the empty vector. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates, and 24 h after transfection they were labeled overnight in inositol-free medium (modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salts) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, l-cysteine, l-leucine,l-methionine, l-arginine, glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 2 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol in the presence or absence of PTX (100 ng/ml). Subsequently, the labeling medium was aspirated, cells were washed for 10 min with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm LiCl, and incubated for 2 h in the same medium in the absence or presence of the tested chemokines. The incubation was stopped by aspiration of the medium and addition of cold 10 mm formic acid. After 90 min of incubation on ice, inositol phosphates were isolated by anion exchange chromatography (Dowex AG1-X8 columns, Bio-Rad) and counted by liquid scintillation. Cells transiently cotransfected with pNFκB-Luc and either pcDNA3 (mock) or pcDNA3-US28 were seeded in 96-well black plates (Costar) in serum-free culture medium in the presence or absence of PTX (100 ng/ml) and the tested chemokines. After 48 h, cells were assayed for luminescence by aspiration of the medium and addition of 25 μl of luciferase assay reagent (0.83 mm ATP, 0.83 mm d-luciferin, 18.7 mm MgCl2, 0.78 μmNa2H2P2O7, 38.9 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.39% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2.6 μm dithiothreitol). Luminescence was measured for 3 s in a Wallac Victor2. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates; 48 h after transfection binding was performed on whole cells for 3 h at 4 °C using 0.1 nm125I-RANTES in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). After incubation, cells were washed four times at 4 °C with binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.1 μm cold competitor (RANTES or fractalkine). Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin and leupeptin), sonicated, separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. An antibody recognizing the common motif of Gβ (Sigma) was used in combination with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein bands were detected with ECL chemiluminescence and quantified using an Imagestation (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All data shown are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference. Expression of the viral chemokine receptor US28 (encoded by the HCMV VHL/E strain) in COS-7 cells resulted in an expression-dependent increase in both [3H]inositol phosphate production and NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 A). Expression of the related US28-N, encoded by the HCMV AD169 strain, gave similar findings (data not shown). As reported in Ref. 16Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, the expression of the HHV-8-encoded oncogenic GPCR ORF74 also led to a pronounced constitutive activation of phospholipase C (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, expression of the human CCR1 receptor, which is most homologous to US28 (6Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not result in constitutive or RANTES-mediated phospholipase C activation (Fig. 1 B). These findings are in accordance with previous observations that activation of CCR1 does not result in [3H]inositol phosphates accumulation in COS-7 cells (32Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The constitutive activity of ORF74 was negatively modulated by IP-10 and positively by GRO-α (Fig. 1 B), thus acting as inverse agonist and agonist, respectively (17Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Brauner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 18Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Ho H. Clark-Lewis I. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The US28-induced signaling was not affected by the CC chemokines RANTES or MCP-1 up to 100 nm but was inhibited by the CX3C chemokine fractalkine (Fig. 1 B). It has been reported that fractalkine binds to US28 (27Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but so far no functional activity of fractalkine at US28 has been described. Fractalkine inhibited the constitutive US28 signaling to phospholipase C by 37 ± 4% with an IC50value of 1.6 ± 0.2 nm (n = 3; Fig.2). As the observed inhibition of the US28 signaling is not complete, fractalkine apparently behaves as a partial inverse agonist (20Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 21Leurs R. Smit M.J. Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The CC chemokines RANTES (100 nm) (Fig. 2, inset) and MCP-1 (data not shown) antagonized the reduction of basal US28 signaling by 10 nmfractalkine, thereby acting as neutral antagonists. RANTES and MCP-1 have previously been shown to act as agonists at US28 for Gi-dependent signal transduction (6Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Billstrom M.A. Johnson G.L. Avdi N.J. Worthen G.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5535-5544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data can be explained by differences in the levels of constitutive US28 signaling in the different cell systems, probably as a result of differences in expression of US28 and/or signaling moieties (20Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 21Leurs R. Smit M.J. Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because Gi proteins are known signaling partners for chemokine receptors (34Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar), including US28 (6Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Billstrom M.A. Johnson G.L. Avdi N.J. Worthen G.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5535-5544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the activation of phospholipase C by US28 could be due to the release of Gβγ subunits, which can activate phospholipase C isoenzymes (35Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25952-25957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, Gαi subunits are not implicated in the US28-mediated constitutive activation of phospholipase C. PTX treatment did not abolish the US28-mediated production of [3H]inositol phosphates (103 ± 5%; n = 3), whereas for the muscarinic m2 receptor PTX, treatment inhibited the carbachol-induced increase in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation for 45 ± 1.8%. Coexpression of Gαi2 with US28 did not increase the US28 response (Fig. 3), probably because of the absence of the βγ-sensitive phospholipase Cβ2 in COS-7 cells (32Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Instead, coexpression of US28 with either Gα11 or Gαq enhanced the US28-mediated production of [3H]inositol phosphates (Fig.3), whereas coexpression of Gα16 or Gαs did not affect US28 responsiveness. Previously, the receptor kinases GRK2 and -3 have been reported to scavenge both Gαq/11subunits (36Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), as well as βγ subunits (37Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Coexpression of US28 with GRK2 or the kinase-deficient GRK2K220R (38Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol.

In contrast, coexpression of the βγ-scavenger Gαt did not modify constitutive US28 signaling (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effect of various Gα subunits on US28-mediated inositol phosphates accumulation.COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding US28 (2 μg/106 cells) in the presence of cDNAs encoding the indicated Gα subunits (2 μg/106 cells) and were assayed for InsP accumulation after 48 h.

Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), US28 interacts with endogenous Gαq/11subunits in COS-7 cells and thereby constitutively activates phospholipase C. A large number of GPCRs can also couple to phospholipase C upon coexpression of Gα16, an hematopoietic specific member of the Gq class of proteins (39Milligan G. Marshall F. Rees S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 235-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Expression of Gα16 enhanced, for example, the agonist-induced inositol phosphate production mediated by the muscarinic m2 receptor 2.2-fold, as previously reported (40Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, US28 shows a remarkable level of selectivity for Gα11 and Gαq over Gα16 for the coupling to phospholipase C in COS-7 cells. Besides the US28-mediated modulation of phospholipase C activity, we also observed a constitutive activation of NF-κB activity upon expression of US28 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 A). This effect was not observed for the homologous CCR1 receptor (data not shown). The constitutive stimulation of NF-κB activity was not modulated by RANTES or MCP-1 (up to 100 nm; data not shown), but fractalkine again behaved as an apparent partial inverse agonist. The US28-mediated increase in NF-κB activity was reduced by fractalkine for 42 ± 4% (n = 3) with an IC50value of 5 ± 0.2 nm. The observed constitutive activation of NF-κB by US28 is of potential pathophysiological relevance, as NF-κB is an ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of inducible genes in immune response and inflammatory events associated with, for example, atherosclerosis (41Brand K.

Yet, as observed for the production of [3H]inositol phosphates, Gαi is not involved in the US28-induced increase in NF-κB activity, as PTX treatment did not affect the US28 response (104 ± 5%; n = 3). Previous studies have indicated that depending on the cell type and GPCR, NF-κB-mediated transcription can also be stimulated following activation of G12/13 or Gq/11 proteins (44Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Yet, in COS-7 cells, only the expression of the activated form of Gα11(Gα11 Q209L, referred to as Gα11 *) subunits resulted in significant activation of NF-κB (Fig.4 A). In line with these findings, coexpression of the wild-type Gα11 or Gαq (Fig. 4 A) increased the US28-mediated constitutive NF-κB signaling, whereas the basal NF-κB activity in mock-transfected cells was not affected. These observations clearly imply the involvement of the Gαq/11 proteins in the US28-mediated signaling to NF-κB. As found for the activation of phosholipase C, GRK2 and its kinase-deficient mutant inhibited the increase in NF-κB activity (Fig. 4 B, inset). Yet, in contrast to the US28-induced phospholipase C activation, US28-mediated NF-κB activity was fully inhibited by coexpression of Gαt (Fig. 4 B). The involvement of βγ subunits in constitutive US28 signaling to NF-κB was further strengthened by coexpression experiments with various βγ subunits (Fig. 5, inset). Of the different combinations tested, only the Gβ2 and Gγ1 further significantly increased the US28-mediated activation of NF-κB (Fig. 5). These data corroborate previous findings that GPCRs can show a clear specificity for specific βγ subunit combinations (45Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of different βγ combinations on US28-mediated NF-κB activation. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with US28 (2 μg/106 cells), NF-κB-Luc, and different combinations of Gβ1, β2, and β5 with Gγ1 and γ2 (2 μg/106 cells of each construct); 48 h after transfection NF-κB-driven luciferase expression was measured. Data are expressed as percentage of US28-mediated response. A representative experiment performed in triplicate is shown, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.

Inset, expression of Gβ subunits measured by an antibody directed at a common motif in Gβ .View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whereas US28 activates phospholipase C via Gαq/11subunits, our data suggest that besides αq/11 subunits, βγ subunits are also involved in the NF-κB activation by US28. The apparent coinvolvement of αq/11 and βγ subunits suggests that NF-κB activation is due to βγ subunits that are released upon US28 interaction with Gq/11 proteins, although release of βγ subunits from other G proteins cannot be ruled out. As previously observed after stimulation of the bradykinin B2 receptor in Hela cells (44Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Gβγ subunits appear to be essential but not exclusive signaling moieties for the NF-κB signaling by US28. Expression of the various Gβγ subunits by themselves did not increase NF-κB signaling (data not shown). Moreover, our observation that expression of activated Gα11 initiates NF-κB signaling indicates that Gαq/11 subunits also trigger a signaling pathway that converges to NF-κB. Protein kinase C activation is a likely candidate for this αq/11-mediated pathway (46Shahrestanifar M. Fan X. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3828-3833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB via βγ subunits probably involves the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt (44Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), two recently identified signaling partners for GPCRs (47Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A.

Additional experiments need to be performed to further delineate the mechanisms of US28-mediated NF-κB activation. The specific roles of the αq/11 and βγ subunits, especially, will require further clarification. In conclusion, in comparison to its closest human homologue CCR1, it is interesting to note that the viral GPCR US28 signals without the need for an agonist and is using a larger diversity of G proteins and chemokines to affect cellular signaling pathways. For the first time, we show that US28 signals to phospholipase C via Gαq/11subunits and NF-κB via both Gαq/11 and Gβγ in a constitutively active manner. It is tempting to speculate that these characteristics of a promiscuous GPCR allows US28 to affect a broad range of cells upon CMV infection. The constitutive activation of the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-κB by the early viral gene product US28 could be of major importance for viral action. US28 has been shown to cause smooth muscle cell migration upon HCMV infection without the addition of exogenous chemokines (31Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The basal US28-mediated migration was antagonized for 80% by neutralizing antibodies against MCP-1, which was released in an autocrine fashion (31Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Constitutive signaling by US28 could be responsible for the remaining migratory response of the HCMV-infected smooth muscle cells. Moreover, if US28 is expressed on viral particles, it would also be immediately present on the membrane of CMV-infected cells and, by means of its constitutive activity, could modulate the cellular response. We also show for the first time a functional response to the CX3C chemokine fractalkine, i.e. acting as an inverse agonist at US28. Fractalkine is a quite unique GPCR ligand as its chemokine-like domain is linked to a transmembrane segment (49Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Accordingly, fractalkine is membrane-bound, and its interaction with US28 has been suggested to be involved in the viral transfer between cells (27Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The action of fractalkine as an inverse agonist suggests that inhibition of constitutive US28 activity by fractalkine expressed on the membrane of a target cell might give the appropriate signal to an CMV-infected, US28-expressing cell to allow CMV entry into the target cell. Because no data are currently available on the expression of US28 on the viral particle or on the role of fractalkine in CMV infections, future investigations should substantiate these suggestions and indicate if US28 can be regarded as an interesting drug target in HCMV-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1811969339,"We measured the phase evolution of electrons as they traverse a quantum dot (QD) formed in a two-dimensional electron gas that serves as a localized spin. The traversal phase, determined by embedding the QD in a double path electron interferometer and measuring the quantum interference of the electron wave functions manifested by conductance oscillation as a function of a weak magnetic field, evolved by pi radians, a range twice as large as theoretically predicted. As the correlation weakened, a gradual transition to the familiar phase evolution of a QD was observed. The specific phase evolution observed is highly sensitive to the onset of Kondo correlation, possibly serving as an alternative fingerprint of the Kondo effect."
https://openalex.org/W1976561295,"During meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA replication occurs 1. 5 to 2 hours before recombination initiates by DNA double-strand break formation. We show that replication and recombination initiation are directly linked. Blocking meiotic replication prevented double-strand break formation in a replication-checkpoint-independent manner, and delaying replication of a chromosome segment specifically delayed break formation in that segment. Consequently, the time between replication and break formation was held constant in all regions. We suggest that double-strand break formation occurs as part of a process initiated by DNA replication, which thus determines when meiotic recombination initiates on a regional rather than a cell-wide basis."
https://openalex.org/W2045717118,"Environmental pH exerts broad control over growth and differentiation, but the molecular responses to external pH changes are poorly understood. Here we have used open reading frame macroarray hybridization to identify alkaline response genes inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Northern or lacZfusion assays confirmed the alkaline induction of two ion pump genes (ENA1 and VMA4), several ion limitation genes (CTR3, FRE1, PHO11/12, andPHO84), a siderophore-iron transporter gene (ARN4/ENB1), two transcription factor genes (NRG2 and TIS11), and two predicted membrane protein genes (YAR068W/YHR214W and YOL154W). Unlike ENA1 and SHC1, these new alkaline response genes are not induced by high salinity. The known pH-responsive genes in other fungi depend on the conserved PacC/Rim101p transcription factor, but induction of several of these new genes relied upon Rim101p-independent pH signaling mechanisms. Rim101p-dependent genes were also dependent on Rim13p, a protease required for Rim101p processing. The Rim101p-dependent gene VMA4 is required for growth in alkaline conditions, illustrating how Rim101p may control adaptation. Because Rim101p activates ion pump genes, we tested the role of RIM101 in ion homeostasis and found thatRIM101 promotes resistance to elevated cation concentrations. Thus, gene expression surveys can reveal new functions for characterized transcription factors in addition to uncovering physiological responses to environmental conditions.

Specialized responses to pH changes have been characterized in many organisms, but there is limited information concerning the extent and general features of such a response. Our objective is to use Saccharomyces cerevisiaeas a model to understand transcriptional responses to a change in external pH. Yeast cells grow more rapidly in acidic media than in neutral or alkaline media. They neutralize the cytoplasm through activity of Pma1p, the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which hydrolyzes ATP to pump protons out of the cell (10van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proton gradient is used for transport of amino acids, nucleotide bases, phosphate, and many other molecules in symport reactions (10van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also provides an electrochemical gradient that favors uptake of cations (11Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 12Withee J.L. Sen R. Cyert M.S. Genetics. 1998; 149: 865-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the plasma membrane proton gradient is required for accumulation of solutes from the medium, and PMA1 is an essential gene (10van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In neutral and alkaline conditions, two other ion pumps are vital for growth: the plasma membrane Na+-ATPase (called Ena1p or Pmr2p (14Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) and the multi-subunit vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase (15Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Ena1p hydrolyzes ATP to pump Na+ out of the cell, and the Na+ gradient permits uptake of other cations. The vacuolar ATPase is required for vacuolar acidification, which cannot occur through endocytosis in alkaline media (16Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Null mutants lacking these pumps are hypersensitive to alkaline growth conditions and elevated external cation concentrations but are capable of growth in acidic media. External pH changes cause a transcriptional response in S. cerevisiae. There are three known alkaline-inducible genes: the Na+-ATPase structural gene ENA1 (14Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),SHC1, and SCY1 (19Hong S.K. Han S.B. Snyder M. Choi E.Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1999; 255: 116-122Google Scholar). ENA1 andSHC1 are also induced in high salt medium; results forSCY1 have not been reported. Thus, it is possible that external pH is sensed by factors that also sense external salt concentration, thereby triggering a common signal transduction cascade and activating a common set of genes. Alternatively, it is possible that a unique regulatory pathway senses and responds to external pH changes. Transcriptional responses to external pH have been characterized in several other fungi. For example, alkaline pH induces transcription ofIPNA and other penicillin biosynthetic genes inAspergillus nidulans and Penicillium chrysogenum(20Espeso E.A. Penalva M.A. J. Biol.

It accumulates in an apparently inactive full-length form under acidic growth conditions and is activated by C-terminal proteolytic cleavage under alkaline growth conditions (30Orejas M. Espeso E.A. Tilburn J. Sarkar S. Arst Jr., H.N. Penalva M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1622-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Several alkaline response regulatory genes,palA, palB, palC, palF,palH, and palI, are required for proteolytic cleavage of PacC (30Orejas M. Espeso E.A. Tilburn J. Sarkar S. Arst Jr., H.N. Penalva M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1622-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Tilburn J. Sarkar S. Widdick D.A. Espeso E.A. Orejas M. Mungroo J. Penalva M.A. Arst Jr., H.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Their sole known function is to promote PacC cleavage, because loss-of-function pal mutations cause similar phenotypes to loss-of-function pacC mutations and because expression of C-terminally truncated PacC derivatives suppresses pal mutant defects (30Orejas M. Espeso E.A. Tilburn J. Sarkar S. Arst Jr., H.N. Penalva M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1622-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Tilburn J. Sarkar S. Widdick D.A. Espeso E.A. Orejas M.

Rim101p is a homolog of PacC, and it is activated by C-terminal proteolytic cleavage (32Li W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1997; 145: 63-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that depends upon pal gene homologs (26Davis D. Wilson R.B. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell.

Genet. 1999; 260: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, unlike PacC cleavage, which is completely dependent upon external alkaline pH, Rim101p cleavage occurs under both acidic and alkaline growth conditions (32Li W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1997; 145: 63-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is uncertain whether the S. cerevisiae RIM101 pathway also governs pH-responsive gene expression. Here we have used a gene expression survey to identify pH-responsiveS. cerevisiae genes. We have used these genes to determine the relationship between gene induction by alkaline pH and by salt. In addition, we have asked whether the S. cerevisiae RIM101pathway is required for alkaline gene expression, and how cleavage of Rim101p impinges upon regulation of alkaline genes. Our results provide insight into both the functional conservation of the PacC/RIM101 pathway as a pH response pathway and upon the nature of external pH as a global transcriptional regulatory signal.

Open table in a new tab Yeast growth media (YPD and SC) were of standard composition (36Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). For growth in liquid YPD medium at a specified pH, YPD containing 0.1 m HEPES was titrated to pH 4 (with ∼35 mm HCl) or pH 8 (with ∼75 mm NaOH) and filter sterilized. YPD plates at pH 3 or pH 9 contained 150 mmHEPES and were titrated before autoclaving. Other additions to YPD included 0.4 or 0.8 m NaCl, 1.2 m sorbitol, 50 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 20 mm LiCl. For plates, these additions were always made after autoclaving. To assess growth on various media, YPD overnight cultures were adjusted to anA 600 of 5- and 3.5-μl samples of serial 5-fold dilutions in YPD were spotted on test plates. All cultures and plates were incubated at 30° C. For β-galactosidase assays, strains were grown to saturation in pH 4 YPD and then inoculated at an A 600 <0.2 in pH 4 YPD or pH 8 YPD and grown for at least two doublings. β-Galactosidase assays were carried out on permeabilized cells as described (36Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar), except that cells were suspended in 0.15 ml of Z buffer, permeabilized, and assayed with 0.7 ml of 1 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in Z buffer. Yeast ORF1 GeneFilters (Research Genetics, GF100I and II) were probed with labeled cDNA from strain TLY759 as follows. A late exponential pH 4 YPD culture was used to inoculate 250 ml cultures of pH 4 YPD and pH 8 YPD at anA 600 of 0.375. After 2 h, cells were collected by filtration and frozen at −80° C; at this time the pH 4 culture had reached an A 600 of 0.905 and pH 3.6, and the pH 8 culture had reached an A 600 of 0.625 and pH 7.5. Total RNA was produced as follows. Thawed cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml AE (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 10 mm EDTA) and brought to 1% SDS. After vortexing and incubation at 65° C in the presence of 25 ml of acid phenol, the aqueous phase was separated, and total RNA was precipitated. For each sample, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared as follows. 1 mg of total RNA was batch bound to 40 mg of oligo(dT) cellulose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in NETS buffer (0.6 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% SDS), transferred to a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad), washed four times with NETS, eluted in ETS (10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2% SDS) at 65° C, and precipitated, yielding between 15 and 30 μg of selected RNA. 0.04 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from the pH 4 culture was used to generate [α-33P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs through reverse transcription, following the Research Genetics protocol. After purification on a BioSpin6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequent boiling, the labeled cDNAs were added to GeneFilters which had been prehybridized at 42° C for 3 h in 10 ml of MicroHyb (Research Genetics, HYB250-GF). Filters were hybridized at 42° C for ∼18 h in roller bottles, washed as recommended, and exposed to a phosphor screen for 26 h. The filters were scanned at a resolution of 50 microns on a Storm2000 Phosphorimager, and the data were imported into Pathways software (Research Genetics) for analysis. Filters were then stripped by washing twice with boiling 0.5% SDS and reprobed with cDNAs prepared from the pH 8 culture. Pathways software was used to normalize each ORF signal to all data points for each probe, and then a ratio of the pH 8 to pH 4 signal was obtained for each ORF. We identified 71 ORFs that had a pH 8 to pH 4 ratio of 2.1-fold or greater. Because of the order of hybridization and incomplete stripping of the pH 4 signal, our experiment may not have reliably identified genes that are up-regulated at pH 4 compared with pH 8. For Northern analysis, 15–20 μgs of total RNA per lane was run on dentaturing formaldehyde gels, transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized as described (37Smith H.E. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2142-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To generate Northern blot probes, genomic DNA was PCR-amplified using the primers designated with “N” followed by the gene name in TableII. The ENA1 andENO1 PCR fragments were gel purified, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a High Prime kit (Roche), and QIAquick PCR purified (Qiagen). All other PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and plasmid inserts were obtained by NotI digestion, gel purified, and labeled as described above.Table IIOligonucleotidesOligonucleotideSequence (5′–3′)Pada-RIM13FAACTTATTAAACGGTTACTCGACCATTTCAGTCGAAGACAAGAACCTTGTGGTATCAAAACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAAPada-RIM13RTTTTGTGTGTAGAATTGTAAAAAGGATGGATAGACAGTTCTTGAGATAAAGCACAGTTATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAACpRIM13–5′FTGCTCAGTAGCTGAGGAGCpRIM13–5′RGATACCACAAGGTTCTTGTCpRIM13–3′RCTCAAACAATTAGCTTCCTTGpalB-ATGTACTCGACCATTTCAGTCGAAGACAAGAACCTTGTGGTATCAAAATTTCCCAGpalB-TAAGAATTGTAAAAAGGATGGATAGACAGTTCTTGAGATAAGCACAGGCAAGTGCpalB-620GGGGATCCCAGTTTAGGACTTCGATCGpalB+2526CCAAGAATTCTACTTCCTTCN-ENA1 up2ATTGATTACCATGCGCGGTAN-ENA1 dwn1TCACCTGTCATTGTGCAGAAN-NRG2-FTTTCCAGATGTCCATAGGTTACN-NRG2-RTTTTGGCTGAGCTCACTCACATN-ENB1-FGCTCGTGAATGTCTCTCTGAAAN-ENB1-RACTCTCCAGCTCAATATCCAAN-YHR214w-FTTACTTGAATGCCACAAGTACAGN-YHR214w-RAAGCATTGGTTCTCAAACCAGCN-PHO84-FCACACAACAAACAAAACTCCACGN-PHO84-RGTGCATCTTTGAGGCTTTTATGCN-PHO11 up1CAGAAGAGAGCAAGAACATCAN-PHO11 dwn1AAGTGTCGTTGTAGTGCTTGGN-FRE1 up1GAAGAACGAGCCGGATCAATN-FRE1 dwn1ATTAACAAGGGGCCTTCACCAN-CTR3 up1GACGAAAACACATTTAAGGGCN-CTR3 dwn1ACCTCTCGGCTTTCCTCTATTN-UBC4-FGGAAAATCACTATCGCCACAN-UBC4-RCCCTGTACTGTTGCCAACAATN-ENO1 up1CCAAGCAACTGCTTATCAACAN-ENO1 dwn1TGGAAGTTTTCACCAGCGAAL-VMA4-Pst-FCGCTGCAGGGATTCTATCTGGACTTTGGL-VMA4-Eco-RGCGAATTCAGCGGAGGACATGCTGTATCL-YOL154-Sph-FACAGCATGCTGTAGTGGTTCCGTTATATTTTTGGCL-YOL154-RGTCGGATTCCATAATGTTTAGTAGTTGTGTGTGGAL-YOL158-Sph-FACAGCATGCCCTTGAGATTTAGAAAGGCACACL-YOL158-RGTCGGATTCCATTTTCAGAGAGACATTCACGAGL-TIS11-Pst-FCGCTGCAGAGAGGCACTGCCGCATCGCAL-TIS11-Eco-RCCGAATTCTAATTGAGCCCACATATTGCGL-YOL158-FACAGCATGCCCTTGAGATTTAGAAAGGCACACL-YOL158-RGTCGGATTCCATTTTCAGAGAGACATTCACGAGL-ENA1-Sph-FACAGCATGCGAGGTTTTCATTGTCATACGATCTL-ENA1-RGTCGGATTCCATCGAAAATTTTCAATTCTGTG Open table in a new tab To generate lacZ fusion genes, 1.5 kilobase pairs of DNA sequence upstream of the desired gene was PCR-amplified from wild-type genomic DNA using the primers designated with “L” followed by the gene name in Table II. PCR products were cloned into plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to yield the plasmids pAED54 (VMA4 5′), pAED50 (YOL154W 5′), pAED51 (ARN4 5′), pAED49 (ENA1 5′), and pAED53 (TIS11 5′). A PstI-EcoRI fragment from plasmid pAED54 was cloned into PstI- andEcoRI-cut plasmid YIp356R (38Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) to yield plasmid pTL112 (vma4-lacZ), which includes 1.5 kilobase pairs ofVMA4 5′ sequences and fuses the VMA4 initiation codon in-frame to lacZ. Also, aPstI-EcoRI fragment from plasmid pAED53 was inserted into PstI- and EcoRI-digested plasmid YIp356R to yield plasmid pTL111 (tis11-lacZ). Similar fusions were created by inserting SphI-SphI fragments of plasmids pAED49, 50, and 51 into SphI-cut plasmid YIp356 to yield plasmids pTL107 (ena1-lacZ), pTL105 (yol154W-lacZ), and pTL106 (arn4-lacZ), respectively. For transformation into yeast, each plasmid was cut withStuI to direct integration to the ura3 locus. We identifiedRIM13(YMR154C) initially through a S. cerevisiaegenomic BLAST search for a PalB homolog (60Li W. Characterizations of Meiotic Regulators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph.D. Thesis. Columbia University, 1996Google Scholar). Our conclusion that YMR154C is RIM13 is based upon tests of phenotype, complementation, and linkage. For phenotypic tests, aymr154C::TRP1 insertion-deletion allele (rim13Δ10::TRP1) that removes the entire ORF was introduced into haploid strain AMP1604 by transformation and was moved into meiotic segregants for analysis of diploids. The mutation caused an invasive growth defect in haploids and a sporulation defect in homozygous diploids, as described for rim13-1(32Li W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1997; 145: 63-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation tests: ymr154C::TRP1 strains failed to complement rim13-1 strains for sporulation ability and for expression of a meiotic ime2-lacZ reporter gene. In addition, a plasmid carrying YMR154C complemented the Rim101p processing defect of a rim13-1 mutant. For the linkage test, a cross of a ymr154C::TRP1 strain to a rim13-1 strain yielded exclusively 0+:4− meiotic segregation of invasive growth ability in 24 tetrads, as expected from tight linkage of YMR154C and RIM13. Thus all tests indicate that YMR154C is RIM13. During the course of our studies, RIM13 was independently described asCPL1 (34Futai E. Maeda T. Sorimachi H. Kitamoto K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 260: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The rim13Δ10::TRP1 mutation was constructed as follows. Primers palB-ATG and palB-TAA were used to amplify a TRP1 cassette, and the PCR product was transformed into haploid strain AMP1604. Homologous integration was verified by PCR with flanking primers palB−620 and palB+2526. The rim13Δ::HIS3 mutation was constructed as follows. Primers Pada-RIM13F and Pada-RIM13R were used to amplify the HIS3-MX6 cassette (Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5 +) from plasmid pFA6aHis3MX6 (39Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Primers pRIM13–5′F and pRIM13–5′R were used to amplify 500 base pairs ofRIM13 5′-flanking sequences, and two-way PCRs were performed to fuse this sequence to the amplified HIS3-MX6 cassette. The fused PCR product was transformed into strains WXY169 and WXY170, and homologous integration was verified by PCRs with primer pRIM13–5′F and flanking primer pRIM13–3′R. Transformants were also tested for smooth colony morphology and failure to process Rim101-HA2p. We used a GeneFilter macroarray to identify 71 S. cerevisiae genes that appeared to be expressed at higher levels at pH 8 than at pH 4 (Table III). These genes includedENA1, which is induced at pH 8 (14Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen.

Commun. 1999; 255: 116-122Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization confirmed the expression pattern of genes that represent several major classes in Table III. Of 9 Northern probes, seven detected transcripts of appropriate size, and all of these transcripts accumulated at 10–100-fold higher levels at pH 8 than at pH 4 (Fig. 1). These genes included phosphate metabolism genes PHO84 andPHO11/PHO12 (a duplicated gene pair), metal transport genesCTR3, FRE1, and ARN4(ENB1), putative membrane protein genes YAR068W/YHR214W (a duplicated gene pair), and transcription factor gene NRG2 (Fig. 1). Levels of a control transcript from ENO1/ENO2 (a duplicated gene pair) were unaffected by external pH. Two additional transcripts were not reliably detected on Northern blots but gave alkaline-dependent GeneFilter signals: VMA4, a vacuolar ATPase subunit gene, and YOL154W, a putative cell surface protein gene. To verify pH-dependent expression of these genes and ofTIS11, a transcription factor gene, we created strains carrying the respective lacZ fusion genes and assayed β-galactosidase activity after growth at pH 4 and pH 8 (TableIV, RIM101 strain). Controlena1-lacZ and arn4-lacZ fusions were expressed at 100-fold higher levels at pH 8 than at pH 4, as expected from Northern analysis, and the lacZ fusion vector with no insert was not expressed at either pH. The vma4-lacZ,yol154W-lacZ, and tis11-lacZ fusions were expressed at 100-fold higher levels at pH 8 than at pH 4. These results indicate that expression of several genes increases substantially in response to a shift from acidic to alkaline pH.

Images of the magnetic field of martian meteorite ALH84001 reveal a spatially heterogeneous pattern of magnetization associated with fractures and rock fragments. Heating the meteorite to 40 degrees C reduces the intensity of some magnetic features, indicating that the interior of the rock has not been above this temperature since before its ejection from the surface of Mars. Because this temperature cannot sterilize most bacteria or eukarya, these data support the hypothesis that meteorites could transfer life between planets in the solar system."

A major loss of both intracellular potassium and sodium occurs when apoptotic cells shrink and prior to the loss of membrane integrity (6Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Maintenance of the normal physiologic intracellular concentration of these monovalent ions was also shown to inhibit the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3-like enzymes) and the apoptotic nuclease activity during cell death, suggesting that the role ions play during apoptosis is more extensive than simply facilitating the loss of cell volume (7Hughes Jr., F.M.

In most excitable cells, cellular depolarization occurs as a result of a movement of sodium ions, which can occur through a variety of mechanisms including opening of voltage-gated sodium channels (12Kallen R.G. Cohen S.A. Barchi R.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 383-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suppression of the Na+/K+-ATPase activity (13Jones G.S. Van Dyke K. Castranova V. J. Cell.

Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Philo R.D. Eddy A. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast to excitable cells, lymphocytes have a relatively stable sodium concentration, and very little detail is known about the movement of sodium ions in these cells, although several studies have suggested that changes in sodium levels in lymphocytes may occur by similar mechanisms as in other cell types (17Senn N. Garay R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C12-C18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Adebodun F. Post J.F. M J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the movement of ions, especially sodium, in lymphocytes would be likely to be reflected in a change in plasma membrane potential (PMP).1 The loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential has been shown to occur in a variety of apoptotic model systems (19Inai Y.

Recent evidence has shown that changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, along with several other characteristics of apoptosis, appear to be restricted to the shrunken population of cells (27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (21952): 21953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate whether an early transit of monovalent ions, prior to the loss of cell volume, might promote the activation of apoptosis and lead to the downstream movement of ions and apoptotic events associated with cell death. Flow cytometry allows multiple cell death characteristics to be analyzed at the single cell level and thus has been an invaluable tool in the study of apoptosis. We have used this technology to ascertain if an early movement of monovalent ions occurs during apoptosis. By using a fluorescent dye that measures changes in intracellular sodium, we show that an early increase in intracellular sodium occurs prior to the loss of cell volume. We hypothesized that this increase in intracellular sodium would be reflected in changes in the plasma membrane potential. By using flow cytometry and a dye that responds to acute changes in the plasma membrane potential (PMP), we show that cells depolarize very early during apoptosis, prior to a loss in cell volume, and in response to various apoptotic stimuli. We also observed that changes in PMP correlated with a population of cells with increased intracellular sodium. K+ uptake studies using86Rb+ suggested the rapid inactivation of the Na+/K+-ATPase, which was confirmed by using a functional enzyme activity assay and Western blot analysis. We also show that inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase by using ouabain enhances cellular depolarization and apoptosis, whereas treatment with an anti-apoptotic PKC activator prevents anti-Fas-induced cellular depolarization and cell death. These studies indicate that an early movement of monovalent ions, particularly sodium, results in plasma membrane depolarization that may orchestrate subsequent movement of ions during apoptosis. Jurkat cells, E6.1 (human lymphoma), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 31 mg/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells (5 × 105 cells per ml) was accomplished using either 10 or 50 ng/ml anti-human Fas IgM (Kamiya Biomedical), 2 μmA23187 (Calbiochem), or 10 μmthapsigargin (Sigma). The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere for the specified periods. The caspase-8 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-IETD-fluormethyl ketone was purchased from Kamiya Biomedical. Ouabain and the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were purchased from Sigma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; synthetic analog of diacylglycerol) was purchased from Calbiochem. Cell size and changes in the light scattering properties of the cell were determined by flow cytometry as described previously using a Becton Dickinson FACSort (28Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 7,500 cells were examined by exciting the cells with a 488 nm argon laser and determining their position on a forward-scatter versus side-scatter dot plot. Light scattered in the forward direction is roughly proportional to cell size, whereas light scattered at a 90° angle (side scatter) is proportional to cell density or granularity (29Willman C.L. Stewart C.C. Semin. Diagnostic Pathol. 1989; 6: 3-12PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, as a cell shrinks or loses cell volume, a decrease in the amount of forward-scattered light is observed, along with a slight change in side-scattered light. A gate based on the properties of the control cells was set on each forward-scatter versus side-scatter dot plot to separate the normal and apoptotic populations of cells and remained constant throughout the analysis. Acute changes in the plasma membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry using DiBAC4(3) (Molecular Probes). DiBAC4(3) was prepared in Me2SO according to the manufacturer's instructions. Graded potassium media were made by altering the KCl and NaCl concentrations in RPMI 1640 media containing glutamine and antibiotics. The normal KCl and NaCl concentrations in RPMI 1640 are 5.4 and 102.7 mm, respectively, totaling 108.1 mm for these salts. For graded potassium media, the KCl concentration was set at 5.4 (normal), 25, 50, 75, or 102.7 mm, whereas the NaCl concentration was adjusted such that the combined monovalent salt concentration equaled 108.1 mm. Heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, dialyzed against several changes of the KCl/NaCl-free RPMI 1640, was added to a final concentration of 10%. Jurkat cells were resuspended in 1 ml of the various graded potassium media or in normal RPMI 1640 containing 150 nm DiBAC4(3) at a density of 5 × 105 cells per ml. All samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere and were immediately examined by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSort, with excitation performed using a 488 nm argon laser, and fluorescent emission was detected at 530 nm (FL-1). Ten thousand cells were examined under each condition, and all flow cytometric analyses were accomplished using CellQuest software. Jurkat cells treated with either 10 ng/ml of an anti-Fas antibody, 2 μmA23187, or 10 mmthapsigargin were incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2atmosphere. Stock solutions of 20 μmDiBAC4(3) and DiOC6(3) (Molecular Probes) was prepared in Me2SO. Thirty minutes prior to each time of examination, either DiBAC4(3) or DiOC6(3) was added to 1 ml of cells at a final concentration of 150 ng/ml, and incubation was continued at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were examined as changes in their plasma membrane potential by flow cytometry using either a Becton Dickinson FACSort or FACSVantage SE as described above. Ten thousand cells were examined under each condition, and all flow cytometric analyses were accomplished using CellQuest software. Jurkat cells treated with either 10 ng/ml of an anti-Fas antibody, 2 μmA23187, or 10 mm thapsigargin were incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. One hour prior to each time of examination, SBFI-AM (Na+) was added to 1 ml of cells at a final concentration of 5 μm, and incubation was continued at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Immediately prior to flow cytometric examination, propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Ten thousand cells were analyzed by sequential excitation of the cells containing SBFI-AM and PI at 340–350 and 488 nm, respectively, using a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and CellQuest software. For the86Rb+ efflux experiments, Jurkat cells (5 × 105 cells per ml) loaded overnight with 12.5 μCi of86Rb+ were washed twice in normal RPMI 1640 and then split into 2 samples at a final cell density of 1 × 106 cells per ml. Anti-Fas antibody was added to one sample at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, and all samples were incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. At 1-h intervals, 3 separate 1-ml aliquots of cells were harvested for each sample, and 800 μl of the supernatant was removed to be counted. The pellet was washed in RPMI 1640 and finally resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Both the pellet and supernatant were counted in triplicate, and the average 86Rb+ in the pellet fraction from two independent experiments is shown ± S.E. For the86Rb+ uptake experiments, 5 μCi of86Rb+ was added to Jurkat cells (5 × 105 cells per ml) in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml of an anti-Fas antibody. All samples were incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. At 1-h intervals, 3 separate 1-ml aliquots of cells were harvested for each sample. The pellets were washed twice in RPMI 1640 and then resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and counted in triplicate, and the average86Rb+ in the pellet fraction from two independent experiments is shown ± S.E. The DNA content for each sample was determined as described previously by flow cytometry (28Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ml of cells were pelleted from the culture medium and fixed by the slow addition of cold 70% ethanol to a volume of ∼1.5 ml. The volume of each sample was adjusted to 5 ml with cold 70% ethanol, and the cells were stored at 4 °C overnight. For flow analysis, the fixed cells were pelleted, washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained in 1 ml of 20 μg/ml PI, 1 mg/ml RNase in 1× PBS for 20 min. Seven thousand five hundred cells were examined by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSort by gating on an area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell aggregates. The percentage of degraded DNA was determined by the number of cells with subdiploid DNA divided by the total number of cells examined under each experimental condition. The functional expression of the Na+/K+-ATPase was assessed by the ouabain-sensitive uptake of Rb+. Cells cultured in RPMI 1640 were treated in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml of an anti-Fas antibody for 3 h. Thirty minutes prior to the assay, 100 μm ouabain was added to the medium in the fraction of cells used for ouabain-insensitive transport. Cells were pelleted, washed with 1× PBS, and then resuspended in RPMI 1640 without K+ but containing 2.5 mm RbCl. After 10 min at 37 °C (time of transport), triplicates of 250-μl cell aliquots were immediately transferred to Eppendorf tubes on ice, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min, and washed 3 times with cold 0.1m MgCl2. The pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of 0.1 m trichloroacetic acid. Cell extracts were analyzed for Rb+ by emission flame photometry in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer AA100 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transport activity is expressed as μmol of Rb+ uptake per million cells in 10 min. Jurkat cells were treated in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml of an anti-Fas antibody, harvested at the indicated times, and washed once in cold PBS. Protein extracts for each sample were prepared by resuspending the cells in a chilled lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. After 15 min of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was collected and assayed for protein concentration by the method of Bradford using the Bio-Rad system. 20–50 μg of protein per sample equally diluted in Laemmli loading buffer and denatured for 5 min were examined by gel electrophoresis at 120 V for 2 h using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). The gels were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at 42 V for 1.5 h and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to verify the equal amount and quality of protein between lanes prior to Western blotting. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween (Sigma) and 5% nonfat dried milk. Monoclonal anti-Na+/K+recognizing human α and β isoforms (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) and monoclonal anti-caspase-8 (Calbiochem) were diluted 1:250 in TBS, 0.05% Tween, 0.5% milk and membranes were blotted with the correspondent antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed 3 times with TBS, 0.05% Tween and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:5000 in TBS, 0.05% Tween, 0.5% milk. Following washes with TBS, membranes were treated with ECL chemiluminescence detection system, exposed to hyperfilm (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and developed. The maintenance of a homeostatic balance of intracellular and extracellular ions is crucial for cell survival. Alterations in this ionic balance can signal a cell to divide, differentiate, or even to undergo cell death. We have previously shown that a dramatic loss of intracellular ions, particularly sodium and potassium, is associated with the shrinkage of cells during apoptosis, thus altering the intracellular environment and permitting nuclease activity and effector caspase activation (6Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 7Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In this study, we were interested in determining if a change in monovalent cations could be detected in response to apoptotic stimulation, prior to cell shrinkage. Thus, we analyzed Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas for changes in intracellular sodium using the sodium-binding fluorescent indicator SBFI-AM (Na+) (6Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of Jurkat cells treated with an anti-Fas antibody showed a time-dependent increase in a population of cells that had an increase in intracellular sodium, which occurred prior to the loss of membrane integrity (Fig.1). Interestingly, we failed to detect any change in intracellular potassium in these cells (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesized that this increase in intracellular sodium may be reflected in a change in the plasma membrane potential. We initially used the plasma membrane-specific dye, DiBAC4(3), to examine apoptotic cells for changes in their PMP at the single cell level by flow cytometry. DiBAC4(3) is an anionic oxonal dye that responds with an increase in fluorescent intensity at 530 nm upon membrane depolarization. We determined the utility of this membrane potential dye in our model system, Jurkat T-cells, by analyzing cells for acute changes in their PMP. Jurkat cell were depolarized with increasing concentrations of extracellular KCl. In the presence of DiBAC4(3), these KCl-treated Jurkat cells responded with a stepwise increase in DiBAC4(3) fluorescence, indicating cellular depolarization (Fig.2). To determine the specificity of this dye to measure changes specific to the PMP, we examined the response of DiBAC4(3) to acute changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by using various concentrations of the protonophore CCCP to collapse the membrane potential of these organelles. We have previously shown that the concentrations of CCCP used in this study were effective in uncoupling the MMP when either JC-1, a mitochondrial membrane specific dye, or DiOC6(3), a dye which responds to both changes in the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potential, were used to access changes in the MMP (27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (21952): 21953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results shown for acute plasma membrane depolarization, DiBAC4(3) did not respond to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential indicating a distinct ability of DiBAC4(3) to measure strictly changes in the PMP (Fig. 2). To determine whether changes in the PMP occur during apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with an anti-Fas antibody, the calcium ionophoreA23187, or thapsigargin, all known apoptotic agents that differ in their mode of cell death activation (27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (21952): 21953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Under each apoptotic condition, a population of cells with an increase in DiBAC4(3) fluorescence, indicating plasma membrane depolarization, was observed in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the observed cellular depolarization was not a transient event, as might occur in electrically excitable cells, but rather was sustained, as the population of cells with increased DiBAC4(3) fluorescence increased over time. This sustained cellular depolarization suggests that upon apoptotic stimulation, the ability of cells to repolarize is lost, thus maintaining a constant state of depolarization throughout the cell death process. In addition to the time-dependent nature of this cellular depolarization observed during cell death, we determined that this event was also sensitive to the concentration of apoptotic stimulus employed. Increasing concentrations of anti-Fas antibody added to Jurkat cells 3 h prior to flow cytometric examination in the presence of DiBAC4(3) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the number of cells with increased DiBAC4(3) fluorescence (Fig. 4 A), thus indicating that cellular depolarization is intrinsically linked to the degree of apoptotic stimulation. The onset of plasma membrane depolarization is rapid, occurring between 1 and 2 h after stimulation with anti-Fas (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Response of DiBAC4(3) to measure changes in the plasma membrane potential upon increasing concentrations of anti-Fas antibody after 3 h. A, Jurkat cells treated with 10, 25, 50, or 100 ng/ml anti-Fas were incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere for 2.5 h. At this time, DiBAC4(3) was added to 1 ml of cells to a final concentration of 150 ng/ml, and incubation was continued at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere for an additional 30 min. Flow cytometric analysis showed an increase in DiBAC4(3) fluorescence, indicating cellular depolarization occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. The bar graph shows the results of 3 independent experiments ± S.E.B, a time course of Jurkat cells treated with 50 ng/ml anti-Fas in the presence of DiBAC4(3) showed a rapid, time-dependent increase in the number of depolarized cells.

Thus, we determined if cellular depolarization was also restricted to the shrunken apoptotic cells or if it occurred prior to the loss of cell volume. Flow cytometry, which permits the simultaneous examination of multiple cellular characteristics at the single cell level, was used to determine the relationship between cellular depolarization and cell size by examining DiBAC4(3) fluorescence and the forward light scattering property of the cell, respectively. When control Jurkat cells were examined on a forward-scatter versus side-scatter dot plot in the presence of DiBAC4(3), a single major population of cells was observed (Fig. 5). Gating on this single population of cells, we examined these cells on a forward-scatterversus a DiBAC4(3) fluorescence contour plot. Analysis of these control Jurkat cells showed only a single level of DiBAC4(3) fluorescence. In contrast, gating on the minor population of cells with a decrease in forward-scattered light in the control sample, denoting cells with a decreased cell size, showed that the shrunken cells had an increase in DiBAC4(3) fluorescence or a depolarized plasma membrane (Fig. 5)."

We show that prospero is controlled by signals from the EGF receptor DER and the Sevenless receptor. A direct link is established between DER activation of a transcription enhancer in prospero and binding of two transcription factors that are targets of DER signaling. Binding of the cell-specific Lozenge protein is also required for activation, and overlapping Lozenge protein distribution and DER signaling establishes expression in a subset of equivalent cells competent to respond to Sevenless. We show that Sevenless activates prospero independent of the enhancer and involves targeted degradation of Tramtrack, a transcription repressor."

Using a 10-year data series accumulated since Hurricane Joan struck the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua in 1988, we examined the pattern of species accumulation over time and with increased sampling of individuals. Our analysis shows that the pattern after a hurricane differs from the pattern after a simple tree-fall disturbance, and we conclude that pioneers are limited in large disturbances and thus do not suppress other species the way they do in smaller disturbances."

The E3-10.4K and 14.5K gene products are known to modulate the death receptor Fas. In this study, we demonstrate that an additional viral E3 protein, 6.7K, functions in the specific modulation of the two death receptors for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The 6.7K protein is expressed on the cell surface and forms a complex with the 10.4K and 14.5K proteins, and this complex is sufficient to induce down-modulation of TRAIL receptor-1 and -2 from the cell surface and reverse the sensitivity of infected cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Down-modulation of TRAIL-R2 by the E3 complex is dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, but the death domain alone is not sufficient. These results identify a mechanism for viral modulation of TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis and suggest the E3 protein complex has evolved to regulate the signaling of selected cytokine receptors.

These strategies include blocking cellular apoptosis at critical junctions in the death-signaling cascade, suppressing the interferon response, and inhibiting presentation of viral antigens (reviewed in Refs. 1Mahr J.A.

Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 337-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The E3 region of the adenovirus genome contains seven expressed open reading frames, most of which encode proteins with immunomodulatory functions, and viral deletion mutants lacking E3 genes induce stronger pro-inflammatory responses in animal models (3Sparer T.E.

Although the E3 region is dispensable for viral replication in tissue culture, emerging data reveal that several E3 genes are involved in the evasion of host immune defenses. Uncovering the mechanism by which E3 genes temper host immune responses could lead to the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies. The E3-10.4K and 14.5K open reading frames encode type 1 transmembrane glycoproteins that form a heteromeric complex (4Stewart A.R. Tollefson A.E. Krajcsi P. Yei S.P. Wold W.S. J.

More recently, the E3-10.4K/14.5K complex has been shown to mediate the down-regulation of cell surface Fas (8Shisler J. Yang C. Walter B. Ware C. Gooding L. J.

Other members of the TNFR family, such as the LTβR and TNFR1 were not modulated by the 10.4K/14.5K complex. Loss of cell surface Fas results in the desensitization of virus-infected cells to apoptosis induced by Fas signaling, thus counteracting a key defense pathway of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. It is not clear whether the targeting of both EGF-R and Fas, which show no primary sequence homology, reflects independent or linked functions of the E3-10.4K/14.5K complex. This issue of receptor specificity exhibited by the E3 protein complex prompted us to address whether additional death domain-containing receptors in the TNFR family are targeted by adenovirus. Cell surface receptors for the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are members of the TNFR superfamily, and currently four membrane-anchored TRAIL receptors have been described (reviewed in Refs. 11Ashkenazi A.

Additionally, TRAIL has been implicated in both CTL and NK cell killing of target cells (21Johnsen A.C. Haux J. Steinkjer B. Nonstad U. Egeberg K. Sundan A. Ashkenazi A. Espevik T.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 2195-2200PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for this cytokine in the innate response to viral pathogens. Here we report that adenovirus infection results in the down-regulation of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 from the cell surface causing desensitization of infected cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. The E3-6.7K protein (24Wilson-Rawls J. Saha S.K. Krajesi P. Tollefson A.E. Gooding L.R. Wold W.S. Virology. 1990; 178: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,25Wilson-Rawls J. Wold W.S. Virology. 1993; 195: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is required in addition to the E3-10.4K/14.5K proteins for TRAIL receptor down-regulation. These results identify a strategy for viral modulation of TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis and suggest the E3 trimolecular complex has evolved to regulate the signaling of selected cytokine receptors. HT29.14S cells are a human colon adenocarcinoma line that are sensitive to the death inducing activities of TNF-related ligands (26Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D.A. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 293T-Fas cells were generated by transfecting a Fas expression vector into 293T cells (from ATCC), and drug selecting cells that stably expressed a “noncytotoxic” level of Fas on their surface (provided by P. Schneider and J. Tschopp). HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC. Primary small airway epithelial and normal human bronchial epithelial cell lines were acquired from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were propagated in the company's recommended medium. All other cell lines were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 mmglutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). All viruses used in these experiments have been described in detail previously (27Wold W.S. Deutscher S.I. Takemori N. Bhat B.M. Virology. 1986; 148: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Brady H.A. Wold W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15 (2416): 9397Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and were kind gifts of W. Wold (St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, rec700 is a recombinant Ad5 subtype virus containing the Ad2 10.4K protein (Eco RI-D fragment, map position 73–86) and the Ad5 14.5K and 14.7K proteins. All viral deletion mutants were generated from this parent recombinant “wild-type” virus. dl752 lacks the first 5 amino acids of the 10.4K protein; dl759 deletes the N-terminal 103 amino acids of 14.5K resulting in a nonfunctional 10.4K/14.5K fusion protein; dl762 is deleted for 14.7K but expresses wild-type levels of 10.4K/14.5K, and dl799 is deleted for both 10.4K and 14.5K. For production of anti-TRAIL-R1, -R2, and -R3 antibodies, a custom antibody production service was utilized (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Rabbits were immunized with TRAIL-R1:Fc, TRAIL-R2:Fc, and TRAIL-R3:Fc (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). For antibody purification, the various TRAIL receptors were coupled to HighTrap NHS-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fc-specific antibodies were first depleted by repeated passage over human IgG1-agarose (Sigma). TRAIL-R1, -R2, and -R3 specific antibodies were then purified on TRAIL-R1(R2 and R3)-Fc-Sepharose, eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 2.7, neutralized with citrate NaOH, pH 9, and dialyzed against PBS. The anti-10.4K polyclonal antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide corresponding to amino acids 60–91 of Ad2–10.4K. Total IgG was purified from crude rabbit serum using protein G-Sepharose, eluted in 50 mm glycine, pH 3.0, neutralized with Tris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against PBS. The anti-TRAIL-R4 goat polyclonal antibody was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). FLAG-tagged FasL and TRAIL were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA); the anti-EGF-R antibody (clone Ab-1) was from Calbiochem (Cambridge, MA); the anti-Fas antibody (clone DX2) was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), and the anti-FLAG and anti-VSV antibody were obtained from Sigma. The pBluescriptII-Ad2E3 region plasmid (Ad2-E3) has been described previously (9Elsing A. Burgert H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift from Hans-Gerhard Burgert (Max Von Pettenkofer-Institut, Munich, Germany). The E3-10.4K expression plasmid was generated by excising the Ad2 10.4K coding sequence from pMAM-10.4K (gift of W. Wold) with Sal I and ligating the fragment into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cut with Xho I. The E3-14.5K expression plasmid was generated by amplifying the 14.5K coding sequence from isolated Ad5 genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) (primers, 5′-ggactatagctgatcttctc-3′ and 5′-cgggatccatccaattctagatctag-3′), digesting with Bam HI and Eco RI, and ligating the fragment into pcDNA3.1(−). FLAG-14.5K was generated by amplification of the mature 14.5K coding sequence from E3-14.5K (primers, 5′-acgtgaattcccgacctccaagcctcaa-3′ and 5′acgtgaattcctatcagtcatctcctcctg-3′) with Pfu polymerase. The amplified PCR product was cut with Eco RI and ligated into PS497 (provided by F. Martinon and J. Tschöpp), an engineered PCRIII (Invitrogen)-based vector containing the signal peptide from human IgG fused to an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. VSV-6.7K was constructed by amplifying the Ad2 E3-6.7K coding sequence from isolated adenoviral genomic DNA (primers, 5′-acgtgaattcagcaattcaagtaactctacaagc-3′ and 5′-acgtgaattcttatcatcttggatgttgcccccag-3′) using Pfu polymerase. The amplified PCR product was digested withEco RI and ligated into PL507, an engineered PCRIII-based vector containing an N-terminal start codon fused to the VSV epitope tag. FLAG-6.7K was generated in exactly the same manner as VSV-6.7K; however, the Eco RI-digested PCR product was ligated into PL508, an engineered PCRIII-based vector containing an N-terminal start codon fused to the FLAG epitope tag. The FLAG-tagged full-length TRAIL-R2 expression construct was generated by PCR amplification of the mature coding sequence of TRAIL-R2 (amino acids 52–440) from a PCRIII-TRAIL-R2 plasmid (16Schneider P. Bomer J.L. Thome M. Hofmann K. Holler N. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) with the addition of a flanking 5′ Bam HI-FLAG sequence and a 3′ Pst I site allowing subsequent ligation into a PCRIII-derived vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing a signal peptide from the heavy chain of human IgG (PS089). The TRAIL-R2ΔC16 construct, lacking the 16 C-terminal amino acids, was derived from the full-length FLAG-TRAIL-R2 construct by PCR amplification using the primers 5-ctgcagctagctcaacaagtggtc-3′ and T7. The resulting product was subcloned as a Bam HI-Pst I fragment in PS089. The TRAIL-R2ΔDD deletion mutant (ΔLeu348–Ser424) was generated using a dual stage PCR approach. In the first PCR round, two overlapping fragments corresponding to the 5′ end and 3′ end of TRAIL-R2 devoid of the DD sequence were amplified using the primers 5′-caccaaattgtcctcagcccc-3′and T7 for the 5′ fragment and 5′-tttgcagactctggaaagttcatg-3′ and sp6 for the 3′ end fragment. The two PCR products obtained were allowed to anneal and were re-amplified using sp6 and T7 to generate FLAG-TRAIL-R2ΔDD, which was subcloned as a Bam HI-Pst I fragment in PS089. TRAIL-R2:GPI was obtained by sub-cloning the sequence of the 5 TAPE tandem repeats of human TRAIL-R3 (amino acids 157–259) as aSal I-Not I fragment in replacement of the human IgG1 Fc cassette of a TRAIL-R2:Fc construct (described in Ref. 16Schneider P. Bomer J.L. Thome M. Hofmann K. Holler N. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). pBMN-10.4K/14.5K was constructed by amplification of the E3-10.4K/14.5K coding sequence from Ad2-E3 using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-agacggatccgccatgattcctcgagttcttata-3′ and 5′- tcgtaagctttcagtcatctccacctgtcaa-3′. The amplified product was digested with Bam HI and Hin dIII and ligated into pBMN-LacZ (derived from pBABE series vectors, gift of Garry Nolan, Stanford University), and the resulting retroviral vector expresses both E3 proteins. The pBABE-6.7K plasmid was generated by amplification of the Ad2 E3-6.7K-coding sequence from isolated adenoviral genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-atgagcaattcaagtaactc-3′ and 5′-tcatcttggatgttgccc-3. The amplified product was ligated into the PCRII-Topo vector (Invitrogen). The E3-6.7K-coding sequence was then excised from PCRII-Topo with Eco RI and ligated into pBABE-puro (29Morgensstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) to generate pBABE-6.7K. pBABE-FLAG-6.7K was generated by digesting FLAG-6.7K with Sma I and Eco RV to excise the N-terminal FLAG-tagged 6.7K gene, and this fragment was ligated into Sna BI-digested pBABE-puro. The sequences of all constructs were verified unambiguously using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer automatic sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell viability was determined using an MTT-based assay as described previously (30Rooney I.A. Butrovich K.D. Glass A.A. Borboroglu S. Benedict C.A. Whitbeck J.C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14307-14315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For adenovirus infection, cells were infected at a m.o.i. of ∼30 in 100-μl volume; virus was allowed to preadsorb for 60 min, and then 100 μl of media containing cytokine (FLAG-tagged FasL or TRAIL), 80 units/ml human interferon-γ, and 20 μg/ml cytosine 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) (Sigma) were added (13Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). One μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody was added to wells containing FasL (2 μg/ml for TRAIL-containing wells) to enhance the activity of the FLAG-tagged cytokines. Fresh Ara-C was added to wells every 12–18 h, and cell viability was determined with MTT 48 h after infection. All cytokine concentrations were performed in triplicate, and error bars represent standard deviations. Retrovirally transduced cells (5 × 103) were assayed for viability with MTT 72 h after addition of cytokines. Fold differences in sensitivity to TRAIL and FasL mediated killing were determined using IC50 concentrations of cytokine calculated from cell viability plots. Retroviral vectors were generated as described previously (31Benedict C.A. Tun R.Y.M. Rubinstein D.B. Guillaume T. Cannon P.M. Anderson W.F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) based on the method of Soneoka et al. (32Soneoka Y. Cannon P.M. Ramsdale E.E. Griffiths J.C. Romano G. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) and were pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G). HT29.14S cells (1.5 × 105) were transduced multiple times in vector supernatant containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene. The volume of vector supernatant was kept constant for all wells by the addition of growth medium. Retroviral vector titers were ∼1–2 × 107 colony-forming units/ml when determined on HT29.14S cells, and transduction efficiency was >99% as gauged by resistance to puromycin (pBABE-6.7K) or staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (pBMN-LacZ virus made in parallel). Cells were harvested for analysis by FACS or plating into 96-well dishes for killing assays ∼48 h after transduction. HT29.14S and SAEC were infected with adenovirus at a m.o.i. ∼30, and cells were detached from plastic with 5 mm EDTA in PBS 18 h after infection. Cells were resuspended in FACS binding buffer (PBS + 2% fetal bovine serum + 0.02% sodium azide), and 1 × 105 cells were used for each staining. Cells were incubated in 50 μl of FACS buffer plus appropriate antibodies (all antibodies used at 10 μg/ml) for 1 h, at which time cells were washed and incubated in either goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 (for detection of TRAIL-R1, R2 or R3), goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (for detection of Fas and EGF-R), or biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG followed by streptavidin (for TRAIL-R4). All secondary detection reagents were conjugated to R-phycoerythrin and were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), and each histogram represents 5 × 103 cells gated on forward and side-angle light scatter. HT29.14S cells transduced with retroviral vectors were analyzed by the same methods. In all presented figures, dotted histograms represent either isotype control antibody (Fas and EGF-R) or goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 (TRAIL receptors) staining as a negative control. 293T-Fas and 293T cells were transfected by the CaPO4precipitation method as described previously (33Benedict C. Butrovich K. Lurain N. Corbeil J. Rooney I. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Ware C. J. Immunol. 1999; 126: 6967-6970Google Scholar). Two μg of E3-10.4K and E3-14.5K expression plasmid (4 μg of Ad2 E3 plasmid) were used to examine the down-regulation of endogenously expressed receptor in 293T-Fas cells (Fig. 4). For analysis of E3-6.7K surface expression (Fig. 6), 3 μg of VSV-6.7K (or FLAG-6.7K), 1 μg of E3-10.4K, and 1 μg of E3-14.5K or 0.5 μg of FLAG-14.5K were used. For analysis of TRAIL-R2 mutants (Fig. 7), 0.1 μg of wild-type or mutant receptor plasmid was used plus or minus 3 μg of Ad2-E3 plasmid. Total DNA concentration was always kept equivalent by addition of empty vector. Cells were detached from plastic 36 h after transfection for analysis by FACS as described above.Figure 6TRAIL-R2 down-regulation by E3 proteins is dependent upon the cytoplasmic tail of the receptors. 293T cells were transfected with either wild-type TRAIL-R2 or various TRAIL-R2 mutants in the presence (gray histogram) or absence (black histogram) of the Ad2-E3 plasmid. All receptor constructs were detected using anti-FLAG antibody, except TRAIL-R2:GPI where anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7E3 proteins reduce the sensitivity of cells to FasL and TRAIL apoptosis. a, HT29.14S cells were infected with wild-type adenovirus (Rec700) or various E3 deletion mutants, and cells were tested for their sensitivity to TRAIL and FasL-mediated apoptosis using a MTT-based assay. Adenovirus mutants lacking E3-10.4K, 14.5K, or both proteins are indicated by thegray lines. b, HT29.14S cells were transduced with various retroviral vectors expressing E3 proteins and tested for sensitivity to FasL and TRAIL using an MTT assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The subcellular distribution of down-modulated receptors was analyzed by confocal imaging of immunofluorescently labeled HeLa cells. HeLa cells (3 × 105) were infected with virus at a m.o.i. of 100 in permanox chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). Twelve hours after infection, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. After washing with 0.2 m glycine, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin. The cells were then incubated in 10% donkey serum for 20 min prior to the addition of the primary antibodies. Fas was detected with murine anti-Fas (DX2) followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse Fab (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and donkey anti-goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). TRAIL-R2 was detected with rabbit anti-TRAIL-R2 polyclonal antibody followed by donkey anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The biotinylated anti-LAMP1 antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was used at a 1:8 dilution according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by detection with streptavidin-Texas Red. All primary antibodies were used at 20–25 μg/ml and secondary detection reagents were used at 2 μg/ml. The immunofluorescently labeled cells were analyzed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 (Emeryville, CA) confocal microscope using the 60 × objective. Two-color Z-series were collected in the simultaneous mode, and the overlap of green and red fluorescence was depicted by a yellow signal. The Z-sections were then projected as stacks using the Lasersharp image processing software. 293T cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes as described above using E3-10.4K (10 μg/dish), FLAG-14.5K (5 μg/dish), and VSV-6.7K (10 μg/dish). Cells were lysed 36 h after transfection (lysis buffer: 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.018 units of aprotinin), and the lysates were pre-cleared with mouse IgG (5 μg/ml) and protein G-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysates were then incubated with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma, 5 μg/ml) or anti-VSV (for analysis of total transfected VSV-6.7K) antibody and protein G beads overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 18% Tris glycine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated with anti-VSV antibody (1:5000) followed by rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Protein (VSV-6.7K) was then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Super-Signal detection kit (Pierce). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG or rabbit polyclonal anti-10.4K antibody to visualize FLAG-14.5K and 10.4K, respectively. HT29.14S cells, which have been shown previously to down-regulate cell surface Fas and EGF-R upon infection with adenovirus (8Shisler J. Yang C. Walter B. Ware C. Gooding L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8299-8306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were infected with either wild-type adenovirus (rec700) or viral deletion mutants lacking functional E3 region proteins as follows: 10.4K (dl752), 14.5K (dl759), 14.7K (dl762), or both 10.4K/14.5K (dl799). After infection, cells were analyzed by FACS for surface levels of TRAIL-R1, -R2, -R3, and -R4 as well as for Fas and EGF-R (Fig. 1 a). Infection with wild-type virus resulted in significant down-regulation of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, Fas, and EGF-R, but surface levels of TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 were not down-regulated. TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 surface levels decreased 66 and 60%, respectively, after viral infection (based on peak mean fluorescence), as compared with a 96% decrease in the levels of Fas and 88% for EGF-R. Three viral deletion mutants (dl752, dl759, and dl799) were incapable of down-regulating any receptors analyzed, indicating that the E3-10.4K/14.5K complex was necessary for TRAIL receptor down-regulation as has been shown previously for both Fas and EGF-R. By contrast, infection with a virus deleted for E3-14.7K (14.7K is encoded by various polycistronic E3-transcripts which also encode 10.4K/14.5K (34Cladras C. Bhat B.M. Wold W.S. Virology. 1985; 140: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) was similar to the effect of wild-type virus, indicating the E3-14.7K protein is not required for TRAIL receptor down-regulation. Although various studies have analyzed E3-mediated down-regulation of cell surface receptors, all these experiments have been performed using transformed human cell lines. To determine whether cell surface levels of TRAIL receptors decrease in cells that represent the normal target tissue for adenoviral infection in vivo, primary small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were infected with wild-type virus or dl799 (Fig. 1 b). Infection with wild-type virus resulted in TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 down-regulation, as well as Fas and EGF-R, from the cell surface. Notably, TRAIL receptor down-regulation in SAEC was significantly more pronounced than in HT29.14S cells. TRAIL-R1 was undetect"

To investigate its molecular mechanism, we now constructed an in vitro experimental system for observation of tubulin transport, using squid giant axons. After injecting fluorescence-labeled tubulin into the axons, we monitored the movement of fluorescence by confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Here, from the pharmacological experiments and the functional blocking of kinesin motor protein by anti-kinesin antibody, we show that the directional movement of fluorescent profile was dependent on kinesin motor function. The fluorescent correlation function and estimated translational diffusion time revealed that tubulin molecule was transported in a unique form of large transporting complex distinct from those of stable polymers or other cytosolic protein."
https://openalex.org/W2057071478,"During Drosophila oogenesis, asymmetrically localized Gurken activates the EGF receptor (Egfr) and determines dorsal follicle cell fates. Using a mosaic follicle cell system we have identified a mutation in the D-cbl gene which causes hyperactivation of the Egfr pathway. Cbl proteins are known to downregulate activated receptors. We find that the abnormal Egfr activation is ligand dependent. Our results show that the precise regulation of Egfr activity necessary to establish different follicle cell fates requires two levels of control. The localized ligand Gurken activates Egfr to different levels in different follicle cells. In addition, Egfr activity has to be repressed through the activity of D-cbl to ensure the absence of signaling in the ventral most follicle cells."

The proliferative growth of cardiac myocytes is primarily limited to fetal and early neonatal periods of development (1Zak R. Growth of the Heart in Health and Disease. Raven Press, New York1984: 140-150Google Scholar). Postnatal maturation of cardiac myocytes is marked by cellular hypertrophy and is also accompanied by ventricular remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment, such as extracellular matrix formation and coronary angiogenesis (2Anversa P. Olivetti G. Loud A.V. Circ. Res. 1980; 46: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The signals that coordinate these processes in cardiac muscle are not well understood, but several growth factors and hormones have been shown to influence heart development (3Engelmann G.L.

Complex cellular responses, such as proliferation and differentiation, are frequently modulated by external stimuli. Intracellular signaling cascades, in turn, act as mediators to translate the stimulus into transcriptional activity. A large family of receptors involved in a broad spectrum of cell signaling is the G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane (TM7)1receptor (GPCR) family. This family of molecules mediates signals from hormones, cytokines, light, and odorants (10Watson S.P. Arkinstall S. The G-protein Linked Receptor Factsbook. Academic Press, London1994: 1-291Google Scholar). GPCRs, activated by humoral, endothelial, or platelet-derived factors, are also able to stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (11Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J.

GPCRs have a common topology characterized by an extracellular N terminus, seven membrane-spanning helices flanked by a cytoplasmic tail. A group of receptors that shares homology in the heptahelical region and activated by peptide hormones is the secretin receptor family (13Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J.

Recently, a subfamily of secretins has emerged that exhibit cell-surface interaction and cell adhesion modules in unusually large extracellular domains (15McKnight A.J. Gordon S. J.

This novel subtype of GPCRs consists of a small number of EGF-TM7 receptors such as EMR1, a receptor of neuroectodermal origin (20Baud V. Chissoe S.L. Viegas-Pequignot E. Diriong S. N′Guyen V.C. Roe B.A. Lipinski M. Genomics. 1995; 26: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), its mouse homolog, F4/80 (21McKnight A.J. Macfarlane A.J. Dri P. Turley L. Willis A.C. Gordon S. J. Biol.

Hoovers J.M. Hartmann E. Strauss M. van Lier R.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1942-1950PubMed Google Scholar). All three receptors contain EGF modules and mucin-like domains in the N terminus. The recently discovered Celsr1 gene also belongs to the EGF-TM7 group. In addition to EGF repeats, Celsr1 contains cadherin and laminin type repeats (16Hadjantonakis A.K. Sheward W.J.

In an effort to pinpoint the stimuli and signal transduction machinery that regulate the transition of myocyte from hyperplasia to hypertrophy, coronary capillary formation, and extracellular matrix deposition in the mammalian heart, we conducted differential display analysis on mRNAs using fetal and adult cardiomyocytes. As a result, we have identified a new member of the EGF-TM7 receptor family named ETL (forEGF-TM7-latrophilin-related protein). The large extracellular domain of rat ETL consists of EGF modules, a Ser/Thr rich linker region, and a Cys-rich proteolysis domain. A seven-transmembrane region is followed by a short cytoplasmic tail. Besides having structural homology to the EGF-TM7 family, ETL shares considerable similarity with closely related heptahelical receptors CL1 (calcium-independent receptor for latrotoxin (CIRL)/latrophilin 1), CL2, and CL3 (18Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G.

The similarity with latrophilins includes a Cys-rich domain that may direct endoproteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain. The expression of the ETL mRNA is developmentally regulated in the heart, suggesting that ETL seven-transmembrane receptors may be important in cardiac switching from fetal to adult phenotypes. Purified preparations of cardiomyocytes were generated as described (23Thorburn J. Xu S. Thorburn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Navankasattusas S.

Differential display was carried out using a RNAimage kit (GenHunter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differentially displayed bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gels and reamplified. The resultant PCR amplicons were tested for differential expression on Northern blots using whole heart poly(A+) RNA and then used as probes to screen cDNA libraries for full-length transcripts. Double-selected poly(A+) mRNAs from rat heart and total RNAs from lung were obtained using Messagemaker (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA libraries were constructed using a Superscript cDNA synthesis kit. The cDNAs were size-fractionated, adapted with linkers, ligated into ZipLox arms (Life Technologies, Inc.), and packaged using GigapackIII Gold (Stratagene). Approximately 30 clones were incorporated into the ETL cDNA contig. The GenBankTM accession number for rat ETL is AF192401, and the accession number for the type II isoform is AF192402. Clones obtained from cDNA library were sequenced and a contig was compiled using Sequencher 3.0 software. The consensus sequence was analyzed by Blast for homologies and ExPASy tools for protein motifs and patterns. Primers RP29.2A–RP29.2B, that amplify a genomic STS from human BAC RP11–29e12 (Research Genetics), were used in PCR with DNAs from medium resolution (G3) and high resolution (TGN3) radiation hybrid panels (Research Genetics). Results were analyzed using the Stanford RH mapping data bases (available on the World Wide Web). Four human-specific primer pairs were used to amplify hETL: 29.13A-B, 29.18A-11B, 29.8A-B, and 29.7A-B. The GenBankTM accession number for a partial hETL cDNA sequence is AF192403. Incorporated ESTs had the following GenBankTMaccession numbers: AA364110, W72803, H00259, AA487827, T10363,AI024874, AI024852, AA296694 (EST 112416), AA429137, AW604713, W68553,AI802994, AW204065, AI241562, AA487977, AI093076, AA370362, andAA724866. Equal amounts of RNA were run on formaldehyde gels, blotted on nylon membranes (GeneScreen) and UV-cross-linked. Membranes were stained with methylene blue for visualization of 28 and 18 S RNAs (25Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed in Express Hyb solution (CLONTECH) followed by washes and autoradiography. For normalization of poly(A+) RNAs, blots were probed with GAPDH and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The cDNA sequence corresponding to the ETL open reading frame was amplified by RT-PCR from rat heart using primers 69F50XH and 69XBB, containing 5′ restriction site overhangs. The amplified product was cloned into pBluescript, and 10 clones were sequenced. Clone 1 contained no mutations, while clone 3 harbored a T455A substitution. These were selected and subcloned in frame with Myc-His 3′ tag sequences into the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The extracellular region was amplified using primers 69F50BI and 69R45H3. The extracellular region up to the cleavage site, including Thr455, was amplified using 69F50BI and 69R46H3. PCR products were fused in frame with the Fc portion of human IgG and subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector. The Fc portion of human IgG was also amplified by PCR using the human EST clone 809684 (GenBankTM accession numberAA456339) as a template. The 1–455 aa extracellular region was also fused in frame with Myc-His 3′ tag sequences in the pcDNA 3.1 vector. 1.5 × 105 COS-7 cells were seeded into six-well dishes and transfected with constructs using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 μg of plasmid DNA purified with a Qiagen column. Proteins were harvested 48 h after transfection in 300 μl of triple detergent solution (25Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ten μl of total protein extracts and 10 μl of a protein molecular weight ladder (New England Biolabs) were heated in the presence of 1% β-mercaptoethanol and resolved in Laemmli buffer (25Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gels (Bio-Rad) or 7.5% nongradient gels with 8 m urea. Rat ETL (rETL)-Myc was visualized using mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Oncogene Research Products) and the appropriate secondary antibody for ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), followed by ECL detection, was used for ETL-Fc protein visualization. Membrane preparations were processed as described (17Abe J. Suzuki H. Notoya M. Yamamoto T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19957-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium from COS-7 cells, transiently transfected with the 1–455-Myc extracellular domain of ETL was concentrated using a Centricon-3 spin column and loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels along with total cell lysates. The transmembrane region of rat ETL was PCR-cloned into pBluescript using two primers with restriction site overhangs, TRE1A and TRH3B. Plasmid was linearized, and sense/antisense probes were synthesized using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche) and used in hybridization at 1 ng/μl. Paraffin-embedded 2-week-old rat lung and heart tissues were sectioned, 8–9 μm thick, deparaffinized in Hemo-DE, hydrated through a series of graded ethanol and water, and treated with proteinase K at 6 μg/ml for 90 min. Sections were hybridized overnight at 60 °C in a buffer containing 50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Washes were as follows: 4× SSC, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h; 5% formamide, 2× SSC, 20 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 50 °C; 1× NTE for 15 min at 37 °C. Immunological detection was performed using a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Washes consisted of 2× SSC for 5 min, 0.1× SSC for 15 min, buffer 1 (Roche) for 15 min, buffer 2 containing 20% sheep serum for 30 min. Washes were followed by incubation with anti-DIG-AP conjugate, 1:500 dilution, for 2 h. Postincubation washes were performed in buffer 1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) three times for 10 min and buffer 3 for 5 min, followed by incubation with the substrate, 1% nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in buffer 3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Development was carried out for several hours and terminated for both antisense and sense slides at the same time. Slides were counterstained in 0.5% methylene blue, washed in water and 100% butanol, dehydrated in Hemo-DE, mounted, and photographed using a Zeiss microscope. COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 104 on chamber slides, transiently transfected with an ETL-Myc expression construct, allowed to recover for 24–48 h, serum-starved for 4 h where indicated, and stained for immunofluorescence. Washed cells were fixed in Zamboni (Vector Laboratories), permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked in 1% nonfat milk. Cells were then incubated with anti-Myc antibody (Oncogene Research Products) followed by appropriate secondary IgG conjugated to biotin and Alexa-594 conjugated to streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy using a Texas Red filter or by confocal microscopy at 594-nm wavelength.

Bold ATG indicates initiating Met. To identify genes involved in heart development, we conducted a differential display of fetal and postnatal mRNAs isolated from purified cardiac myocytes using fetal, day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 12 rat hearts. Several genes were identified by RT-PCR as up-regulated or down-regulated during heart development. Here, we describe clone 69, subsequently named ETL, that is up-regulated postnatally during cardiomyocyte development (Fig.1 A). The differentially expressed PCR amplicon was subsequently excised from the polyacrylamide gel and used for Northern blot analyses. The developmentally regulated expression of rETL was confirmed on poly(A+) mRNA Northern blots from rat whole hearts, where RNAs were extracted at several developmental time points: fetal, day 1, day 3, and day 12 (Fig. 1 B). The experiments identified an increasing abundance of rETL mRNA that correlated with developmental age. The GAPDH-normalized images of rETL indicated a 4.6-fold increase in expression by day 12 and 1.9-fold increase by birth in comparison with embryonic day 16 mRNA levels. Using rat poly(A+) RNA Northern blots, we examined the expression of rETL in adult tissues. Rat ETL is abundantly expressed in heart, lung, and kidney; less evident expression is observed in brain, skeletal muscle, liver, and spleen, with the exception of testis, where no expression is detected (Fig. 1 D). Similarly, differential expression of human ETL (hETL) was evident by probing total RNA Northern blots from 3-month fetal and adult human hearts (Fig.1 C) with PCR-cloned human cDNA. Unlike rat, two messages were detected in human heart and may represent distinct isoforms of hETL. The PCR products from differential display were used to screen an adult rat heart library to generate a full-length cDNA contig. Several screens of our rat heart cDNA library yielded 30 overlapping clones. Sequence analyses revealed a cDNA sequence of 4274 bp that approximately corresponds to the size of the 4.4-kilobase mRNA observed on rat heart Northern blots (Fig. 1 B). The longest open reading frame is 2214 bp, starting with the putative initiation Met and ending with a TAA termination codon. The 3′-untranslated region is 1821 bp and contains a putative polyadenylation signal. The 5′-untranslated sequence is 235 bp and contains a stop codon preceding the open reading frame. Further analyses of cDNA clones revealed a second isoform of rETL. Several clones encompassed an in-frame insertion sequence between nucleotides 2129 and 2130. The alternatively spliced exon of 234 bp contains a TAA termination codon and leads to premature termination with a predicted peptide length of 660 aa, thereby deleting amino acids C-terminal to the fifth transmembrane domain. Homology searches with rat ETL cDNA sequences revealed several highly homologous human ESTs, mostly residing in 3′-coding and -untranslated regions. The most striking homology was observed to unordered contigs of genomic sequences of human BAC RP11–29e12 (accession number AC024326.2). The homology extends through the majority of the open reading frame, including sequences of the 3′-untranslated region. To obtain physical clones, we designed human-specific pairs of PCR primers in the regions of indicated homology and employed RT-PCR on cDNAs from human heart. Sequences of RT-PCR products and several human ESTs allowed us to identify a total of 13 exons (Table I) spanning 2689 bp. Exon 1 contains the putative translation initiation Met; however, it does not have an in-frame stop codon upstream of the Met. Exon 1a was revealed by a high homology to the rat protein, yet is it spliced out in several tissues we examined and in EST 112416. Exon 13 carries a conserved translational stop codon and 3′-untranslated region sequences. Pairwise comparisons of human ETL cDNA sequence and predicted peptide sequence against the rat homolog indicated 80% identity at the nucleotide and 87% similarity at the amino acid level. In obtained 3′-untranslated region sequences, 234 bp show striking interspecies identity (87%). This untranslated region is located ∼200 bp from the conserved stop codon and potentially represents a regulatory element for mRNA expression or stabililty.Table IExons of human ETL are contained within three contigs of BAC RP11–29e12Exon no.1-a13 exons span 2689 nucleotides, excluding exon 1a.SizeSplice acceptorSplice donorIntron size1-bIntron sizes were determined precisely only for exons contained within one contig.Exon location1-cExon location is shown in genomic sequences of BAC RP11 29e12.

Open table in a new tab Using 29.2A-2B primers, we amplified a genomic STS from BAC RP11–29e12 and DNAs from medium and high resolution Radiation Hybrid panels (Research Genetics). We linked hETL to two chromosome 1 markers, SHGC-21318 within 8 centirays and to SHGC-57820 within 15 centirays with LOD scores of 8 and 11, respectively (data not shown). These markers, although not ordered on the chromosome 1 map, are tightly linked to the D1S500, a GDB locus located on the 1p32-p33 band of chromosome 1 (26Bray-Ward P. Menninger J. Lieman J. Desai T. Mokady N. Banks A. Ward D.C. Genomics. 1996; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A genomic clone containing mouse ETL, BAC 322E17, was mapped by fluorescentin situ hybridization analysis on mouse chromosome 3, H3-H4. 2T. Nechiporuk, unpublished observation. This mouse genomic region is syntenic with human chromosome 1p32-p33. The novel rETL cDNA sequence codes for a 738-amino acid protein. The molecular masses of the deduced ETL precursor and mature peptides are 82.5 and 80.3 kDa. As determined by hydropathy and motif analyses, rETL peptide consists of three regions: a large extracellular domain of 481 aa, a seven-transmembrane region of 231 aa, and a short intracellular cytoplasmic tail of 26 aa (Fig. 2). The N-terminal region begins with a 19-aa signal peptide, followed by a short domain (∼26 aa) related to a lectin-type domain (27Ozeki Y. Matsui T. Suzuki M. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2391-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), one EGF-like domain, and two identical Ca2+-binding EGF domains (∼91 aa). A Ser/Thr-rich linker region of ∼297 aa follows the EGF domains and precedes a conserved Cys-rich proteolysis domain (∼50 aa). The latter has recently been described in a small number of transmembrane proteins and is also referred to as the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) (19Sugita S. Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2114269227,"Mechanisms of fulminant gene induction during an inflammatory response were investigated using expression of the chemoattractant cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a model. Recently we found that coordinate activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is required for strong IL-8 transcription, whereas the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway stabilizes the IL-8 mRNA. It is unclear how these pathways are coupled to the receptor for IL-1, an important physiological inducer of IL-8. Expression of the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) TAK1 together with its coactivator TAB1 in HeLa cells activated all three pathways and was sufficient to induce IL-8 formation, NF-κB + JNK2-mediated transcription from a minimal IL-8 promoter, and p38 MAPK-mediated stabilization of a reporter mRNA containing IL-8-derived regulatory mRNA sequences. Expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TAK1 largely blocked IL-1-induced transcription and mRNA stabilization, as well as formation of endogenous IL-8. Truncated TAB1, lacking the TAK1 binding domain, or a TAK1-derived peptide containing a TAK1 autoinhibitory domain were also efficient in inhibition. These data indicate that the previously described three-pathway model of IL-8 induction is operative in response to a physiological stimulus, IL-1, and that the MAPKKK TAK1 couples the IL-1 receptor to both transcriptional and RNA-targeted mechanisms mediated by the three pathways. Mechanisms of fulminant gene induction during an inflammatory response were investigated using expression of the chemoattractant cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a model. Recently we found that coordinate activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is required for strong IL-8 transcription, whereas the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway stabilizes the IL-8 mRNA. It is unclear how these pathways are coupled to the receptor for IL-1, an important physiological inducer of IL-8. Expression of the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) TAK1 together with its coactivator TAB1 in HeLa cells activated all three pathways and was sufficient to induce IL-8 formation, NF-κB + JNK2-mediated transcription from a minimal IL-8 promoter, and p38 MAPK-mediated stabilization of a reporter mRNA containing IL-8-derived regulatory mRNA sequences. Expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TAK1 largely blocked IL-1-induced transcription and mRNA stabilization, as well as formation of endogenous IL-8. Truncated TAB1, lacking the TAK1 binding domain, or a TAK1-derived peptide containing a TAK1 autoinhibitory domain were also efficient in inhibition. These data indicate that the previously described three-pathway model of IL-8 induction is operative in response to a physiological stimulus, IL-1, and that the MAPKKK TAK1 couples the IL-1 receptor to both transcriptional and RNA-targeted mechanisms mediated by the three pathways. interleukin-1 electrophoretic mobility shift assay hemagglutinin immunoprecipitation c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase MAPKK kinase relative light units tumor necrosis factor TAK binding protein glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis green fluorescent protein The proinflammatory cytokine IL-11 mediates its effects primarily by reprogramming gene expression in inflamed tissues. It is therefore likely that clarifying the molecular mechanisms of IL-1-induced gene expression will yield novel molecular targets for anti-inflammatory therapy (1Dinarello C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the many genes induced by IL-1 are those of chemokines, such as IL-8 (2Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Blockade of IL-1 receptors by application of the IL-1 receptor antagonist consistently reduces tissue-neutrophilia in a variety of disease models presumably by preventing IL-1-induced synthesis of IL-8 and related chemokines (reviewed in Ref. 1Dinarello C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus illustrating the pathophysiological importance of IL-1-induced expression of these genes.IL-1 receptors have been molecularly cloned and are ubiquitously expressed. Binding of IL-1 to the cell surface results in formation of an IL-1 receptor complex consisting of the type I IL-1 receptor, the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, MyD88, TRAF6, and the protein kinase IRAK. TRAF6 couples the receptor complex to the I-κB kinase pathway, resulting in the release of I-κB from NF-κB and nuclear translocation of the latter (3Martin M.U. Falk W. Eur.

Furthermore, IL-1 activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways (5Kracht M. Truong O. Totty N.F. Shiroo M. Saklatvala J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2017-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,6Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). These MAP kinases are activated by dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs). JNKs are activated by MKK7, whereas p38 MAPKs are activated by MKK3 and -6. Additionally, MKK4 activates both JNK and p38 MAPK (7Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar, 8Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar).MAPKKs require phosphorylation in the conserved kinase domain VIII for activation. This is achieved by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK). To date, a remarkably large group of distinct enzymes has been shown to fulfill this function, comprising Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf, Mos, NIK, MEKK1–4, MLK2, MLK3, DLK/MUK, ASK1, Tpl-2/Cot, and TAK1 (8Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways can be activated by ectopically expressed MEKK1–4, MLK2, MLK3, DLK/MUK, ASK1, Tpl-2/Cot, and TAK1, albeit to varying degrees (7Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc.

Moreover, it is becoming increasingly evident that most of these MAPKKKs also directly activate the I-κB kinase/NF-κB signaling pathway in parallel, as demonstrated for MEKK1–3 (9Lee F.S. Hagler J.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, MAPKKKs exist that, like NIK, only activate NF-κB, but not JNK and p38 MAPK (17Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 18Malinin N.L.

It is also unclear if different stimuli use the same MAPKKK for a particular biological response. IL-1 shares many biological responses with the other major proinflammatory cytokine TNF (1Dinarello C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactive mutants of NIK, MEKK1, ASK, and TAK1 suppressed TNF-dependent NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK activation, suggesting a role for these MAPKKKs in biological responses to TNF (9Lee F.S. Hagler J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, for IL-1, similar information is limited to NIK and TAK1 mutants (18Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). An important question, therefore, that is yet to be answered is which MAPKKKs are physiologically involved in IL-1-induced gene expression. Changes in enzymatic activity of endogenous MAPKKKs in immunoprecipitation experiments have proven difficult to detect (25Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recently, however, endogenous TAK1 was shown to be activated by IL-1 as well as by TNF (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 26Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K.

In that context it is interesting to note that TAK1 was originally found to function in signaling of transforming growth factor-β (15Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys.

Recently, it was shown that TAK1 and TAB1 associate with the adapter molecule TRAF6 of the IL-1 receptor complex in an IL-1-dependent fashion (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar).IL-8 induction represents an important (patho)physiological response to IL-1. IL-8 gene regulation is under complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, involving AP-1, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and NF-κB binding sites and AU-rich mRNA regions as cis-elements, respectively (17Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 34Winzen R.

We have recently shown by expressing active forms of NIK, MKK7, and MKK6 that IL-8 transcription is controlled by the coordinated action of NF-κB and JNK pathways, whereas IL-8 mRNA degradation is regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway (17Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 34Winzen R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar).Based on the above evidence for a role of TAK1 in IL-1 signaling we set up experiments to investigate the role of TAK1 in IL-1-inducedIL-8 gene expression.DISCUSSIONStudying induction of IL-8 as an example for highly inducible gene expression, we have recently developed a model in which formation of large amounts of IL-8 requires the coordinated activation of at least three signaling pathways. First, activation of NF-κB alone was able to induce IL-8 transcription and secretion, but only to very low levels. Second, selective activation of the JNK pathway by expression of active mutants of MKK7 also induced low levels of IL-8 secretion and transcription (17Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Activation of the JNK pathway is necessary for triggering IL-8 synthesis by its physiological inducer IL-1, because inhibition of that pathway by dominant negative JNK or its antisense mRNA strongly suppressed IL-1-induced IL-8 mRNA and protein expression (40Krause A. Holtmann H. Eickemeier S. Winzen R. Szamel M. Resch K. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23681-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The NF-κB and JNK pathways markedly synergized on the transcriptional level and required intact AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites in the IL-8 promoter (17Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Third, selective triggering of the p38 MAPK pathway by MKK6 stabilized IL-8 mRNA, and IL-1 induced mRNA stabilization in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner (17Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 34Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Müller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We now confirm and extend this model by demonstrating that IL-1 induces both transcription and mRNA stabilization through the MAPKKK TAK1 (Fig.9).TAK1, together with its coactivator TAB1, activated in parallel the NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways in HeLa cells and induced transcription from a minimal IL-8 promoter. The latter effect was inhibited by dominant negative JNK2 and required intact NF-κB and AP-1 sites. Thus TAB1-TAK1 activates transcription in a way suggested by us previously, namely through the coordinate function of both the NF-κB and JNK pathways. TAB1-TAK1 overexpression also induced mRNA stabilization. Although this effect was unaffected by dominant negative JNK2, it was largely abrogated by a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK.Although the p38 MAPK pathway is capable of activating transcription by phosphorylation of several transcription factors (8Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), the dominant negative p38 MAPK mutant was devoid of any effect on TAK1-induced IL-8 transcription. The striking selectivity of effects of TAK1-activated JNK on IL-8 transcription and TAK1-activated p38 MAPK on IL-8 mRNA stabilization may be achieved by binding of the two MAPKs to specific scaffold proteins. Recently, three different scaffold protein families involved in JNK activation have been identified in mammalian cells,i.e. JIP1–3, JSAP1, and JNKBP1 (41Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In yeast, scaffold proteins have been described also for the p38 MAPK homolog HOG1 (44Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It appears that the FUS3 and HOG1 MAPK modules in yeast are activated by the same MAPKKK, Ste11, but are routed to distinct functions by different adapter proteins (8Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 44Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Our observations may therefore be explained by the formation of specific signaling complexes, which direct the cellular function of JNK and p38 MAPK in the IL-1-TAK1 signaling pathway toward transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization, respectively.IL-1 is an important physiological inducer of IL-8 formation. It simultaneously activates the NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. A number of different MAPKKKs have emerged as candidate molecules that serve as upstream activators of the JNK, p38, and NF-κB pathways. Very little information exists, however, that makes it possible to distinguish between the following hypothetical situations: 1) in response to a given stimulus several different MAPKKKs are activated and function in a promiscuous manner; 2) different MAPKKKs in a given setting activate distinct pathways selectively, implying a signal bifurcation point upstream of them; or 3) one MAPKKK species is activated and in turn activates the different downstream pathways, thus itself representing the bifurcation point.Evidence supporting the latter model was obtained by investigating the involvement of TAK1 in IL-1-induced expression of IL-8. First we found that IL-1-induced activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways was blocked by a kinase-inactive mutant of TAK1, thus confirming previous results (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutant also blocked IL-1-induced activation of p38 MAPK. So far, no function has been demonstrated for TAK1-activated NF-κB, JNK, or p38 MAPK signaling pathways in IL-1-dependent cellular responses. As shown here, IL-1-induced transcriptional activation was blocked by the kinase-inactive TAK1 mutant, strongly suggesting a sequence of events involving the IL-1 receptor complex, TAK1 and JNK + NF-κB activation. The kinase-inactive form of TAK1 also inhibited IL-1-induced, p38 MAPK-dependent mRNA stabilization. Thus for both kinds of effects on gene expression, IL-1 appears to utilize the TAK1 MAPKKK.Several other MAPKKKs that activate NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK may be involved in IL-1 or TNF signaling (9Lee F.S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because the inactive TAK1 mutant could possibly interfere with signaling in a nonspecific way, i.e. by competing with those MAPKKKs through its interaction with common downstream targets, we sought to apply more specific inhibitors. TAK1 activation requires a protein-protein interaction with the TAB1 molecule (33Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Available knowledge indicates that, within the group of MAPKKK enzymes, this mode of activation is unique for TAK1. In support of this, TAB1 has not been reported to bind to and activate other MAPKKKs. Mapping of the regions in TAK1 and TAB1 that are required for this interaction showed that a region within the first 303 amino acids of TAK1 binds to the C terminus of TAB1, which contains a region homologous to the serine-rich N terminus of TAK1 (33Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Because deletion of the N-terminal 22 amino acids yields an activated form of TAK1 (29Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), it can be speculated that the N terminus exerts an autoinhibitory interaction with the same region in the TAK1 molecule that also binds TAB1. Binding of the N terminus would render the wild type TAK1 kinase inactive. TAB1 would activate TAK1 by dislodging the N terminus (and possibly exerting a stimulatory effect). The two mutants expected to act in a dominant negative fashion accordingly, the N-terminal TAK1 peptide and the C-terminally truncated TAB1, both effectively inhibited IL-1-induced IL-8 transcription. Therefore the results are indicative of a specific recruitment of TAK1 by the IL-1 receptor complex and suggest that IL-1-induced downstream effects are dependent on TAB1-mediated TAK1 activation.Taken together the evidence presented in this study assigns a central role for IL-1-induced IL-8 formation in HeLa cells to the TAB1 and TAK1 molecules. Further proof will have to await the results of chemokine expression in mice deficient of TAB1 and TAK1. It will also be important to find out if this model holds true for other human cell types, stimuli, and induced genes. That information will shed light on the suitability of TAK1 and its coactivator TAB1 as targets for interference with gene induction by inflammatory stimuli. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-11 mediates its effects primarily by reprogramming gene expression in inflamed tissues. It is therefore likely that clarifying the molecular mechanisms of IL-1-induced gene expression will yield novel molecular targets for anti-inflammatory therapy (1Dinarello C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the many genes induced by IL-1 are those of chemokines, such as IL-8 (2Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I.

Blockade of IL-1 receptors by application of the IL-1 receptor antagonist consistently reduces tissue-neutrophilia in a variety of disease models presumably by preventing IL-1-induced synthesis of IL-8 and related chemokines (reviewed in Ref. 1Dinarello C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus illustrating the pathophysiological importance of IL-1-induced expression of these genes. IL-1 receptors have been molecularly cloned and are ubiquitously expressed. Binding of IL-1 to the cell surface results in formation of an IL-1 receptor complex consisting of the type I IL-1 receptor, the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, MyD88, TRAF6, and the protein kinase IRAK. TRAF6 couples the receptor complex to the I-κB kinase pathway, resulting in the release of I-κB from NF-κB and nuclear translocation of the latter (3Martin M.U. Falk W. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 5-17PubMed Google Scholar, 4O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-1 activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways (5Kracht M. Truong O. Totty N.F. Shiroo M. Saklatvala J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2017-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,6Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). These MAP kinases are activated by dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs). JNKs are activated by MKK7, whereas p38 MAPKs are activated by MKK3 and -6. Additionally, MKK4 activates both JNK and p38 MAPK (7Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar, 8Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). MAPKKs require phosphorylation in the conserved kinase domain VIII for activation. This is achieved by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK). To date, a remarkably large group of distinct enzymes has been shown to fulfill this function, comprising Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf, Mos, NIK, MEKK1–4, MLK2, MLK3, DLK/MUK, ASK1, Tpl-2/Cot, and TAK1 (8Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways can be activated by ectopically expressed MEKK1–4, MLK2, MLK3, DLK/MUK, ASK1, Tpl-2/Cot, and TAK1, albeit to varying degrees (7Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc.

Moreover, it is becoming increasingly evident that most of these MAPKKKs also directly activate the I-κB kinase/NF-κB signaling pathway in parallel, as demonstrated for MEKK1–3 (9Lee F.S. Hagler J.

These two isoforms were identified and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy mass analysis revealed both PM28 isoforms to be tetrameric. Two types of particles, a larger and a smaller one, were found by transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained solubilized proteins and by atomic force microscopy of PM28 two-dimensional crystals.

The absence of PM28B and the ratio of PM28A to PM28C indicate that these plasma membrane intrinsic proteins are differentially expressed in spinach leaves.

Immense water volumes pass across the membranes of all living cells, especially across the plasma membranes of plants (1Johansson I. Larsson C. Ek B. Kjellbom P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1181-1191PubMed Google Scholar). Simple diffusion of water through the lipid bilayer has an activation energy of >10 kcal/mol and cannot explain the rapid water flow through human red cell membranes found to exhibit an activation energy of <5 kcal/mol. This led to the hypothesis that water pores must exist (2Sidel V.W. Solomon A.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1957; 41: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The discovery (3Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloning (4Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11110-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) of the first known water channel, aquaporin-1 (AQP1),1from human erythrocytes and the demonstration of water transport inXenopus oocytes expressing its complementary RNA (5Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar) confirmed this hypothesis. Since then, a large number of channel-forming integral proteins homologous to AQP1 have been found in all forms of life (6Park J.H. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This membrane protein family was initially named the MIP family after its first sequenced member, the major intrinsic protein (MIP) of bovine lens fiber cells (7Gorin M.B. Yancey S.B. Cline J. Revel J.-P. Horwitz J. Cell. 1984; 39: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of 164 members of the MIP family, now frequently referred to as aquaporin super family, revealed 16 subfamilies that form two distinct clusters, the aquaporin (AQP) cluster and the glycerol facilitator-like cluster (8Heymann J.B. Engel A. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar). The AQPs are highly specific for water, whereas the glycerol facilitators allow the passage of small, nonionic molecules such as glycerol and urea (9Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In addition, ovine MIP tetramers have been found to form a groove and tongue contact via their extracellular surfaces, lending support to a dual function of the protein, as a water channel and as a cell to cell adhesion molecule in the eye lens (10Fotiadis D. Hasler L. Müller D.J. Stahlberg H. Kistler J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Most members of the aquaporin super family have similar molecular masses, ranging from 25 to 31 kDa. Based on their sequence homology all members are predicted to comprise six hydrophobic, membrane-spanning α-helices connected by five loops of variable length and to have cytosolic N and C termini (7Gorin M.B. Yancey S.B. Cline J. Revel J.-P. Horwitz J. Cell. 1984; 39: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Preston G.M. Jung J. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly conserved regions are located on the loops B and E, which contain the NPA amino acid motifs (12Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments led to the hypothesis that loops B and E fold back into the membrane and that the NPA boxes must be involved in the selectivity filter of the channel (13Jung J. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other highly conserved residues are found in the helices, revealing the transmembrane helix-helix packing motif GXXG (14Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), as well as conserved charged buried residues that were proposed to form ion pairs (15Heymann J.B. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1039-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Velocity sedimentation, glutaraldehyde cross-linking, and gel filtration (16Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (17Braun T. Philippsen A. Wirtz S. Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Kühlbrandt W. Engel A. Stahlberg H. EMBO Reports. 2000; 1: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Agre P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), have shown that AQPs and glycerol facilitators are tetrameric proteins. When reconstituted into lipid bilayers, these proteins often form highly ordered two-dimensional (2D) crystals suitable for cryo-electron and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Consequently, a wealth of structural information is now available for several aquaporins from different organisms, ranging from single particle projections to the atomic model elucidated at 0.38-nm resolution (19Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar) and subnanometer topographical data recorded by AFM (see Ref. 18Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Agre P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell to cell water transport is required for many physiological processes in plants, including the transcellular movement of water in the transpiration stream, the circulation of water between the xylem and the phloem, the stomatal or organ movement, and cell enlargement. Aquaporins have been found in the plasma membrane (plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs)) and in the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs)) of plants, being expressed in organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific manners. At the cellular level PIPs act in water uptake and release, whereas TIPs are thought to mediate cellular turgor maintaining the structural integrity of the cell. Plant PIPs are further divided into two subfamilies named PIP1 and PIP2 (20Kammerloher W. Fischer U. Piechottka G.P. Schäffner A.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition to several single amino acid residue substitutions, PIP1s are characterized by a long N terminus and a shorter C terminus and PIP2s by a short N terminus and a longer C terminus (21Chaumont F. Barrieu F. Jung R. Chrispeels M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In contrast to PIP2, PIP1 homologs show poor water transport activity in oocytes (20Kammerloher W. Fischer U. Piechottka G.P. Schäffner A.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21Chaumont F. Barrieu F. Jung R. Chrispeels M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The interplay between these aquaporins is likely to be crucial in the regulation of the intracellular osmolarity. The first plant aquaporin to exhibit water transport activity when expressed inXenopus oocytes similar to the human AQP1 was γ-TIP fromArabidopsis (22Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Evidence for the regulation of certain plant aquaporins by reversible phosphorylation was later shown for α-TIP from seeds (23Maurel C. Kado R.T. Guern J. Chrispeels M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3028-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and PM28A from spinach leaves (24Johansson I. Karlsson M. Shukla V.K. Chrispeels M.J. Larsson C. Kjellbom P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) (for recent reviews on plant aquaporins see Refs. 25Johansson I. Karlsson M. Johansson U. Larsson C. Kjellbom P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 324-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar and 26Santoni V. Gerbeau P. Javot H. Maurel C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The major integral proteins of spinach leaf plasma membranes migrate as a single band of 28-kDa molecular mass and were thus termed PM28. Edman degradation of endoproteinase Lys-C fragments originating from the 28-kDa band, polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers based on the obtained amino acid sequences, and subsequent screening of a spinach leaf cDNA library yielded two full-length clones of MIP homologs, pm28a andpm28b. The sequence information showed that PM28A belongs to the PIP2, whereas PM28B belongs to the PIP1 subfamily (1Johansson I. Larsson C. Ek B. Kjellbom P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1181-1191PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, PM28 was identified as the major phosphoprotein of the spinach leaf plasma membrane (1Johansson I. Larsson C. Ek B. Kjellbom P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1181-1191PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro experiments using plasma membrane vesicles demonstrated that PM28A phosphorylates in a Ca2+-dependent manner by a plasma membrane-associated protein kinase (1Johansson I. Larsson C. Ek B. Kjellbom P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1181-1191PubMed Google Scholar). PM28A was shown to be an aquaporin by expression in Xenopus oocytes, and its water channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation at two different serine residues (24Johansson I. Karlsson M. Shukla V.K. Chrispeels M.J. Larsson C. Kjellbom P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Here, we present the structure of PM28A and a new putative aquaporin isoform, PM28C, whose sequence is distinct from that of PM28B but is also a member of the PIP1 subfamily. A fast and efficient purification protocol likely to be applicable to other plant membranes has been developed. The oligomeric state of PM28A and PM28C particles is defined by STEM mass analysis, and their shape, dimensions, and distribution are defined by electron and atomic force microscopy. In addition, the exact mass and stochiometry of the mixture containing the two isoforms was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The absence of PM28B in our preparations and the ratio of PM28A to PM28C indicate that these PIPs are differentially expressed in spinach leaf plasma membranes. Escherichia coli lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside (OTG) was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), and endoproteinase Lys-C (Achromobacterprotease) was from Wako Chemicals GmbH (Neuss, Germany). Preparation of plasma membranes from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves was performed as described in Ref. 27Kjellbom P. Larsson C. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 62: 501-509Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar. Proteins adhering to the plasma membranes were removed by urea/alkali treatment (28Hasler L. Walz T. Tittmann P. Gross H. Kistler J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Kistler J. Goldie K. Donaldson P. Engel A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (protein concentration, 14–18 mg/ml) were homogenized in 100 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 4 m urea, 0.01% NaN3 at 4 °C and was centrifuged (40 min, 4 °C, 100,000 ×g in a Kontron TFT 45.94 rotor). The pellets were taken up in 100 ml of 20 mm NaOH (pH ∼12), homogenized at 4 °C, and centrifuged again. Finally, the pellet obtained was homogenized with 100 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mmNaCl, 0.01% NaN3 (storage buffer) at 4 °C and was pelleted by centrifugation. These urea/alkali-stripped plasma membranes were resuspended at a protein concentration of 2–3 mg/ml in storage buffer and stored frozen at −80 °C until further use. After thawing, stripped plasma membranes were incubated with 3% OTG (stock solution, 10% OTG in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.01% NaN3) for 30 min on a shaker at room temperature. After centrifugation (40 min, 4 °C, 117,000 × g in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor), the supernatant was loaded onto a MiniS column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a Smart™ chromatography station (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Bicine-NaOH (pH 8.75), 0.4% OTG, 0.008% NaN3. Proteins were desorbed from the MiniS column using a 0 to 250 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mmBicine-NaOH (pH 8.75), 0.4% OTG, 0.008% NaN3 over 80 min at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Fractions containing PM28 were identified by SDS gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), pooled, and concentrated to 2 mg/ml in Centricon-100 cartridges (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Solubilized or reconstituted PM28 was incubated in sample buffer containing 1.5% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at room temperature, run on 13% polyacrylamide gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and silver-stained. Gels were electroblotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked for 30 min in 2% milk powder dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3(TBST), and was subsequently incubated for 60 min with the primary antibody (serum-diluted 1:2000 in TBST) directed against the sequence ALGSFRSNPTN in the C-terminal region of PM28A (see Table I). Before incubation with the anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma; diluted 1:2000 in TBST), the blot was washed once for 15 min in TBST containing 2% milk powder and 3 times for 10 min in TBST. Blots were washed 3 times in TBST for 10 min, once with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and were then developed with Western Blue™ (Promega) stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase. All washing and incubation steps of the blot were performed at room temperature.Table IAlignment of the C termini of PM28A, B, and CPM28AA A I K A L G S F R S N P T NPM28BI P F K S R SPM28CI P F K S KThe peptide used to raise the PM28A-specific antiserum is depicted in bold. Open table in a new tab The peptide used to raise the PM28A-specific antiserum is depicted in bold. Purified protein (2 mg/ml) was mixed with E. coli lipids solubilized in OTG (mixed micelles stock solution, 4 mg/ml E. coli lipids in 20 mm Mes-NaOH (pH 6), 5% OTG, 0.01% NaN3) to achieve a lipid to protein ratio of 1 (w/w). The final protein concentration was adjusted to 1.33 mg/ml, and the final OTG content was adjusted to 1.93%. The reconstitution mixture (60 μl) was preincubated at room temperature for 30 min and dialyzed against 1.5 liters of 10 mm Mes-NaOH (pH 6), 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3 for 24 h at room temperature, 24 h at 37 °C, and another 24 h at room temperature. Solubilized PM28 (0.3 mg/ml in 20 mmBicine-NaOH (pH 8.75), 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% OTG, 0.008% NaN3) was digested with the endoproteinase Lys-C at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.4%. Separation of the peptides was performed at a flow rate of 50 μl/min on a C18 reverse-phase column (1 × 250 mm; VYDAC™ 218TP51, Hesperia, CA) connected to an Applied Biosystems 120A pump. Bound peptides were eluted with a 60-min linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) to 80% acetonitrile containing 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B). Elution of protein fragments was monitored at 214 nm. Automated Edman degradations were performed on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Alignment between PM28 sequences were performed using the program ClustalX v1.64b (31Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on a Bruker REFLEX III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). PM28 reconstituted into lipid bilayers was solubilized for less than 20 s in 80% formic acid at room temperature (final protein concentration, 4 mg/ml). After solubilization of the membranes, 2 μl were immediately mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) in 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and placed on the sample plate to dry. Calibration of the instrument in the high molecular mass range was done with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) by using the molecular masses of the singly, doubly, and triply charged forms of bovine serum albumin. Calibration and mass measurements of the PM28 proteins were carried out in the linear mode. The [M+H]+ values of PM28 isoforms shown in Fig.7 B, the ratio between the two peaks, and the corresponding standard deviations were calculated from 13 different spectra. Mass spectra for the endoproteinase Lys-C fragments of PM28 were acquired by mixing 1 μl of the fractions collected by reverse-phase HPLC with 1 μl of matrix solution and spotting the mixture onto the target plate. For mass measurement in the low molecular range the instrument was operated in the reflectron mode and calibrated using the monoisotopic masses of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (fragment 18–39; Fluka), substance P (Fluka), and angiotensin (Fluka). PM28 isoforms solubilized in OTG were adsorbed for 1 min to glow discharged thin carbon films supported by a thick fenestrated carbon layer (directly after cation-exchange chromatography). The gold-plated copper grids were then washed on 8 drops of quartz double-distilled water and were freeze-dried at −80 °C overnight in the microscope. For mass analysis, annular dark-field images were recorded in a STEM (VG-HB5) at 80 kV and doses of 325 ± 35 electrons/nm2. Digital acquisition of the images and microscope parameters, system calibration, and mass analysis were carried out as described previously (32Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The total experimental error was calculated as the standard error of the mean, plus 5% of the measured particle mass to account for the absolute calibration uncertainty. Detergent-solubilized particles eluted from the cation-exchange column were directly adsorbed for 1 min to parlodion carbon-coated copper grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Grids were washed with 4 drops of double-distilled water and stained with 2 drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were recorded on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 sheet film with a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Electron micrographs of single particles adsorbed to the carbon film were digitized using a Leafscan-45 scanner (Leaf Systems, Inc., Westborough, MA). All image processing steps described below were performed using the Semper image processing system (33Saxton W.O. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Synoptics Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom). For single-particle analysis PM28 complexes were extracted, aligned, and classified. Briefly, a reference was established by selecting a well preserved particle and symmetrizing it 20-fold rotationally (34Thuman-Commike P.A. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Zhuang J. Privé G.G. Werner G.E. Ringler P. Kaback H.R. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cross-correlation functions of this reference with images of digitized micrographs containing adsorbed particles of PM28 revealed correlation peaks at the particle positions, irrespective of their angular orientation. Using this particle picking method a gallery of 4096 particles was created. These were submitted to a multivariate statistical analysis (36van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 13: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) without alignment and were classified into clusters of particles with similar features. To this end, a program package kindly provided by J. P. Bretaudière (37Bretaudière J.P. Frank J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1986; 144: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used. The various cluster averages revealed square and round shaped particles at different angular orientations. These averages were taken as references for subsequent angular and translational alignment of the extracted 4096 particles. Aligned particles were classified again, and cluster averages were calculated. The resolution of the calculated averages was estimated according to the Fourier ring correlation function (FRC) (38Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), the phase residual (PHR) (39Frank J. Verschoor A. Boublik M. Science. 1981; 214: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and the spectral signal to noise ratio (SSNR) (40Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The stock solution of crystals (1.33 mg/ml protein) was diluted 20-fold in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2or 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 50 mmMgCl2, depending on the experiment. A 30-μl drop of this solution was deposited on freshly cleaved muscovite mica (Mica New York Corp., New York, NY) prepared as described previously (41Schabert F.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2394-2403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After 15 to 30 min, the sample was gently washed with the appropriate buffer to remove membranes that were not firmly attached to the substrate. Images were acquired with a commercial AFM (Nanoscope III; Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a 120-μm scanner (j-scanner) and a liquid cell. The liquid cell was operated without an O-ring seal. Oxide-sharpened Si3N4 cantilevers from Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) with a length of 100 μm and a force constant of k = 0.1 newton/m were used. AFM images were recorded in the contact mode with forces between 50 and 150 piconewton applied to the tip. The imaging buffer was optimized according to Ref. 42Müller D.J. Fotiadis D. Scheuring S.

The polypeptide pattern of spinach plasma membranes exhibits a dominant protein band of 28-kDa molecular mass (Fig.1 A, lane 1,arrow). In the first purification step, proteins adhering to the membranes were removed by urea/alkali treatment (Fig.1 A, lane 2). This stripping yielded a pure plasma membrane preparation highly enriched in membrane proteins. New bands appeared above the 42.7- and the 66.2-kDa markers, indicating aggregation of the very dominant polypeptide otherwise running at 28 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Moreover, the lipid bilayer not accessible to the detergent before the urea/alkali treatment could now be solubilized by OTG and other detergents (e.g. dodecyl-β-maltoside and octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; data not shown). When a membrane preparation solubilized in 3% OTG was applied to a cation-exchange column, a prominent peak was observed in the elution profile at a concentration of about 55 mm NaCl (Fig.1 B). Fractions showing UV absorbance at 280 nm were collected and subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an antibody directed against the C terminus of PM28A. The polypeptide bands in the silver-stained SDS gel (Fig.1 C) corresponded to the bands from the Western blot (Fig.1 D) and could, therefore, be assigned to PM28A. As seen in Table I, the peptide used to raise the PM28A-specific antiserum is not present in the PM28B or PM28C protein. 2L. Fraysse and P. Kjellbom, unpublished results. The tendency of PM28A to form higher oligomers can also clearly be seen in the Western blot. If the cation exchange column was not overloaded by OTG-solubilized plasma membranes, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the flow-through showed complete depletion of the band at 28 kDa, indicating full binding of the PM28 proteins to the column matrix (data not shown). To check the purity of isolated PM28A further, the protein pool eluted from the cation exchanger was cleaved with the endoproteinase Lys-C, and the digest was separated by reverse-phase HPLC. The m/zvalues measured by MALDI-TOF for the fractions of the various elution peaks are indicated in Fig. 2. Fractions that could be identified as fragments coming from PM28A (Fig. 2,underlined m/z values) are listed in TableII. Fractions that could not be identified based on the measured mass were subjected to amino acid sequencing (Fig. 2, peaks marked with anasterisk). The fragments at m/z 2406.3 andm/z 4165.5 yielded the N-terminal sequences a, GFQPGPYQVGGGGSNYVHHGYTK and b, QINNWNDHWIFWVGPFIGA, respectively. Edman degradation of the peptides at m/z1594.5 and m/z 5526.6 yielded no amino acid sequences. Fig.3 illustrates the high homology between the two sequenced fragments and parts of the PM28A sequence. Accordingly, the fragment at m/z 2406.3 forms the C loop, and that at m/z 4165.5 forms part of the E loop and helix 6 of PM28C. The sequence of new isoform, PM28C, shows that it belongs to the PIP1 subfamily of plasma membrane AQPs2 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details on the sequence analysis and assignment of the fragments to the different domains of PM28A). No indications were found for the presence of PM28B in our preparations.Table IIEndoproteinase LysC fragments of PM28A identified by mass spectrometryPosition in sequence[M + H]+ in daltons from sequence[M + H]+ in daltons from MALDI-TOFSequence of identified fragment4–161449.71449.6EVSEEAQAHQHGK17–331919.91920.3DYVDPPPAPFFDLGELK143–1611913.91913.5GPYNQFGGGANSVALGYNK238–2703733.03733.8VWDDQWIFWVGPFIGAAVAAAYHQYVLRAAAIK271–2811163.61163.4ALGSFRSNPTN Open table in a new tab Figure 3Topology of PM28A and comparison with the fragments of the new isoform PM28C.

Because the kidney contains high concentrations of urea that can destabilize light chains as well as solutes such as betaine and sorbitol that serve as protein stabilizers, we investigated the effects of these solutes on in vitro amyloid fibril formation and thermodynamic stability of light chains. Two recombinant light chain proteins, one amyloidogenic and the other nonamyloidogenic, were used as models. For both light chains, urea enhanced fibril formation by reducing the nucleation lag time and diminished protein thermodynamic stability. Conversely, betaine or sorbitol increased thermodynamic stability of the proteins and partially inhibited fibril formation. These solutes also counteracted urea-induced reduction in protein thermodynamic stability and accelerated fibril formation. Betaine was more effective than sorbitol. A model is presented to explain how the thermodynamic effects of the solutes on protein state equilibria can alter nucleation lag time and, hence, fibril formation kinetics. Our results provide evidence that renal solutes control thermodynamic and kinetic stability of light chains and thus may modulate amyloid fibril formation in the kidney.

In addition, properties of the aqueous environment such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of chaotropic agents may also be important parameters affecting levels of partially unfolded species and, hence, in amyloidosis (5Hurle H.R.

In vivo, partially denaturing environments can be found, for example, in the lysosome (acidic pH) and in the kidney, which has high intra- and extracellular concentrations of urea (11Kelly J.W. Curr.

Lysosomal extracts can convert amyloidogenic immunoglobulins into amyloid fibrils in vitro (22Glenner G.G. Ein D. Eanes E.D. Bladen H.A. Terry W. Page D.L. Science. 1971; 174: 712-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In vitroexposure of transthyretin to acidic pH, mimicking that of the lysosome, causes partial unfolding, which in turn promotes fibril formation (17Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The conversion of VLs into amyloid fibrils under acidic conditions proceeds through at least one partially unfolded intermediate (5Hurle H.R. Helms L.R. Li L. Chan W. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5446-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Thus, both intrinsic stability of proteins and effects of local solution environments are important criteria for the determination of whether light chains will form amyloid fibrils.The kidney is the major target organ for light chain deposition, which can be found in various forms: fibrillar (AL-amyloidosis), punctate (light chain deposition diseases), crystalline (acquired Fanconi's syndrome), and amorphous (tubular cast neuropathy) (1Kyle R.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Dhodapker M.V. Melini G. Solomon A. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North.

Hematol. 1995; 32: 45-59PubMed Google Scholar). Amyloid is found in all compartments of the kidney, with the glomerulus being a primary site of fibril deposition (1Kyle R.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Ronco P.M. Aucouturier P. Mougenot B. Schrier R.W. Gottschalk C.W. Diseases of the Kidney. III. Little, Brown, and Co., Boston1997: 2129-2174Google Scholar). In about 10% of the cases, amyloid is restricted to nonglomerular regions, especially the inner renal medulla (25Striker L.J.M.M. D'Amico G. Preud'bomme J.L. Striker G.E. Tisher C.C. Brenner B.M. Renal Pathology. II. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1994: 1442-1490Google Scholar). Urea is found at high concentrations (0.4 m-1.5 m) in the inner renal medulla, especially during antidiuresis (26Marsh D.J. Knepper M.A. Windhager E.E. Renal Physiology. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 1317-1347Google Scholar). A common feature in AL-amyloidosis patients is Bence Jones proteinuria, in which high levels of monoclonal κ or λ light chains are excreted in the urine, although urinary concentrations of light chains do not necessarily correlate with pathogenesis (24Kyle R.A. Gertz M.A. Semin. Hematol. 1995; 32: 45-59PubMed Google Scholar). As a component of the glomerular filtrate, light chains are exposed to various concentrations of urea during processing by the kidney. Exposure to urea is expected to enhance fibril formation by thermodynamically favoring the population of aggregation-competent, partially unfolded conformations of light chains (6Raffen R.

As a result of this effect, for example, a light chain variant with an intrinsic thermodynamic stability that is just sufficient to avoid amyloid fibril deposition in other areas of the body, might form fibrils in the renal medulla.However, the kidney also contains high concentrations of stabilizing osmolytes that can counteract destabilization by urea, such as betaine, glycerophosphocholine, sorbitol, and inositol (19Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 20Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol.

Counteraction of urea-induced protein structural and functional perturbations by osmolytes has only been demonstrated with a few enzymes (19Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem.

We hypothesize that this phenomenon will also occur with immunoglobulin light chains, because the mechanisms for the effects of urea and stabilizing osmolytes are nonspecific (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Urea destabilizes the compact, native state of proteins because it binds preferentially to the protein backbone, and protein species with greater solvent exposure are thermodynamically favored (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Stabilizing osmolytes are preferentially excluded from the surface of proteins, which shifts the unfolding equilibrium to favor compact states (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gekko K. Morikawa T. J. Biochem. 1981; 90: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Arch.

Osmolytes (e.g. glycerol and sucrose), in the absence of urea, have been found to inhibit amyloid fibril formation from scrapie prion protein (34Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and immunoglobulin light chains (8Kim Y.S. Wall J.S. Meyer J. Murphy C. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Solomon A. Carpenter J.F. J.

The proteins used, recombinant VL SMA and VL LEN (6Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Pokkuluri P.R. Dave P. Wilkins-Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J.

Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Pokkuluri P.R. Dave P. Wilkins-Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Wilkins-Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.L. Berrios-Hammond M. Westholm F.A. Murphy C. Eulitz M. Wetzel R. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has previously been established that recombinant SMA forms fibrils in vitro that are indistinguishable from in vivo light chain fibrils, and recombinant LEN does not form fibrils in vitro in buffer alone (6Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Pokkuluri P.R. Dave P. Wilkins-Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Wilkins-Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.L. Berrios-Hammond M. Westholm F.A. Murphy C. Eulitz M. Wetzel R. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONOur results document that urea decreases the thermodynamic stability of both SMA and LEN and decreases the lag time for nucleation of fibril formation. Betaine and sorbitol counteract the thermodynamic destabilization caused by urea, explaining why these solutes are able to offset, at least in part, the enhanced fibril formation induced by urea. To understand the mechanism(s) for these effects one must consider the different nonspecific interactions of urea versus betaine or sorbitol with proteins (cf.Ref. 28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Urea is a destabilizer of native protein structure and generally an inhibitor of enzyme function (19Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 29Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 35Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Destabilization of the native conformation is due to preferential binding of urea to protein backbone and other polar groups (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Urea binding decreases protein chemical potential and is directly proportional to solvent-exposed protein surface area. Thus, urea shifts the equilibrium away from the native state, favoring partially or fully unfolded states with greater solvent exposure than the native state. Urea also favors dissociation of higher order assemblies (e.g. native oligomers or fibril nuclei), because the total solvent-exposed surface area of the constituent monomers is greater than that for the assembled state (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Conversely, both betaine and sorbitol have been shown to increase the stability of several proteins against stresses such as high temperature (19Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 21Burg M.B. Peters E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F762-F765PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gekko K. Morikawa T. J. Biochem. 1981; 90: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) due to preferential exclusion from the protein surface (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gekko K. Morikawa T. J. Biochem. 1981; 90: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 33Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Preferential exclusion of solutes increases the protein chemical potential in direct proportion to the protein surface area. The magnitudes of preferential exclusion and increase in chemical potential are greater for the denatured state and partially folded species than for the native state. Thus, the free energy barrier between the states increases, thereby stabilizing the native state (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 32Coelho-Sampaio T. Ferreira S.T. Castro Jr., E.J. Vieyra A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, preferentially excluded solutes also thermodynamically favor higher order protein assemblies, which have a reduced surface area relative to the total for the constituent monomers (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Preferential interactions of urea and osmolytes with protein surfaces are nonspecific. Therefore, in mixtures of urea and osmolytes, the two thermodynamic effects should be compensatory and approximately additive (19Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 21Burg M.B. Peters E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F762-F765PubMed Google Scholar, 27Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Peters E.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 50 (suppl.): S100-S104Google Scholar, 28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We found that the thermodynamic parameters, ΔCm and ΔΔG, in mixtures of urea and betaine or sorbitol were, within error of the determinations, equal to the sum of the individual values in each solute (Table I).Betaine is a more effective stabilizer than sorbitol, either in the absence or presence of urea, both in terms of thermodynamic stability and its effect on the lag time for fibril nucleation (Tables I and II). In addition to the chemical nature of the protein surface, the chemical structure and physical properties of a solute determine its interactions (attractive or repulsive) with the protein and itself (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The magnitude of protein chemical potential change caused by solute addition is determined by two parameters according to the following equation.(δμ2/δm3)=−(δμ3/δm2)μ1μ3(δμ3/δm3)m2Equation 2 where μ i and m i are the chemical potential and molal concentration of component i (1 = water, 2 = protein, and 3 = solute), respectively (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). δm3/δm2 is the preferential interaction parameter, and its negative value indicates preferential exclusion (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For bovine serum albumin, betaine has been found to have higher preferential exclusion (δm3/δm2 = −39.6 mol of betaine per mol of bovine serum albumin) than sorbitol (δm3/δm2 = −9.8 mol of sorbitol per mol of bovine serum albumin) (30Gekko K. Morikawa T. J. Biochem. 1981; 90: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The solute self-interaction parameter, δμ3/δm3, is the other major component that determines the effect of solute on protein chemical potential (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calculation of self-interaction parameter using the activity coefficient of each solute (28Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) gives a greater value for betaine (δμ3/δm3 = 776 cal/mol2) than for sorbitol (δμ3/δm3 = 591 cal/mol2). From Equation 2, the total effect of the two parameters shows that δμ2/δm3 is 30.7 kcal/mol for betaine and 5.8 kcal/mol for sorbitol. Thus, betaine provides a greater increase in the protein chemical potential and, hence, in free energy of unfolding than sorbitol, and it will be more effective in counteracting destabilization by urea.Amyloid fibril formation, including that for light chains (see “Results” and Ref. 7Wall J. Schell M. Murphy C. Hrncic R. Stevens F.J. Solomon A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14101-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) is nucleation-dependent (13Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S.

To explain our results for the effects of urea and stabilizing osmolytes on light chain fibril formation, we propose a model that takes into account the effects of solutes on thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the fibril formation pathway. Schematically, the native state, N, is in equilibrium with an aggregation-competent species, A, that is a partially unfolded form of N (5Hurle H.R. Helms L.R. Li L. Chan W. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W2082385351,"Using an in vitro traumatic injury model, we examined the effects of mechanical (stretch) injury on intracellular Ca2+ store-mediated signaling in cultured cortical neurons using fura-2. We previously found that elevation of [Ca2+]i by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, was abolished 15 min post-injury. In the current studies, pre-injury inhibition of phospholipase C with neomycin sulfate maintained Ca2+-replete stores 15 min post-injury, suggesting that the initial injury-induced store depletion may be due to increased inositol trisphosphate production. Thapsigargin-stimulated elevation of [Ca2+]i returned with time after injury and was potentiated at 3 h. Stimulation with thapsigargin in Ca2+-free media revealed that the size of the Ca2+ stores was normal at 3 h post-injury. However, Ca2+ influx triggered by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (capacitative Ca2+ influx) was enhanced 3 h after injury. Enhancement was blocked by inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase. Since intracellular Ca2+ store-mediated signaling plays an important role in neuronal function, the observed changes may contribute to dysfunction produced by traumatic brain injury. Additionally, our results suggest that capacitative Ca2+ influx may be mediated by both conformational coupling and a diffusible messenger synthesized by the combined action of cytosolic PLA2 and P450.

Smith D.H. Meaney D.F. Kotapka M.J. Gennarelli T.A. Graham D.I. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 315-342PubMed Google Scholar). The pathophysiology of TBI is believed to consist of two phases. A primary phase causes cellular damage at the moment of insult by direct mechanical disruption of the brain. A secondary, or delayed phase of damage, consists of biochemical and cellular events that are initiated at the time of insult but do not appear clinically for hours or days after injury. Clinically, this is often presented as patients who regain consciousness after head injury and demonstrate the ability to speak and obey commands, only to die hours or days later (2Doppenberg E.M.R. Choi S.C. Bullock R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 825: 305-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). At present, the biochemical and cellular mechanisms that comprise secondary injury are not entirely understood. A fundamental pathological mechanism underlying secondary cell injury and death in the central nervous system after TBI is believed to be a disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis (3Tymianski M. Tator C.H. Neurosurgery. 1996; 38: 1176-1195PubMed Google Scholar). This “calcium hypothesis” for TBI is based on the finding that calcium in the cerebrospinal fluid decreases from 1 to 0.01 mm following traumatic injury (4Nilsson P. Hillered L. Olsson Y. Sheardown M.J. Hansen A.J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 5Young W. J. Neurotrauma. 1992; 9 Suppl. 1: 9-25Google Scholar). Concurrently, total tissue45Ca2+ uptake is increased after in vivo injury (6Fineman I. Hovda D.A. Smith M. Yoshino A. Becker D.P. Brain Res. 1993; 624: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 7Hovda D.A. Becker D.P. Katayama Y. J. Neurotrauma. 1992; 9: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, substantial evidence supports the notion that total intracellular calcium is elevated in cells of the central nervous system after trauma. However, there are several pools of intracellular calcium that comprise total cell calcium. These include calcium bound to the plasma membrane, cytoskeletal elements, and calcium-binding proteins; calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and nucleus; and intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i ) (8Kostyuk P. Verkhratsky A. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The relative distribution of calcium throughout the various cellular pools after traumatic injury is unknown. Maintenance of [Ca2+]i is of critical importance to the cell because of the vital role that Ca2+ ions play in regulation of cellular functions, especially in neurons (3Tymianski M. Tator C.H. Neurosurgery. 1996; 38: 1176-1195PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, [Ca2+]i plays a critical role in the control of neuronal membrane excitability (8Kostyuk P. Verkhratsky A. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 9Choi S. Lovinger D.M. J.

Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 466-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and control of synaptic activity and neurotransmitter release (12Robitaille R. Adler E.M. Charlton M.P.

(New York). 1998; 54: 581-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i is also an important signal transduction molecule in neurons and is necessary for the activation of calcium-dependent enzymes involved with normal cellular and physiological processes, including several protein kinases and phospholipases (3Tymianski M. Tator C.H. Neurosurgery. 1996; 38: 1176-1195PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations of these important physiological mechanisms in neurons could have profound effects on overall brain function. Currently, there is a strong need to apply biochemical studies to the pathology of TBI, particularly with respect to [Ca2+]i dynamics. Due to technical limitations ofin vivo injury models, the mechanisms of altered [Ca2+]i signaling after TBI are not well documented. To investigate some of the possible mechanisms underlying traumatic injury, our laboratory has utilized an in vitromodel that simulates a major component of TBI, that being tissue strain or stretch (17Ellis E.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Povlishock J.T. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To produce strain, cells are grown in tissue culture wells having a Silastic membrane bottom that is stretched by a 50-ms pulse of pressurized gas. We have validated our model by demonstrating that in vitro stretch injury produces many of the post-traumatic responses observed after in vivo TBI (17Ellis E.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S.

In addition, we have previously identified novel neuronal alterations after in vitro injury, including a transient stretch-induced delayed depolarization (22Tavalin S.J. Ellis E.F. Satin L.S. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7367-7374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using our in vitro model of injury, we have identified disruptions in store-controlled or capacitative calcium signaling in neurons (26Weber J.T. Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Moore S.F Ellis E.F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the capacitative calcium influx pathway, G protein-coupled receptors linked to phospholipase C (PLC) catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate yielding diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3binds to receptors on IP3-sensitive intracellular calcium stores in the ER, resulting in the release of stored calcium (16Ozawa S. Kamiya H. Tsuzuki K. Prog. Neurobiol.

Depletion of calcium stores causes the production of a calcium influx factor (CIF), which stimulates influx of extracellular calcium through store-operated or second messenger-operated channels (SOCs/SMOCs) in the plasma membrane (capacitative calcium influx), thereby further increasing [Ca2+]i (8Kostyuk P.

Although the majority of data on capacitative calcium influx is derived from nonexcitable cells, there is now strong evidence for the existence of this pathway in neurons (30Sakaki Y. Sugioka M. Fukuda Y. Yamashita M. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Scholz W.K. Palfrey H.C. J.

We have previously found that, immediately after injury, the [Ca2+]i elevation elicited by the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist,trans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (tACPD) was abolished, suggesting alterations to mGluRs, IP3 receptors, IP3 production, or capacitative calcium influx (26Weber J.T. Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Moore S.F Ellis E.F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To dissect the various components of the tACPD response, we utilized the pharmacological agent, thapsigargin, which inhibits the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) of intracellular calcium stores (33Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin-stimulated elevation of [Ca2+]i was also inhibited 15 min after neuronal injury (26Weber J.T. Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Moore S.F Ellis E.F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that intracellular calcium stores are either empty or can no longer sequester calcium. However, 3 and 24 h after injury, intracellular calcium stores responded to tACPD and thapsigargin with significantly enhanced elevation of [Ca2+]i . Therefore, we observe a primary phase in which intracellular calcium stores elicit a depressed response to stimuli after injury, followed by a secondary phase in which store-mediated signaling appears to be potentiated in neurons. The initial phase, in which IP3-mediated signaling is diminished in injured neurons, is similar to other findings in which disruption of the cytoskeleton results in inhibition of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i signaling (34Pedrosa Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the initial phase of decreased [Ca2+]i signaling after neuronal injury may correlate with the primary phase of TBI and be due to direct mechanical disruption of the cytoskeleton. The delayed response in which we observe a potentiation in calcium store-mediated signaling may correlate with the secondary phase of TBI due to altered biochemical mechanisms. In the current report, we describe the apparent underlying mechanisms of the observed changes in intracellular calcium store-mediated signaling after mechanical injury. We report, for the first time, a delayed enhancement in capacitative calcium influx in mechanically injured cortical neurons. Despite several recent findings that are in strong support of a physical coupling and the possible involvement of a secretory mechanism in capacitative calcium influx (35Kiselyov K. Xu X.

Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the delayed enhancement in capacitative calcium influx that we observe in injured neurons appears to also involve activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and a P450 monooxygenase system. These findings are consistent with the production of a diffusible signaling molecule in neurons, which is similar to our previous findings in cortical astrocytes (29Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Hoffman S.W. Falck J.R. Ellis E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, alterations in capacitative calcium influx could involve both structural disruption in neurons as well as changes in CIF-mediated signaling. We hypothesize that these alterations in IP3-mediated calcium signaling pathways and intracellular calcium stores may play a role in the neuronal dysfunction that follows TBI. Mixed cultures of neuronal plus glial cells were prepared from 1- to 2-day-old neonatal Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Hilltop Lab Animals, Scottdale, PA) as described previously (18McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Ellis E.F. Stroke. 1996; 27: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, brains were removed aseptically and placed in sterile dissecting saline. Cortices were dissected from the brain and cleaned of white matter and meninges, leaving the neocortex. The neocortex was placed in 5 ml of dissecting saline that contained 0.125% trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min and was transferred to a tube containing 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The tissue was washed, the supernatant removed, and 5 ml of culture medium added for a second wash. After washing, the supernatant was removed, and the tissue fragments were dissociated by trituration with a glass pipette in 5 ml of culture medium. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g. The supernatant was removed, and 5 ml of culture medium was added. The suspension was triturated, filtered with a 70-μm nylon cell strainer, diluted with DMEM, and counted with a hemocytometer. One-ml aliquots of the cell suspension containing 1 × 106 cells were seeded into each well of a collagen-coated Flex Plate (Flexcell International, McKeesport, PA). Cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. One day after plating, the media were removed and replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium. Three days later, 0.5 ml of medium was removed from each well and replaced with 0.5 ml of neuronal growth medium. Neuronal growth medium contained DMEM, 10 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were used for experiments within 10–15 days after removal from the rat. Glial cells typically adhered to the membrane substrate, and the neurons adhered to the glial cells. Neuronal processes and interconnections between individual neuronal cells and neuronal cell clusters were readily apparent. [Ca2+]i was measured with the ratiometric dye, fura-2. Mixed cultures of neuronal plus glial cells were loaded with fura-2 AM as described previously (24Zhang L. Rzigalinski B.A. Ellis E.F. Satin L.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1921-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Weber J.T. Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Moore S.F Ellis E.F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once and placed in 1 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing 1 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ and supplemented with 1 mm glucose and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Fura-2 AM (5 μm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added, and the cells were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h. Under these conditions, the astrocytes in the co-cultures retain fura-2 only weakly in the cytoplasm. In our studies, astrocytes required room temperature conditions for adequate fura-2 loading since the cells appeared to actively metabolize and compartmentalize fura-2, and lose fluorescence when maintained at 37 °C (20Rzigalinski B.A. Weber J.T. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Weber J.T. Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Moore S.F Ellis E.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, loading of mixed neuronal plus glial cultures at 37 °C resulted in a more selective loading of neurons. The concentration of intracellular fura-2, the presence of unhydrolyzed fura-2 AM derivatives, and dye compartmentalization were routinely monitored (39Poenie M. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 40Roe M.W. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 41Williams D.A. Fay F.S. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We have found that these fura-2 loading techniques produce high concentrations of intracellular fura-2 in neurons, negligible dye compartmentalization, and minimal incomplete AM ester hydrolysis as determined by scanning the excitation spectra of loaded cells. After loading, mixed cultures were washed once with supplemented DPBS and were placed in a final volume of 2 ml of DPBS for measurement of [Ca2+]i . Fura-2-loaded neuronal plus glial cultures were injured as described previously, using a commercially available model 94A Cell Injury Controller (Bioengineering Facility, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA) (17Ellis E.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Povlishock J.T. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In brief, the Silastic membrane of the Flex Plate well is rapidly and transiently deformed by a 50-ms pulse of compressed gas, which deforms the Silastic membrane and adherent cells to varying degrees controlled by the pulse pressure. The extent of cell injury, as measured by uptake of propidium iodide and release of lactate dehydrogenase, is dependent on the degree of Silastic membrane deformation (17Ellis E.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Povlishock J.T. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Ellis E.F.

Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on our previous work we have arbitrarily defined three levels of cell injury, mild, moderate, and severe, produced by deforming the silastic membrane on which the cells are grown by 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 mm, respectively (17Ellis E.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Povlishock J.T. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Ellis E.F.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These degrees of membrane deformation result in a biaxial strain or “stretch” of 31, 38, and 54%, respectively (17Ellis E.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Liang S. Povlishock J.T. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This range of cell stretch has been shown to be relevant to what would occur in humans after rotational acceleration/deceleration injury (42Schreiber D. Gennarelli T.A. Meaney D.F. Proceedings of the 1995 International Research Conference on Biomechanics of Impact. International Research Council on Biokinetics of Impact, Brunen, Switzerland1995Google Scholar). The current experiments were all performed at a mild level of injury (5.5 mm deformation, 31% stretch). Correlation of degree of strain produced in models to strain-induced deficits in humans has shown that greater than 30% stretch produces persistent behavioral deficits. It is important to note that with the cell injury model, as currently used, there is no hypoxia superimposed on the injured cells. [Ca2+]i was measured at room temperature using a Ratiomaster (Photon Technologies International, South Brunswick, NJ) microspectrophotometry system. Excitation light was provided by a xenon arc lamp coupled to a RAM scanner that alternated excitation light between 350 and 380 nm. Band pass was set at ±1 nm. Excitation light was delivered to the cells via fiber optics through the epifluorescence port of a Zeiss Standard 16 microscope coupled to a Zeiss Achroplan 40× water immersion lens. Use of the water immersion lens allowed in situ measurements and easy manipulation of the Flex Plates during injury. However, the optical properties of the lens necessitated the ratioing of fura-2 at 350 and 380 nm. Emission was measured at 510 nm via a microphotometer. The entire system for data collection and analysis was computer-driven. Flex plates containing neuronal plus glial cultures were placed on the microscope stage, and single neurons were selected for [Ca2+]i measurement using slit width adjustments on the microphotometer. Basal [Ca2+]i was recorded for several minutes at a sampling rate of one ratio every 0.2 s. In experiments utilizing neomycin sulfate (Sigma), an inhibitor of PLC, cells were pretreated with neomycin for 3 h prior to injury. Thapsigargin (Calbiochem) and tACPD (Research Biochemicals International, Natrick, MA) were added directly to culture wells at the indicated time after injury. In the indicated experiments, the SOC/SMOC antagonist SKF 96365 (Calbiochem) was added to cultures for 10 min prior to application of thapsigargin. The cytochrome P450 inhibitor, econazole (Calbiochem), and the cPLA2 inhibitor, arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3, Calbiochem), were added to cultures for 2 min prior to thapsigargin stimulation. An additional inhibitor of cytochrome P450,N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl) hexanimide (MS-PPOH, synthesized by Dr. J. R. Falck, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) (29Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Hoffman S.W. Falck J.R. Ellis E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was also used and was added to cultures 2 min prior to thapsigargin stimulation. MS-PPOH is a “suicide substrate” inhibitor of P450 arachidonic acid epoxygenase, designed to resemble the substrate arachidonic acid and inactivate the enzyme (43Wang M.H. Brand-Schieber E. Zand B.A. Nguyen X. Falck J.R. Balu N. Schwartzman M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 966-973PubMed Google Scholar). All agents were added directly to culture wells in a volume of 200 μl at the indicated time after injury. This volume ensured almost immediate mixing with the buffer, as determined by dye diffusion. In experiments in which [Ca2+]i was measured at 3 h post-injury, the cells were injured in DMEM without serum or phenol red. After injury, serum was added back to the media, and cells were incubated for the 3-h interval. Uninjured controls were incubated under the same conditions. Cells were loaded with fura-2 AM 1 h prior to the end of the incubation period. The concentration of intracellular fura-2 was routinely monitored (39Poenie M. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) at 3 h post-injury and did not significantly differ from controls. In Ca2+-free experiments, supplemented DPBS was replaced with Ca2+-free DPBS. Nominally Ca2+-free conditions caused a small but nonsignificant drop in basal [Ca2+]i as previously reported by others (30Sakaki Y. Sugioka M. Fukuda Y. Yamashita M. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Brorson J.R. Bleakman D. Gibbons S.J. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 4024-4043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,45Garaschuk O. Yaari Y. Konnerth A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 13-30Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After basal [Ca2+]i had stabilized, thapsigargin was applied to culture wells. To preserve the original status of intracellular calcium stores, neurons were maintained in nominally Ca2+-free conditions for a maximum of 2 min before stimulation with thapsigargin. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described previously (46Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a correction for intracellular viscosity (39Poenie M. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Autofluorescence at 350 and 380 nm was recorded from neurons of neuronal plus glial cultures that were not loaded with fura-2 and was subtracted from all measurements. Leakage of fura-2 into the medium after injury was monitored by measuring intracellular fura-2 concentration at the isosbestic wavelength, 362 nm (46Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Additional measurements were made to assess fura-2 fluorescence directly in the medium. Consistent with the lack of propidium iodide uptake that we have previously reported immediately after injury in neurons (26Weber J.T. Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Moore S.F Ellis E.F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), no significant leakage of fura-2 was observed following injury. Data are mean ± S.E. values. Statistical significance was established by analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test. We have previously reported that tACPD and thapsigargin-stimulated elevation of [Ca2+]i is almost completely abolished 15 min after injury, suggesti"

The goal of this study was to assess the contribution of PPARα in mediating the effect of fish oil on plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels. To this end, PPARα-deficient mice and wild-type littermates were fed isocaloric fish oil or coconut oil diets, the content of which varied reciprocally between 0, 3, 7, and 10% for 1 week. In both wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice, fish oil feeding was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids associated with lower levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The lowering of triglycerides and VLDL triglycerides was associated with a significant decrease of plasma apoC-III in both genotypes. Fish oil treatment did not influence hepatic apoC-III mRNA levels in either genotype indicating that apoC-III is not under transcriptional control by fish oil. The lowering of HDL cholesterol observed in both genotypes was associated with reduced plasma apoA-II without changes in liver apoA-II mRNA levels. In contrast, plasma apoA-I and liver apoA-I mRNA levels were decreased in wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice after fish oil feeding indicating that PPARα contributes to the effect of fish oil on apoA-I gene expression. In conclusion, PPARα is not rate-limiting for fish oil to exert its triglyceride- and HDL-lowering action. Furthermore, PPARα mediates, at least partly, the decrease of apoA-I after fish oil treatment, whereas apoC-III and apoA-II levels are affected in a PPARα-independent manner.

In addition to its effect on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, fish oil decreases HDL1 levels in rodents and to a lesser extent in humans (2Harris W.S. Am. J. Clin.

Fish oil acts by modulating the activity of several enzymes of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, such as diacylglycerol acyltransferase, fatty-acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and Δ9-desaturase (4Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19 (., 63–90): 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Fish oil and its major long chain fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid, appear to affect most hepatic enzyme activities by regulating the expression of their genes (4Jump D.B.

Metabolism. 1985; 34: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and an increase in fatty acid mitochondrial β-oxidation (6Willumsen N. Skorve J. Hexeberg S. Rustan A.C.

Several of these enzymes are controlled by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (11Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C.

PPARα belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that function as ligand-activated transcription factors. In addition to PPARα, the PPAR family comprises PPARγ and PPARδ. PPARs heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor and alter transcription of target genes after binding to peroxisome proliferator response elements. In vitro PPAR is activated by fatty acids that bind to a ligand binding domain in its C-terminal region (14Issemann I. Green S.

In addition, compounds such as fibrates, certain prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and oxidized fatty acid derivates also bind to and activate PPARs. These observations suggest that fish oil may exert its metabolic and lipid-lowering properties by activating PPARs. In agreement with this hypothesis, studies in PPARα-deficient mice have demonstrated that PPARα is necessary for fish oil to activate gene expression of enzymes of fatty acid oxidation such as acyl-CoA oxidase and cytochrome P450–4A2 but is not necessary to inhibit gene expression of fatty-acid synthase and S14 protein (21Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22Ren B. Thelen A. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To date, the exact contribution of the PPARα pathway to the lipid- and lipoprotein-lowering properties of fish oil has not been defined. Moreover, its contribution to the changes in circulating apolipoprotein levels after fish oil treatment has not been described. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the role of the PPARα pathway in mediating the fish oil-dependent lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein alterations. To this end, the effects of increasing consumption of fish oil on lipid and apolipoprotein levels were assessed in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice. The results of the present study indicate that PPARα has a minor role in the fish oil-induced lowering of triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels in mice. In this respect, fish oil acts differently than synthetic PPARα activators such as fibrates. The studies were performed with wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice (23Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J.

Before dietary experiments all animals were acclimatized for more than 2 weeks under conditions of controlled temperature (20 ± 1 °C) and lighting (dark from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.) in a room of low background noise. The average age of the mice was 8 weeks. For all experiments, male wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice were used. Before each dietary experiment a blood sample was drawn for randomization on triglyceride levels. Animals were housed in cages (2–3 per cage) and given free access to a fat-free semi-purified diet (UAR, Villemoisson sur Orge, France) supplemented with coconut oil, fish oil, or fenofibrate (Sigma). Fish oil and coconut oil were obtained from menhaden and copra, respectively, and were purchased from Sigma. Fish oil contained 30% ofn − 3 fatty acid, and the EPA to DHA ratio was 1.2. Duration of experimental dietary exposure was 1 week in all experiments. For experiment 1, three groups of 6 SV129 mice were supplemented with an isocaloric diet containing either 10% (w/w) coconut oil alone, 10% (w/w) coconut plus 0.2% (w/w) fenofibrate, or 10% (w/w) fish oil alone. For experiment 2, wild-type or PPARα-deficient mice were fed an isocaloric diet supplemented with either 10% (w/w) coconut oil alone, 7% coconut oil plus 3% fish oil, 3% coconut oil plus 7% fish oil, or 10% fish oil alone. The other major nutrient components were carbohydrate (50.4 g/100 g), casein (18 g/100 g), cellulose (4.8 g/100 g), salt mixture (5.6 g/100 g), and vitamins (0.8 g/100 g). At the end of each dietary experiment, mice were food-deprived for 4 h and were exsanguinated under diethyl ether anesthesia by cardiac puncture. Blood samples were collected on EDTA tubes. Plasma was separated by centrifugation (630 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. Lipids were determined enzymatically using commercially available kits for triglycerides (Triglycerides GPO-PAP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cholesterol (Cholesterol C System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and phospholipids (Phospholipids PAP 150, BioMérieux, Lyon, France). Plasma levels of mouse apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoC-III were measured by immunonephelemetric assays using specific polyclonal antibodies in a fixed time method in a Behring Nephelometric Analyzer (Behring Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). For these assays, the primary standard was a pool of sera from normolipidemic C57BL/6 mice to which an arbitrary concentration of 100, 50, and 20 mg/dl was attributed for apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoC-III, respectively. With this standard, the calibration curves cover the ranges 1.25–40 mg/dl for apoA-I, 0.62–20 mg/dl for apoA-II, and 0.123–4 mg/dl for apoC-III. As the exact concentration of apolipoproteins of the standard is unknown, it was more convenient to express the results of the experimental groups as percentage of the control group. Accordingly, the correlations between apoA-I and HDL were r = 0.96 and between apoC-III and triglycerides were r = 0.80 in 20 serum samples. The variation coefficients were below 6% for the 3 parameters including within and between-day variation. Antibodies were raised in rabbit by immunization with synthetic peptides reproducing a part of murine apoA-I sequence, the complete apoA-II sequence, and with native murine apoC-III prepared by isoelectrofocusing. Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from 100 μl of plasma. The gel was allowed to equilibrate with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm) containing 0.01% EDTA and 0.01% sodium azide; 200 μl of plasma were eluted with the buffer at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1. Elution profiles were monitored at 280 nm and recorded with an analog recorder chart tracing system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The effluents were collected in 0.22-ml fractions. Triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids were measured in each collected fraction using commercially available enzymatic kits (Triglycerides GPO-PAP or Cholesterol C System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Phospholipid Enzymatic PAP 150, BioMérieux, Lyon, France). Total cellular RNA was isolated from liver tissue by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Northern and dot-blot hybridizations were performed exactly as described previously (25Berthou L. Saladin R. Yaqoob P.

Filters were hybridized to 1 × 106cpm·ml−1 of each probe as described (28Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. Van Tol A. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were washed in 300 ml of 75 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4, and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and twice for 30 min at 65 °C and subsequently exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat-AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Autoradiograms were analyzed by quantitative scanning densitometry (Bio-Rad GS670 Densitometer, Bio-Rad) in the linear range of film sensitivity. Curves were plotted on a log/log scale relating the density measurements to the amounts of mRNA in the corresponding dots. The relative amounts of mRNA were calculated using the parallel, linear parts of these curves as described elsewhere (28Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. Van Tol A. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J.

The SPSS Software release 7.5 for Windows was used (SPSS Institute Inc., Paris, France). To test whether mice of the SV129 strain respond to PPARα activators, we tested the effect of fenofibrate (0.2% w/w) and fish oil (10% w/w) on lipid metabolism in this mice strain. Plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids were lower in SV129 mice supplemented with fish oil than in those on the coconut oil diet (TableI). These effects were accounted for by lower levels of both the large triglyceride-rich and the small cholesterol-rich lipoprotein fraction as assessed by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). In contrast, fenofibrate decreased triglyceride levels but not cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations in the SV129 mice.Table IPlasma lipid levels in SV129 mice treated with fenofibrate or fish oilSV129 wild-type miceCoconut oilCoconut oil + fenofibrateFish oilCholesterol (g/liter)1.62 ± 0.11.82 ± 0.161.1 ± 0.11-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with coconut oil, the p value is p < 0.001.Triglycerides (g/liter)0.61 ± 0.080.39 ± 0.061-bStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with coconut oil, the p value isp < 0.01.0.34 ± 0.051-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with coconut oil, the p value is p < 0.001.Phospholipids (g/liter)3.04 ± 0.323.03 ± 0.241.67 ± 0.151-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with coconut oil, the p value is p < 0.001.SV129 mice were treated for 1 week with 10% (w/w) coconut oil alone, 10% (w/w) coconut oil plus 0.2% (w/w) fenofibrate, and 10% (w/w) fish oil alone.

Lipids were analyzed as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Values are means ± S.D. of six animals per group. To test whether mice of the SV129 strain respond to PPARα activators by peroxisomal proliferation and apolipoprotein gene expression changes, the effect of fenofibrate (0.2% w/w) and fish oil (10% w/w) on liver acyl-CoA oxidase, apoC-III, apoA-I, and apoA-II mRNA levels were analyzed (Fig. 1). Liver acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA levels were higher in SV129 mice treated with fenofibrate (approximately ×10) than in those supplemented with coconut oil. In contrast, liver acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA levels was mildly induced (approximately ×1.4) by fish oil feeding. Liver apoC-III and apoA-I mRNA levels were lower in the fenofibrate group than in the coconut oil group, whereas apoA-I, but not apoC-III, was decreased by fish oil feeding in this mice strain. Finally, liver apoA-II mRNA levels were markedly increased by fenofibrate feeding but not affected by fish oil treatment. To assess whether PPARα mediates the effect of fish oil on plasma lipids, a dose-response study was performed in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice (Table II). Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids were lower in both wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice fed fish oil than in those fed coconut oil (Table II). The lowering effect of fish oil on cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels was already discerned at 3% (w/w) supplementation in both genotypes. The decrease in cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels was dose-dependent and of similar amplitude in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice. Triglyceride levels were lower in the large FPLC plasma lipid fraction, corresponding to VLDL, of both wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice supplemented with increasing doses of fish oil (Fig. 2). Cholesterol and phospholipid peaks were lower in the small FPLC plasma lipid fraction, corresponding to HDL, of wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice fed fish oil than in those fed coconut oil. Therefore, the decreases in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were accounted for by a lowering of VLDL and HDL, respectively, in both genotypes.Table IIPlasma lipid levels in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice fed an isocaloric diet containing increasing amounts of fish oilFish oilWild-typePPARα-deficient0%3%7%10%0%3%7%10%Cholesterol (g/liter)2.0 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.1.2 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.1.0 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.2.0 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.12-bStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.05.1.3 ± 0.12-bStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.05.Triglycerides (g/liter)1.0 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.0.2 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.0.15 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.1.5 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.22-cStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.01.0.5 ± 0.22-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.0.5 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.Phospholipids (g/liter)3.4 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.22-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.1.7 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.1.4 ± 0.12-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.3.8 ± 0.52.6 ± 0.32-cStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.01.2.2 ± 0.22-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.1.9 ± 0.22-aStudent's t test was used for mean comparisons with fish oil; the p value isp < 0.001.Wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice were fed the following diets for 1 week: fish oil 0% contained 10% (w/w) coconut oil; 3%, 3% (w/w) fish oil plus 7% (w/w) coconut oil; 7%, 7% (w/w) fish oil plus 3% (w/w) coconut oil; 10%, 10% (w/w) fish oil.

Values are means ± S.D. of six animals per group. To assess whether fish oil and PPARα deficiency affect peroxisomal proliferation, liver acyl-CoA oxidase and CYP450 mRNA levels were measured (Fig. 3). Liver acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA levels were induced by ∼1.4-fold and in liver CYP450 mRNA levels by 3-fold in wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice. The effect of fish oil on circulating apolipoprotein C-III levels in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice was assessed (Fig.4). Plasma apoC-III levels were lower in both PPARα-deficient and in wild-type mice fed fish oil than in those fed with coconut oil. There was no evidence for a statistically significant effect of fish oil on liver apoC-III mRNA levels in either genotype. Next, we examined the effect of fish oil on the major HDL apolipoproteins (Fig.5). Fish oil supplementation was associated with a decrease in plasma apoA-I levels in both mice strains. This decrease was less pronounced in the PPARα-deficient mice. Similarly, liver apoA-I mRNA levels were lower after fish oil feeding in wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice suggesting that PPARα contributes to the fish oil-mediated lowering of plasma apoA-I and liver apoA-I mRNA levels. Plasma apoA-II levels were lower in both PPARα-deficient and in wild-type mice fed with fish oil than in those fed with coconut oil (Fig. 6). However, fish oil had mild liver apoA-II mRNA levels raising effect in both wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice.Figure 6Plasma apoA-II (upper panel) and liver apoA-II mRNA levels (lower panel) of wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice fed 10% coconut oil (open bar) or 10% fish oil (dark bar) for 1 week.

This finding is different to what is observed with fibrates (32Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and suggests that fibrates and fish oil affect lipoprotein metabolism through different mechanisms of action. The lowering of plasma triglyceride was associated with decreased levels of apoC-III in both wild-type and PPARα. Like fibrates, fish oil lowered apoA-I and liver apoA-I mRNA level in wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice suggesting a contribution of PPARα. These results indicate that, in contrast to fibrates, fish oil has different molecular mechanisms of action on triglyceride and HDL metabolism. In contrast to fibrates, fish oil decreased triglyceride levels to a similar extent in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice suggesting that fish oil exerts its triglyceride-lowering properties through mechanisms that are independent of PPARα. There are a number of possible hypotheses to explain these differences between fish oil and fibrates. First, although long chain fatty acids, including EPA and DHA, bind and activate PPARα (14Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar), the affinity and the ability of these fatty acids to activate PPARα is much smaller than that of pharmacological activators such as fibrates (15Xu H.E.

A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). For example the effect of fish oil on acyl-CoA oxidase expression is much lower than that of fibrates suggesting that the contribution of fatty acid oxidation to the triglyceride-lowering activity of fish oil treatment is minor in mice. In fact, fish oil fatty acids might not be potent enough to activate PPARα to a level where it exerts a significant metabolic effectin vivo. However, in our experiments fish oil treatment regulated apoA-I, acyl-CoA oxidase, and CYP450 gene expression in a PPARα-dependent manner indicating that this hypothesis is unlikely to be true. Second, fish oil may regulate the same genes controlling triglyceride metabolism as fibrates through mechanisms of actions independent of PPARα. For example, the activity of a number of lipogenic enzymes such as the S14 protein and fatty-acid synthase which are conspicuously decreased by fish oil treatment (33Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Christiansen E.N. Drevon C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1417-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Power G.W. Newsholme E.A. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 2142-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) are under the control of the SREBP1 transcription factor (35Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that SREBP1 expression is decreased by long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (36Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Pan D.A. Jump D.B. J. Biol.

Third, in contrast to fibrates EPA and DHA activate PPARγ, which induces lipoprotein lipase in a tissue-specific manner in adipose tissue, it is likely that a part of the triglyceride-lowering activity of fish oil treatment occurs through activation of this nuclear receptor in adipose tissue. Finally, PPARα agonists and fish oil may affect different subsets of genes, by currently unknown mechanisms, that are important for triglyceride metabolism. ApoC-III plays a crucial role in triglyceride metabolism. Earlier studies have demonstrated that apoC-III inhibits VLDL lipolysis and uptake by cellular receptors (40Windler E. Chao Y. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8303-8307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Wang C.S. McConathy W.J. Kloer H.U. Alaupovic P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 42Quarfordt S.H. Michalopoulos G. Schirmer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14642-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that overexpression of apoC-III in mice is associated with elevated levels of triglycerides due to a defective clearance of VLDL (43Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Fibrate treatment has been shown to decrease hepatic apoC-III mRNA and plasma apoC-III levels, an effect contributing to the triglyceride-lowering activity of these drugs. Interestingly, although plasma apoC-III concentrations are also reduced by ∼80% by fish oil, this diet did not decrease hepatic apoC-III mRNA levels, an observation that is in sharp contrast to fibrates (32Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These observations further point out a difference between fibrates and fish oil. Thus, the major reduction of plasma apoC-III levels (−80%) as compared with the lack of effect of fish oil on liver apoC-III mRNA suggests that nontranscriptional mechanisms contribute to the lowering of plasma apoC-III after fish oil treatment. Previous studies have shown that replacing saturated by polyunsaturated fatty acids results in the lowering of HDL cholesterol in rodents as well as in humans (44Brousseau M.E. Ordovas J.M. Osada J.

The mechanism of this effect is not clear since either decreased production rates or increased catabolic rates of apoA-I were described depending on the experimental models, the type of diets, and the metabolic parameters that were measured (47Shepherd J.

In this study, fish oil supplementation resulted in lower levels of HDL cholesterol and HDL phospholipids in both genotypes, indicating a PPARα-independent lowering action of fish oil on HDL lipids. In contrast with this finding, plasma apoA-I and liver apoA-I mRNA levels were decreased in wild-type mice, but not in the PPARα-deficient mice, after fish oil feeding. These observations indicate that PPARα contributes to the effect of fish oil on apoA-I expression. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that fibrates decrease apoA-I gene transcription in rodents (25Berthou L. Saladin R. Yaqoob P. Branellec D. Calder P. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. Auwerx J.

In the present study, the observation that fish oil requires PPARα to exert part of its apoA-I-lowering effect suggests that fish oil and fibrates share, at least in part, a common molecular pathway of apoA-I regulation. Furthermore, the dissociation between the effect of fish oil on HDL lipids and apoA-I suggests that other or additional proteins other than apoA-I regulate HDL lipids levels and that these proteins are not under a major PPARα control. In this respect, apolipoprotein A-II is another major protein of HDL (56Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Rall S.C.J. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1277-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose expression is transcriptionally induced by activation of PPARα in mice and humans (25Berthou L. Saladin R. Yaqoob P.

However, in contrast to fibrate treatment, apoA-II levels were lowered by fish oil feeding as well in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice. Furthermore and in contrast to apoA-I, liver apoA-II mRNA levels were not affected by fish oil treatment. The observed changes in plasma apoA-II concentrations might be due to a (post) translational repression of its production or secondary to intravascular metabolic changes. Although further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved therein, our results clearly demonstrate a distinct regulation of apoA-II by fibrates and fish oil. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that fish oil decreases triglyceride and HDL levels to a similar extend in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice suggesting that PPARα is not rate-limiting for fish oil to exert its lipid- and lipoprotein-lowering action. The decrease in triglyceride levels was associated with a decrease in plasma apoC-III which occurs independently of PPARα. The lowering of HDL cholesterol was accompanied by a decrease in plasma apoA-I, apoA-II, and liver apoA-I mRNA. The effect on plasma apoA-I and liver apoA-I mRNA levels was abolished by PPARα deficiency indicating a contribution of PPARα to this effect. Altogether, these data suggest that although fibrates and fish oil have a very similar lipid- and apolipoprotein-lowering profile, they exert their lipid-lowering action through different molecular mechanisms of action.

Human ovarian cancer cell line, HRA, was treated with phorbol ester (PMA) to evaluate the effect on expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), since the action of uPA has been implicated in matrix degradation and cell motility. Preincubation of the cells with UTI reduced the ability of PMA to trigger the uPA expression at the gene level and at the protein level. UTI-induced down-regulation of PMA-stimulated uPA expression is irreversible and is independent of a cytotoxic effect. Down-regulation of uPA by UTI is mediated by its binding to the cells. We next asked whether the mechanism of inhibition of uPA expression by UTI was due to interference with the protein kinase C second messenger system. An assay for PKC activity demonstrated that UTI does not directly inhibit the catalytic activity of PKC and that PMA translocation of PKC from cytosol to membrane was inhibited by UTI, indicating that UTI inhibits the activation cascade of PKC. PMA could also activate a signaling pathway involving MEK1/ERK2/c-Jun-dependent uPA expression. When cells were preincubated with UTI, we could detect suppression of phosphorylation of these proteins. Like several types of PKC inhibitor, UTI inhibited PMA-stimulated invasiveness. We conclude that UTI markedly suppresses the cell motility possibly through negative regulation of PKC- and MEK/ERK/c-Jun-dependent mechanisms, and that these changes in behavior are correlated with a coordinated down-regulation of uPA which is likely to contribute to the cell invasion processes.

Biochem. 1998; 253: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which effectively inhibits trypsin, plasmin, and granulocyte elastase. In addition to its protease inhibiting effects, UTI plays a role in suppressing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) production responsible for the invasiveness of tumor cells (12Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Terao T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 380-386PubMed Google Scholar), although UTI does not inhibit directly the catalytic activity of uPA. uPA converts plasminogen into plasmin, a serine protease with broad substrate specificity toward components of the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix including laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin (13Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). These proteolytic functions facilitate the migration of tumor cells through the extracellular matrix and basement membrane barriers. Therefore, UTI apparently plays a key role in regulation of cell invasiveness and metastatic formation possibly through down-regulation of uPA expression. Expression of uPA is controlled by a variety of extracellular signals such as phorbol ester, protein kinase C (PKC), and Fos/Jun-dependent signals, cAMP, cytoskeletal reorganization, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interferon-γ, tumor growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor-2, okadaic acid, retinoic acid, UV, and oncogene products v-Src and v-Ras (14Nagamine Y. Lee J.S. Menoud P-A. Nanbu R. Glas-Grenwalt P. Fibrinolysis in Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). uPA activity of malignant cells is induced during the promotion stage of the carcinogenic process and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) is one of the best characterized, tumor promoting agent. PMA is generally recognized to modulate cellular functions by activating a Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent PKC (15Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agents that modulate uPA have been shown to alter the rate of metastasis in in vitro experiments and in some animal models (16Ways D.K. Kukoly C.A. deVente J. Hooker J.L. Bryant W.O. Posekany K.J. Fletcher D.J. Cook P.P. Parker P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Recent publication demonstrated that UTI with anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor promoting properties can influence the PKC-dependent signal pathway in uPA expression in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in the promyeloid leukemia cell line U937 (12Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Terao T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 380-386PubMed Google Scholar); exogenous UTI inhibits a rapid increase in membrane-associated PKC activity, and a decrease in cytosolic PKC activity. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of the UTI-mediated changes occurring downstream of the PKC signal transduction have remained unclear. In the present study, we have sought to define the UTI-dependent regulatory mechanisms involved in PMA-induced uPA expression and cell motility. First, we have determined the effect of UTI on PMA-induced uPA expression, as well as quantitating time- and dose-dependent alterations in the steady state levels ofuPA mRNA and uPA activity. Second, we ask whether the inhibition was due to interference with the PKC second messenger system. For this, we have compared the effect of UTI and several types of PKC inhibitor on PMA-induced uPA expression, PKC translocation, and signal pathway involving a relay of phosphorylation of several proteins. Third, we have investigated the possibility that UTI binding to tumor cells might be involved in the down-regulation of uPA expression. Finally, we have determined if there is a relation between UTI-dependent alterations in the uPA expression and cellular motility. UTI was purified to homogeneity from human urine. A highly purified preparation of human UTI was kindly supplied by Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan. The COOH-terminal fragment of UTI (HI-8) was purified as described previously (9Kobayashi H. Sugino D. She M.Y. Ohi H. Hirashima Y. Shinohara H. Fujie M. Shibata K. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies raised against MEK1, ERK2, and c-Jun were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies raised against human uPA and human high molecular weight uPA were supplied by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). PMA, calcium ionophore A23187, H-7, calphostin C, staurosporin, aspirin, and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid were purchased from Sigma, and all other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and were purchased from major suppliers. Ethanol was used as the solvent for PMA, and the final concentration of ethanol was 0.1% in all experimental points. Human ovarian cancer cell line HRA was obtained from Dr. Y. Kikuchi (17Kikuchi Y. Kizawa I. Oomori K. Miyauchi M. Kita T. Sugita M. Tenjin Y. Kato K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 592-596PubMed Google Scholar). The HRA was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). Cells were disaggregated routinely with 0.1% trypsin/EDTA solution and replated at a split ratio of 1:10. The cells were harvested and aliquoted into 12-well tissue culture plates (0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. On the next day, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove serum, and the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics. Serum-free medium plus the test drugs were added and incubation was continued for different time lapses. The cells were incubated with various concentrations of UTI during three different periods, i.e.(a) during 30 min preceding the stimulation phase, (b) during the PMA-stimulation phase, and (c) 60 min after the stimulation, UTI being then added to the expression medium. Conditioned media were individually harvested, one of the remaining monolayers were trypsinized and hemocytometer cell counting or protein content determinations were performed. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218536) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard and reagents purchased from Bio-Rad. Conditioned media were used for measurement of plasminogen activator activity by chromogenic and zymographic analyses. Following the recovery of conditioned media, monolayers were washed and used for determination of cell-associated plasminogen activator activity. Plasminogen activator (PA) activity in the cell-conditioned media (100 μl) was quantitated utilizing a functional assay for plasmin. Medium (100 μl) was then incubated for 3 h in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline containing plasminogen (0.165 units/ml) and S-2251 (0.5 mm)) as the chromogenic substrate of plasmin. In a parallel experiment, after the cells were washed, the medium was replaced with buffer A and incubated for 5 h to determine the cell associated PA activity. The amount of p-nitroaniline released was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Each assay was run with a plasminogen-free blank. In some experiments, using log-log graph paper, a calibration curve was drawn by plotting the calibrator values on thex axis and their corresponding absorbance values on they axis. The uPA activities were quantitatively obtained by reading from the calbration curve. Viability of the cells was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release in the medium as described previously (19Dubois P. Lison D. Lauwerys R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2139-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase release is expressed as % of total enzyme content determined after cell disruption with Triton X-100. Zymography was performed as described previously (20Granelli-Piperno A. Reich E. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). To confirm uPA activity present in zymograms, plasminogen-casein-agarose underlays were prepared with an anticatalytic anti-human uPA antibody or without plasminogen. uPA activity was quantified by a caseinolysis assay (21Saksela O. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), using plasminogen-rich casein-agarose plates. Secreted uPA activity was referenced to a standard uPA curve and normalized to 106cells and to a 24-h incubation period, unless otherwise indicated. Of note that, in the present study, zymographic analysis only detected an uPA (molecular mass 55 kDa) in HRA cells. Cells (3 × 106) were plated in 100-mm dishes with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The next day, the cells were treated as described above. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the protein concentrations were determined. Total protein (20 μg) was diluted in SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with the use of a semidry electroblotter apparatus. The blots were finally incubated with ECL chemiluminescence substrate mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo) for 1 min and exposed to Fuji x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film). Anti-uPA antibodies were used as the primary antibodies. For quantification, computerized scanning and densitometry (Power Macintosh 7600/200-assisted FAS-II and Electronic U.V. transilluminator; Toyobo Co. Ltd., Tokyo) were used. PKC was determined essentially as described by Walton et al.(22Walton G.M. Bertics P.J. Hudson L.G. Vedvick T.S. Gill G.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Aliquots of both cytosolic and membrane extracts were assayed for PKC activity by a PKC enzyme assay system (PepTagTMNon-Radioactive Protein Kinase Assays; Promega, Madison, WI), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two micrograms of PepTag™ C1 peptide were incubated as in the standard reaction with varying amounts of PKC in a final volume of 25 μl for 30 min at 23 °C. The reactions were stopped by heating to 95 °C for 10 min. The samples were loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel and run at 100 V for 15 min. Phosphorylated peptide migrated toward the anode, while nonphosphorylated peptide migrated toward the cathode. Using a razor blade, the nagatively charged phosphorylated bands were excised from the gel and assayed for PKC activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blot analysis of PKC was performed using α-subtype-specific monoclonal antibodies. Immunoreactivity was analyzed using ECL detection kit as described above. Total RNA was isolated from cells by lysis in Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.); 10 μg of RNA were separated in 1.2% agarose gels and blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes.uPA mRNA was detected by a radioactively labeleduPA oligonucleotide probe. A 1.0-kilobaseEcoRI-PstI fragment of a human uPAcDNA (23Medcalf R.L. Van den Berg E. Schleuning W.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was used as a probe in the hybridization experiments.uPA cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primed DNA labeling technique as described before (24Niiya K. Taniguchi T. Shinbo M. Ishikawa T. Tazawa S. Hayakawa Y. Sakuragawa N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Following hybridization with uPA, blots were stripped and rehybridized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GAPDH) as a semi-quantitative control by densitometry. After each hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed on Kodak BioMax MS-1 film at −70 °C. Invasion assays were performed essentially as described previously (25Johnson M.D. Torri J.A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 873-877PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were conducted using a 24-well Boyden chamber apparatus. For motility assays, 8-μm pore sized, polycarbonate filters were placed in the apparatus separating the upper from the lower wells. The lower wells contained 25 μl of fibroblast-conditioned media prepared by incubating confluent monolayers of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts for 24 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid. HRA cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, resuspended in media containing the appropriate treatment, and added to the top well (5 × 104 cell/well). The filters were coated with 0.375 mg of Matrigel per filter. The apparatus was incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air for 18 h, after which the cells that had traversed the membrane and spread on the lower surface of the filter were stained with Diff-Quick and quantified electronically with the image analysis system. This system analyzes 32 independent fields for each filter. Cells are identified on the basis of nuclear staining and a count of cells per field is generated. The chemotactic assay was conducted as described previously (4Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Shinohara H. Moniwa N. Terao T. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 71: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For chemotaxis assay, the upper filters were not coated with Matrigel. All experiments were performed using at least three different cell preparations. Data are presented as mean ± S.D.. All statistical analysis was performed using StatView for Macintosh. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparisons between two groups. In cases in which significant interactions were detected, Duncan's multiple range test was used for group comparisons. p less than 0.05 was considered significant. It has been established that the cell-associated receptor-bound uPA activity is important for tumor cell invasiveness (26Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of various concentrations of PMA on the uPA expression was determined by a chromogenic assay. The HRA cells were treated with PMA, calcium ionophore A23187, or 8-Br-cAMP. A23187 and cAMP were included for comparison because they have been shown to induce the uPA in other cell types. Fig. 1 shows that PMA strongly induced PA activity on HRA cell surface. Plasminogen activator activity on the surface of the cells incubated with PMA (100 nm) was increased about 7-fold as compared with the control cells. In contrast, A23187 and cAMP showed a negligible effect by themselves or in combination with PMA (not shown). When cells were preincubated with anti-uPA IgG, PA activity was inhibited more than 85%, indicating that most of the PA activity expressed by HRA cells is uPA. As shown in Fig. 1, inset, induction by PMA reached maximal and 50% values at the concentrations 100 and ∼10 nm, respectively. Time course analyses showed that PMA induction reached a maximum at 9 h (see Fig. 6).Figure 6Time-dependent effect of UTI or H-7 on steady state levels of PMA-stimulated PA activity. Cells (1 × 106/well) were exposed to PMA (100 nm, ●) for 1 to 9 h in the absence or presence of UTI (100 nm, ■) or H-7 (10 μm, ○). Cell associated uPA activity was assayed.

Asterisks indicate barsthat are significantly different from the 1-h incubation (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated whether UTI could inhibit PMA-induced stimulation of PA activity expressed on the cell surface. We initially reported (2Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Ohi H. Sugimura M. Terao T. Fujie M. Clin. Exp. Metast. 1994; 12: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that UTI is able to reduce cell-associated protease activity directly via inactivation of plasmin and trypsin, while UTI fails to inhibit uPA activity. In the present study, to examine if UTI could be directly modifying uPA catalytic activity, purified human uPA activity was assayed with or without UTI (0.01–1 μm). We again confirmed that there was no inhibitory effect of UTI on uPA catalytic activity. The dose-dependent ability of UTI to inhibit PMA-induced expression of uPA activity by cells is clearly demonstrated (Fig.2 A). In cell monolayers treated with PMA, cell associated PA activity was significantly decreased in the presence of 100 nm UTI. The maximal suppression of PMA-induced PA expression was obtained at 1000 nm UTI. Constitutive uPA expression without stimulation by PMA was also affected to a lesser degree by 1000 nm UTI (Fig. 2 B). Cells exposed to not less than 100 nm(PMA-stimulated) or 1000 nm UTI (constitutive, nonstimulated) exhibited a significant decrease in PA activity. Contrary to UTI, the COOH-terminal domain of UTI (HI-8), which is active fragment for protease inhibitor but is not recognized by the cell-associated UTI-binding sites, failed to suppress PMA stimulated PA activity at concentrations of HI-8 as high as 5000 nm. Furthermore, to determine whether the increased expression of cell-associated uPA produced by treatment with PMA resulted in an increase in the secretion of this enzyme, conditioned media were prepared from cells treated with PMA and UTI and analyzed by zymography and Western blotting (Fig. 3). Western blot with anti-human uPA antibody confirmed and correlated the decrease in PMA-stimulated uPA secreted activity with a lower uPA antigen expression. Zymographic assays also showed that cell monolayers produced a PA activity corresponding to a main band of 55 kDa. This activity was completely abolished by anti-catalytic antibodies to human uPA, confirming uPA identity (not shown). By zymography, plasminogen-independent protease activity was not detected in HRA cells (not shown). Thus, we confirmed that treatment of cell monolayers with UTI showed an inhibitory effect on PMA-stimulated expression and secretion of enzymatically active uPA. Results obtained after exposing the cells to UTI before, during, and after stimulation by PMA are presented in Fig.4. Preincubation of the cells with UTI during 30 min before 100 nm PMA stimulation results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of the induction of cell associated PA activity. At concentrations of 100 and 1000 nm, PA activity is inhibited by 55 and 75%, respectively. This inhibition is irreversible since it cannot be reversed by washing the cells before PMA stimulation. The presence of UTI during stimulation by PMA (concurrent treatment) does not cause a dramatic reduction of PA activity. At a concentration of 1000 nm, PA activity is inhibited by ∼25%. In contrast, no significant decrease of PA activity is observed when UTI is added to the medium 1 h after stimulation by PMA. More than 90% of the control value still remains at the highest UTI concentration (1000 nm) tested. Cell viability, monitored by lactate dehydrogenase leakage in the culture medium and trypan blue dye exclusion test, is not altered under the different exposure conditions (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated that a marked and a slight, but significant, decrease of PA activity are observed when UTI is added to the medium before and during stimulation by PMA. The cell signaling pathways associated with UTI-induced down-regulation of PA expression were estimated utilizing several types of specific inhibitors (Fig.5). The cells exposed to 100 nm PMA exhibited a 7.5-fold increase in PA activity on the cell surface. Preincubation of the cells with either aspirin (2 μg/ml) or eicosatetraenoic acid (0.1 mm) had no effect on the ability of PMA to stimulate PA activity. This experiment demonstrated that it is unlikely that cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid are involved. We next compared the ability of UTI to reduce PMA-stimulated expression of PA activity by cells pretreated with each PKC inhibitor. When cells were incubated with 10 μm H-7, the ability of PMA to stimulate the expression of cell associated PA activity was inhibited about 90%. When cells were preincubated with 1.0 μm UTI, the ability of PMA to stimulate the expression of PA activity was inhibited about 60%. Higher concentrations of UTI (10 μm) gave similar results on inhibition of PMA-dependent stimulation of PA activity (see Fig. 2). Although UTI, like H-7, was effective to reduce PMA-stimulated PA activity, induction of PA activity was not synergistically reduced. This shows that component(s) of UTI action are mediated dependently of PKC. Other PKC inhibitors such as calphostin C (250 nm), not shown, and staurosporin (50 nm) gave similar results. These data suggest that UTI may suppress PA activity in a manner analogous to PKC inhibitor. The time-dependent accumulation of PA activity on the cells exposed to PMA is presented in Fig. 6. Cell associated PA activity did not increase until after 2 h of PMA stimulation and continued to increase over 9 h. As expected, PMA stimulated PA activity was significantly suppressed in a time-dependent manner when the cells were preincubated with 1 μm UTI or 10 μm H-7, respectively. Of note, both UTI and H-7 did not directly inhibit uPA activity. The effect of UTI or PKC inhibitors on the PMA-induced expression of uPA mRNA was studied. RNA was prepared from cells treated with PMA and inhibitors and hybridized with probes derived from human cDNA clones ofuPA. Fig. 7 shows the results from a blot probed for uPA mRNA. PMA produced a marked increase in uPA expression at the gene level. The expression of theuPA gene was increased by ∼12-fold at 100 nmPMA for 3 h. This stimulation was abrogated in cells pretreated with UTI or PKC inhibitors. The time-dependent effect of UTI on PMA-stimulated expression of uPA mRNA was determined. As illustrated in Fig. 8, an increase in HRA celluPA mRNA levels was observed after 1 h and peaked after 3 h. uPA mRNA levels dropped sharply over the next 6 h. The increase in levels of uPA mRNA observed in cells treated with PMA for 9 h was inhibited more than 50% (UTI) or 95% (H-7) when cells were preincubated with UTI or H-7, respectively. We have investigated whether UTI can suppress PMA-mediated PKC translocation. HRA cells were grown to confluency and then maintained overnight in serum-free conditions to keep the cells in a quiescent state. PKC enzymatic assay and immunoblot analysis showed that stimulation with 100 nmPMA for 30 min at 37 °C resulted in the translocation of PKC-α in the membrane fraction, with a concomitant decrease in the cytosolic pool, while total PKC activity did not significantly change (Fig.9). Abolition of PMA effect was achieved in the presence of UTI, but not of HI-8. UTI did not directly inhibit the catalytic activity of partially purified porcine brain PKC even at the concentration of 1 μm (data not shown). The phosphorylation of proteins in tyrosine/threonine residues is a prerequisite for the activation of these enzymes. In some systems these events are PKC-dependent (27Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B.

Biol. 1999; 291: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This ADF/cofilin-mediated structural change in F-actin is important for cooperative binding of ADF/cofilin to F-actin (17McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Although the structure of gelsolin segment-1-actin complex has been solved (25McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), predicted models of ADF/cofilin-actin complex that were based on the topology of this complex (21Hatanaka H. Ogura K.

When one of these predicted structures was extended to develop models of ADF/cofilin-F-actin complex (17McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), the C terminus of ADF/cofilin was placed away from the actin surface. However, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of yeast cofilin (27Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) revealed that helix α4 near the C terminus (Fig. 1 b) is a part of the actin-binding surface that confers filament binding. Mutagenesis of yeast cofilin (27Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) revealed two actin-binding surfaces as follows: one that is essential for G-actin binding and a second that is required for F-actin. The essential G-actin-binding surface includes the N terminus, a portion of helix α3, and the turn connecting strand β6 and helix α4 (27Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 b). Helix α3 includes two highly conserved basic residues that have been implicated in monomer binding in several ADF/cofilin proteins by chemical cross-linking (28Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and this region includes the phosphorylation site Ser-3 (Ser-6 in plant ADF) that is responsible for phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of actin binding by ADF/cofilin (33Agnew B.J.

These regions of the molecule are close together in the three-dimensional structures and probably form a binding surface that interacts with subdomains 1 and 3 of G-actin (21Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagaki F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Leonard S.A. Gittis A.G. Petrella E.C. Pollard T.D.

Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There is little detailed information regarding the site on ADF/cofilin that is required for F-actin binding. Two regions have been implicated in filament binding as follows: (i) a cluster of charged residues (15Pope B.J. Gonsior S.M. Yeoh S. McGough A. Weeds A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,27Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) in a loop connecting β2 and β3 in destrin and at a similar position at the beginning of β5 in yeast cofilin, and (ii) a group of charged residues in helix α4 in yeast cofilin (27Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations of conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr67 and Tyr70 in maize ADF3) in the apolar core of the molecule results in uncoupling of monomer and filament binding activities (37Jiang C.J. Weeds A.G. Khan S. Hussey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9973-9978Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We previously identified a novel function for the C-terminal tail of ADF/cofilin (30Ono S. Baillie D.L. Benian G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The tail is predicted to lie outside helix α4 (Fig.1 c) and is not included in the crystal structures of either yeast cofilin (23Fedorov A.A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Drubin D.G. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or Acanthamoeba actophorin (38Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), suggesting structural flexibility in this region. A mutant form of UNC-60B (a Caenorhabditis elegans ADF/cofilin isoform) that lacks three C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1 c) shows loss of both F-actin binding and severing activity but still depolymerizes F-actin, possibly through its monomer sequestering activity (30Ono S. Baillie D.L. Benian G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Importantly, a C. elegans strain that expresses this mutant is defective in proper assembly of actin into myofibrils (30Ono S. Baillie D.L. Benian G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating that the C-terminal tail of UNC-60B is functionally significant in vivo. Therefore, in this study, we characterized the role of the C-terminal tail of UNC-60B in its actin regulating activity. Homology modeling of UNC-60B was based on the known structures ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae cofilin (Protein Data Bank code1cfy) (23Fedorov A.A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Drubin D.G. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Acanthamoeba castellanii actophorin (Protein Data Bank code 1ahq) (22Leonard S.A. Gittis A.G. Petrella E.C. Pollard T.D. Lattman E.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Sus scrofa destrin (Protein Data Bank code 1ak7) (21Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagaki F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Coordinate files were obtained from Protein Data Bank. The initial alignment, generated by pattern-induced (local) multiple alignment, showed 10% identical and 57% conserved residues between UNC-60B and cofilin, actophorin and destrin (Fig.1 a). A model was built based on this initial alignment using the program Modeller by Sali and Blundel (39Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the initial model, superimposed with the known structures, suggested changes in the alignment in the region of the insertion at UNC-60B Lys58–Lys65. Multiple cycles of realignment and rebuilding of the models were completed. Side chain conformations, along the length of the UNC-60B sequence, were optimized manually to satisfy individual residue structural functions (i.e. van der Waals packing, ionic interactions, H bonds between side chain and main chain, etc.) as seen in the known structures. Additional refinement and minimization of the model are underway. Recombinant wild-type UNC-60B was purified as described (40Ono S. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3778-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rabbit muscle actin was purified as described (41Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), and G-actin was further purified by gel filtration with Sephacryl S-300 or purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). We obtained indistinguishable results using either actin preparation. C. elegans actin was purified from wild-type N2 strain (obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, St Paul, MN) as described (42Ono S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Bovine pancreas carboxypeptidase A (CPA) (EC 3.4.17.1) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. UNC-60B (1 mg/ml) was incubated with CPA (20 μg/ml) in a buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, at 25 °C for 3 h. The digestion was stopped by adding 1,10-phenanthroline (Fisher) at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The protein solution was acidified to pH ∼2 with 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and the protein was chromatographed on a Jupiter-C4 column (1 × 150 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluted using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The column eluate was monitored at 210 nm, and the fractions containing the protein (eluting as a major peak at ∼30% acetonitrile) were collected for further analysis. The fractions were mixed 1:1 with isopropyl alcohol/water/acetic acid (50:50:1) and directly infused at a flow rate of 15 μl/min into a MicroIon source of model API3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Following spectra deconvolution (using the BioSpec BioReconstruct routine), the mass of the protein was determined. The proteins were subjected to automated Edman degradation in a Procise-cLC sequencer (PE Biosystems) using a standard manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were introduced in synthetic oligonucleotides that complement the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the cDNA for UNC-60B. The cDNA fragments that carry mutations were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using these mutant primers and a common forward primer (5′-GATCCCATGGCTTCCGGAGTCAAAGTTG). The amplified DNA fragments were digested by NcoI and BamHI at the sites introduced by the primers and cloned into pET-3d (Novagen, Madison, WI). The sequences of the inserts were verified by DNA sequencing not to contain any polymerase chain reaction-induced errors. The mutant primers used are 5′-CTAGGGATCCTTATCTTTGGTTGGACATCAGGTC for ΔI, 5′-CTAGGGATCCTTATTGGTTGGACATCAGGTCGC for ΔRI, 5′-CTAGGGATCCTTAGATTCTTTAGTTGGACATC for ΔQRI, 5′-CTAGGGATCCTTAGGCTCTTTGGTTGGACATC for I152A, and 5′-CTAGGGATCCTTAGATTGCTTGGTTGGACATC for R151A. The mutant UNC-60B proteins were expressed and purified as described previously for wild-type UNC-60B (40Ono S. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3778-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Copelleting assays of UNC-60B with rabbit muscle F-actin were performed as described previously (40Ono S. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3778-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5. All protein solutions except F-actin were clarified by ultracentrifugation prior to the pelleting assays. Ultracentrifugation was performed with a Beckmen Airfuge at 28 pounds/square inch for 20 min. Assay for nucleation of actin polymerization was performed as described previously (30Ono S. Baillie D.L. Benian G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) except that rabbit muscle actin was used as seeds in this study. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Safer (43Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CaATP-G-actin and UNC-60B were incubated in G-buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then supplemented with 0.25 volume of a loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed using a Bicine/triethanolamine buffer system. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma). Decorated filaments were prepared in one of two ways. In most cases, pre-formed actin filaments (3 μm) were incubated at room temperature for ∼2 h with 10 μm UNC-60B in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 0.1m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA. Although ATP was present in the polymerized F-actin solution, no additional ATP was added upon dilution into the UNC-60B-containing buffer, resulting in a final concentration of <0.04 mm ATP. For partial decoration of filaments, 10 μm F-actin was decorated on ice overnight in the presence of 10 μm UNC-60B using the same buffer conditions and diluted to a final actin concentration of 2.5 μm just prior to plunging. Filament decoration was confirmed by pelleting assays in a Beckman Airfuge at 20 pounds/square inch for 15 min followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Decorated filaments were rapidly frozen on holey carbon films in ethane slush cooled with liquid nitrogen and then imaged using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron cryomicroscope at the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging at Baylor College of Medicine. Micrographs were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and a nominal magnification of × 30,000. Suitable micrographs were digitized using a Zeiss SCAI film scanner at a final resolution of 4.7 Å per pixel. Tobacco mosaic virus particles (0.05 mg/ml; kindly provided by Dr. Ruben Diaz, Florida State University) were included in the samples to provide an internal magnification standard. The defocus of each micrograph was determined by incoherent averaging of regions of protein embedded in ice (44Zhou Z.H. Hardt S. Wang B. Sherman M.B. Jakana J. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The micrographs used in this study were recorded at −2.1- and −2.6-μm defocus. Filament images were analyzed using the helical image processing package PHOELIX (45Whittaker M. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 58: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 46Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mean crossover lengths were measured from positions of the first layer line in computed diffraction patterns of computationally straightened filaments. For image reconstructions, layer line data were collected to a radial resolution of 0.032 Å−1 (within the first node of the contrast transfer function) and separated into near and far side data sets. Filaments that best conformed to the 20:9 selection rule and that showed good symmetry between the near and far sides of the Fourier transform were selected for further processing. A total of 22 data sets were averaged, and a three-dimensional structure was calculated by Fourier-Bessel inversion (47DeRosier D.J. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) to a resolution limit of 0.032 Å−1 radially using the following layer lines (l, n): 0, 0; 2, 2; 4, 4; 5, −5; 7, −3; 9, -1; 11, 1; 13, 3; 15, 5. The mean phase residuals during the last round of alignment of the 22 data sets were 31.8° and 47.6° for the correct and incorrect polarity, respectively. The resulting reconstruction was aligned to a previously calculated F-actin reconstruction (17McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) in Fourier space to aid in model building. Pseudo-atomic models of UNC-60B-F-actin were derived using the actin subunits from the Lorenz filament model (twisted to match the UNC-60B-induced actin structure) and the homology-based model of UNC-60B. The UNC-60B model structure was positioned interactively using the programs O (48Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and Iris Explorer (Numerical Algorithms Group, Downers Grove, IL) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo R4000 work station (Mountain View, CA). The goal was to produce a model that fit inside the envelope of the electron microscopy reconstruction well and also taking into account available genetic and biochemical data concerning the cofilin residues involved in actin contacts (27Lappalainen P.

The structure of UNC-60B was modeled based on the known structures of three ADF/cofilin proteins. The model presented in Fig.1 c incorporated the tertiary structures of the known ADF/cofilin proteins, a three-layer α-β-α sandwich, with an internal five-stranded β-sheet. Significant differences in the model resulted from insertions in the UNC-60B sequence between helix α2 and strand β3 (UNC-60B Lys58–Lys65 inserted between Pro58and Asn60 of cofilin) and between strands β3 and β4 (UNC-60B Arg80–Thr86 inserted between Gly75 and Gly78 of cofilin). There is also an addition of 4 residues at the C terminus (UNC-60B Asn149–Ile152), the structure of which is modeled after the destrin C-terminal structure (residues Leu156–Ala159). The C-terminal isoleucine at position 152 of UNC-60B was removed by carboxypeptidase, and its effect on the activity of UNC-60B was examined. We found that CPA removed only Ile152 because Arg151 is not a substrate of CPA. Removal of Ile152 was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Molecular mass of control UNC-60B was determined as 16,919 atomic mass units that corresponded to residues 2–152 of UNC-60B (the predicted mass, 16,915 atomic mass units). However, the spectrum of CPA-treated UNC-60B yielded a major peak of 16,806 atomic mass units and a minor one of 16,921 atomic mass units. These correspond to residues 2–151 (the predicted mass, 16,802 atomic mass units) and 2–152, respectively. The mass of the major peak was consistent with that of UNC-60B-ΔI (the experimentally determined mass, 16,803 atomic mass units), a mutant lacking Ile152. Area calculations of the peaks from the mass spectra suggested that ∼17% of the total UNC-60B was not processed with CPA assuming that both forms were ionized to the same extent. N-terminal sequencing of CPA-treated UNC-60B yielded the identical sequence to control UNC-60B starting from Ala2, indicating that there was no detectable amino- or endopeptidase activity in the CPA preparation. In addition, there was no evidence of major alteration in secondary structure as examined by circular dichroism (plots not shown), providing evidence that removal of Ile152 does not significantly disrupt the structure of the C-terminal helix α4. Interaction of CPA-treated UNC-60B with F-actin was surprisingly different from that of control UNC-60B. Whereas control UNC-60B cosedimented with rabbit muscle F-actin without significantly depolymerizing it (Fig. 2 a, lane 2, compare with lane 1) (40Ono S. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3778-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 42Ono S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), CPA-treated UNC-60B increased the amount of unpolymerized actin in the supernatant and did not cosediment with F-actin (Fig. 2 a, lane 3). Thus, CPA-treated UNC-60B depolymerizes F-actin and prevents re-polymerization. CPA itself did not cause actin depolymerization (Fig. 2 a, lane 4). Furthermore, preincubation of CPA with its inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline, abolished the ability of CPA to change the activity of UNC-60B (Fig. 2 a, lane 5). These results indicate that removal of the C-terminal Ile from UNC-60B converts it from a filament-binding protein to a depolymerizing factor. Nearly complete depolymerization of F-actin was achieved at molar ratios at greater than 1:1 of CPA-treated UNC-60B to actin monomer (Fig. 2 b). CPA-treated UNC-60B also showed enhanced actin depolymerizing activity using C. elegans actin as compared with control UNC-60B (data not shown). Since rabbit muscle actin consists of a single isoform that has been very well characterized, we used rabbit muscle actin in the biochemical experiments to correlate better the biochemical data with the structural interpretation as described below. In contrast to the effects on F-actin, CPA treatment of UNC-60B did not affect its interaction with G-actin. Both control UNC-60B and CPA-treated UNC-60B were resolved as a single band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3, lanes 2–5), whereas actin gave a doublet and smeared bands (Fig. 3,lane 1). When actin and either control or CPA-treated UNC-60B were mixed, a third band appeared (Fig. 3, lanes 6–9, arrows). The intensity of this band increased as the concentration of UNC-60B was increased (Fig. 3, lanes 6–9). This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the intensities of both actin and UNC-60B bands. These results indicate that the third band represents the actin-UNC-60B complex. Results were similar with control or CPA-treated UNC-60B (compare Fig. 3, upper and lower pa"

It involved the immunoblotting measurement of the quantity of these cytokines unbound to a series of different immobilized glycoconjugates and displacement of the bound cytokines with oligosaccharides of known structures. This method allows demonstrating that the following interleukins specifically recognize different oligosaccharide structures in a calcium-independent mechanism: interleukin-1α binds to the biantennary disialylatedN-glycan completed with two Neu5Acα2–3 residues; interleukin-1β to a GM4 sialylated glycolipid Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1-Cer having very long and unusual long-chain bases; interleukin-4 to the 1,7 intramolecular lactone ofN-acetyl-neuraminic acid; interleukin-6 to compounds havingN-linked and O-linked HNK-1-like epitopes; and interleukin-7 to the sialyl-Tn antigen. Because the glycan ligands are rare structures in human circulating cells, it is suggested that such activities could be essential for providing specific signaling systems to cells having both the receptors and the oligosaccharide ligands of the interleukin at their cell surface.

As a general rule, the action of a cytokine results from its binding to membrane receptors, a series of molecules coupled to signaling systems involving kinases and/or phosphatases (1Hatakeyama M.

The binding of a cytokine to its receptor(s) generally results in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the intracytoplasmic domain of the receptor(s), the first step of the signaling. In general, the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism is cell type-specific, the kinases/phosphatases involved in these processes being quite specifically associated with surface molecular complexes different from the cytokine receptor complex (3Shibuya H.

Even when two different cytokines use the same receptor, the signal transduction pathways may be specific of the cytokines (7Miresluis A. Page L.A. Wadhwa M. Thorpe R. Blood. 1995; 86: 2679-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We made the hypothesis that the specific association of interleukin receptors with other surface complexes could be due to carbohydrate-binding properties of these cytokines, a property already suggested in the literature (8Hession C.

The lectin activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2)1 for specific oligomannosides (15Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) appeared to be essential, because IL-2 behaves as a bifunctional molecule able to extracellularly associate its β receptor (IL-2Rβ) to other surface receptor complexes bearingN-glycans recognized by IL-2. This is the case for the CD3·TCR complex in which a N-glycosylated form of CD3 is an IL-2 ligand. This specific extracellular association is responsible for the specific phosphorylation of the IL-2Rβ by the CD3·TCR-associated kinase p56lck (15Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), considered as a first step in the antigen-specific activation process of CD4+ T cells. As a consequence of this carbohydrate-binding property, it was suggested that oligomannosides accumulated in specific diseases or bound to specific microorganisms could alter this essential role of IL-2 (16Zanetta J.-P.

Vitiello F. Vincendon G. Lipids. 1980; 15: 1055-1061Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar); and 8) a mixture of neutral lipids from the human meconium (containing especially globosides and blood group substance glycolipids (42Larson G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), supplemented with galactosylceramides, sulfatides, and asialo-GM1 (see above). Glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans were dissolved in PBS (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.15m NaCl), each at the concentration of 1 mg/ml. Sciatic nerve extract was dissolved (1 mg of protein/ml) in PBS containing 0.1% SDS. Gangliosides and glycolipids were dissolved in methanol (10 μg of hexose/ml of each compound). 50 μl of the previous mixtures were added to the wells and put in an oven at 50 °C until dried. After immobilization, the microwells were washed thrice with 300 μl of PBS and then saturated thrice during 2 h with periodate-treated BSA (pBSA). As reported by Glass et al. (43Glass W.F. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the periodate treatment followed by elimination of excess of periodate with glycerol of BSA, reduced by a factor 100 the quantity of lectin necessary to reveal specific ligands because of the absence of binding to oligosaccharide impurities of BSA (44Zanetta J.-P. Maschke S. Badache A. Gabius H.-J. Lectins and Glycobiology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1993: 182-187Crossref Google Scholar). Wells were washed with PBS and then water and dried at room temperature. The quantity of bound glycoconjugates was calculated from the amount of hexose equivalents determined directly in the microwells using the resorcinol sulfuric acid micromethod (45Monsigny M. Petit C. Roche A.-C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) relative to dilutions of a galactose solution treated in parallel. Measurements of the absorbance were performed using a Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader at 430 nm and applying the coefficient of relative absorbance as reported by the previous authors (45Monsigny M. Petit C. Roche A.-C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A mean value of 0.5 μg galactose equivalent was found for fetuin, ovalbumin, OSM, gangliosides, neutral glycolipids, and RNase B, 1.2 μg for equine submaxillary mucin and the mucin of B. bufo, and 1.5 μg for the mixture of glycosaminoglycans. These quantities of bound glycans remained the same after incubations with the cytokines as determined in the wells after recovery of the supernatant. The wells containing the immobilized glycoconjugates were saturated once as above, washed thrice in PBS, and then supplemented with 50 μl of PBS containing 0.3% pBSA and 5 mm EDTA. Cytokines (0.1–0.5 μg in 5 μl of PBS) were added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a rotatory agitation. The supernatants were carefully recovered and diluted with 25 μl of the Laemmli dissociating buffer (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Samples were placed for 15 min in boiling water. Identical volume aliquots (10–25 μl) corresponding to the same cytokine were submitted to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13% acrylamide) in the presence of SDS (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose (47Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). After saturation with 3% BSA in PBS containing a 1/20 dilution of normal goat serum, blots were revealed using the proper polyclonal anti-cytokine antibody followed by the alkaline phosphatase-labeled second antibody and then staining with the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate reagent (48Leary J.J. Brigati D.J. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The binding of a cytokine to one or several glycoconjugate mixtures was evidenced by its decreased amount on blots. For quantitation, blots were scanned using a Scanjet 4c (Hewlett Packard), and integrations were performed using the Quantiscan 32 software. Because for most cytokines the polyclonal antibodies were allowed to detect down to 10 ng of cytokines, optimal results (difference in intensity between samples for which a binding was observed and the others) were obtained using 50 to 100 ng of cytokines in each incubation. All determinations were performed in triplicate. Incubations in the presence of 0.3% pBSA also reduced nonspecific binding. However, the very high amount of pBSA produced specific electrophoretic artifacts; these were frequently curving of the electrophoretic front and presence of a double band for a single compound. These artifacts could be substantially reduced but not eliminated by decreasing the electric power of the electrophoresis during the concentration step of the sample. Once a binding of a cytokine to a specific mixture was observed, a refinement of the nature of the interaction was performed. The first step consisted in studying the binding of the cytokine to individual glycoconjugates present in the mixture (for example separated RNase B and bLTF for IL-1α or individual mucins for IL-4 and IL-7 or purified glycoproteins for IL-6 or purified gangliosides for IL-1β). When a specific binding to one of these compounds was observed, attempts were made to inhibit this binding first with mixtures of oligosaccharides isolated from the glycoconjugate ligand and then with separated individual oligosaccharides. In crude inhibition assays, oligosaccharides were added to the wells at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in PBS for mixtures, or 1 μg/ml in PBS for purified compounds, prior to addition of the cytokine. For testing the efficiency of the different inhibitory glycans, serial 10-fold dilutions of these compounds in PBS were performed. The rationale of the method used for studying the lectin activities of interleukins was to detect the cytokines unbound to different immobilized glycoconjugates with known glycan structures using an immunoblotting technique as schematized in Fig.1. The reasons for choosing such a method were as follows: 1) because cytokines could loose their carbohydrate-binding properties upon chemical or radiochemical labeling (49Kaplan D. Smith D. Huang R. Yildirim Z. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we used unlabeled recombinant human cytokines having a preserved biological activity; 2) because no precise carbohydrate-binding properties of most cytokines were found in the literature, we studied the binding of cytokines to a large variety of glycoconjugates or mixtures of glycoconjugates, the structure of their glycans being in large part determined; and 3) because the presence of calcium (above 1 mm in Tris-buffered saline) induced a nonspecific fixation of all interleukins to all immobilized glycoconjugates, the experiments were performed in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. Consequently, the data reported in this manuscript were concerned only with Ca2+-independent carbohydrate-binding properties. As shown in Fig. 2 a, IL-1α binds significantly to fetuin and to the mixture of RNase B and bLTF, whereas no binding was observed to the other immobilized glycoconjugates. These data were surprising, because the major glycans of RNase B and bLTF were of the oligomannosidic type, in contrast with fetuin, which contains essentially sialylated O- and N-glycans. When incubations were performed separately on RNase B and bLTF, the binding of IL-1α was observed only to the latter. From the quantity of IL-1α bound to bLTF, it could be calculated that IL-1α binding sites were present on about 7% of the bLTF molecules, a result that indicated that the ligands of IL-1α corresponded to minor glycans of this molecule, as they were minor glycans of fetuin. In fact, theO-glycan fraction obtained from fetuin after reductive β-elimination and Biogel P2 chromatography, as well as the two majorO-glycans of fetuin, were devoid of inhibitory activity, in contrast with the N-glycan-enriched fraction obtained by extensive Pronase digestion of fetuin. However, the purified major triantennary N-glycan of fetuin and the products obtained after its partial or complete desialylation did not show any inhibitory activity. Because bLTF possessed minor biantennary N-glycans with the Neu5Acα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc sequence (35Coddeville B. Strecker G. Wieruszeski J.-M. Vliegenthart J.F.G. van Halbeck H. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Spik G. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 145-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we tested the inhibitory activity of this compound. As for the previous ones, no significant inhibitory activity was obtained at the 10−4m concentration range. We therefore tested a variety of biantennary oligosaccharides isolated from the urine of patients with sialidoses (25Strecker G. Peers M.C. Michalski J.-C. Hondi-Assah T. Fournet B. Spik G. Montreuil J. Farriaux J.-P. Maroteaux P. Durand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Florea D. Maes E. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 302: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The one containing two α2,6-linked Neu5Ac residues was ineffective at 10−4m, whereas the binding of IL-1α was completely inhibited using 10−6m of the biantennary N-glycan containing two α2,3-linked Neu5Ac residues (Fig. 2, b and c). A quasi-equimolar mixture of the two isomers of biantennaryN-glycans containing α2,3- and α2,6-linked Neu5Ac residues showed a weak inhibition only at the 10−4m concentration range. Therefore, it was concluded that IL-1α is a calcium-independent lectin endowed with a higher affinity for the biantennary N-glycan having the Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1, 4GlcNAcβ1,2 sequence on its two branches (Fig.2 d). Previous authors (8Hession C. Decker J.M. Sherblom A.P. Kumar S. Yue C.C. Mattallano R.J. Tizard R. Kawashima E. Schmeissner U. Heletky S. Chow E.P. Burne C.A. Shaw A. Muchmore A.V. Science. 1987; 237: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) reported that IL-1α was able to bind to uromodulin, a urine glycoprotein rich in sialylatedN-glycans, the binding being inhibited by the bulk of glycopeptides isolated by Pronase digestion of fetuin. These authors suggested that IL-1α was a lectin specific for the major glycan of fetuin, the trisialylated triantennary N-glycan. Our experiments demonstrated that the inhibitor of the interaction was not the previous glycan but the biantennary N-glycan with two α2,3-linked Neu5Ac residues. 50% inhibition of the binding to fetuin was obtained using 0.5–1 μm of this compound,i.e. 100–200-fold higher efficiency than the total N-glycans of fetuin. The reason why the biantennaryN-glycan was a high affinity ligand, whereas α2,3-sialyl-lactose or the mixture of the linear monoantennary α2,3-sialylated glycan isolated from patients with sialidosis (25Strecker G. Peers M.C. Michalski J.-C. Hondi-Assah T. Fournet B. Spik G. Montreuil J. Farriaux J.-P. Maroteaux P. Durand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,26Florea D. Maes E. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 302: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was ineffective, remained speculative. This might be related to the tendency of IL-1α to associate into dimers, with each subunit being able to bind one of the branches of the biantennaryN-glycan. Such a specifically increased affinity upon formation of oligomers of lectins was previously demonstrated for the asialo-fetuin receptor (50Ozaki K. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Kawasaki T. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IL-1β binds only significantly to the fraction containing the mixture of gangliosides isolated from the rat cerebellum (Fig. 3 a). Because these gangliosides were previously fractionated according to their charges by ion-exchange chromatography (20Zanetta J.-P. Vitiello F. Vincendon G. Lipids. 1980; 15: 1055-1061Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we examined the binding of IL-1β to the different classes of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasialo-gangliosides, respectively. Only the monosialo-ganglioside fraction showed a binding of IL-1β (Fig. 3 b). The different constituents of the fraction of monosialo-gangliosides isolated by preparative TLC (20Zanetta J.-P. Vitiello F. Vincendon G. Lipids. 1980; 15: 1055-1061Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were immobilized individually. As shown in Fig. 3 c, IL-1β binds to a single fraction, previously identified as the sialylated galactosylceramide GM4 (20Zanetta J.-P. Vitiello F. Vincendon G. Lipids. 1980; 15: 1055-1061Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This binding was surprising, because GM4 is a very simple sialylated glycolipid, Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1-Cer. It was therefore expected that the binding could be inhibited by small oligosaccharides with similar structures. In fact, sialyl-lactoses (with α2,3- or α2,6-linked Neu5Ac) were without inhibitory effects at the concentration of 10−3m. Because it was described that IL-1β binds to glycolipids of GPI anchors (13Fukushima K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Ideo H. Inazu T. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10579-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the GM4 sample used in this study was contaminated by GPIs. This possibility was ruled ou"

The cellular response to heat shock involves an elevated expression of highly conserved proteins referred to as the heat shock proteins (HSPs)1. The HSPs are known to function as molecular chaperones during protein folding/assembly and membrane translocation and to prevent aggregation of misfolded polypeptide chains in cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Welch W.J. Kang H.S. Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 31-55PubMed Google Scholar and2Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). They are also involved in protection against stress-induced apoptosis (3Mosser D.D. Carone A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The HSPs can be induced by other proteotoxic stresses such as l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Azc), a proline analog, and heavy metals (1Welch W.J. Kang H.S. Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 31-55PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the HSPs is mediated through the activation of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF), which binds to and activates a conserved regulatory site, the heat shock element (HSE), located in the promoters of heat-inducible HSP genes (for review, see Refs. 4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar and 5Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, HSFs 1–4 have been identified: HSFs 1, 2, and 4 are ubiquitous, whereas HSF3 has been characterized only in avian species (5Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Under nonstressful conditions, HSF1 exist as a non-DNA-binding form in complex with other regulatory proteins such as HSP90 an HSP70, which are believed to function as repressors of HSF1 activation in the absence of stress (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 5Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 6Abravaya K.

It has been suggested that nonnative polypeptides accumulated by heat shock and proteotoxic stresses function as a common proximal inducer of HSF1 activation and HSP expression (1Welch W.J. Kang H.S.

In stressed cells, misfolded proteins may compete with HSF1 for binding chaperone HSP70, and unbound HSF1 homotrimerizes, becomes transcriptionally competent and is hyperphosphorylated (4Wu C. Annu.

Although protein kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and JNK have been demonstrated to down-regulate HSF1 activation in response to heat shock (12Chu B.

Here we show that a distinct signal pathway(s) involving Rac1 may be implicated in HSF and JNK activation in response to heat shock. We also demonstrate that Rac1 may be linked to HSF activation by denaturation of polypeptides by other proteotoxic stresses such as Azc and heavy metals. However, Rac1N17 did not prevent phosphorylation of HSF1 in response to these proteotoxic stresses. Although moderate heat shock induced membrane translocation and membrane ruffling in a Rac1-dependent manner, a constitutively active Rac1V12 did not activate the HSF, while it stimulated the JNK activity. These results suggest that a signal pathway(s) involving Rac1 may be directly and indirectly linked to heat shock-induced JNK and HSF activation, respectively. Rat-2 fibroblast cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL 1764) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Rat-2 stable clones expressing a dominant negative Rac1N17 were prepared as described previously (32Shin E.A. Kim K.H. Han S.I. Ha K.S. Kim J.H. Kang K.I. Kim H.D. Kang H.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). pEXV-Myc and pEXV-Myc-Rac1N17 plasmids (gifts from Dr. Alan Hall) were expressed as N-terminally 9E10 epitope-tagged derivatives under SV40 promoter (25Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). Rat-2 cells were stably cotransfected with pEXV-Rac1N17 or control vector plasmid, pEXV, along with the NeoR gene, and clones were selected and expanded in the presence of G418 (500 μg/ml). For preparation of constitutively active Rac1V12 cells, full-length wild type Rac1 cDNA was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and Gly-to-Val mutagenesis at codon 12 of the Rac1 cDNA was achieved using a mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pcDNA3.1-Rac1V12 plasmid was expressed under CMV promoter. Rat-2 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-Rac1V12 or control vector plasmid, pcDNA3.1, and clones were selected and expanded in the presence of G418. Expression of mutant Rac1 proteins was determined by Western blotting with anti-Rac1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Metabolic labeling, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (32Shin E.A. Kim K.H. Han S.I. Ha K.S.

Cells (1 × 106 cells) were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the pellet rapidly frozen at −80 °C. After thawing the pellet on ice, it was suspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT). The pellet was resuspended in modified buffer A (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 0 °C. The nuclei were gently resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were diluted to modified buffer D (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −80 °C. Between steps the samples were kept on ice. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the HSE consensus sequence (5′-GATCCTCGAATGTTCGCGAAAAG-3′) were labeled using Klenow polymerase (Promega) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml). 20 μg of nuclear protein was preincubated for 15 min at 0 °C in 17 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and protease inhibitors (mixture solution; Sigma). Thereafter, binding reaction was performed for 40 min at room temperature with 200 nCi of radioisotope-labeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 20 μl. HSF·HSE complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% acrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:1) gel at 30 mA for 1 h. Prior to sample loading, the gel was run for 30 min at 20 mA. After electrophoresis, the gel was exposed to an x-ray film for 12–24 h at −80 °C. For EMSSA, nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-HSF1 (SPA-901, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.) up to 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of reaction mixture containing the radioisotope-labeled HSE and analyzed by electrophoresis in a similar fashion to EMSA. JNK activity was determined as described in Shin et al. (32Shin E.A. Kim K.H. Han S.I. Ha K.S. Kim J.H. Kang K.I. Kim H.D. Kang H.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rat-2 cells were lysed with buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 nm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and the cell extracts incubated with anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h and then protein A-agarose for an additional 1 h. After centrifugation, the precipitates were incubated in the mixture of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DDT, 100 mm MgCl2, [32P]ATP, and 4 μl of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun at 30 °C for 30 min. To stop the reaction, 4 × Laemmli sample buffer was added to the precipitates and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Rat-2 cells were grown on round coverslips in multiwell culture plates and exposed to epidermal growth factor (EGF, 100 ng/ml) and heat shock for 10 min. The cells were fixed with 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min on ice. The fixed cells were then permeabilized by incubating in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min on ice. For actin staining, the cells were incubated with 0.165 m NBD-phallacidin for 30 min at room temperature. The stained cells were washed three times in PBS for 15 min and mounted on slide glasses with gelvitol, which was prepared by mixing 100 ml of 23% polyvinyl alcohol in PBS with 50 ml glycerol. For Rac1 staining, the permeabilized cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin containing several drops of horse serum in TBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with TBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST), the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed five times in TBST and mounted on slide glasses with crystal mount. Then the stained cells were observed under a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). To test the possible involvement of Rac1 in the heat shock response, we prepared and characterized Rat-2 fibroblast cells expressing either a dominant negative Rac1N17 or a constitutively active Rac1V12 (32Shin E.A. Kim K.H. Han S.I. Ha K.S. Kim J.H. Kang K.I. Kim H.D. Kang H.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-Rac1 antibody was used in Western blotting of cell extracts to detect simultaneously the amounts of mutant and endogenous Rac1. Because of the tag, Rac1 mutants had a slower electrophoretic mobility than endogenous Rac1. The expression levels of mutant Rac1 proteins were similar to that of endogenous Rac1 (Fig.1 A). Expression of Rac1V12 in which amino acid 12 was substituted to Val significantly stimulated the JNK activity, while expression of Rac1N17 in which residue 17 was changed to Asn reduced the JNK activity (Fig. 1 A). Similar results have been reported by several investigators in different cell lines (27Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenström P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 28Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Rac1 has been shown to play a role in mitogen signaling; when injected into quiescent cells, Rac1V12 stimulates cell cycle progression through G1 and DNA synthesis, while Rac1N17 blocks serum-induced DNA synthesis (21Van Aelst L. Dsouza-Achorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar, 26Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A.

In agreement with these results, Rac1V12 cells exhibited an increased cell growth, whereas Rac1N17 cells showed a decreased cell proliferation (Fig.1 B). In addition, upon stimulation of cells with EGF, Rac1N17 cells did not show any changes in actin filaments, whereas normal cells exhibited extensive membrane ruffling within 10 min, followed by stress fiber formation (32Shin E.A. Kim K.H. Han S.I. Ha K.S. Kim J.H. Kang K.I. Kim H.D. Kang H.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test whether Rac1 is activated by heat shock, we examined its membrane translocation by confocal microscopy using anti-Rac1 antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, exposure of Rat-2 cells to moderate heat shock (40 °C) induced membrane translocation of Rac1, similar to that in cells treated with EGF. Similar results were obtained in cells exposed to either 39 or 41 °C (data not shown). Since Rac1 mediates growth factor-induced membrane ruffling and lamellipodia (22Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 23Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5165) Google Scholar, 25Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar), we examined alterations in the actin structure in response to heat shock (39–44 °C) by confocal microscopy using NBD-phallacidin, a probe specific for F-actin. As exposed to heat shock for 10 min, membrane ruffling was observed (Fig.2 B). Heat shock-induced ruffling pattern was different depending on the heat shock temperature. Mild heat shock (39–41 °C)-induced ruffling was similar to that observed in growth factor-treated cells (22Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 23Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5165) Google Scholar, 25Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar), whereas severe heat shock (43–44 °C)-induced ruffling was similar to that in cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator (34Myat M.M. Anderson S. Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1N17 inhibited membrane ruffling in response to mild, but not to severe, heat shock (Fig. 2 B). In addition, protein kinase C inhibitors, H7 and staurosporine, did not exert inhibitory effects on severe heat shock-induced ruffling, indicating that protein kinase C is not likely involved in the severe heat shock-induced actin reorganization (data not shown). These results suggest that mild heat shock-induced actin ruffling may occur via a Rac1 signal pathway, while severe heat shock-induced actin remolding is likely regulated by a Rac1- and protein kinase C-independent mechanism. It was examined whether Rac1 participates in heat shock-induced JNK activation. Heat shock activated JNK in time- and temperature-dependent manners (Fig.3) (18Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Rac1N17 completely inhibited moderate (39–41 °C) heat shock-induced JNK activation, but it partially inhibited severe (43 °C) heat shock-induced JNK activation. Thus, a distinct signal pathway involving Rac1 may mediate JNK activation by mild heat shock, whereas a Rac1-independent pathway as well as Rac1 signal pathway may be responsible for JNK activation by severe heat shock. We also investigated whether Rac1 is involved in heat shock-induced HSF activation. Heat shock highly enhanced the synthesis of HSP70 and HSP90 as described previously (1Welch W.J. Kang H.S. Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 31-55PubMed Google Scholar), and Rac1N17 significantly prevented the heat shock-induced HSP expression, while unaffecting synthesis of other proteins (Fig.4). As shown in Fig.5 A and demonstrated by others (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 5Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 6Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 7: 1153-1164Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar), HSF1 was involved in the heat shock-induced HSP expression. Rac1N17 significantly inhibited heat shock-induced HSF1 activation (Fig. 5 B), without affecting the level of HSF1 (Fig.5 C). However, as the heat shock temperature was elevated or heat shock was imposed for prolonged period, an inhibitory effect of Rac1N17 was diminished (Figs. 4 and 5 B). These results suggest that Rac1 may be required in heat shock-induced HSP expression and HSF1 activation, although the Rac1-independent mechanism also participates in severe heat shock response.Figure 5Inhibition by Rac1N17 of heat shock-induced HSF1 activation. A, Rat-2 wild type cells were exposed to 42 °C for 20 min. Twenty μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated in the absence or presence of anti-HSF1 antibody and incubated with 32P-labeled HSE consensus sequence (5′-GATCCTCGAATGTTCGCGAAAAG-3′) in a DNA binding buffer. After separation on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. B, Rat-2 wild type (WT) and Rac1N17 cells were exposed to either 42 °C for the times indicated or exposed to various temperatures for 20 min. Twenty μg of nuclear proteins were then incubated with32P-labeled HSE and analyzed by EMSA. Binding reaction was also done with nuclear extracts from wild type cells exposed to 45 °C heat shock in the presence of 100-fold excess of competitor DNA (×100 HSE). C, wild type (WT) and Rac1N17 Rat cells were cultured at normal growth condition and the cellular proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HSF1 (Neo markers).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been suggested that mild heat shock induces denaturation of only nascent polypeptides, while severe heat shock causes misfolding of both cellular proteins and nascent polypeptides (35Baler R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Rac1 may be linked to HSF1 activation by denaturation of nascent polypeptides. First, we tried to confirm whether HSF1 activation in response to mild heat shock response is linked with the regulation of protein synthesis. As demonstrated by others (35Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Tanabe M. Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), preincubation with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, significantly blocked HSF1 activation in response to moderate heat shock of 39–41 °C, but not to severe heat shock of 43–45 °C (Fig. 6 A). We also examined the effects of cycloheximide on HSF1 activation in response to Azc, which causes denaturation of only nascent polypeptides. As shown in Fig. 6 A, Azc-induced HSF1 activation was significantly inhibited by cycloheximide. With other's previous results (35Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Tanabe M. Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), these results support that mild heat shock only affects the proteins being newly synthesized, whereas severe heat shock causes misfolding of nascent polypeptides as well as proteins preexisting in cells. It was then examined whether Rac1 is involved in HSF activation by denaturation of nascent polypeptides. Azc-induced HSF1 activation was prevented by Rac1N17 (Fig. 6 B). However, Rac1N17 also prevented HSF (possibly HSF1) activation by CdCl2 (Fig.6 B), which is thought to cause denaturation of both nascent polypeptides and proteins preexisting in cells. Furthermore, Rac1N17 also prevented HSF1 activation in response to heat shock of 43 °C, at which cycloheximide did not exert an inhibitory effect on HSF1 activation (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). Taking these results together, we suggest that Rac1 may be linked to activation of HSF1 by denaturation of cellular polypeptides in response to a variety of proteotoxic stresses, including heat shock, amino acid analogs, and heavy metals. HSF1 has been known to be hyperphosphorylated upon exposure to proteotoxic stresses such as heat shock and heavy metals (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Catabolite repression regulates transcription initiation, whereas excess tryptophan induces antitermination at Rho factor-dependent termination sites in the leader region of the operon. Synthesis of the leader peptide, TnaC, is essential for antitermination. BoxA and rut sites in the immediate vicinity of the tnaC stop codon are required for termination. In this paper we use an in vitro S-30 cell-free system to analyze the features of tna operon regulation. We show that transcription initiation is cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent and is not influenced by tryptophan. Continuation of transcription beyond the leader region requires the presence of inducing levels of tryptophan and synthesis of the TnaC leader peptide. Using a tnaA′-′trpE fusion, we demonstrate that induction results in a 15–20-fold increase in synthesis of the tryptophan-free TnaA-TrpE fusion protein. Replacing Trp codon 12 oftnaC by an Arg codon, or changing the tnaCstart codon to a stop codon, eliminates induction. Addition of bicyclomycin, a specific inhibitor of Rho factor action, substantially increases basal level expression. Analyses of tna mRNA synthesis in vitro demonstrate that, in the absence of inducer transcription is terminated and the terminated transcripts are degraded. In the presence of inducer, antitermination increases the synthesis of the read-through transcript. TnaC synthesis is observed in the cell-free system. However, in the presence of tryptophan, a peptidyl-tRNA also appears, TnaC-tRNAPro. Our findings suggest that inducer acts by preventing cleavage of TnaC peptidyl-tRNA. The ribosome associated with this newly synthesized peptidyl-tRNA presumably stalls at the tnaC stop codon, blocking Rho's access to the BoxA and rut sites, thereby preventing termination. 1-Methyltryptophan also is an effective inducerin vitro.

Degradation allows organisms to utilize tryptophan as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy (1Kazarinoff M.N. Snell E.E. J. Biol.

The tryptophanase reaction is reversible; thus,l-tryptophan can be formed from indole andl-serine, l-cysteine, or pyruvate and ammonia (3Newton W.A. Snell E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The tna operon of Escherichia colicontains two major structural genes, tnaA, encoding tryptophanase, and tnaB, specifying a low affinity tryptophan permease (5Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. J.

The tna operon promoter is separated from the tnaA structural gene by a 319-nucleotide leader region. This region encodes a 24-residue peptide, TnaC, that is essential for induction. Transcription of the tna operon is regulated by the combined action of catabolite repression and tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination. Regulation by catabolite repression requires the catabolite gene activator protein plus cyclic AMP, and is tryptophan-independent (5Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. J.

Transcription termination/antitermination in the leader region of the operon is regulated in response to high levels of tryptophan. Studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that in the absence of tryptophan, transcription is subject to Rho-dependent termination at several transcription pause sites located betweentnaC and tnaA (9Stewart V.

In the presence of inducing levels of tryptophan, termination at these sites is prevented (10Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Specifically, inactivating the tnaC start codon, replacing the single Trp residue of TnaC with a different amino acid, or introducing several other amino acid changes in TnaC, prevents induction (13Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1M. Eshoo and C. Yanofsky, unpublished data. 1M. Eshoo and C. Yanofsky, unpublished data. BoxA and rut sites located immediately adjacent to the tnaC stop codon are essential for Rho-dependent termination; alteration of either of these sites reduces termination (14Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. J Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3981-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the basis of these and other findings, it has been proposed that, in the presence of inducer, TnaC acts in cis on its associated translating ribosome to inhibit its release at the tnaC stop codon. Inhibition of ribosome release could block Rho's access to the BoxA orrut sites of the transcript and thereby prevent transcription termination (15Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gish K. Yanofsky C. J.

To define the roles of TnaC, tryptophan, and Rho factor in regulation of tna operon expression, we developed a cell-free S-30 system in which regulation of tna operon could be studied. In this paper we show that the major regulatory features oftna operon observed in vivo can be duplicatedin vitro. We examined transcription under inducing and noninducing conditions and demonstrate that in the absence of inducer transcription terminates at several sites in the leader region, and the terminated transcripts are then degraded. In the presence of tryptophan transcription pausing is observed, but the paused transcripts subsequently are elongated. We also detected and analyzed the synthesis and fate of the TnaC peptide. We show that tryptophan induction leads to the accumulation of TnaC-tRNAPro. This finding implicates tryptophan-induced inhibition of cleavage of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro as the event crucial to induction. A derivative of the E. coli A19 RNaseI− strain containing trpRΔlacZ ΔtrpEA2 tnaAbgl::Tn10, was constructed and used as the source of cell-free S-30 extracts. E. coli DH5 α was occasionally employed for amplification of plasmids. All plasmid DNAs were purified by banding twice in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradients. Plasmid pGF4 was constructed by inserting aHindIII-BamHI fragment containing atnaA′-′trpE translational fusion from pKG3 (constructed by Kirt Gish) into pBR322. pGF14 and pGF71 were constructed by replacing the HindIII-NsiI fragment of pGF4 containing thetna promoter through the ATG start codon of tnaA by an homologous fragment from pPDG14 and pPDG71 (constructed by P. Gollnick), respectively. In pPDG14, tnaC Trp codon 12 is replaced by an Arg codon; in pPDG71 the tnaC ATG start codon is replaced by TAG. Plasmid pPDG52 (constructed by P. Gollnick) contains a tnaC′-′lacZ translational fusion. pGF24 was constructed by cloning the PstI-BamHI fragment containing E. coli rpoBC“t” from plasmid pSVS24 (constructed by V. Stewart) into pUC18. pGF1 was constructed by ligating a PCR2 fragment (with an engineered HindIII site at its 5′ end and aPstI site at its 3′ end) containing the region from −195 to +6 (relative to tna transcription initiation site) into pGF24 (HindIII and PstI sites). pGF25–00 was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment (with an engineeredHindIII site at the 5′ end and a PstI site at the 3′ end) containing the region from −190 to +306 into pGF24 (HindIII and PstI sites). To facilitate clean transcription and translation, we prepared circular DNA templates. We performed PCR on plasmid pGF25–00 and amplified the region from −160 upstream of tna promoter to a site just beyond the rpoBC terminator. We used two oligonucleotides, ECOR-160 (5′-ACGGAATTCCTGTTATTCCTCAACCC-3′) and RPOC-ECOR (5′-ACGGAATTCCTTGCCGAGTTTGACTC-3′). EcoRI sites were introduced at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of this fragment. The fragment was digested with EcoRI and then circularized with T4 DNA ligase, resulting in CF-tna+306rpoBC“t”. Using plasmid pGF1 as template and the same procedure, CF-tna+6rpoBC“t” was constructed. 2–3 μg of CF-tna+306rpoBC“t” or CF-tna+6rpoBC“t” were used in each 50-μl S-30 reaction. S-30 extracts were prepared according to Zubay (18Zubay G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1973; 7: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, the standard coupled transcription/translation reaction mixture (with a total volume of 50 μl) contains 35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm each of CTP, UTP, and GTP, 20 mm phosphoenol pyruvate (trisodium salt), 0.25 mg/ml E. coli tRNA (Sigma), 0.3 unit/ml pyruvate kinase, 35 mg/ml polyethylene glycol (8000), 20 μg/ml folinic acid, 1 mm cyclic AMP, 200 μm each of 19 amino acids, with varying amounts of added l-tryptophan, and plasmid DNA or a circularized DNA fragment. All reactions were performed at 37 °C. To measure plasmid-directed β-galactosidase and TnaA-TrpE synthesis, reaction mixtures were incubated for 40 min (except in time-course experiment). In protein labeling experiments, the unlabeled amino acid was replaced by 20 μCi of [35S]methionine, [3H]isoleucine, [3H]proline, [3H]tyrosine, or [3H]tryptophan (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1000 Ci/mmol). Details are presented in the legends. At the end of the incubation, a 5-μl aliquot was removed, precipitated with five volumes of cold acetone, and pellets were analyzed by Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE) (19Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). To measure RNA synthesis, unlabeled UTP was omitted from the incubation mixture. After 10 min of preincubation at 37 °C, 20 μCi of [α-33P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1000–3000 Ci/mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and samples were taken after another 10 min, and extracted with phenol. A 5-μl aliquot was analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. For single-round transcription (coupled with translation) assays, after 10 min of incubation at 37 °C in the absence of added CTP and UTP, 50 μCi of [α-33P]UTP, 200 μm CTP, and 200 μg/ml rifampicin were added at the same time. Samples were taken at different intervals. After CF-tna+306rpoBC“t” directed cell-free transcription and translation (20 μCi of [35S]methionine, labeling for 20 min), reactions were stopped by acetone precipitation, centrifuged, and the pellets boiled in SDS gel loading buffer for 3 min. Samples were separated electrophoretically on a 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The 25-kDa band was localized by autoradiography, excised, and recovered by immersion in a low pH buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mmNaCl) overnight at 4 °C. The recovered 25-kDa molecules were used as RT-PCR template with an Access RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Two oligonucleotides specific for tRNAPro (tRNApro-Plus, 5′-CGGCACGTAGCGCAGCCTGGTAGC-3′; tRNApro-Minus, 5′-TGGTCGGCACGAGAGGATTTGAAC-3′) were used. A S-30 reaction without the CF-tna+306rpoBC“t” template was also loaded on the same gel, and the corresponding band was recovered as a negative control for RT-PCR. For RNase digestion and proteinase K treatment, the recovered 25-kDa molecules were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μg of RNase A/ml or 50 μg of proteinase K/ml, mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS gel loading buffer, and separated on a 10% Tricine-SDS protein gel. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described (20Lesley S.A. Tymms M.J. Methods in Molecular Biology: In Vitro Transcription and Translation Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 265-278Google Scholar). Anthranilate synthase activity was determined fluorometrically by measuring the conversion of chorismate plus glutamine to anthranilate (21Yanofsky C. Horn V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated as fluorometer units produced per 50 μl of cell-free reaction mixture following a 20-min incubation at 37 °C. Fluorometer units were based on the following standard; 5 μl of a 1 mm solution of anthranilic acid were added to a tube containing the standard 0.5-ml reaction mixture, and the tube was incubated and processed with the assay tubes. Following acidification and extraction of anthranilate with ethyl acetate, the ethyl acetate extract from the standard tube was set at 100 fluorometer units. A blank reaction tube was treated similarly, and the ethyl acetate extract was set at zero. Fluorometer units were then determined for each assayed sample. In previous studies it was shown that initiation of transcription of the tna operon is regulated by catabolite repression (8Botsford J.L. DeMoss R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 303-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A presumed cAMP-CAP complex binding site is located just upstream of the −35 region of the tnapromoter (5Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pPDG52 contains a tnaC′-′lacZtranslational fusion (Fig.1 A). This plasmid DNA was used as a reporter to examine catabolite repression-dependent expression of the tna operon in vitro. In this construct most of the tna leader region had been removed; thus, expression from the promoter could be tested independently of the effects of the tna operon downstream region and attenuation. The data in Table I show that, in the absence of cAMP and presence of added tryptophan, β-galactosidase activity was almost undetectable. By contrast, in the presence of cAMP and absence of added tryptophan, high levels of β-galactosidase were produced. Addition of tryptophan increased β-galactosidase production less than 2-fold. These results suggest that expression oftnaC′-′lacZ construct in this cell-free system is cAMP-dependent, and that tryptophan produced by protein turnover provides most of the tryptophan required for β-galactosidase synthesis. The less than 2-fold increase observed upon addition of tryptophan is probably not regulatory; it presumably is due to increased completion of synthesis of the 1024-residue β-galactosidase monomer, which contains 39 Trp residues.Table IExpression of tnaC′-′lacZ and tnaA′-′trpE gene fusions in vitroPlasmid (5 nm)Gene fusioncAMP (1 mm)Enzymatic activities−Trp+Trp+1MTpPDG52tnaC′-′lacZ−<1<1NDpPDG52tnaC′-′lacZ+2540NDpBR322+<0.1<0.1<0.1pGF4tnaA′-′trpE−434pGF4tnaA′-′trpE+21358 (17) 1-aThe induction ratios observed upon addition of 300 μm l-tryptophan (Trp) ordl-1-methytryptophan (1MT) are shown in parentheses.405 (20) 1-aThe induction ratios observed upon addition of 300 μm l-tryptophan (Trp) ordl-1-methytryptophan (1MT) are shown in parentheses.In vitro S-30 reaction conditions and enzyme assay procedures are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each assay was performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions, and the average is given here.1-a The induction ratios observed upon addition of 300 μm l-tryptophan (Trp) ordl-1-methytryptophan (1MT) are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab In vitro S-30 reaction conditions and enzyme assay procedures are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each assay was performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions, and the average is given here. To study tryptophan induction of tna operon expression in vitro, we prepared a special construct, pGF4, containing the intact tna promoter-leader region followed by a translational fusion of the initial segment of tnaA fused to trpE of E. coli (Fig. 1 B). The resulting fusion protein TnaA-TrpE would be tryptophan-free; thus,in vitro synthesis could be examined in the absence as well as the presence of tryptophan. The strain used to prepare the S-30 extract carried a trpR mutation and a trpEdeletion; this extract has high levels of TrpG-D but no TrpE enzyme activity. As expected, expression of the tnaA′-′trpE fusion was cAMP-dependent; without cAMP, very low levels of TnaA-TrpE enzyme activity were detected either in the absence or presence of tryptophan (Table I). In the presence of cAMP, addition of 300 μm tryptophan led to a 17-fold increase in synthesis of the TnaA-TrpE protein. Addition of a tryptophan analog, 1MT, also led to a 20-fold increase (Table I). We believe that the increase in tryptophan-free TnaA-TrpE protein synthesis in the presence of tryptophan, or 1MT, is due to their action as inducers of antitermination in the leader region. We also examined the effects of tryptophan addition on TnaA-TrpE synthesis by measuring [35S]methionine incorporation into the TnaA-TrpE protein, following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Template plasmid pGF4 contains a β-lactamase gene, which also is expressed in vitro; β-lactamase has four tryptophan residues, and therefore serves as an excellent internal reference to monitor the availability of charged tRNATrp for protein synthesis. In Fig. 2 it can be seen that there was no significant effect of tryptophan addition on β-lactamase production. This suggests that there are appropriate levels of charged tRNATrp (tryptophan presumably generated by protein turnover) for synthesis of proteins like β-lactamase, even in the absence of added tryptophan. A 25-fold increase in TnaA-TrpE synthesis was observed in the presence of 300 μmtryptophan; synthesis was assessed by counting the Cerenkov radiation of 35S-labeled TnaA-TrpE bands (Fig. 2, lane 5 versus lane 2) on the SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). This increase agrees with the values in Table I, and suggests that the ASase assay results accurately reflect the levels of TnaA-TrpE protein produced in this S-30 system. It was shown previously, in vivo, that synthesis of the intact TnaC peptide containing its crucial Trp residue is essential for tryptophan induction of tna operon expression (13Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1 To verify the role of tnaC translation in induction of thetna operon in the S-30 system, Trp codon 12 (TGG) andtnaC start codon (ATG) in the tnaA′-′trpEconstruct were replaced by an Arg codon (CGG) and a stop codon (TAG), respectively. Replacing the tnaC start codon by a stop codon (pGF71, Fig. 1 B) should eliminate leader peptide synthesis. Basal level expression by this plasmid was decreased 5-fold relative to that of the wild type plasmid pGF4, and induction by tryptophan was abolished (Table II). Replacing Trp codon 12 by an Arg codon (pGF14, Fig. 1 B) should allow peptide synthesis to proceed to the normal TGA stop codon of tnaC, generating an altered peptide. TnaA-TrpE production directed by pGF14 was decreased 3–4-fold compared with that of the wild typetnaA′-′trpE fusion plasmid pGF4, and was not inducible by tryptophan (Table II). Addition of arginine had no effect on expression of pGF14 (TnaC Trp12 → Arg), confirming the in vivo finding that induction is not simply dependent on high concentrations of the amino acid encoded by codon 12 (13). These results suggest that translation of tnaC, and incorporation of Trp at codon position 12, are essential in establishing the basal level of tna operon expression, and for tryptophan induction, in vitro.Table IIEffect of added tryptophan and bicyclomycin on expression of tnaA′-′trpE plasmidstnaA′-′trpE plasmid (5 nm)tnaCmutationASase-specific activity 2-aThe induction ratios observed with 300 μm Trp are shown in parentheses.−Trp+Trp+BC 2-bBC, 50 μg/ml bicyclomycin.+Trp and BCpBR322<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1pGF4Wild type20360 (18)380453pGF71ATG to TAG45 (1.3)348ND 2-cND, not determined.pGF14Trp12 to Arg65 (0.8)360NDIn vitro S-30 reaction conditions and the ASase assay procedure are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each assay was performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions, and the average is given here.2-a The induction ratios observed with 300 μm Trp are shown in parentheses.2-b BC, 50 μg/ml bicyclomycin.2-c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In vitro S-30 reaction conditions and the ASase assay procedure are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each assay was performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions, and the average is given here. Bicyclomycin is a specific inhibitor of E. coli Rho factor. This antibiotic inhibits the poly(C)-stimulated ATPase activity of E. coli Rho factor (22Park H.G. Zhang X. Moon H.S. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, it has been shown that bicyclomycin increases basal level expression of the tna operon in vivo (24Yanofsky C. Horn V. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of an appropriate concentration of this antibiotic directly to the S-30 system should therefore inhibit Rho factor activity and increase basal level expression of the tna operon. To examine this possibility, 50 μg/ml bicyclomycin was added in vitro with tnaA′-′trpE plasmids that did or did not have tnaC mutations. Bicyclomycin relieved Rho-dependent termination in the tna operon, irrespective of whether an intact TnaC peptide could be synthesized (Table II). To optimize reaction conditions, we examined three variables: reaction time, plasmid pGF4 concentration, and the concentration of inducer. Fig.3 A presents the results of a time-course experiment performed in the presence of inducer. TnaA-TrpE enzyme activity was observed to increase linearly for 40 min, whereupon it began to level off. In the absence of inducer, there was no significant increase in TnaA-TrpE activity. Plasmid concentration was varied, as shown in Fig. 3 B. When 5 nm pGF4 was present, there was 18-fold induction by 300 μmtryptophan. Increasing the pGF4 plasmid concentration to 10 nm elevated basal level expression appreciably, and there was only 1.2-fold induction by added tryptophan. When the pGF4 plasmid concentration was increased to 15 nm or greater, basal level expression increased further and there was no significant effect of added tryptophan. These results are consistent with the intensities of the TnaA-TrpE bands observed on a SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2, comparelanes 7 and 8); when 15 nmpGF4 was used, the [35S]methionine-labeled TnaA-TrpE protein bands in lane 7 (without added tryptophan) and lane 8 (with 300 μmtryptophan) were indistinguishable. These data suggest that the S-30 system employed is limiting for some component required for efficient transcription termination under noninducing condition. 1MT, an analog of tryptophan, effectively induces tna operon expression in vivo (25Yanofsky C. Horn V. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6009-6017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that 1MT inducestna operon without being charged onto tRNATrp or being incorporated into protein (see below) (13Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of varying 1MT concentration on TnaA-TrpE production in our S-30 system is shown in Fig. 3 C. A concentration of 0.5–1 mm was sufficient to fully induce tna operon expression; maximum induction provided a 23-fold increase in ASase-specific activity over that observed in the absence of added 1MT. Increasing the tryptophan concentration from 50 μm to 300 μm (Fig. 2,lane 4 versus lane 5) also led to a significant increase in TnaA-TrpE production. Since tryptophanyl-tRNA synthase has a relatively high affinity for tryptophan (K m of 5 × 10−5m; Ref. 26Squires C.L. Rose J.K. Yanofsky C. Yang H.L. Zubay G. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 245: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the tRNATrp in our S-30 should be fully charged in the presence of 50 μm added tryptophan. Taken together, these findings suggest that tna induction is not based on the extent of charging of tRNATrp. One unexpected finding was that, when the concentration of plasmid pGF4 was increased from 5 to 15 nm, basal level expression oftnaA′-′trpE increased dramatically (Fig. 3 B). This observation suggests that a factor(s) responsible for (or participating in) basal level expression in the S-30 system might be limiting, or titrated out. To determine whether increased translation of tnaC is responsible for this presumed titration effect, constructs with mutations in tnaC that prevent induction were tested. It can be seen in Table IIIthat, with 15 nm pGF71 (or pGF14) (Fig. 1 B) as template, the results obtained are similar to those observed with pGF4 (Fig. 3 B). These findings indicate that translation oftnaC is not responsible for the apparent titration effect.Table IIIAddition of purified Rho lowers basal level expression when high concentrations of tnaA′-′trpE plasmids are usedtnaA′-′trpEplasmidtnaC mutationASase-specific activity aNo added Rho+Rho (6 μM)−Trp+Trp+/− ratio−Trp+Trp+/− ratiopGF4 (5 nm)Wild type2036018NDNDpGF14 (5 nm)Trp12 to Arg650.8NDNDpGF71 (5 nm)ATG to TAG451.3NDNDpGF4 (15 nm)Wild type4254561.1533286.0pGF14 (15 nm)Trp12 to Arg3604041.137351.0pGF71 (15 nm)ATG to TAG3753801.037401.0In vitro S-30 reaction conditions and the ASase assay procedure are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each assay was performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions, and the average is given here.

A second reasonable explanation is that Rho may become limiting because the additional tna transcripts produced contributeBoxA and rut binding sites that sequester much of the available Rho. If this is the case, addition of purified Rho protein should reverse the titration effect. As expected, when 6 μm Rho was added to the reaction mixture (Table III), both the basal and induced levels of tna operon expression were lowered, and now 6-fold tryptophan induction was observed with wild type tnaC plasmid pGF4.

https://openalex.org/W1983940758,"Pip is a pristinamycin-induced transcriptional regulator protein detected in many Streptomyces species by its ability to specifically bind sequence motifs within the promoter of a Streptomyces pristinaespiralis multidrug resistance gene (ptr). To investigate the possible role of Pip in regulating multidrug resistance, it was purified from a genetically characterized species, Streptomyces coelicolor, utilizing an affinity matrix of the ptr promoter conjugated to magnetic beads. Reverse genetics identified the corresponding locus and confirmed that it encoded Pip, a protein belonging to the TetR family of procaryotic transcriptional repressors. Pip binding motifs were located upstream of the adjacent gene pep, encoding a major facilitator antiporter homologous to ptr. In vivo analysis of antibiotic susceptibility profiles demonstrated that pep conferred elevated levels of resistance only to pristinamycin I (PI), a streptogramin B antibiotic having clinical importance. Purified recombinant Pip was a dimer (in the presence or absence of PI) and displayed a high affinity for its palindromic binding motifs within the ptr promoter and the upstream region of pep. The Pip/ptr promoter complex was dissociated by PI but not by any of the other nonstreptogramin antibiotics that were described previously as transcriptional inducers. These procaryotic regulatory elements served as the basis for the development of systems allowing repression or induction of cloned genes in mammalian and plant cells in response to streptogramin antibiotics (including pristinamycin, virginiamycin, and Synercid(R))."

Glyoxalase I is an isomerase that catalyzes the formation of S- d -lactoylglutathione from the hemimercaptal adduct that forms nonenzymatically between glutathione and the 2-oxoaldehyde methylglyoxal (Fig.1). Glyoxalase II then catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glutathione thiolesterS-d-lactoylglutathione into reduced glutathione and d-lactate. These coupled reactions also convert other 2-oxoaldehydes into their corresponding 2-hydroxy acids. The physiological role of the glyoxalase system is still not fully clear, but it is believed that its main function is detoxication. 2-Oxoaldehydes are toxic to the cell since they react with guanine residues in nucleic acids and arginine, lysine, and cysteine residues in proteins (1Kalapos M.P.

Methylglyoxal is considered a physiological substrate for glyoxalase I. It is mainly formed in glycolysis as a by-product of the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate catalyzed by triose-phosphate isomerase (4Iyengar R. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human glyoxalase I has been solved (5Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homodimer with two identical active sites at its dimer interface. Each active site contains one zinc(II) ion, coordinated by 4 amino acids and one molecule of water. The coordination symmetry is close to square pyramidal with 3 amino acids and the water in the plane and the fourth amino acid as the axial ligand (5Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Yeast glyoxalase I is a monomeric enzyme, which consists of 326 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 37,207 Da (6Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Marmstål E. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 85: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The enzyme was proposed to have one zinc(II) ion per monomer (8Aronsson A.-C. Marmstål E. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In a sequence alignment it was found that the N-terminal half of the yeast glyoxalase I structure is 47% identical and 71% similar to its C-terminal half (9Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1005-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both halves in turn are homologous to the sequence of the subunit of human glyoxalase I, which is a homodimeric protein. This led to the conclusion that the yeast protein arose by gene duplication events (9Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1005-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Clugston S.L. Daub E. Kinach R. Miedema D. Barnard J.F.J. Honek J.F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 186: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It also raises the possibility that yeast glyoxalase I has two functional active sites. The model of yeast glyoxalase I built in this study provides further evidence that yeast glyoxalase I may have two metal binding sites. To test the hypothesis that the protein has two active sites even though it is a monomer, the DNA encoding yeast glyoxalase I was cloned and used for heterologous expression of the enzyme in Escherichia coli. Both potential active sites were then mutated in such a fashion as to possibly destroy all catalytic activity of that particular site. A third mutant containing both mutations was also constructed. Steady-state kinetic studies and metal analyses were performed on the recombinant enzymes. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Täby, Sweden). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). [α-35S]CTP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Ampicillin, methylglyoxal, and glutathione were from Sigma. All plasmids were purified using Magic minipreps DNA purification resin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and DNA fragments were purified with QIAquick (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). DNA constructs were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by electroporation. The cells were distributed on agar plates (10% (w/v) tryptone, 5% (w/v) yeast extract, 10% (w/v) NaCl and 15% (w/v) agar, 100 μg ampicillin/ml) and grown overnight. Other chemicals were commercial products of high purity. Double stranded DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxynucleotide method with Sequenase™ (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). GenomicSaccharomyces cerevisiae DNA was prepared by the Hoffman-Winston method (11Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar) using bakers' yeast purchased from a local grocery store. Primer 1, 5′-AGA GCTCGAGGAATTCATGTCCACTGATAGTAACG-3′ and primer 2, 5′-ATACTGCAGGTACCGTCAACAAGAATGGTCATTAT-3′ were used to amplify the gene for yeast glyoxalase I from the genomic DNA. The primers were designed on the basis of the previously published yeast glyoxalase I sequence (6Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recognition sites for the endonucleases (underlined) XhoI-EcoRI andPstI-KpnI were added to primer 1 and primer 2, respectively. The reaction volume for the PCR1 was 50 μl, consisting of 2 μl of the genomic DNA preparation, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1% TritonTM X-100, 0.1 mg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin/ml, 0.8 μm of each primer, 125 μm dNTP, 125 μmMgCl2, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The reaction was incubated at 94 °C for 7 min and then 35 cycles were carried out with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 45 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s. The PCR product was digested with PstI andXhoI and ligated to the PstI and SalI restriction sites of the pGEM-3z vector (Promega Corp.). To eliminate an internal EcoRI site a silent mutation was introduced using PCR. Here, the gene was amplified in two pieces, changing theEcoRI site with internal primers before these two pieces were put together in a final PCR. The pGEM vector primers M13CCV (5′-AACAGCTATGACCATG-3′) and M13FOR (5′-CACCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) were used in combination with the primers 5′-CCAACCCGGTCTTTAGAGTTCTACCAGAATGTG-3′ and 5′-CACATTCTGGTAGAACTCTAAAGACCGGGTTGG-3′, respectively, to produce the two mutated fragments. By changing one base pair (underlined) the EcoRI site was eliminated (bold). Equal amounts of these fragments together with primer 1 and primer 2 (above) were used to amplify the final mutated full-length DNA. The PCR reactions were the same as above except for the template, where now ∼10 ng of pGEM-3z vector carrying DNA coding for yeast glyoxalase I was used in the first PCRs, and about 70 ng of each fragment was used in the final PCR. Twenty-five cycles were carried out with denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min. The final PCR product was digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into the pGEM-3z vector to give the construct pGYGlxI. The DNA encoding yeast glyoxalase I was then subcloned into the EcoRI andPstI sites of the expression vector pKK-D (12Björnestedt R. Widersten M. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) which is a modified pKK223-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This construct was named pKYGlxI. The DNA sequences encoding the mutants E163Q and E318Q were constructed using inverted PCR with pGYGlxI as template. For the E163Q mutant the 5′-phosphorylated primers 5′-GGATACTGGATTCAGTTGATCACATAT-3′ and 5′-ATCAGGGTCTAAAGCAAACGCAATGTC-3′ were used in a PCR run under similar conditions as described above. Twenty-five cycles were run with denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 11 min. The E318Q mutant was constructed using the 5′-phosphorylated primers 5′-GGTTATTCCATTCAGGTCGTTCCTTATG-3′ and 5′-ATCAGGATCCTTCAAAAAGGCAATATT-3′. The PCR products were blunt-end ligated at room temperature to give the constructs pGE163Q and pGE318Q. To construct the double mutant E163Q/E318Q, both pGE163Q and pGE318Q were digested with EcoRI and XbaI, an internal restriction site of the yeast glyoxalase I gene. The fragments were combined and ligated at room temperature in such a way that both mutations were present in the construct pGE163Q/E318Q. The DNA sequences encoding the three mutants were subcloned into theEcoRI and PstI sites of the expression vector pKK-D to give the expression clones pKE163Q, pKE318Q, and pKE163Q/E318Q. Medium containing 16% (w/v) tryptone, 10% (w/v) yeast extract, and 5% (w/v) NaCl supplied with 50 μg of ampicillin/ml was used for expression. A 3-liter culture of bacteria was inoculated by 30 ml of overnight culture of E. coli XL1-Blue containing pKYGlxI and grown in a rotary shaker at 37 °C until the culture had reached an A 600of 0.4. The cells were then induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown overnight at 37 °C. In some experiments glyoxalase I was expressed with 1 mm bivalent metal ion (Mn(II), Co(II)) added to the bacterial growth medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A), sonicated for 3 × 20 s and centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 10 min. The cells were again resuspended in buffer A, sonicated, and centrifuged. The lysates were pooled and DNase I was added before a final centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 60 min. The lysate was applied to an S-hexylglutathione affinity matrix (2 cm × 2 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was first washed with buffer A supplemented with 0.2m NaCl and then with 5 mm glutathione in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8. The enzyme was eluted with 3 mm S-hexylglutathione and 5 mmglutathione in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8 (7Marmstål E. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 85: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To purify the E163Q/E318Q and E163Q mutants the same protocol as above was followed. The E318Q mutant was also purified like the wild-type with the addition of a washing step with 20 mm glutathione in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8. To check that the proteins were pure, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (12.5% w/v) gel electrophoresis was run and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the protein band. Steady-state kinetic measurements were conducted by varying the adduct concentration at a constant concentration of free glutathione (0.1 mm) in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30 °C, and monitoring the formation ofS-d-lactoylglutathione spectrophotometrically at 240 nm using an extinction coefficient of 3.37 mm−1 cm−1 (13Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was 0.1–0.5 nm in the cuvette, except in experiments with the E163Q/E318Q double mutant where the concentration was 0.5 μm. The equilibrium constant used to calculate the concentration of hemimercaptal adduct from methylglyoxal and glutathione was 3.0 mm (14Vander Jagt D.L. Han L.-P.B. Lehman C.H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies withS-hexylglutathione were performed by varying the methylglyoxal-glutathione adduct concentration and the inhibitor concentration at a free glutathione concentration of 0.1 mm. The kinetic data were analyzed using the Prism 2.0 program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) or the SIMFIT program (15Bardsley W.G. Bukhari N.A.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Cachaza J.A. Burguillo F.J. Computers Chem. 1995; 19: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The amount of different metals in the pure enzymes was determined by Dr. Jean Pettersson (Department of Analytical Chemistry, Uppsala University) using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry. A structural model was built using InsightII, Modeler, and Discover (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The sequence alignment made by Ridderström and Mannervik (9Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1005-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used as input. The coordinates of human glyoxalase I (5Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (16Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and used to structurally align the enzymes. A combined molecular dynamics and energy minimization run was performed to yield the final structure. The pictures were made using Molscript (17Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster 3D (18Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). The modeling of yeast glyoxalase I was based on a primary structure alignment of human and yeast glyoxalase I (9Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1005-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of human glyoxalase I (5Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The sequence identity and similarity were found to be ∼44 and 64%, respectively. The matching segments allowed the building of a model of the tertiary structure of yeast glyoxalase I (Fig. 2) that is very similar to the crystal structure of the human enzyme. However, the human glyoxalase I dimer consists of 372 amino acid residues and is larger than the 326-amino acid yeast enzyme. Consequently, there are gaps in the sequence alignment that are reflected in the model. For example, residues B8 to B30 and B76 to B86 of the human enzyme form extra loops compared with the model of yeast glyoxalase I. Residues 174 to 183 in the monomeric yeast glyoxalase I connect the two sequences that correspond to the two subunits of the human enzyme. The superposition of the crystal structure of human glyoxalase I with the model of the yeast enzyme gives a root mean square deviation of 1.75 Å, when 279 amino acids of yeast glyoxalase I are included. The value was calculated using the program O (19Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. O, The Manual. Uppsala, Sweden1991Google Scholar). According to the modeled structure it is clearly possible that yeast glyoxalase I has two active sites (Fig. 2). Both putative active sites have several amino acid residues in common with the human glyoxalase I active site and can thus be assumed to function according to a similar mechanism. Residues His-25, Glu-89, His-269, and Glu-318 build up one putative metal-binding site. Residues His-185, Glu-242, His-117, and Glu-163 form another one. His-25, Glu-89, and Glu-318 in the first and His-185, Glu-242, and Glu-163 in the second site occupy three corners of the respective square in the two pyramidal binding sites. His-269 and His-117 in turn are the axial ligands (Fig.3, A and B). The backbone peptide bonds of Lys-156 and Met-157 in human glyoxalase I probably donate hydrogen bonds to the glycyl carboxylate of the substrate, but the residues do not play a direct role in catalysis (20Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Kavarana M.J. Creighton D.J. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13480-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,21Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Corresponding residues are found in the yeast enzyme; Lys-156 in human glyoxalase I corresponds to Arg-302 in the C-terminal half of yeast glyoxalase I and to Arg-147 in the N-terminal half. Met-157 corresponds to Met-303 in the C-terminal half and Gln-148 in the N-terminal half. Replacing Met-157 with glutamine in human glyoxalase I results in a fully functional enzyme (21Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sequencing revealed that the DNA coding for yeast glyoxalase I amplified from the genomic DNA differed in five positions compared with the previously published sequence (6Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This resulted in three changes in the deduced amino acid sequence. The changes are presented in TableI. None of the variant residues affect the putative binding sites of metal but the His-322 → Tyr mutation may affect the binding of the glutathione moiety in one of the active sites. Amplification of yeast glyoxalase I DNA from genomic DNA preparations was performed twice and the five mutations were present in both clones. Hence, it is unlikely that the differences resulted from artifacts that arose in the PCR amplifications.Table IDifferences found in the DNA encoding yeast glyoxalase I as compared to the sequence previously published (6Inoue Y.

Open table in a new tab The differences are in bold. Purification of recombinant wild-type enzyme resulted in 6–20 mg of protein from a 3-liter culture. Purification of the three mutants E163Q, E318Q, and E163Q/E318Q each yielded less protein than the wild-type. Based on activity measurements it can be concluded that the different yields were due to differences in the expression levels and not to differences in binding to the affinity matrix. The similar affinities for the S-hexylglutathione matrix and the stoichiometries of metal binding (see below) indicate that the physical properties of the mutants are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. The extinction coefficient was determined as 1.4 ml mg−1cm−1 at 280 nm by amino acid analysis of the wild-type and the mutants. Pure wild-type glyoxalase I was frozen at −80 °C, where it was found to be stable. When stored on ice, the wild-type slowly lost activity with a half-life of ∼6 days. The mutants, on the other hand, were subjected to kinetic analyses immediately after the purification since they lost activity somewhat more rapidly. Their half-lifes when stored on ice were 2 to 3 days. Steady-state kinetic constants for wild-type and mutant recombinant yeast glyoxalase I are presented in Table II. The kinetic data were well described by the Michaelis-Menten equation and the data did not give evidence for a more complex rate behavior that could have indicated cooperativity. The previously published k cat andK m values for native yeast glyoxalase I (22Marmstål E. Aronsson A.-C. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Vander Jagt D.L. Han L.-P.B. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 5161-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) are in the same range as those determined for wild-type recombinant enzyme in the present study. The E318Q mutant clearly is less active than the wild-type enzyme. The E163Q mutant also appears to be less active, although its kinetic constants are similar to those of the wild-type. In contrast, the double mutant E163Q/E318Q is substantially less active, having a k cat value that is almost 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type. The corresponding mutant in human glyoxalase I (E172Q) had an activity of ∼10−5 times that of the wild-type (24Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21623-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The affinity forS-hexylglutathione appears to be slightly higher for the wild-type than for the two single mutants as shown by theK i values.Table IIKinetic parameters of yeast glyoxalase I with the adduct between methylglyoxal and glutathione as substrateRecombinant yeast glyoxalase Ik catK mk cat/K mK i 2-aKi values forS-hexylglutathione were determined by varying methylglyoxal-glutathione adduct and S-hexylglutathione concentrations at a constant free glutathione concentration of 0.1 mm.s −1mmmm −1 s −1μmWild-type 2-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.1,700 ± 1000.41 ± 0.044,200 ± 200Wild-type 2-cPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium and purified with Chelex-treated buffers.1,100 ± 1000.37 ± 0.052,900 ± 200Wild-type 2-dPrepared with addition of 1 mm Mn(II) to the growth medium.1,600 ± 500.45 ± 0.053,500 ± 30015 ± 4Wild-type 2-ePrepared with addition of 1 mm Co(II) to the growth medium.2,700 ± 1000.24 ± 0.0311,000 ± 1000E163Q 2-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.990 ± 500.30 ± 0.053,300 ± 40027 ± 5E318Q 2-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.280 ± 200.24 ± 0.051,200 ± 20032 ± 10E163Q/E318Q 2-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.0.31 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.032.3 ± 0.4Native enzyme1,817 2-fFrom Ref. 22.

The wild-type, E163Q, and E318Q contain at least one iron per enzyme molecule. In the wild-type, the second metal is zinc or manganese, apparently dependent on the growth conditions. Inside the living cell, the second metal could even be an additional iron; when wild-type glyoxalase I was purified with Chelex-treated buffers, the enzyme displayed an increased iron content. Only if the wild-type was expressed in medium supplemented with Co(II), no iron was detected by metal analysis, but instead cobalt. The second metal in E163Q seems to be manganese with some zinc, while E318Q contains only zinc as second metal. E163Q/E318Q displayed an increased zinc content as compared with the other enzymes.Table IIIMetal contents of recombinant wild-type yeast glyoxalase I and the different mutants expressed as mol metal per mol enzyme moleculeRecombinant yeast glyoxalase IEnzyme concentration 3-aThe enzyme concentration of the sample used in the metal analysis.FeZnMnTotal metal contentμmWild-type 3-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.430.81.00.051.9Wild-type 3-cPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium and purified with Chelex-treated buffers.191.20.30.31.8Wild-type 3-dPrepared with addition of 1 mm Mn(II) to the growth medium.140.90.20.92.0Wild-type 3-ePrepared with addition of 1 mm Co(II) to the growth medium; The Co content was determined as 1.5 per enzyme molecule, which is included in the total metal content.7<0.11.30.082.9 3-ePrepared with addition of 1 mm Co(II) to the growth medium; The Co content was determined as 1.5 per enzyme molecule, which is included in the total metal content.E163Q 3-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.310.80.20.61.6E318Q 3-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.120.80.9<0.11.8E163Q/E318Q 3-bPrepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.110.31.40.21.9Metal content was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma—Atomic Emission Spectrometry.3-a The enzyme concentration of the sample used in the metal analysis.3-b Prepared without addition of metals to the growth medium.3-c Prepared without addition of metals to the growth medium and purified with Chelex-treated buffers.3-d Prepared with addition of 1 mm Mn(II) to the growth medium.3-e Prepared with addition of 1 mm Co(II) to the growth medium; The Co content was determined as 1.5 per enzyme molecule, which is included in the total metal content.

FEBS Lett. 1978; 85: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clear how many active sites it possesses. In a previous study one zinc per enzyme molecule was found, and yeast glyoxalase I was thus regarded as having one active site (8Aronsson A.-C. Marmstål E. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1996; 316: 1005-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the dimeric human glyoxalase I showed that the N-terminal part of yeast glyoxalase I is homologous to the C-terminal part. This suggested the possibility of two active sites in the monomeric yeast glyoxalase I. Residue 172 in the human enzyme, a glutamate, is proposed to act as the base in the catalyzed reaction (20Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Kavarana M.J. Creighton D.J. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13480-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21623-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acid residues in the two portions of yeast glyoxalase I are Glu-163 and Glu-318. Therefore, Glu-163 and Glu-318 were mutated into glutamines to substantially decrease the activity of each potential active site (Table II). The mutations might cause a loss of the metal ion in the active sites and thus result in unwanted structural changes. In human glyoxalase I it was possible to make a compensatory mutation of a glutamine into a glutamate in the active site to counterbalance the loss of charge and thus maintain the zinc (24Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21623-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since apparently no glutamines or asparagines (only histidines and glutamates) coordinate the zinc in the yeast enzyme it was not possible to accomplish such a charge balance. However, the metal analyses (Table III) show that the mutants still bind two metal ions stoichiometrically. Also, it was possible to purify the mutants on an S-hexylglutathione column suggesting that the mutated enzymes still by and large retain the binding characteristics of the active site and the tertiary structure. The double mutant has a very low k cat value as compared with the wild-type and the single mutants. Thus, it can be concluded that the mutated active site in E163Q and E318Q, respectively, do not contribute significantly to thek cat andk cat/K m values of the respective mutants. This, and the fact that the double mutant, but not the single mutants, has such a low activity, strongly suggest that yeast glyoxalase I has two catalytically competent active sites. According to the kinetic parameters in Table II, the active site with His-25, Glu-89, His-269, and Glu-318 contributes about 75% to the total activity, while the active site with His-185, Glu-242, His-117, and Glu-163 contributes some 25%. The activities of the two single mutants do not completely account for all of the activity of the wild-type. However, the nature of the mutation of one site may influence the catalytic function of the other. Also, the differences in metal substitutions of the two single mutants could affect their respective activities. Hence, the kinetic properties of the mutants are not necessarily additive. The nature of the metal ions utilized by yeast glyoxalase I is not completely clear. It seems as if a number of bivalent ions in different combinations can be used, and that these give catalytically competent enzymes with similar activities (Table II and Table III). It is well established that mammalian glyoxalase I is active with a variety of bivalent metal ions (25Sellin S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11426-11429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vander Jagt D.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramović O. Glutathione, Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. Wiley, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar). In most cases the yeast enzyme shows a 1:1 ratio between one metal on the one hand, and one or two metals on the other (Table III). This suggests a preference for a distinct type of metal distinguishing the two somewhat different active sites. However, it cannot be ruled out that each active site uses alternative metals, even in the same enzyme preparation. Iron, most probably present as Fe(II), clearly binds to one of the metal-binding sites in wild-type yeast glyoxalase I. The other site seems to be occupied by a Zn(II) ion. Zinc was also found in the previous analysis (8Aronsson A.-C. Marmstål E. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Mn(II) appears to function equally well and may be preferred if present in the growth medium. Also Co(II) can be utilized and gives an enzyme with a slightly increasedk cat/K m value. However, the availability of cobalt under “natural” conditions is probably limited. Yeast glyoxalase I is one of few enzymes that have two apparently functionally similar and independent active sites per one polypeptide. Other examples are protein-disulfide isomerase (27Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and isomaltase (28Sjöström H. Norén O. Christiansen L. Wacker H. Semenza G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 4878-4884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from different sources. Also, carbonic anhydrase from the red algaPorphyridium purpureum has two active sites (30Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Miyachi S. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5521-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly both active sites of the latter enzyme contain zinc, and, similarly to yeast glyoxalase I, the enzyme seems to have evolved by gene duplication and subsequent gene fusion. Although it is not common, there are several possible advantages of having two active sites in one monomer. Cooperativity could be evolved, and it would also be possible to acquire a totally new function in one of the active sites, if necessary. One could also imagine that the enzyme has as yet undiscovered functions in vivo and that the active sites actually have different functions. However, due to the high structural similarity of the two active sites in yeast glyoxalase I, it is most likely that they have evolved to catalyze the same isomerization reaction.

Elevated VDR expression was found in wt1-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, as well.

Physiologically, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 directly binds to its cellular receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR),1 resulting in transcription factor activity of the VDR. The VDR molecule dimerizes with the retinoic X receptor and activates target genes via interaction with vitamin D response elements in vitamin D-responsive promoters (1Jones G. Strugnell S.A.

Additionally, vitamin D response element-independent functions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, referred to as “nongenomic signaling,” have been described, as well (3Hmama Z. Nandan D. Sly L. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our own previous experiments addressing the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in leukemic cells pointed to an influence of Wilms' tumor gene (wt1) expression on the induction of differentiation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(4Maurer U. Weidmann E. Krapohl A. Schneider B. Karakas T. Bergmann L. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 736Google Scholar). The Wilms' tumor gene (wt1) was isolated by deletion analysis and positional cloning in Wilms' tumor and WAGR (Wilms' tumor, aniridia, urogenital malformation, mental retardation) patients, leading to its definition as a tumor suppressor gene (5Call K.M.

The gene product contains a C-terminal zinc finger motif and a proline-glutamine-rich domain at the N terminus, similar to the early growth response-1 transcription factor (6Madden S.L. Cook D.M.

WT1 is expressed as four alternative isoforms containing or lacking a 17-amino acid stretch (termed 17AA) encoded by an alternatively spliced exon 5 and an insertion of three amino acids between zinc fingers 3 and 4, encoded by alternative splice II, termed KTS (7Haber D.A.

Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). During hematopoietic differentiation, the Wilms' tumor gene is transiently expressed, as well (10Maurer U. Weidmann E. Karakas T. Hoelzer D. Bergmann L. Blood. 1997; 90: 4230-4231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Maurer U. Brieger J. Weidmann E. Mitrou P.S. Hoelzer D. Bergmann L. Exp. Hematol. 1997; 25: 945-950PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to its proposed role as a tumor suppressor, WT1 is expressed in the majority of acute leukemias (12Bergmann L. Miething C. Maurer U. Brieger J. Karakas T. Weidmann E. Hoelzer D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the anti-oncogenic function of WT1 is dependent on the cellular context. In initial experiments, we probed a multiple-tissue cDNA blot with probes for WT1 and VDR, observing a correlated expression pattern of VDR and WT1 mRNA. This led us investigate a possible regulation of the expression of the VDR by WT1. In this work, we demonstrate that WT1 activates the VDR promoter in vitro. We show that that engineered expression of WT1 by HT29 colon carcinoma cells, which respond moderately to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (13Shabahang M. Buras R.R. Davoodi F. Schumaker L.M. Nauta R.J. Uskokovic M.R. Brenner R.V. Evans S.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4057-4064PubMed Google Scholar), causes enhanced VDR levels and an enhanced response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Induction of the VDR by WT1 is confirmed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells from renal origin, suggesting that the VDR gene represents a downstream target of WT1. HEK293 and HT29 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish, and after 24 h, they were transfected with 20 μg of expression plasmid using DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). To generate stable transfectants, cells were selected for stable vector insertion with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones derived from single cells were generated by limiting dilution and were analyzed for WT1 protein expression by Western blotting. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 was prepared as a 1000× stock solution (10 μm) in ethanol. Antisense probes for VDR and WT1 mRNA were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate cDNA sequences (VDR 5′, CCCAGCTCTCCATGC; VDR 3′, TGACGCGGTACTTGTAGT; WT1 5′, ACGCGCCCTACCTGCCCAG; and WT1 3′, TTCTCACTGGTCTCAGATGC; MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The VDR amplicon (224 base pairs) was cloned in antisense orientation in pCR 3.1 (Invitrogen). The wt1 amplicon was digested withBam HI, and the resulting 154-base pair fragment was cloned into pCDNA 3 (Invitrogen) after digestion withBam HI/Eco RV. GAPDH and L32 probes (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were included for normalization. A multiple probe for cell cycle genes including p21 was also purchased from the manufacturer. In vitro transcription and ribonuclease protection assay was performed with a kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturers' instructions analyzing 20 μg of total RNA isolated with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protected RNA-RNA hybrids were separated on a 6% sequencing gel and subsequently exposed to Biomax x-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Co., Rochester, NY) or to a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). Protein lysate was dissolved in Laemmli buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8), heated to 95 °C, and subjected to a 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After blotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocking with skim milk (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany), the membrane was incubated with anti-WT1 C19, anti-WT1 180, or anti-VDR C-20 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) antibodies diluted 1:1000. Detection was performed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1: 5000), and the ECL system (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For further analysis, blots were stripped with 0.2 mglycine, pH 2.5, at 56 °C for 30 min. Different murine vitamin D receptor promoter fragments were subcloned in to a pGL2basic vector upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene as described elsewhere (14Jehan F. DeLuca H.F. Proc.

A mutant lacking the WT1 recognition element (WRE)-related sequence was generated by digestion of the 0.5-kb construct with Rsr II and Sma I, followed by treatment with T4 polymerase and religation. The expression constructs used were WT1+17AA-KTS, WT1+17AA+KTS (wt1B and wt1D, kindly provided by F. J. Rauscher, III, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA), and WTAR, encoding a truncated protein (16Haber D.A. Buckler A.J. Glaser T. Call K.M. Pelletier J. Sohn R.L. Douglass E.C. Housman D.E.

NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, 0.5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish and were transfected with 5 μg of expression plasmid, together with 1 μg of reporter construct using DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) after 24 h. Transfection efficiency was determined by cotransfection of 1 μg of a renilla luciferase plasmid (pRLTK; Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). After 48 h, 20 μl of lysate were transferred to a luminescent reaction, and both firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase light activity were determined according to the manufacturers' protocol (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) with a Lumat 9510 (Berthold, Bad Weinsberg, Germany). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments were essentially done as described before (17Elser B. Kriz W. Bonventre J.V. Englert C. Witzgall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27908-27912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 20 ng of protein were incubated with 3000 cpm of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. The oligos were as follows: hVDRWRE sense, AGGACTGGACCTGTGGGCGGGGCGGAG; hVDRWRE antisense, CTCCGCCCCGCCCACAGGTCCAGTCCT; mutated hVDRWRE sense, AGGACTGGACCTGCG TT CGGGGCGGAG; mutated hVDRWRE antisense, CTCCGCCCCG AA CACAGGTCCAGTCCT; mVDRWRE sense, AGGACTGAACTTAGTGGGCGTGGTTGAG; mVDRWRE antisense, CTCAACCACGCCCACTAAGTTCAGTCCT; mutated mVDRWRE sense, AGGACTGAACTTAGTG TT CGTGGTTGAG; and mutated mVDRWRE antisense, CTCAACCACG AA CACTAAGTTCAGTCCT (altered nucleotides are shown in bold and italics). To investigate the effect of WT1 on the endogenous expression of VDR, HT29 cells expressing moderate endogenous levels of VDR were stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding the −17AA-KTS isoform of WT1. Expression of WT1 mRNA was detected in different selected HT29 clones by RNase protection assay and Northern blotting (data not shown), and the protein expression was detected by Western blotting. A significant induction of VDR mRNA was observed in different, independently generated HT29 cell clones expressing WT1, compared with HT29 cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig.1 A). In accordance with the induction of VDR mRNA, we observed elevated VDR protein levels in WT1-expressing HT29 cells (Fig. 1 B). Detection of elevated levels of VDR in different HT29 clones expressing WT1 suggested that this was not an effect of clonal selection. In control experiments, mRNA expression of the dimerization partner of VDR, the retinoic X receptor-α was not elevated in clones expressing WT1 (data not shown). To compare the extent of VDR up-regulation with a previously characterized WT1 target gene, the induction of p21 (18Englert C. Maheswaran S. Garvin A.J. Kreidberg J. Haber D.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1429-1434PubMed Google Scholar) was investigated in HT29 cells expressing WT1 and control cells. p21 mRNA was induced significantly, although to a somewhat lesser extent than VDR mRNA, in WT1-expressing HT29 cells (Fig.1 C). To investigate induction of VDR by the Wilms' tumor gene product in renal cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with a WT1 expression construct, and induction of VDR was assayed by immunoblotting. VDR protein was strongly elevated in HEK293 cells overexpressing WT1, suggesting that WT1 up-regulates VDR expression in the context of renal cells (Fig. 2). To address the question whether WT1 regulates the VDR expression at the transcriptional level, transient cotransfection experiments were performed. A 0.8-kb fragment of the mouse vdr gene promoter fused to a sequence coding for the firefly luciferase was cotransfected with −KTS and +KTS isoforms of WT1 and a mutant (WTAR) lacking the third zinc finger (16Haber D.A. Buckler A.J. Glaser T. Call K.M. Pelletier J. Sohn R.L. Douglass E.C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The VDR promoter fragment was induced 4-fold by the −KTS-isoform but not by the +KTS isoform of WT1. In contrast, cotransfection of the mutant WTAR slightly repressed the VDR promoter construct (Fig. 3 A). The response to WT1 appeared to be in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). To narrow the sequence element responsive for WT1, the promoter construct was shortened from distal of the transcriptional start site (see Fig. 4). A 0.5-kb promoter fragment responded, as well, to WT1. A 0.2-kb fragment, located proximal to the transcription start site, was induced to the same extent, suggesting that the WT1-responsive element was located in this fragment of the VDR promoter. This fragment contains four GC-rich clusters, with putative Sp1 binding sites (15Jehan F. DeLuca H.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The most distal GC element, 5′-TGTGGGCG-3′, is very similar to the sequence of the recently defined WRE high affinity binding sequence, 5′-CGTGGG(A/T)G-3′ (19Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B.

A deletion construct lacking this site exhibited no response to WT1 anymore (Fig. 4). In contrast, mutation of a WT1/early growth response-1 site, which is present in the murine but not in the human VDR promoter, only slightly reduced the response to WT1 (data not shown). The WT1-responsive site is well conserved between the human and the mouse vitamin D receptor promoter. The element was then formally tested for its ability to bind the WT1 protein by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The sequence element was specifically bound by wild-type WT1-KTS but not by the mutant WTAR. Mutation of a the binding sequence abrogated binding to WT1-KTS (Fig.5). These observations suggest that WT1 activates the vdr gene expression at the transcriptional level through a WRE-related sequence element.Figure 4Schematic representation of the vitamin D receptor promoter with potential transcription factor binding sites and the deduced reporter constructs with their induction by WT1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrating specific binding by WT1 of the element similar to WRE (19Lee S.B.

Different HT29 clones expressing high levels of WT1 and HT29 control cells transfected with an empty construct were stimulated with 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3for 7 days. Consistent with previous reports (13Shabahang M. Buras R.R. Davoodi F. Schumaker L.M. Nauta R.J. Uskokovic M.R. Brenner R.V. Evans S.R.

In contrast, HT29 cells expressing WT1 exhibited a marked stronger response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; after 7 days, the cell count in WT1-expressing HT29 cells was ∼30% compared with control vector-transfected HT29 cells after induction with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Fig.6 A). At this time, HT29 control cells showed flat morphology and tight adhesion to the surface of the culture dish, whereas WT1-expressing HT29 cells stimulated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 grew less clustered and detached from the surface of the culture dish (Fig. 6 B). The striking growth inhibition in WT1-expressing cells reflects the enhanced VDR levels in WT1-expressing HT29 clones and suggests a major change in the molecular response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 dependent on WT1 expression. An influence of WT1 expression on the response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in hematopoietic cells was demonstrated by the inhibition of granulocytic differentiation mediated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 because of expression of WT1 (21Svedberg H. Chylicki K. Baldetorp B. Rauscher III, F.J. Gullberg U. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, we analyzed the expression of WT1 and the receptor gene for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, VDR, by investigating the expression pattern of both genes using an array spotted with cDNA from different normal and tumor tissues. We detected WT1 expression predominantly in cDNA spots derived from normal adult kidney tissue. The VDR expression pattern resembled the pattern of WT1, raising the possibility of a regulatory link between WT1 and VDR expression in normal renal tissues (data not shown). Recent investigations identified Sp1 as being responsible for baseline expression of the murine vitamin D receptor (15Jehan F. DeLuca H.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, induction of the VDR by Sp1 cannot fully explain the specific pattern of VDR expression in different tissues like kidney or promyelocytes. A number of putative WT1 target genes, with promoters being regulated in transient cotransfection experiments by WT1, could not be proved to be true targets (22Thate C. Englert C. Gessler M. Oncogene. 1998; 11: 1287-1294Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For this reason, besides investigating the regulation of a vdr promoter reporter constructs by WT1, we focused our investigations on the regulation of the endogenousvdr gene expression by transfecting two different cell lines with a wt1 expression construct and subsequent selecting for WT1 protein expression. Consistent with an induction of thevdr promoter reporter construct by the −KTS isoforms in the transient transfection assays, the endogenous VDR expression in HT29 and HEK293 cells expressing WT1 was significantly elevated. In HT29 clones expressing WT1, the induction of VDR mRNA expression was comparable with the induction of the expression of p21 mRNA. The p21 cell cycle inhibitor gene has previously been shown to be induced by WT1 (18Englert C. Maheswaran S. Garvin A.J. Kreidberg J. Haber D.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1429-1434PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). After generating single clones transfected with the WT1 constructs, we obtained comparably few HT29 clones stably expressing detectable WT1 protein. This suggests a selection against high levels of WT1, possibly because of induction of p21 or other growth-suppressing WT1 target genes. In addition, we observed a slight growth reduction of HT29 cells expressing WT1 compared with control cells during cell culture (Fig.6 A). In our hands, HT29 colon carcinoma cells, but not HEK293 cells, were responsive to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. After induction with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, HT29 cells have been shown to exhibit elevated alkaline phosphatase activity as a marker of differentiation, which is accompanied by growth arrest and followed by a slow induction of apoptosis (20Diaz G.D. Paraskeva C. Thomas M.G. Binderup L. Hague A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2304-2312PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments with HT29 clones expressing WT1, this response was markedly enhanced demonstrating that WT1 expression results in a different phenotype regarding the response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. WT1 interferes with gene expression at the transcriptional and the postranscriptional levels (23Caricasole A. Duarte A. Larsson S.H. Hastie N.D. Little M. Holmes G. Todorov I. Ward A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7562-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the latter being mediated predominantly by the +KTS isoforms (24Larsson S.H. Charlieu J.P. Miyagawa K. Engelkamp D. Rassoulzadegan M. Ross A. Cuzin F. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 391-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). For this reason, regulation of the VDR expression by WT1 at the transcriptional level was proved by transient cotransfection assays with different murine VDR promoter reporter constructs. This led to the identification of a sequence element in the mouse VDR promoter being responsible for induction of the VDR expression by WT1. This sequence element is well conserved in the human VDR promoter (25Miyamoto K.I. Kesterson R.A. Yamamoto H. Taketani Y. Nishiwaki E. Tatsumi S. Inoue Y. Morita K. Takeda E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1165-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is highly similar to the WRE in the amphiregulin promoter (19Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D.

This element has recently been shown to be bound by WT1-KTS with much higher affinity than the WT1/early growth response-1 target site defined earlier (26Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Drouin S.S. Madrid L.V. Marshall A.F. Reed J.C. Weissman B.E. Baldwin A.S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Consistently, WT1 recognition elements in the human and murine vitamin D receptor promoters were specifically bound by WT1 in mobility shift assays. Our data showing that WT1 induces the cellular receptor for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 provide a new molecular mechanism by which WT1 may be involved in cellular differentiation. To date, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is known to induce differentiation of a number of leukemic and solid tumor cell lines, but a physiological role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in cellular differentiation is poorly understood (1Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 2Christakos S. Raval-Pandya M. Wernyj R.P. Yang W. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The data presented here raise the possibility that the response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is modulated by the Wilms' tumor gene product (WT1), which is predominantly expressed in renal and immature hematopoietic cells. In hematopoietic cells, however, we and others have found that WT1 antagonizes the induction of differentiation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (4Maurer U. Weidmann E. Krapohl A. Schneider B. Karakas T. Bergmann L. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 736Google Scholar, 21Svedberg H. Chylicki K. Baldetorp B. Rauscher III, F.J. Gullberg U. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The discrepancy of the data presented here could be explained by a cell type-specific suppression or activation, respectively, of the VDR gene expression by WT1. Cell type-specific regulation of bcl-2 has been shown recently (25Miyamoto K.I. Kesterson R.A. Yamamoto H. Taketani Y. Nishiwaki E. Tatsumi S. Inoue Y. Morita K. Takeda E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1165-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), supporting this hypothesis. Deletions at the 11p13 locus in Wilms' tumors pointed to a tumor suppressor function of WT1. This is underscored by the findings that WT1 suppresses expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr; see Ref. 27Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J.

Our finding of an induction of the VDR by WT1 rises the possibility that loss of WT1 may have an influence on the response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with possible implications for neoplasia, suggesting a novel pathway for an antioncogenic function of WT1 in at least some tumor tissues.

Here, we have utilized a cholecystokinin (CCK) analogue with a photolabile benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) sited in position 24, adjacent to the pharmacophoric domain of this hormone (positions 27–33). This probe was a fully efficacious agonist that bound to the CCK receptor saturably and with high affinity (K i = 8.9 ± 1.1 nm). It covalently labeled the CCK receptor either within the amino terminus (between Asn10 and Lys37) or within the third extracellular loop (Glu345), as demonstrated by proteolytic peptide mapping, deglycosylation, micropurification, and Edman degradation sequencing. Truncation of the receptor to eliminate residues 1–30 had no detrimental effect on CCK binding, stimulated signaling, or affinity labeling through a residue within the pharmacophore (Bpa29) but resulted in elimination of the covalent attachment of the Bpa24 probe to the receptor. Thus, the distal amino terminus of the CCK receptor resides above the docked ligand, compressing the portion of the peptide extending beyond its pharmacophore toward the receptor core. Exposure of wild type and truncated receptor constructs to extracellular trypsin damaged the truncated construct but not the wild type receptor, suggesting that this domain also may play a protective role. Use of these additional insights into molecular approximations provided key constraints for molecular modeling of the peptide-receptor complex, supporting the counterclockwise organization of the transmembrane helical domains.

The molecular details of how ligands as structurally dissimilar as photons, biogenic amines, peptides, and glycoproteins can elicit similar conformational changes in the cytosolic face of their receptors (where G protein-coupling occurs) are far from clear. Our best understanding of this process relates to the smallest ligands that appear to bind within the confluence of helices within the lipid bilayer (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), where we have analogous low resolution crystal structures on which to rely (2Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A.

Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). As the ligands get larger and more structurally complex, the binding domains tend to move toward the extracellular face of the membrane, with extracellular loop and amino-terminal tail domains becoming more important (1Ji T.H.

Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These are receptor domains for which we have minimal meaningful structural data.We have been quite interested in the molecular basis of ligand binding to the type A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor (5Pearson R.K.

This receptor is a member of the class I family of G protein-coupled receptors, along with rhodopsin and the β-adrenergic receptor (11Kolakowski L.F. Receptors and Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). CCK occurs as a series of linear peptides, having lengths ranging from 8 to 58 residues (12Mutt V. Glass G.B.J. Cholecystokinin: Isolation, Structure, and Functions. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 169-221Google Scholar). These all share their carboxyl-terminal domain, with the carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide-amide representing the minimal region that has full potency and efficacy for stimulating targets of this hormone. Two molecular approximations have been experimentally determined for residues within this region of CCK and residues within the ligand-binding domain of this receptor (8Ji Z.S. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M.

Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Extension or structural modification of the amino terminus of CCK-8 has been well tolerated, without interfering with receptor binding or activation (13Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Engel S.L. Pluscec J. Sheehan J.T. Am. J. Dig. Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,14Pearson R.K. Powers S.P. Hadac E.M. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One provocative report has recently suggested that the naturally occurring amino-terminal extension that is present in CCK-58 can affect the conformation of the biologically active carboxyl-terminal octapeptide and can have a positive effect on the action of this hormone (15Keire D.A. Solomon T.E. Reeve Jr., J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).With these observations in mind, we initiated the current group of studies. We were particularly interested in the structural details of how an amino-terminal extension from the CCK pharmacophore might be positioned relative to the CCK receptor. This work has given us new insights into the structure and function of the amino-terminal tail of this receptor. Unlike affinity labeling through photolabile residues that are positioned within the pharmacophore of CCK that have yielded only focused sites of covalent attachment to the receptor (8Ji Z.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the present work with a photolabile benzophenone residue positioned outside of this domain has resulted in demonstration of the ability to label either of two sites in distinct regions of the CCK receptor. This suggests that this position within the receptor-bound ligand may retain substantial mobility and not be held tightly in a single position relative to the receptor.One of the sites of covalent labeling was in a position in the amino-terminal tail of the CCK receptor that can be eliminated without having any negative impact on receptor binding or signaling. The other site of labeling was within the third extracellular loop domain. However, by truncation of the region of the receptor amino terminus in which the first contact was present, this photolabile residue no longer came in contact with or labeled the CCK receptor. These observations suggest that the amino-terminal domain of the receptor might provide a protective cover for the peptide-binding domain within the receptor. Indeed, when comparing the sensitivity of wild type and truncated receptor constructs to extracellular protease treatment, we found the latter to be much more amenable to damage by tryptic protease.The insights coming from the molecular approximations with a photolabile residue sited in position 24 of a CCK-like ligand, when combined with our previous ligand binding and cross-linking data (8Ji Z.S.

This refined molecular model of the ligand-receptor complex is quite distinct from models recently proposed in the literature based on less direct receptor mutagenesis studies (16Kennedy K. Gigoux V.

The current model is fully consistent with all existing experimental data and will continue to spawn experimentally testable predictions as it is further refined.DISCUSSIONG protein-coupled receptors can provide pockets for binding small ligands within the confluence of their seven intramembranous helical segments and for binding large glycoprotein ligands in specialized structural domains configured within large amino-terminal domains (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar,4Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These receptors can also bind and be activated by peptide ligands, such as CCK. The emerging themes for such binding suggest critical contributions by extracellular loop and amino-terminal tail domains that are near the external face of the membrane, as well as including examples of portions of ligands dipping down into the confluence of helices.Our current understanding of the molecular basis of CCK binding is based on receptor mutagenesis and affinity labeling studies. Both support the importance for peptide binding of regions just outside of the first transmembrane segment and in the extracellular loop domains (8Ji Z.S. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A.

Nonpeptidyl ligand binding to this receptor seems to occur deeper in the membrane within the confluence of helices (34Smeets R.L.L. IJzerman A.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Ophorst O.J.A.E. Vries S.E.V.

Pharmacol. 1997; 325: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Established structure-activity relationships for CCK have localized the pharmacophoric domain to the carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide-amide (12Mutt V.

Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Almost every residue within this domain makes an important contribution to binding and activity. In contrast, almost any modification to the amino terminus of CCK-8 that has been attempted has been well tolerated, without modifying receptor binding or signaling. It was this feature that encouraged our positioning of the amino terminus of CCK-8 above the ligand-binding domain of the CCK receptor in our evolving model, such that an extension would not make contact with the regions of this receptor that are known to be important for function (8Ji Z.S.

It is noteworthy that another molecular model has placed the amino terminus of CCK much closer to the membrane and directed toward the other side of the helical bundle (16Kennedy K. Gigoux V.

This has been accomplished with two different photoreactive moieties in position 33 of CCK (8Ji Z.S. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The position 33 photoprobes covalently labeled receptor residue Trp39 just above the first transmembrane segment. The position 29 photoprobe established a covalent bond with receptor residues His347 and Leu348 just above the seventh transmembrane segment. It is noteworthy that both of these represented focused contacts with a single receptor domain, as might be expected from the high affinity tight interaction between native agonist ligand and the ligand-binding domain of the receptor.In contrast, in the present work, the Bpa residue in position 24 of CCK established covalent bonds to either of two distinct domains of the CCK receptor. This probe was fully characterized as a high affinity ligand that had full efficacy relative to natural CCK. While one of the covalently labeled receptor domains was within a region that is known to be important, the third extracellular loop, it is notable that this contact was lost when the amino terminus of the receptor was shortened by truncation. The second labeled domain was a portion of the amino-terminal tail of the CCK receptor that can be eliminated by truncation, without any detrimental effects on CCK binding or agonist-stimulated signaling. This contact is therefore not critical for ligand affinity or function.These spatial approximations, however, provide the basis to postulate that the docked peptide is tucked under the protective cover of the amino terminus of the CCK receptor. This function was further supported by the demonstration that this domain protected the receptor from extracellular proteolytic attack. Eliminating this region of the receptor by truncation had no detrimental effect on ligand binding affinity or agonist-stimulated signaling, but resulted in a more labile receptor that was much more sensitive to proteolysis. The glycosylation of the amino-terminal domain of the CCK receptor is probably most responsible for this resistance to proteolysis. This is a recognized function of the glycosylation of membrane proteins (35Pang R.T.K. Ng S.S.M. Cheng C.H.K. Holtmann M.H. Miller L.J. Chow B.K.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5102-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Ho H.H. Gilbert M.T. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another established function for membrane protein glycosylation relates to assisting in solubility and folding during biosynthesis that is also likely relevant to the CCK receptor.Although position 24 in the CCK ligands is external to the established pharmacophore, cross-linking data generated by substitution of a photolabile residue at this position provides extremely useful constraint data for three-dimensional model building studies. The results reported here provide clear evidence that our earlier decision to position the amino terminus of the ligand facing away from receptor binding site (8Ji Z.S. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Hadac E.M. Ji Z.S. Pinon D.I. Henne R.M. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was appropriate. The photoaffinity labeling data for the ligand amino terminus, combined with ligand binding studies and cross-linking data for positions within the peptide pharmacophore, also enable us for the first time to propose a distinct topological model for the peptide ligand-CCK receptor complex. Based on the full set of photoaffinity labeling and ligand binding data now available, it appears likely that the CCK receptor possesses a counterclockwise helix bundle topology. More definitive biophysical data will be needed to ultimately verify this prediction.With this refinement in our working model, the tyrosine-sulfate residue in position 27 of CCK that has been shown to be so important in structure-activity studies (37Huang S.C., Yu, D.H. Wank S.A. Mantey S. Gardner J.D. Jensen R.T. Peptides. 1989; 10: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is now in direct contact with Arg197. These residues, therefore, represent potential partners for charge-charge interaction. Indeed, Arg197 is one of only three basic residues in the extracellular domain of the CCK receptor that has been reported to have a marked negative impact on CCK binding when replaced with an Ala residue (38Gouldson P. Legoux P. Carillon C. Dumont X. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Shire D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 389: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Thus, using an analogue of CCK with a photolabile Bpa moiety in position 24, we have learned much about the binding domain for this hormone within its receptor. While the pharmacophoric domain of the peptide is held in constant approximation with the regions of the CCK receptor close to the membrane, the amino-terminal extension from the pharmacophore likely moves further away from the bilayer and is overlaid by a region of the receptor amino terminus that has no direct effect on binding affinity or on biological activity. Instead, this region of the receptor serves a protective function over the more critical domain below. The distinct positions of covalent labeling with this probe also provide additional detail to refine the molecular model of the docked peptide agonist. This evolving model now best supports a counterclockwise helical bundle topology for the receptor and residue approximations that are fully consistent with all existing experimental data.AddendumSince submission and review of this manuscript, a preliminary crystal structure for bovine rhodopsin has appeared Palczewski, K., Kumasaka, T., Hori, T., Behnke, C. A., Motoshima, H., Fox, B. A., Le. Trong, I., Teller, D. C., Okada, T., Stenkamp, R. E., Yamamoto, M., and Miyano, M. (2000) Science 289,739–745 that exhibits a counterclockwise helix bundle topology. Since the CCK receptor is also a member of the rhodopsin β-adrenergic receptor family, it is quite likely that the helix bundle topology will be similar. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)1-coupled receptors represent a remarkable group of structurally homologous membrane proteins that can bind and be activated by widely diverse ligands. The molecular details of how ligands as structurally dissimilar as photons, biogenic amines, peptides, and glycoproteins can elicit similar conformational changes in the cytosolic face of their receptors (where G protein-coupling occurs) are far from clear. Our best understanding of this process relates to the smallest ligands that appear to bind within the confluence of helices within the lipid bilayer (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), where we have analogous low resolution crystal structures on which to rely (2Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 393-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar,3Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). As the ligands get larger and more structurally complex, the binding domains tend to move toward the extracellular face of the membrane, with extracellular loop and amino-terminal tail domains becoming more important (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 4Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These are receptor domains for which we have minimal meaningful structural data. We have been quite interested in the molecular basis of ligand binding to the type A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor (5Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

This receptor is a member of the class I family of G protein-coupled receptors, along with rhodopsin and the β-adrenergic receptor (11Kolakowski L.F. Receptors and Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). CCK occurs as a series of linear peptides, having lengths ranging from 8 to 58 residues (12Mutt V. Glass G.B.J. Cholecystokinin: Isolation, Structure, and Functions. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 169-221Google Scholar). These all share their carboxyl-terminal domain, with the carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide-amide representing the minimal region that has full potency and efficacy for stimulating targets of this hormone. Two molecular approximations have been experimentally determined for residues within this region of CCK and residues within the ligand-binding domain of this receptor (8Ji Z.S. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M.

Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Extension or structural modification of the amino terminus of CCK-8 has been well tolerated, without interfering with receptor binding or activation (13Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Engel S.L. Pluscec J. Sheehan J.T. Am. J. Dig. Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,14Pearson R.K. Powers S.P. Hadac E.M. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One provocative report has recently suggested that the naturally occurring amino-terminal extension that is present in CCK-58 can affect the conformation of the biologically active carboxyl-terminal octapeptide and can have a positive effect on the action of this hormone (15Keire D.A. Solomon T.E. Reeve Jr., J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). With these observations in mind, we initiated the current group of studies. We were particularly interested in the structural details of how an amino-terminal extension from the CCK pharmacophore might be positioned relative to the CCK receptor. This work has given us new insights into the structure and function of the amino-terminal tail of this receptor. Unlike affinity labeling through photolabile residues that are positioned within the pharmacophore of CCK that have yielded only focused sites of covalent attachment to the receptor (8Ji Z.S.

https://openalex.org/W2121603799,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a plasma glycoprotein involved in regulation of the complement system. C4BP consists of seven α-chains and one unique β-chain, all constructed of repeating complement control protein (CCP) modules. The β-chain, made up of three CCPs, binds tightly to vitamin K-dependent protein S, a cofactor to anticoagulant activated protein C. When bound to C4BP, protein S loses its activated protein C cofactor function. In this study, we have mutated potentially important amino acids located at the surface of CCP1 of the β-chain to probe the protein S-C4BP interaction. The substitutions were designed after analysis of a homology-based three-dimensional structure of the β-chain and were L27T/F45Q, I16S/V18S, V31T/I33N, I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N, L38S/V39S, and K41E/K42E. The mutants were expressed in a prokaryotic system, purified using an N-terminal His-tag, refolded using an oxido-shuffling system, and tested in several assays for their ability to bind protein S. Our data define Ile16, Val18, Val31, and Ile33 as crucial for protein S binding, with secondary effects from Leu38 and Val39. In addition, Lys41 and Lys42contribute slightly to the interaction. Our results further confirm that surface hydrophobicity analysis may be used to identify ligand recognition sites.

C4b-binding protein complement control protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis human immunodeficiency virus C4b-binding protein (C4BP)1 is a regulator of the classical pathway of complement that also plays a role in the anticoagulant protein C pathway (1Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Res. 1995; 77: 1-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the complement cascade, C4BP acts as a cofactor to factor I in the degradation of C4b (3Fujita T. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, C4BP inhibits the formation and accelerates the decay of the classical C3 convertase pathway, i.e. the C4b2a complex (4Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). C4BP is a large plasma glycoprotein of 570 kDa consisting, for the main isoform, of seven α-chains and one β-chain, which are held together by a central core. Both the α- and β-chains are composed of multiple complement control protein (CCP) domains. A CCP domain is ∼60 residues long and contains two disulfide bridges and a central antiparallel β-sheet (5Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). CCP domains are present in numerous proteins both within and outside the complement system (6Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some CCP-containing molecules have been investigated by NMR or x-ray crystallography, e.g. vaccinia virus complement control protein (7Wiles A.P. Shaw G. Bright J. Perczel A. Campbell I.D. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), β2-glycoprotein I (8Bouma B. de Groot P.G. van den Elsen J.M. Ravelli R.B. Schouten A. Simmelink M.J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of these domains enabled us to construct a homology-based model of C4BP. The α-chains of C4BP, consisting of eight CCPs, bind complement protein C4b (1Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A key recognition site for C4b on C4BP has been recently ascribed to a cluster of positively charged amino acids on the interface of CCP1-CCP2 of the α-chain (10Blom A.M. Webb J. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19237-19245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The unique C4BP β-chain, essentially made up of three CCPs, binds protein S, an anticoagulant molecule that acts mainly as cofactor to activated protein C in the degradation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa. C4BP and protein S form a high affinity, noncovalent complex with a 1:1 molecular ratio, which is greatly enhanced by calcium (11Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12022-12027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal sex hormone globulin binding-like region of protein S is involved in the interaction with C4BP (12He X. Shen L. Malmborg A.C. Smith K.J. Dahlback B. Linse S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3745-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Evenäs P. Garcı́a de Frutos P. Linse S. Dahlbäck B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This domain in protein S is expected to have calcium-binding site(s), whereas it has never been shown or proposed that C4BP interacts with any metal ion (12He X. Shen L. Malmborg A.C. Smith K.J. Dahlback B. Linse S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3745-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,13Evenäs P. Garcı́a de Frutos P. Linse S. Dahlbäck B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In plasma, ∼70% of protein S is in complex with C4BP. Only free protein S functions as an activated protein C cofactor (11Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12022-12027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, C4BP in complex with protein S can still exert its regulatory functions on the complement system (14Schwalbe R.A. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21749-21757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C4BP regulates the plasma availability of free protein S since the concentration of free protein S represents the molar excess of protein S over C4BP (15Griffin J.H. Gruber A. Fernández J.A. Blood. 1992; 79: 3203-3211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological importance of the protein S-C4BP interaction is emphasized by the fact that only the concentration of free protein S can clearly be linked to thrombotic risk in patients suffering from protein S deficiencies (16Zöller B. Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. Blood. 1995; 85: 3524-3531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological purpose of the interaction between C4BP and protein S is not yet fully understood. However, protein S, being a vitamin K-dependent protein, has a very high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids; and therefore, it could localize C4BP to surfaces where such phospholipids are exposed (17Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Hu C.Y. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Schwalbe R. Dahlback B. Hillarp A. Nelsestuen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16074-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our group has shown that the β-chain of C4BP (19Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains the protein S-binding site (20Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); more precisely, CCP1 is required for binding to occur (21Härdig Y. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20861-20867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was recently suggested by van de Poelet al. (22van de Poel R.H.L. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23van de Poel R.H.L. Meijers J.C.M. Dahlbäck B. Bouma B.N. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1999; 25: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that CCP2 also contributes to the binding to a small extent. van de Poel et al. used a different approach to study the binding. In their investigation, chimeras were constructed composed of individual CCP modules (or the different CCPs in combination) fused to the N-terminus of a modified tissue plasminogen activator. They found that CCP2 increased the affinity for protein S ∼5-fold. Fernández and Griffin (24Fernández J.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2535-2540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used synthetic peptides to probe the protein S-C4BP interaction and suggested residues 31–45 on C4BP to be important for protein S binding. This hypothesis was supported in a subsequent report (25Fernández J.A. Villoutreix B.O. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Bouma B.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11073-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), where it was found that preincubation of C4BP with monoclonal antibody 6F6 (directed against a region located nearby residues 31–45) inhibited the C4BP and protein S interaction. It was then concluded that the antibody interfered with the interaction most likely because of steric hindrance (25Fernández J.A. Villoutreix B.O. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Bouma B.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11073-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that binding of protein S to C4BP varied only to a small extent with the concentration of salt, in a manner implying a significant contribution from hydrophobic interactions, with minor roles played by electrostatic forces (26Blom A.M. Covell D.G. Wallqvist A. Dahlbäck B. Villoutreix B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These experiments were the first to confirm the hypothesis that a hydrophobic cluster at the surface of CCP1 may be the main binding site for protein S (27Villoutreix B.O. Fernández J.A. Teleman O. Griffin J.H. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we have mutated potentially important amino acids located in this hydrophobic cluster on C4BP CCP1. The mutations were chosen based on the homology-based, computer-generated three-dimensional structure of the C4BP β-chain and previous experimental data. In addition, two lysines that could be responsible for the slight electrostatic component seen in the interaction were also mutated and studied. Wild-type CCP1 and CCP2 of the β-chain and the mutants were expressed in a prokaryotic system, purified on a nickel-Sepharose column, and refolded. All recombinant proteins were then tested for their ability to bind protein S. We found that substitution of four hydrophobic amino acids by polar residues in the first CCP of the β-chain decreased the apparent affinity for protein S 100-fold. Our results not only provide insights into the nature of the protein S-C4BP interaction, but also have implications for the prediction of binding sites at the surface of other CCP modules and may be valuable for the understanding of protein-protein recognition. The prokaryotic expression vector used for expression of the recombinant C4BP β-chain was pET-26b(+) (Novagen). It carries an N-terminal pelB signal sequence and a C-terminal 6-His tag. CCP1 and CCP2 of the C4BP β-chain were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from full-length cDNA of the β-chain into pET-26b(+) using the following primers: 5′-ATC CAT GGG ATC AGA TGC AGA GCA C-3′ and 5′-CGC TCG AGA CTT TTG CAG ATG GGA AA-3′. This construct was then used as a template, and the mutations were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The templates and sense primers used for mutagenesis as well as the resulting mutants are shown in Table I. The various β-chain constructs were then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria, and mutations were confirmed using an automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table ITemplates and sense primers used for mutagenesisMutantTemplatePrimerL27TWild-type β-chain CCP1–25′-G GTG GAA GGA CAG ATT ACG GGG ACT TA C-3′L27T/F45QL27T5′-GGA AAG AAG ACC CTT CAA TGC AAT GCC TCT AAG GAG TGG-3′I16S/V18SWild-type β-chain CCP1–25′-CCA GTG GAC AAT AGC AGT TTT TCCGCA AAG GAG GTG G-3′V31T/I33NWild-type β-chain CCP1–25′-CTG GGG ACT TAC ACT TGT AAC AAG GGC TAC CAC C-3′I16S/V18S/V31T/I33NI16S/V18S5′-CTG GGG ACT TAC ACT TGT AAC AAG GGC TAC CAC C-3′L38S/V39SWild-type β-chain CCP1–25′-ATC AAG GGC TAC CACTCGTCA GGA AAG AAG ACC CTT-3′K41E/K42EWild-type β-chain CCP1–25′-CAC CTG GTA GGAGAGGAG ACC CTT TTT TGC-3′Changes introduced are underlined; antisense counterpart primers are not shown.

About 1 ml of overnight culture of the transformed bacteria grown in Luria broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin was used to inoculate 500 ml of the same medium. The bacteria were grown by shaking at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm was ∼0.7. Expression of protein was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for 3 h. The culture was then centrifuged at 7000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, with lysozyme added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, the bacteria were sonicated at 10 micron peak to peak and centrifuged in the same way. The pellet obtained was suspended in 6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm reduced glutathione and sonicated and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was then applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (2.6 × 12 cm, QIAGEN) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 100 mm EDTA. Fractions containing protein were chosen by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm and pooled. Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) and dithiothreitol were then added, both to a final concentration of 100 mm. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the sample was diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 3 mm cysteine, and 0.3 mm cystine so that the absorbance at 280 nm was equal to 0.1, and folding of the protein was accomplished by overnight dialysis at 4 °C against the same buffer. Iodoacetamide was then added to the dialyzed sample to a final concentration of 5 mm, and dialysis was continued overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. The dialyzed sample was then applied to a MonoQ column (2 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer; protein was in the flow-through. The protein was concentrated using an Amicon concentrator. Finally, the protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C until further use. Exact concentrations of recombinant protein were determined by analysis of amino acid composition after hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 24 h. All recombinant proteins were tested for their ability to bind to seven monoclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant wild-type β-chain using a standard procedure. Microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of purified antibody at 10 μg/ml in 75 mm sodium carbonate (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. The plate was then washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, and 2 mm CaCl2), quenched in wash buffer with 3% fish gelatin for 2 h, and washed as described above. Increasing amounts of recombinant β-chain (wild-type and mutant) plus trace amounts of 125I-labeled recombinant wild-type β-chain were added for 5 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed five times, and bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. All recombinant proteins were analyzed by gel filtration (Superose 12 HR 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fifty μg of each protein was applied to the column, previously equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0). The flow rate used was 0.5 ml/min. During each run, the absorbance of the eluate at 280 and 214 nm was constantly monitored. Mass spectrometry, carried out at the Protein Analysis Center of the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden), was performed on all recombinant proteins using quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry (Micromass) (28Jonsson A.P. Carlquist M. Husman B. Ljunggren J. Jörnvall H. Bergman T. Griffiths W.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The proteins were dialyzed against 2% HAc. Samples were subsequently analyzed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry in 1% acetic acid and 60% acetonitrile. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) before analysis. Approximately 50 μg of each protein was analyzed in the far-UV region (185–250 nm). The resolution was 1 nm; the speed was 10 nm/min; and the response was measured every 8 s. Sensitivity was 20 millidegrees. Human C4BP and protein S were purified as described before (29Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficients (ε1 cm1%) used were 14.1 (C4BP) and 9.5 (protein S). Protein S and recombinant wild-type C4BP β-chain CCP1 and CCP2 were labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T method. Recombinant proteins were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing (∼1 μg) and nonreducing (∼0.5 μg) conditions for silver staining and under nonreducing conditions for radioligand blotting (∼2 μg). For radioligand blotting, the proteins were transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a quenching solution composed of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% (w/v) Tween 20) supplemented with 3% fish gelatin. The buffer was changed to buffer A with 2 mm CaCl2and trace amounts of 125I-labeled protein S, and the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed with buffer A, dried, and exposed in a cassette. Finally, the membrane was scanned using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In addition, the intensities of the bands detected were estimated by densitometry using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of protein (plasma-purified C4BP or recombinant wild-type or mutant β-chain) at 10 μg/ml in 75 mm sodium carbonate (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. The plate was then washed three times with wash buffer and quenched in wash buffer with 3% fish gelatin for 2 h. The plate was washed as described above, and protein S was added at increasing concentrations (0–240 nm final concentration) with trace amounts of 125I-labeled protein S at 4 °C overnight. Finally, the plate was washed five times with wash buffer, and bound radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. Microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of plasma-purified C4BP at 10 μg/ml in 75 mm sodium carbonate (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. The plate was then washed three times with wash buffer, quenched in wash buffer with 3% fish gelatin for 2 h, and washed as described above. Increasing amounts of plasma-purified C4BP or recombinant β-chain (wild-type and mutant) plus trace amounts of 125I-labeled protein S were added overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the plates were washed five times with the same buffer, and bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. To study a possible binding site for protein S on the C4BP β-chain, the following mutations were introduced in the first CCP of the β-chain: L27T/F45Q, I16S/V18S, V31T/I33N, I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N, K41E/K42E, and L38S/V39S. The mutations were chosen after analysis of a homology-based three-dimensional model of the β-chain (Fig.1) and previous experimental data on the protein S-C4BP interaction (21Härdig Y. Dahlbäck B.

Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The residues selected for mutagenesis were all solvent-exposed, and their replacement should be structurally well tolerated, as removal of hydrophobic residues from the surface generally tends to stabilize a protein. This results from the fact that surrounding water molecules should be able to form hydrogen bonds with the newly introduced polar amino acids. Furthermore, substitution of amino acids expected to be positively charged at physiological pH (Lys41 and Lys42) with two negatively charged residues at the surface of CCP1 should not alter the structure of the domain. Indeed, the two Lys side chains point in opposite directions in the three-dimensional model, in part due to charge-charge repulsion. This phenomenon is also expected for the two resulting Glu residues. All proteins (recombinant wild-type and mutant) were expressed in a prokaryotic system and purified utilizing a C-terminal His-tag. Since the expressed proteins were localized to inclusion bodies in the BL21(DE3) bacteria, the almost pure but misfolded protein obtained was then refolded using an oxido-shuffling system (30Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1989: 191-223Google Scholar, 31Stenberg Y. Muranyi A. Steen C. Thulin E. Drakenberg T. Stenflo J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and subsequently purified on a MonoQ column. All recombinant proteins were of similar apparent molecular mass (14 kDa) as judged by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). (A slight increase in apparent size was seen under reducing conditions for all recombinant proteins (Fig. 2 A).) Approximately 3 mg of purified protein was obtained from each liter of bacterial culture. Introduction of mutations did not affect the expression levels or electrophoretic mobilities of corresponding proteins compared with the wild-type protein. Furthermore, all constructs bound with similar apparent affinity to seven monoclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant wild-type protein. Results for two different antibodies are shown as an example of the binding curves obtained (Fig.3). The exact masses of all recombinant proteins (except L38S/V39S) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. All masses were the precise expected match given the change in mass due to the changes of amino acids (TableII).Table IIDetermination of exact masses of recombinant proteins using quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometryRecombinant β-chain constructMeasured massDaWild-type14,404L27T/F45Q14,373I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N14,368I16S/V18S14,366V31T/I33N14,407L38S/V39SND2-aNot determined.K41E/K42E14,4052-a Not determined. Open table in a new tab Upon gel filtration, all proteins eluted with a major single peak at a volume of ∼15 ml, corresponding to a protein size of 13 kDa, as judged by a standard curve obtained from proteins with a known molecular mass, indicating that aggregates were not present (data not shown). The amount of protein eluted in the major peak, compared with the total amount of protein eluted, varied between 63 and 99%, the lowest being for the L27T/F45Q mutant. The major eluted peak for the mutant with four hydrophobic amino acids mutated, I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N, contained 84% of the total eluted protein. Circular dichroism analysis of all recombinant proteins gave very similar spectra, once again confirming that introductions of mutations did not cause folding changes. The signal was not possible to judge below 205 nm due to background noise. Results are presented as strength of the signal relative to the lowest point (millidegrees/s) measured (Fig.4). To assess the binding of protein S to the various mutants, we used radioligand blotting, in which unreduced wild-type and mutant proteins immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were allowed to bind 125I-labeled protein S (Fig. 5, one representative experiment is shown). Mutant L27T/F45Q bound with similar or increased strength compared with the recombinant wild-type β-chain. I16S/V18S, V31T/I33N, I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N, and L38S/V39S all lost the binding ability for protein S as judged by the absence of bands on the blot after analysis by the PhosphorImager. The K41E/K42E mutant displayed weaker binding than the recombinant wild-type β-chain. For better quantification of differences between mutants, the intensities of all bands were estimated by measurement of density using ImageQuant software. The results are shown in TableIII; each value represents the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. No binding was detectable when proteins were reduced (data not shown), implying that the two characteristic disulfide bonds present in the CCP modules were appropriately formed and, as expected, are crucial for the domain folding and thus for the interaction with protein S.Table IIIBinding of protein S to immobilized recombinant wild-type and mutant C4BP β-chainsRecombinant β-chain constructIntensity%Wild-type100L27T/F45Q153 ± 20I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N2 ± 7I16S/V18S<1V31T/I33N1 ± 3L38S/V39S6 ± 3K41E/K42E69 ± 23Results are from the analysis of the intensities of bands detected by radioligand blotting.

Intensities are expressed as percent of the intensity detected with the recombinant wild-type β-chain (100%). The results shown are the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. To further confirm the results obtained by radioligand blotting, a ligand binding assay was performed (Fig.6 A). Increasing amounts of unlabeled and 125I-labeled protein S were added to immobilized plasma-purified C4BP or the recombinant β-chain (wild-type or mutant). After washing, bound radioactive protein S was measured using a γ-counter. The recombinant wild-type β-chain construct bound protein S with similar affinity as plasma-purified C4BP. This result also supports the structural integrity of the recombinant molecule and further confirms the fact that this expression system combined with the proper refolding technique leads to the production of a protein sharing the same characteristics as plasma-purified C4BP, but with the absence of glycosylation. It is known, however, that the carbohydrate side chains are not important for protein S binding, as a truncated recombinant wild-type β-chain composed of three CCP modules was able to bind to protein S in a similar fashion as plasma-purified C4BP (20Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is also confirmed in the present study. As in the radioligand blotting, the L27T/F45Q mutation seemed to increase the binding of C4BP to protein S. For the remaining mutants, I16S/V18S, V31T/I33N, I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N, and L38S/V39S, the binding was essentially lost. K41E/K42E again displayed weaker binding, never reaching more than ∼70% of binding of125I-labeled protein S, compared with the wild-type β-chain. In the competition assay, increasing amounts of plasma-purified C4BP or recombinant β-chain (wild-type or mutant) were allowed to compete with immobilized C4BP for binding of fluid-phase 125I-labeled protein S. After washing, bound radioactive protein S was measured using a γ-counter. The wild-type β-chain bound protein S equally well compared with plasma-purified C4BP (Fig. 6). In this assay, mutant K41E/K42E bound in a similar fashion compared with the wild-type β-chain (Fig. 6 C). L38S/V39S displayed ∼10-fold less apparent affinity (Fig.6 C), whereas I16S/V18S, V31T/I33N, and I16S/V18S/V31T/I33N had an ∼100-fold lower apparent affinity (Fig. 6 B). In this study, we show that a key binding surf"

Characterizing these mechanisms is important for predicting how tumors will respond to genotoxic radiation or chemotherapy. The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein can regulate apoptosis triggered by DNA damage through an unknown mechanism. The nuclear death domain-containing protein p84N5 can induce apoptosis that is inhibited by association with Rb. The pattern of caspase and NF-κB activation during p84N5-induced apoptosis is similar to p53-independent cellular responses to DNA damage. One hallmark of this response is the activation of a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. In this report, we characterize the effects of p84N5 on the cell cycle. Expression of p84N5 induces changes in cell cycle distribution and kinetics that are consistent with the activation of a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Like the radiation-induced checkpoint, caffeine blocks p84N5-induced G2/M arrest but not subsequent apoptotic cell death. The p84N5-induced checkpoint is functional in ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase-deficient cells. We conclude that p84N5 induces an ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM)-independent, caffeine-sensitive G2/M cell cycle arrest prior to the onset of apoptosis.

Programmed cell death is recognized by a collection of distinctive morphological and biochemical characteristics termed apoptosis (1Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). The pathways leading to apoptosis in response to extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor, or in response to mitochondrial apoptotic signals, such as cytochrome c release, are well characterized (2Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases are typically recruited to protein complexes composed of death receptors and/or adapter molecules. These proteins contain signature protein interaction motifs like the death domain, the death effector domain, or the CARD domain. The locally high concentration of recruited caspase proenzyme triggers its activation by proteolytic processing thereby initiating a caspase proteolytic cascade. Apoptotic signals can also originate from within the nucleus. For example, DNA damage caused by radiation triggers a stress response that can result in apoptotic cell death (4Haimovitz-Friedman A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The mechanisms utilized by nuclear signals to initiate apoptosis are not well understood.A number of nuclear transcription factors can induce apoptosis, including p53 (5Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Although p53 has a well documented role in the response of the cell to DNA damage, the mechanism used by p53 to initiate apoptosis is controversial. Although it may trigger apoptosis from within the nucleus by altering the expression of genes directly involved in the execution of apoptosis (7Yin C. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Van Dyke T. Nature. 1997; 385: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), non-nuclear mechanisms unrelated to transcriptional regulation have also been proposed (8Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Few proteins other than transcription factors are known to require nuclear localization to initiate apoptosis. Nuclear localization of expanded polyglutamine repeat proteins is required for their ability to induce apoptosis that causes progressive neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxia (9Klement I.A.

Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 is a required step in this process (11Sanchez I. Xu C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 apparently occurs by a novel mechanism involving recruitment of the proenzyme to characteristic protein aggregates that are associated with these diseases.Recently, we demonstrated that the nuclear protein encoded by the N5 gene (p84N5)1 was capable of initiating p53-independent apoptosis (12Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since p84N5 contains a death domain that is required for its ability to induce apoptosis, it may participate in a nuclear apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, p84N5-induced apoptosis has a pattern of caspase and NF-κB activation that is similar to radiation-induced apoptosis (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25336-25341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N5 gene was originally isolated based on the ability of p84N5 to bind an amino-terminal domain of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) (14Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Rb can regulate both p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic responses to DNA damage (15Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Association with pRb inhibits p84N5-induced apoptosis, identifying p84N5 as a potential mediator of the inhibitory effects of pRb on p53-independent apoptosis. One characteristic feature of DNA damage-induced apoptosis, especially in the absence of wild-type p53, is the activation of a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint prior to cell death (16Iliakis G. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 602-615PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we test whether p84N5 activates a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here confirm the hypothesis that p84N5 expression activates an authentic G2/M cell cycle checkpoint prior to the onset of apoptosis. This conclusion is supported first by the fact that AdN5 causes an accumulation of cells with G2/M phase DNA content relative to infection with the control virus. Since similar results have been obtained in two different tumor cell lines and an immortalized human AT fibroblast cell line, the effects observed are unlikely to be cell line- or tumor cell-specific. Neither p53 nor Rb is required for this G2/M arrest since SAOS-2 cells are null for both. Furthermore, functional ATM is not required for activation of the G2/M checkpoint by p84N5 since AT cells lacking ATM still accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle after infection with AdN5. Second, the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase is due to an increase in the duration of this phase of the cell cycle. Based on analysis kinetic data obtained from bivariate flow cytometry of BrdUrd pulse-labeled cells, the calculated duration of G2/M doubles upon AdN5 infection relative to AdGFP infection. In contrast, the duration of S phase and the potential doubling time are not consistently dissimilar in AdN5- and AdGFP-infected cells. Third, the relative increase in cyclin A and cyclin B expression observed in pCMVN5- versus pCMV-transfected cells is consistent with an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle since the expression of these proteins peak during this phase. The accumulation of G2/M phase cells upon pCMVN5 transfection also indicates that the effects observed are not dependent on adenovirally mediated gene transfer. Finally, treatment of AdN5-infected cells with caffeine, a known inhibitor of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, prevents accumulation of G2/M phase cells.DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation also activates a G2/M checkpoint that is sensitive to caffeine. Although caffeine abrogates radiation-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, it sensitizes cells to radiation-induced cell death (32Bracey T.S. Williams A.C. Paraskeva C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1371-1381PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that G2/M cell cycle arrest is not a prerequisite for subsequent apoptosis. Similarly, caffeine abrogates p84N5-induced G2/M checkpoint activation but not apoptosis. The percentage of apoptotic AdN5-infected cells is similar in the presence or absence of caffeine. Although the percentage of apoptotic cells at the 48-h time point is not significantly altered by caffeine, caffeine does reduce the total number of viable AdN5-infected cells. These observations suggest that, like radiation, caffeine sensitizes cells to the effects of AdN5. The G2/M arrest induced by DNA damage is persistent. In the absence of normal G1 and S phase checkpoints, such as in Rb or p53 mutant cells, G2/M cells arrested by DNA damage will initiate another round of DNA synthesis without completing the intervening mitosis. Polyploid cells are also observed after infection with AdN5 but not control virus Ad/E1−. Like DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation, this suggests that AdN5-infected cells arrested at G2/M can reinitiate DNA synthesis without completing the intervening mitosis. Blocking DNA synthesis by treatment with aphidicolin does not cause an increase in the percentage of AdN5 cells in G1 phase as is observed in cells infected with Ad/E1−, but rather causes an increase in the fraction of cells with S phase DNA content. Since new DNA synthesis is blocked by aphidicolin, the increased fraction of apparent S phase cells is likely due to loss of DNA content during apoptotic cell death of G2/M or polyploid cells. Hence, it appears as if cells arrested at G2/M by AdN5 either re-initiate DNA synthesis and/or die by apoptotic cell death before completing mitosis and reentering G1 phase.Caffeine can inhibit ATM protein kinase activity and subsequent activation of Chk2/Cds1 (29Zhou B.B.

However, AdN5- and radiation-induced (data not shown) G2/M cell cycle arrest still occurs in the absence of ATM, indicating that ATM-independent mechanisms must exist to enforce a G2/M checkpoint. This finding is consistent with the observations that Chk2 is dispensable for initiation of the G2/M phase checkpoint (33Hong F.D. Chen J. Donovan S. Schneider N. Nisen P.D.

How p84N5 expression leads to maintenance of Cdk1 in the inactive state required to prevent mitotic entry is unclear. One possibility is that forced p84N5 expression stresses the cell in a manner that induces an ATM-independent response analogous to that observed in response to DNA damage.DNA damage is one apoptotic signal that unambiguously originates from within the nucleus. The nuclear localized Rb protein negatively regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis (36Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.C. Levi D. Dazin P. T'Ang A. Fung Y.-K.T.

The observation that an amino-terminal domain of Rb that is dispensable for cell cycle regulation may be required to inhibit some forms of apoptosis 2B. S. Poe and D.W. Goodrich, unpublished observations. (38Riley D.J. Liu C.-Y. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7342-7352Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggests that the ability of Rb to regulate apoptosis may be a novel function. The amino-terminal domain of Rb is also required to bind p84N5, and this binding inhibits p84N5-induced apoptosis (12Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and G2/M arrest.2 We hypothesize that p84N5 plays a role in a cellular stress response that is similar to that triggered by radiation-induced DNA damage and, therefore, that it is a good candidate for mediating the effects of Rb on this response. Programmed cell death is essential for normal development, tissue homeostasis, and host defense mechanisms. Programmed cell death is recognized by a collection of distinctive morphological and biochemical characteristics termed apoptosis (1Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). The pathways leading to apoptosis in response to extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor, or in response to mitochondrial apoptotic signals, such as cytochrome c release, are well characterized (2Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases are typically recruited to protein complexes composed of death receptors and/or adapter molecules. These proteins contain signature protein interaction motifs like the death domain, the death effector domain, or the CARD domain. The locally high concentration of recruited caspase proenzyme triggers its activation by proteolytic processing thereby initiating a caspase proteolytic cascade. Apoptotic signals can also originate from within the nucleus. For example, DNA damage caused by radiation triggers a stress response that can result in apoptotic cell death (4Haimovitz-Friedman A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The mechanisms utilized by nuclear signals to initiate apoptosis are not well understood. A number of nuclear transcription factors can induce apoptosis, including p53 (5Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Although p53 has a well documented role in the response of the cell to DNA damage, the mechanism used by p53 to initiate apoptosis is controversial. Although it may trigger apoptosis from within the nucleus by altering the expression of genes directly involved in the execution of apoptosis (7Yin C. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Van Dyke T. Nature. 1997; 385: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), non-nuclear mechanisms unrelated to transcriptional regulation have also been proposed (8Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Few proteins other than transcription factors are known to require nuclear localization to initiate apoptosis. Nuclear localization of expanded polyglutamine repeat proteins is required for their ability to induce apoptosis that causes progressive neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxia (9Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 10Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 is a required step in this process (11Sanchez I. Xu C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 apparently occurs by a novel mechanism involving recruitment of the proenzyme to characteristic protein aggregates that are associated with these diseases. Recently, we demonstrated that the nuclear protein encoded by the N5 gene (p84N5)1 was capable of initiating p53-independent apoptosis (12Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since p84N5 contains a death domain that is required for its ability to induce apoptosis, it may participate in a nuclear apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, p84N5-induced apoptosis has a pattern of caspase and NF-κB activation that is similar to radiation-induced apoptosis (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25336-25341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N5 gene was originally isolated based on the ability of p84N5 to bind an amino-terminal domain of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) (14Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Rb can regulate both p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic responses to DNA damage (15Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Association with pRb inhibits p84N5-induced apoptosis, identifying p84N5 as a potential mediator of the inhibitory effects of pRb on p53-independent apoptosis. One characteristic feature of DNA damage-induced apoptosis, especially in the absence of wild-type p53, is the activation of a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint prior to cell death (16Iliakis G. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 602-615PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we test whether p84N5 activates a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. DISCUSSIONThe results presented here confirm the hypothesis that p84N5 expression activates an authentic G2/M cell cycle checkpoint prior to the onset of apoptosis. This conclusion is supported first by the fact that AdN5 causes an accumulation of cells with G2/M phase DNA content relative to infection with the control virus. Since similar results have been obtained in two different tumor cell lines and an immortalized human AT fibroblast cell line, the effects observed are unlikely to be cell line- or tumor cell-specific. Neither p53 nor Rb is required for this G2/M arrest since SAOS-2 cells are null for both. Furthermore, functional ATM is not required for activation of the G2/M checkpoint by p84N5 since AT cells lacking ATM still accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle after infection with AdN5. Second, the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase is due to an increase in the duration of this phase of the cell cycle. Based on analysis kinetic data obtained from bivariate flow cytometry of BrdUrd pulse-labeled cells, the calculated duration of G2/M doubles upon AdN5 infection relative to AdGFP infection. In contrast, the duration of S phase and the potential doubling time are not consistently dissimilar in AdN5- and AdGFP-infected cells. Third, the relative increase in cyclin A and cyclin B expression observed in pCMVN5- versus pCMV-transfected cells is consistent with an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle since the expression of these proteins peak during this phase. The accumulation of G2/M phase cells upon pCMVN5 transfection also indicates that the effects observed are not dependent on adenovirally mediated gene transfer. Finally, treatment of AdN5-infected cells with caffeine, a known inhibitor of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, prevents accumulation of G2/M phase cells.DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation also activates a G2/M checkpoint that is sensitive to caffeine. Although caffeine abrogates radiation-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, it sensitizes cells to radiation-induced cell death (32Bracey T.S. Williams A.C. Paraskeva C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1371-1381PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that G2/M cell cycle arrest is not a prerequisite for subsequent apoptosis. Similarly, caffeine abrogates p84N5-induced G2/M checkpoint activation but not apoptosis. The percentage of apoptotic AdN5-infected cells is similar in the presence or absence of caffeine. Although the percentage of apoptotic cells at the 48-h time point is not significantly altered by caffeine, caffeine does reduce the total number of viable AdN5-infected cells. These observations suggest that, like radiation, caffeine sensitizes cells to the effects of AdN5. The G2/M arrest induced by DNA damage is persistent. In the absence of normal G1 and S phase checkpoints, such as in Rb or p53 mutant cells, G2/M cells arrested by DNA damage will initiate another round of DNA synthesis without completing the intervening mitosis. Polyploid cells are also observed after infection with AdN5 but not control virus Ad/E1−. Like DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation, this suggests that AdN5-infected cells arrested at G2/M can reinitiate DNA synthesis without completing the intervening mitosis. Blocking DNA synthesis by treatment with aphidicolin does not cause an increase in the percentage of AdN5 cells in G1 phase as is observed in cells infected with Ad/E1−, but rather causes an increase in the fraction of cells with S phase DNA content. Since new DNA synthesis is blocked by aphidicolin, the increased fraction of apparent S phase cells is likely due to loss of DNA content during apoptotic cell death of G2/M or polyploid cells. Hence, it appears as if cells arrested at G2/M by AdN5 either re-initiate DNA synthesis and/or die by apoptotic cell death before completing mitosis and reentering G1 phase.Caffeine can inhibit ATM protein kinase activity and subsequent activation of Chk2/Cds1 (29Zhou B.B.

These signals are recognized by specific receptor proteins, which are either located in the cytosol (e.g. signal recognition particle for the endoplasmic reticulum (1Brodsky J.L. Phoenix D.A. Protein Targeting and Translocation. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 169-191Crossref Google Scholar)) or bound to the membrane of the organelle (e.g. TOM proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane (2Hovius R. Phoenix D.A. Protein Targeting and Translocation. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 231-248Crossref Google Scholar)). Proteins destined for the peroxisomal matrix are encoded by nuclear genes and synthesized in the cytosol. Specific topogenic signals have been detected at the extreme C terminus (the PTS1) or in the N terminus of the protein (termed PTS2) (3Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 400-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that the PTS1 and PTS2 are recognized in the cytosol by their specific receptor molecules, Pex5p and Pex7p, and that this interaction in fact initiates the actual protein import process. Both pathways converge at the docking site, consisting of at least Pex13p, Pex14p, and Pex17p. Maintenance of the correct stoichiometry of the components of the docking complex seems to be important since relatively minor alterations in the level of Pex14p already affect normal import (4Komori M.

Another peroxin complex, consisting of the two zinc-binding proteins Pex10p and Pex12p, most likely binds Pex5p at a later stage after docking (5Chang C.C. Warren D.S. Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. J.

These interactions could lead to the dissociation of the cargo from the receptor, and the hand over of the cargo molecule to the translocation machinery. Alternatively, the receptor-cargo complex may be completely translocated across the peroxisomal membrane, followed by dissociation of the complex in the peroxisomal lumen (7van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, in Hansenula polymorpha we have obtained evidence for this pathway in which Pex4p, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, plays a role (8van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A.K.W. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In yeast, deletion of the PEX5 gene results in a general block in PTS1 matrix protein import. However, at PTS2 protein-inducing conditions (e.g. oleate, in case of H. polymorpha primary amines), small peroxisomes were observed in these mutants since both the PTS2 import and the insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins are independent of Pex5p function (9McCollum D. Monosov E. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10van der Leij I. Franse M.M. Elgersma Y. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When H. polymorpha pex5 mutant cells were grown in carbon-limited chemostats on glucose/choline, conditions that strongly induce peroxisome proliferation, a few small peroxisomes were observed. These organelles contained the PTS2 protein amine oxidase (AMO,1 induced by choline), whereas the PTS1 proteins alcohol oxidase, dihydroxyacetone synthase, and catalase were mislocalized in the cytosol (11van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Swaving G.J. Waterham H.R. Vrieling E.G. Titorenko V.I. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17229-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, under AMO-repressing conditions during growth of cells on methanol/ammonium sulfate, peroxisomes are fully absent in pex5 cells (12Nuttley W.M. Szilard R.K. Smith J.J. Veenhuis M. Rachubinski R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed whether such cells contained peroxisomal membrane structures and normal peroxisomal membrane proteins. We have used the integral peroxisomal membrane protein Pex10p, carrying a C-terminal Myc tag (Pex10p.myc) as a marker protein for the detection of these structures. Also, we studied whether peroxisome development upon induction of AMO protein initiates from such structures or whether alternative mechanism existed. The results of these studies are the focus of this paper. The H. polymorpha strains used in this study are listed in TableI. The cells were cultivated in mineral media (13van Dijken J.P. Otto R.

One transformant was selected which was uracil prototrophic, methanol utilization-deficient and showed the expected genomic changes after Southern blot analysis.

The plasmid pHIPX4-PEX10.MYC was introduced into a H. polymorpha pex10-1 mutant strain by electroporation (17Faber K.N. Haima P. Harder W. Veenhuis M. AB G. Curr.

Transformants were selected on YND plates and site-directed integration of the plasmid at the PAOX locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. pex5 strains containing two copies of the pHIPX4 derivatives were selected for further studies. Crude extracts of H. polymorpha cells were prepared as detailed by Baerends et al. (18Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol.

Evers M.E. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 143: 237-243Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay system (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) was carried out as described, and gels were subjected to Western blotting (22Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose blots were decorated using specific polyclonal antibodies against various H. polymorpha proteins. Cells were fixed and prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (23Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was performed on ultrathin sections of unicryl-embedded cells, using specific antibodies against various proteins and gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies (23Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The presence of putative peroxisomal membrane structures inH. polymorpha pex5 cells was first determined in cells, grown at moderate peroxisome-induction conditions on ethanol/ammonium sulfate. Under these conditions, WT cells contain few organelles, characterized by the presence of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle. Electron microscopic analysis showed that in such pex5 cells peroxisomal structures were not detectable despite extensive research also including analysis of serial sections (Fig. 1 A). This was remarkable since the levels of the membrane protein Pex14p was equal to WT control cells and over 5-fold enhanced, compared with cells grown on glucose (Fig. 2). Pex3p was also detectable but not enhanced compared with glucose-grown WT cells, independent whether ammonium sulfate or ethylamine was used as the nitrogen source (Fig. 2). Ethylamine metabolism is mediated by AMO, a PTS2 protein of H. polymorpha. At the morphological level, however, replacement of ammonium sulfate by ethylamine led to the rapid development of peroxisomes in ethanol-grown pex5 cells. Typically, one or very few peroxisomes developed within 1 h of cultivation in the new ethylamine environment (Fig. 1 B). As expected, these organelles were characterized by the presence of AMO protein. This raises the question of the origin of these new organelles. A reason for the virtual absence of peroxisomal remnants in ethanol/ammonium sulfate-grown cells could be that these structures were below the limit of detection of electron microscopy. To enhance the level of peroxisomal proteins, pex5 cells were subsequently grown on glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate. SinceH. polymorpha pex strains cannot grow on methanol alone (24van der Klei I.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), glycerol was applied as the growth substrate using methanol as additional energy source and peroxisome inducer. In this way growth conditions are created that are similar for both pex5 and WT control cells, at least until the mid-exponential growth phase. WT cells grown under these conditions contain several large peroxisomes (25Veenhuis M. Harder W. Fahimi D. Sies H. Peroxisomes in Biology and Medicine. Springer Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg1987: 436-457Crossref Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that the levels of Pex3p and Pex14p in glycerol/methanol-grown pex5 and WT cells were comparable but strongly enhanced compared with the levels in ethanol- or glucose-grown cells (Fig. 2). This indicated that deletion of thePEX5 gene did not affect the amounts of peroxisomal membrane proteins in the cells.Figure 2Western blot analysis of crude extracts prepared from H. polymorpha WT and pex5 cells cultivated at various conditions. Cells were grown on glucose/ammonium sulfate (GA), ethanol/ammonium sulfate (EA), ethanol/ethylamine (EE), glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate (GMA), and glycerol/methanol/methylamine (GMM). The levels of the peroxisomal membrane proteins Pex3p and Pex14p were determined by decorating the Western blots with specific antibodies against these proteins. Glucose-grown cells contained minor amounts of these proteins. Upon growth on ethanol-containing medium, the level of Pex3p was comparable to glucose-grown cells, but Pex14p levels were enhanced. Both proteins were strongly induced in cells grown on glycerol/methanol. The protein band indicated by theasterisk on the Western blots decorated with Pex3p antibodies represents an aspecific mitochondrial protein (30Kiel J.A.K.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Klei I.J.

These structures apparently represented peroxisomal membrane remnants, because they could be specifically labeled in immunocytochemical experiments using antibodies against the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex14p (Fig. 1 C, inset). However, they did not contain alcohol oxidase, dihydroxyacetone synthase, and catalase, all PTS1 proteins and key enzymes of methanol metabolism. In medium with methylamine as sole nitrogen source instead of ammonium sulfate, the pex5 cells contained distinct peroxisomes, characterized by the presence of the PTS2 protein AMO protein (Fig. 1 D). This clear-cut morphological phenotype allowed us to analyze the fate of the membrane remnants during the adaptation of cells, pre-grown on glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate, to glycerol/methanol/methylamine-containing media to resolve whether these structures take part in the formation of new AMO-containing peroxisomes or whether alternative mechanisms exist. H. polymorpha has the advantage over other yeast that PTS2 proteins are repressed or below the level of detection in cells grown on glucose, glycerol, or methanol in the presence of ammonium sulfate. Previous data showed that the PTS2 import machinery is induced by primary amines, used as sole nitrogen source (26Faber K.N. Haima P. Gietl C. Harder W., AB, G. Veenhuis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12985-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of these properties in our studies to determine whether the peroxisomal membrane remnants can develop into peroxisomes upon induction of AMO protein by (m)ethylamine. The second crucial condition to conduct the above experiments is the possibility to tag specifically these membrane structures. To achieve this, a hybrid gene was constructed that encoded a C-terminal Myc-tagged version of the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex10p (Pex10p.myc) and was placed under control of the alcohol oxidase promoter (PAOX PEX10.MYC). This gene was selected since it is known that overproduction of Pex10p does not affect peroxisome integrity and protein import competence (27Tan X. Waterham H.R. Veenhuis M. Cregg J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Also, Pex10p.myc has been shown to normally function in man (28Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To test the function of Pex10p.myc in H. polymorpha, we introduced the PEX10.MYC expression cassette in the originalH. polymorpha pex10-1 mutant (27Tan X. Waterham H.R. Veenhuis M. Cregg J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The resulting transformant grew on methanol at WT rates (data not shown). This suggested that Pex10p.myc functionally complemented the peroxisomal defect in pex10-1 cells, since any defect in PTS1 (and thus alcohol oxidase) import would prevent growth of cells on methanol (24van der Klei I.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by electron microscopic analysis, which revealed that methanol-grown cells of this transformant contained normal peroxisomes. Moreover, immunocytochemistry showed that the location of Myc protein was confined to peroxisomal membranes, confirming that indeed Pex10p.myc was normally sorted to the peroxisomal membrane (not shown). Next, we introduced the PAOX PEX10.MYC cassette in the H. polymorpha pex5 strain. A transformant with two copies of PAOX PEX10.MYC integrated in the genome was selected and cultivated in glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate-containing media to induce Pex10p.myc and peroxisomal protein synthesis. Electron microscopy demonstrated that these cells contained clusters of membranous structures (Fig.3 A) that behaved like normal cell constituents in that they were donated to newly developing buds (not shown; compare Fig. 9 A). These structures were the sole sites of gold labeling in immunocytochemical experiments, using α-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained when α-Pex3p, α-Pex10p, and α-Pex14p antibodies were used (shown for Pex10p; Fig. 3 C), indicating that these structures represent peroxisomal membrane structures. Analysis of series of consecutive sections revealed that these clusters were invariably associated with the nucleus and generally include over 20 small vesicles (Fig.4). Taken together, these data imply that the Pex10p.myc marker protein had specifically accumulated at the peroxisomal membrane remnants in glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate-grown pex5 cells (Fig. 1 C) and, thus, is a suitable component to tag these structures.Figure 9Immunocytochemical demonstration that the pre-existing peroxisomal remnants containing Pex10p-Myc are the target for newly synthesized AMO. Glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate-grownpex5:: PAOX PEX10-MYC cells were transferred to glucose/methylamine medium and cultivated for 2 h. A double labeling experiment using antibodies against Myc (10 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse) and AMO (5 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit) showed that Pex10p-Myc and AMO co-localized in the peroxisomal remnants (arrow = peroxisomal remnants). A small portion of these peroxisomal remnants was transferred to the bud of this cell. A more detailed image of the co-localization of Pex10p-Myc and AMO is provided by the inset (thearrow indicates the 5 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit).

C, three structures are selected (white box) that actually represent vesicles, since in the previous (B) and the following section (D) of the cell only small fragments are present. These selected peroxisomal remnants are not detected in other sections of the cell. In addition, in A and B relatively small membrane structures, compared with other peroxisomal vesicles, are detected (indicated by an arrow). Because of their small size, they may represent newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane remnants. Remarkably, the location of these small structures seems to be restricted to a small area (frequently in close association with a mitochondrion (A)).Electron micrographs were taken of glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, poststained with uranyl acetate, unless otherwise indicated.

A post-nuclear supernatant (PNS), prepared from homogenized protoplasts of glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate-grown cells of this strain, was subjected to sucrose density centrifugation (29Salomons F.A.

Analysis of the various fractions obtained indicated that the bulk of the cellular protein was located at the top of the gradient, representing soluble, cytosolic proteins. Western blot analysis of these fractions revealed that Pex10p.myc migrated to a density corresponding to ∼35% (w/w) sucrose (Fig.5 B, fractions 16–18). A similar distribution pattern was observed for Pex14p. At 53% (w/w) sucrose, where intact peroxisomes of H. polymorpha wild type cells normally sediment (8van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E.

The protein peak at ∼42% (w/w) sucrose contains mitochondria judged from the distribution of the mitochondrial marker enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. The minor cytochromec oxidase peak, present at 30% (w/w) sucrose, most probably reflects fragmented and subsequently sealed protoplasts that were still present in the PNS. From this we conclude that the peroxisomal membrane structures present in glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate-grown H. polymorpha pex5:: PAOX PEX10.MYC cells sediment to a density of 35% (w/w) sucrose. These findings are in line with earlier data that revealed that peroxisomal remnants from otherH. polymorpha pex mutants defective in matrix protein import also sedimented to relatively low densities in sucrose gradients (e.g. pex4 (8van der Klei I.J.

The approach to analyze whether the peroxisomal remnants inpex5:: PAOX PEX10.MYC cells can develop into normal peroxisomes includes the initial induction of these structures by methanol, followed by the synthesis of the peroxisomal PTS2 protein AMO under conditions that the synthesis of Pex10p.myc is fully repressed (by glucose). Pex5:: PAOX PEX10-MYC cells were pre-cultivated on glycerol/methanol/ammonium sulfate to induce the synthesis of Pex10p.myc containing membrane remnants. These cells were harvested by centrifugation and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in mineral medium, lacking the C- and N-source to remove any Pex10p.myc mRNAs (31Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Swaving G.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4785-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Subsequently, methylamine (as N-source) was added to this medium to induce AMO synthesis together with glucose (as C-source) to concurrently block the synthesis of Pex10p.myc. At various time points after addition of these substrates, cells were harvested and analyzed. The protein patterns of AMO, Pex10p.myc, and Pex3p were"
