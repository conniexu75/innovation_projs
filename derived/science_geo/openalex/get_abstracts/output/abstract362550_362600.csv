https://openalex.org/W2098912234,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is the catalytic subunit of two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that coordinately promote cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Rapamycin is a potent allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor with clinical applications as an immunosuppressant and anti-cancer agent. Here we find that Torin1, a highly potent and selective ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor that directly inhibits both complexes, impairs cell growth and proliferation to a far greater degree than rapamycin. Surprisingly, these effects are independent of mTORC2 inhibition and are instead because of suppression of rapamycin-resistant functions of mTORC1 that are necessary for cap-dependent translation and suppression of autophagy. These effects are at least partly mediated by mTORC1-dependent and rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Our findings challenge the assumption that rapamycin completely inhibits mTORC1 and indicate that direct inhibitors of mTORC1 kinase activity may be more successful than rapamycin at inhibiting tumors that depend on mTORC1."
https://openalex.org/W2051206671,"The possibility of cloaking an object from detection by electromagnetic waves has recently become a topic of considerable interest. The design of a cloak uses transformation optics, in which a conformal coordinate transformation is applied to Maxwell's equations to obtain a spatially distributed set of constitutive parameters that define the cloak. Here, we present an experimental realization of a cloak design that conceals a perturbation on a flat conducting plane, under which an object can be hidden. To match the complex spatial distribution of the required constitutive parameters, we constructed a metamaterial consisting of thousands of elements, the geometry of each element determined by an automated design process. The ground-plane cloak can be realized with the use of nonresonant metamaterial elements, resulting in a structure having a broad operational bandwidth (covering the range of 13 to 16 gigahertz in our experiment) and exhibiting extremely low loss. Our experimental results indicate that this type of cloak should scale well toward optical wavelengths."
https://openalex.org/W1991444801,"The mapping of neuronal connections in the cerebral cortex has traditionally relied on electrophysiological recordings performed on brain slices, in which long-range connections are severed. Karel Svoboda and colleagues have now adapted a recent optogenetic method to map long-range inputs onto various segments of the dendritic arbours of cortical pyramidal neurons. They find that specific inputs tend to cluster in distinct domains within dendritic trees. Such spatial segregation of different axonal inputs within dendrites may strengthen coupling of coherent cell populations during neuronal information processing and learning. A recent optogenetic method has been adapted to map long-range inputs onto various segments of the dendritic arborizations of cortical pyramidal neurons. Specific inputs tend to cluster in distinct domains within dendritic trees. Such spatial segregation of different axonal inputs within dendrites may strengthen coupling of coherent cell populations during neuronal information processing and learning. Understanding cortical circuits will require mapping the connections between specific populations of neurons1, as well as determining the dendritic locations where the synapses occur2. The dendrites of individual cortical neurons overlap with numerous types of local and long-range excitatory axons, but axodendritic overlap is not always a good predictor of actual connection strength3,4,5. Here we developed an efficient channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted method6,7,8 to map the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs, defined by presynaptic ChR2 expression, within the dendritic arborizations of recorded neurons. We expressed ChR2 in two thalamic nuclei, the whisker motor cortex and local excitatory neurons and mapped their synapses with pyramidal neurons in layers 3, 5A and 5B (L3, L5A and L5B) in the mouse barrel cortex. Within the dendritic arborizations of L3 cells, individual inputs impinged onto distinct single domains. These domains were arrayed in an orderly, monotonic pattern along the apical axis: axons from more central origins targeted progressively higher regions of the apical dendrites. In L5 arborizations, different inputs targeted separate basal and apical domains. Input to L3 and L5 dendrites in L1 was related to whisker movement and position, suggesting that these signals have a role in controlling the gain of their target neurons9. Our experiments reveal high specificity in the subcellular organization of excitatory circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2073895194,"The intermediate coupling regime for electronic energy transfer is of particular interest because excitation moves in space, as in a classical hopping mechanism, but quantum phase information is conserved. We conducted an ultrafast polarization experiment specifically designed to observe quantum coherent dynamics in this regime. Conjugated polymer samples with different chain conformations were examined as model multichromophoric systems. The data, recorded at room temperature, reveal coherent intrachain (but not interchain) electronic energy transfer. Our results suggest that quantum transport effects occur at room temperature when chemical donor-acceptor bonds help to correlate dephasing perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W1987622845,"Living systems produce more than 90% of Earth's atmospheric methane; the balance is of geochemical origin. On Mars, methane could be a signature of either origin. Using high-dispersion infrared spectrometers at three ground-based telescopes, we measured methane and water vapor simultaneously on Mars over several longitude intervals in northern early and late summer in 2003 and near the vernal equinox in 2006. When present, methane occurred in extended plumes, and the maxima of latitudinal profiles imply that the methane was released from discrete regions. In northern midsummer, the principal plume contained ∼19,000 metric tons of methane, and the estimated source strength (≥0.6 kilogram per second) was comparable to that of the massive hydrocarbon seep at Coal Oil Point in Santa Barbara, California."
https://openalex.org/W2166102124,"Successful cell division requires that chromosomes attach to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). Aurora B kinase regulates chromosome-spindle attachments by phosphorylating kinetochore substrates that bind microtubules. Centromere tension stabilizes bi-oriented attachments, but how physical forces are translated into signaling at individual centromeres is unknown. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer–based biosensors to measure localized phosphorylation dynamics in living cells, we found that phosphorylation of an Aurora B substrate at the kinetochore depended on its distance from the kinase at the inner centromere. Furthermore, repositioning Aurora B closer to the kinetochore prevented stabilization of bi-oriented attachments and activated the spindle checkpoint. Thus, centromere tension can be sensed by increased spatial separation of Aurora B from kinetochore substrates, which reduces phosphorylation and stabilizes kinetochore microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2088514135,"Massive stars produce so much light that the radiation pressure they exert on the gas and dust around them is stronger than their gravitational attraction, a condition that has long been expected to prevent them from growing by accretion. We present three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of a massive prestellar core and find that radiation pressure does not halt accretion. Instead, gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities channel gas onto the star system through nonaxisymmetric disks and filaments that self-shield against radiation while allowing radiation to escape through optically thin bubbles. Gravitational instabilities cause the disk to fragment and form a massive companion to the primary star. Radiation pressure does not limit stellar masses, but the instabilities that allow accretion to continue lead to small multiple systems."
https://openalex.org/W1980115442,"Fibrillar polyglutamine aggregates are taken up by mammalian cells in culture and associate with aggresomes that contain both proteasome subunits and chaperones. Aggresomes also recruit soluble proteins that share the same amyloidogenic sequences as the internalised polyglutamine aggregates. Sequence-specific nucleated protein aggregation is closely linked to the pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases and constitutes the molecular basis of prion formation1. Here we report that fibrillar polyglutamine peptide aggregates can be internalized by mammalian cells in culture where they gain access to the cytosolic compartment and become co-sequestered in aggresomes together with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and cytoplasmic chaperones. Remarkably, these internalized fibrillar aggregates are able to selectively recruit soluble cytoplasmic proteins with which they share homologous but not heterologous amyloidogenic sequences, and to confer a heritable phenotype on cells expressing the homologous amyloidogenic protein from a chromosomal locus."
https://openalex.org/W1967428530,"Like many species, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits multiple different life histories in natural environments. We grew mutants impaired in different signaling pathways in field experiments across the species' native European range in order to dissect the mechanisms underlying this variation. Unexpectedly, mutational loss at loci implicated in the cold requirement for flowering had little effect on life history except in late-summer cohorts. A genetically informed photothermal model of progression toward flowering explained most of the observed variation and predicted an abrupt transition from autumn flowering to spring flowering in late-summer germinants. Environmental signals control the timing of this transition, creating a critical window of acute sensitivity to genetic and climatic change that may be common for seasonally regulated life history traits."

https://openalex.org/W2088486846,"The cerebral cortex is often viewed as a sparsely connected network of neurons. Using quadruple whole-cell recordings, Solange Brown and Shaul Hestrin have now tested for synaptic connections among heterogeneous populations of cortical excitatory cells — pyramidal neurons. Their results reveal highly connected local circuits of neurons, each reflecting the neurons' long-range projections to a different brain region. The findings illustrate a diversity of dense cortical microcircuitry associated with the variety of information streams that produce our repertoire of behaviours and internal states. Using quadruple whole-cell recordings, this study tested for synaptic connections among heterogeneous populations of cortical excitatory cells (pyramidal neurons), and found highly connected local circuits of neurons, each reflecting the neurons' long-range projections to a different brain region. The findings illustrate a diversity of dense cortical microcircuitry associated with the variety of information streams that produce our repertoire of behaviours and internal states. Cortical columns generate separate streams of information that are distributed to numerous cortical and subcortical brain regions1. We asked whether local intracortical circuits reflect these different processing streams by testing whether the intracortical connectivity among pyramidal neurons reflects their long-range axonal targets. We recorded simultaneously from up to four retrogradely labelled pyramidal neurons that projected to the superior colliculus, the contralateral striatum or the contralateral cortex to assess their synaptic connectivity. Here we show that the probability of synaptic connection depends on the functional identities of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. We first found that the frequency of monosynaptic connections among corticostriatal pyramidal neurons is significantly higher than among corticocortical or corticotectal pyramidal neurons. We then show that the probability of feed-forward connections from corticocortical neurons to corticotectal neurons is approximately three- to fourfold higher than the probability of monosynaptic connections among corticocortical or corticotectal cells. Moreover, we found that the average axodendritic overlap of the presynaptic and postsynaptic pyramidal neurons could not fully explain the differences in connection probability that we observed. The selective synaptic interactions we describe demonstrate that the organization of local networks of pyramidal cells reflects the long-range targets of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2114600491,"Here, we characterized behavioral abnormalities induced by prolonged social isolation in adult rodents. Social isolation induced both anxiety- and anhedonia-like symptoms and decreased cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). All of these abnormalities were reversed by chronic, but not acute, antidepressant treatment. However, although the anxiety phenotype and its reversal by antidepressant treatment were CREB-dependent, the anhedonia-like symptoms were not mediated by CREB in NAcSh. We found that decreased CREB activity in NAcSh correlated with increased expression of certain K(+) channels and reduced electrical excitability of NAcSh neurons, which was sufficient to induce anxiety-like behaviors and was reversed by chronic antidepressant treatment. Together, our results describe a model that distinguishes anxiety- and depression-like behavioral phenotypes, establish a selective role of decreased CREB activity in NAcSh in anxiety-like behavior, and provide a mechanism by which antidepressant treatment alleviates anxiety symptoms after social isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2121315499,"Bacterial multidrug tolerance is largely responsible for the inability of antibiotics to eradicate infections and is caused by a small population of dormant bacteria called persisters. HipA is a critical Escherichia coli persistence factor that is normally neutralized by HipB, a transcription repressor, which also regulates hipBA expression. Here, we report multiple structures of HipA and a HipA-HipB-DNA complex. HipA has a eukaryotic serine/threonine kinase–like fold and can phosphorylate the translation factor EF-Tu, suggesting a persistence mechanism via cell stasis. The HipA-HipB-DNA structure reveals the HipB-operator binding mechanism, ∼70° DNA bending, and unexpected HipA-DNA contacts. Dimeric HipB interacts with two HipA molecules to inhibit its kinase activity through sequestration and conformational inactivation. Combined, these studies suggest mechanisms for HipA-mediated persistence and its neutralization by HipB."

https://openalex.org/W2072059848,"Among cellular organisms, symbiotic bacteria provide the extreme examples of genome degradation and reduction. However, only isolated snapshots of eroding symbiont genomes have previously been available. We documented the dynamics of symbiont genome evolution by sequencing seven strains of Buchnera aphidicola from pea aphid hosts. We estimated a spontaneous mutation rate of at least 4 × 10 –9 substitutions per site per replication, which is more than 10 times as high as the rates previously estimated for any bacteria. We observed a high rate of small insertions and deletions associated with abundant DNA homopolymers, and occasional larger deletions. Although purifying selection eliminates many mutations, some persist, resulting in ongoing loss of genes and DNA from this already tiny genome. Our results provide a general model for the stepwise process leading to genome reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2158339570,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to pathogenic bacteria with conserved innate immune responses and pathogen avoidance behaviors. We investigated natural variation in C. elegans resistance to pathogen infection. With the use of quantitative genetic analysis, we determined that the pathogen susceptibility difference between the laboratory wild-type strain N2 and the wild isolate CB4856 is caused by a polymorphism in the npr-1 gene, which encodes a homolog of the mammalian neuropeptide Y receptor. We show that the mechanism of NPR-1–mediated pathogen resistance is through oxygen-dependent behavioral avoidance rather than direct regulation of innate immunity. For C. elegans , bacteria represent food but also a potential source of infection. Our data underscore the importance of behavioral responses to oxygen levels in finding an optimal balance between these potentially conflicting cues."
https://openalex.org/W2047306851,"The precipitation of barium or strontium carbonates in alkaline silica-rich environments leads to crystalline aggregates that have been named silica/carbonate biomorphs because their morphology resembles that of primitive organisms. These aggregates are self-assembled materials of purely inorganic origin, with an amorphous phase of silica intimately intertwined with a carbonate nanocrystalline phase. We propose a mechanism that explains all the morphologies described for biomorphs. Chemically coupled coprecipitation of carbonate and silica leads to fibrillation of the growing front and to laminar structures that experience curling at their growing rim. These curls propagate in a surflike way along the rim of the laminae. We show that all observed morphologies with smoothly varying positive or negative Gaussian curvatures can be explained by the combined growth of counterpropagating curls and growing laminae."
https://openalex.org/W2123185065,"Oceanic production of calcium carbonate is conventionally attributed to marine plankton (coccolithophores and foraminifera). Here we report that marine fish produce precipitated carbonates within their intestines and excrete these at high rates. When combined with estimates of global fish biomass, this suggests that marine fish contribute 3 to 15% of total oceanic carbonate production. Fish carbonates have a higher magnesium content and solubility than traditional sources, yielding faster dissolution with depth. This may explain up to a quarter of the increase in titratable alkalinity within 1000 meters of the ocean surface, a controversial phenomenon that has puzzled oceanographers for decades. We also predict that fish carbonate production may rise in response to future environmental changes in carbon dioxide, and thus become an increasingly important component of the inorganic carbon cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2081299552,"The DNA-binding chromodomain helicase CHD8 regulates gene expression but how it acts on specific genes has been unclear. During early embryogenesis in mice, CHD8 recruits histone H1 to the p53-dependent promotors of apoptotic genes and thereby prevents massive cell death at this stage of development. The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of enzymes is thought to regulate gene expression, but their role in the regulation of specific genes has been unclear. Here we show that CHD8 is expressed at a high level during early embryogenesis and prevents apoptosis mediated by the tumour suppressor protein p53. CHD8 was found to bind to p53 and to suppress its transactivation activity. CHD8 promoted the association of p53 and histone H1, forming a trimeric complex on chromatin that was required for inhibition of p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis. Depletion of CHD8 or histone H1 resulted in p53 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, Chd8−/− mice died early during embryogenesis, manifesting widespread apoptosis, whereas deletion of p53 ameliorated this developmental arrest. These observations reveal a mode of p53 regulation mediated by CHD8, which may set a threshold for induction of apoptosis during early embryogenesis by counteracting p53 function through recruitment of histone H1."
https://openalex.org/W1979989319,"The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has a central role in coordinating DNA damage responses, including cell-cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair and apoptosis. Mutations of ATM cause a spectrum of defects ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer predisposition. However, the mechanism by which DNA damage activates ATM is poorly understood. Here we show that Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5), activated by DNA damage, directly phosphorylates ATM at Ser 794 in post-mitotic neurons. Phosphorylation at Ser 794 precedes, and is required for, ATM autophosphorylation at Ser 1981, and activates ATM kinase activity. The Cdk5-ATM signal regulates phosphorylation and function of the ATM targets p53 and H2AX. Interruption of the Cdk5-ATM pathway attenuates DNA-damage-induced neuronal cell cycle re-entry and expression of the p53 targets PUMA and Bax, protecting neurons from death. Thus, activation of Cdk5 by DNA damage serves as a critical signal to initiate the ATM response and regulate ATM-dependent cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1997533858,"Pin1 interacts with Notch1 to increases its cleavage by γ-secretase and thus its transcriptional activity. In a feedback loop, Notch1 controls Pin1 expression, which results in enhanced Notch1 tumorigenic activity. Signalling through Notch receptors requires ligand-induced cleavage to release the intracellular domain, which acts as a transcriptional activator in the nucleus. Deregulated Notch1 signalling has been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis; however the mechanisms underlying Notch activation in breast cancer remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 interacts with Notch1 and affects Notch1 activation. Pin1 potentiates Notch1 cleavage by γ-secretase, leading to an increased release of the active intracellular domain and ultimately enhancing Notch1 transcriptional and tumorigenic activity. We found that Notch1 directly induces transcription of Pin1, thereby generating a positive loop. In human breast cancers, we observed a strong correlation between Pin1 overexpression and high levels of activated Notch1. Thus, the molecular circuitry established by Notch1 and Pin1 may have a key role in cancer."

The lunar crust and returned samples are magnetized, but the source of this magnetization could be meteoroid impacts rather than a dynamo. Here, we report magnetic measurements and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar thermochronological calculations for the oldest known unshocked lunar rock, troctolite 76535. These data imply that there was a long-lived field on the Moon of at least 1 microtesla ∼4.2 billion years ago. The early age, substantial intensity, and long lifetime of this field support the hypothesis of an ancient lunar core dynamo."
https://openalex.org/W2123766420,"Axon guidance proteins are critical for the correct wiring of the nervous system during development. Several axon guidance cues and their family members have been well characterized. More unidentified axon guidance cues are assumed to participate in the formation of the extremely complex nervous system. We identified a secreted protein, draxin, that shares no homology with known guidance cues. Draxin inhibited or repelled neurite outgrowth from dorsal spinal cord and cortical explants in vitro. Ectopically expressed draxin inhibited growth or caused misrouting of chick spinal cord commissural axons in vivo. draxin knockout mice showed defasciculation of spinal cord commissural axons and absence of all forebrain commissures. Thus, draxin is a previously unknown chemorepulsive axon guidance molecule required for the development of spinal cord and forebrain commissures."
https://openalex.org/W2032303532,"Vaults are among the largest cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles and are found in numerous eukaryotic species. Roles in multidrug resistance and innate immunity have been suggested, but the cellular function remains unclear. We have determined the x-ray structure of rat liver vault at 3.5 angstrom resolution and show that the cage structure consists of a dimer of half-vaults, with each half-vault comprising 39 identical major vault protein (MVP) chains. Each MVP monomer folds into 12 domains: nine structural repeat domains, a shoulder domain, a cap-helix domain, and a cap-ring domain. Interactions between the 42-turn-long cap-helix domains are key to stabilizing the particle. The shoulder domain is structurally similar to a core domain of stomatin, a lipid-raft component in erythrocytes and epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055508399,"Retroviruses have the potential to acquire host cell–derived genetic material during reverse transcription and can integrate into the genomes of larger, more complex DNA viruses. In contrast, RNA viruses were believed not to integrate into the host's genome under any circumstances. We found that illegitimate recombination between an exogenous nonretroviral RNA virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and the endogenous intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) retrotransposon occurred and led to reverse transcription of exogenous viral RNA. The resulting complementary DNA was integrated into the host's genome with an IAP element. Thus, RNA viruses should be closely scrutinized for any capacity to interact with endogenous retroviral elements before their approval for therapeutic use in humans."

However, yields from available transgenic mice and transchromosomic (Tc) cattle carrying human immunoglobulin loci are too low for therapeutic applications. We report a Tc bovine system that produces large yields of hpAbs. Tc cattle were generated by transferring a human artificial chromosome vector carrying the entire unrearranged, human immunoglobulin heavy (hIGH) and kappa-light (hIGK) chain loci to bovine fibroblasts in which two endogenous bovine IgH chain loci were inactivated. Plasma from the oldest animal contained >2 g/l of hIgG, paired with either human kappa-light chain (up to approximately 650 microg/ml, fully human) or with bovine kappa- or lambda-light chain (chimeric), with a normal hIgG subclass distribution. Hyperimmunization with anthrax protective antigen triggered a hIgG-mediated humoral immune response comprising a high proportion of antigen-specific hIgG.

This combination of off-chip synthesis and biofunctionalization with high-density, heterogeneous assembly and integration at the individual nanowire level points to new ways of incorporating biological functionality with silicon electronics."

FA-J null cells are hypersensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agents (9Litman R. Peng M. Jin Z. Zhang F. Zhang J. Powell S. Andreassen P.R. Cantor S.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This may reflect defective HR in the late steps of processing DNA ICLs. FANCJ helicase unwinds duplex DNA with a 5′ to 3′ directionality, preferentially binds and unwinds forked duplexes, and has the ability to unwind the invading strand of a three-stranded D-loop structure, a key early intermediate of HR repair (13Cantor S.

Understanding how FANCJ performs its role(s) in DNA repair through its coordination of catalytic activity and protein interaction is an important topic of investigation, since this will provide a better comprehension of the FA pathway. In an effort to better understand the molecular functions of FANCJ, we explored the hypothesis that FANCJ may use its motor ATPase for other catalytic activities in addition to DNA unwinding of canonical B-form duplex DNA. For example, nonconventional roles of FANCJ ATPase motor may be important for its role in replication initiation after DNA damage (15Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B. Pathania S. Cantor S.B. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that FANCJ helicase activity is required for timely progression through S phase (16Kumaraswamy E. Shiekhattar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6733-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggests that the helicase plays a role in resolving alternate DNA structures that impede the replication fork. Recently, we reported that FANCJ can efficiently resolve G-quadruplex DNA structures (17Wu Y. Shin-Ya K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4116-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The DOG-1 protein in nematodes, which has sequence similarity to the FANCJ helicase domain, has been proposed to have a role in the resolution of G4 DNA structures based on the observation that dog-1 (deletions of guanine-rich DNA) mutations show germ line as well as somatic deletions in genes containing guanine-rich DNA (18Cheung I. Schertzer M. Rose A. Lansdorp P.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Another source of genomic instability and perturbation to cellular processes of nucleic acid metabolism is the DNA triple helix, an alternate DNA structure stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding of the third strand to the DNA double helix that poses a source of genomic instability and perturbs cellular processes of nucleic acid metabolism (19Bissler J.J. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 4536-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Wang G. Vasquez K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, triplex formation by the Friedreich ataxia (GAA)n repeat results in reduced expression of the frataxin gene (21Gacy A.M. Goellner G.M. Spiro C. Chen X. Gupta G. Bradbury E.M. Dyer R.B.

Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition to resolving alternate DNA structures, the ability of certain helicases to clear proteins from nucleic acid structures is potentially important, since helicases provide access of single-stranded DNA or RNA for subsequent steps during vital processes, such as replication, recombination, repair, transcription, and translation (24Mackintosh S.G. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A limited number of helicases have been characterized for their ability to catalyze protein displacement from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. A classic example is the yeast Srs2 helicase, which prevents recombination by disrupting Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments (25Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 26Veaute X. Jeusset J. Soustelle C. Kowalczykowski S.C. Le Cam E. Fabre F.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and RECQL5 (28Hu Y. Raynard S. Sehorn M.G. Lu X. Bussen W. Zheng L. Stark J.M. Barnes E.L. Chi P. Janscak P. Jasin M. Vogel H. Sung P. Luo G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3073-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) DNA helicases have also been shown to strip human RAD51 from DNA. Similarly, Escherichia coli UvrD helicase dismantles RecA nucleoprotein filaments formed on ssDNA (29Veaute X. Delmas S. Selva M. Jeusset J. Le C.E. Matic I. Fabre F. Petit M.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and clears proteins bound to replication forks (30Flores M.J. Sanchez N. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1664-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase has the ability to dissociate a stationary RNA polymerase (31Bedinger P. Hochstrasser M. Jongeneel C.V. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or E. coli trp repressor bound to DNA (32Byrd A.K. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3020-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The yeast Pif1 helicase acts as a negative regulator of telomerase by catalytically removing telomerase from telomeric DNA (33Boule J.B. Vega L.R. Zakian V.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Proteins with the canonical ATPase/helicase motifs, such as chromatin remodeling enzymes, can alter histone-DNA interactions (34Lusser A. Kadonaga J.T. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A common feature of chromatin remodeling enzymes and helicases is that both classes of proteins utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to perform their protein displacement function. In this study, we have experimentally determined that FANCJ utilizes its motor ATPase function to resolve a DNA triple helix. We also demonstrate that FANCJ disrupts a model protein-DNA substrate interaction of streptavidin bound to a biotinylated ssDNA molecule. This approach has been successfully used to characterize a limited number of helicases or motor ATPases to perform protein-nucleic acid remodeling functions (for reviews, see Refs. 24Mackintosh S.G. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 35Eoff R.L. Raney K.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The identification and characterization of a novel FANCJ protein displacement activity suggests that the current model(s) proposed for FANCJ function in the DNA damage response will be enhanced with the new appreciation that FANCJ efficiently disrupts a model protein-DNA interaction of high affinity. In support of this model, we further demonstrate that FANCJ inhibits RAD51 strand exchange, a reaction that is likely to be important to prevent inappropriate homologous recombination. Proteins-Baculovirus encoding FANCJ wild type (WT) or FANCJ-M299I with a C-terminal FLAG tag was used to infect High Five insect cells, and the recombinant FANCJ protein was purified as previously described (13Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recombinant FANCJ protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purified recombinant FANCJ-WT and FANCJ-M299I proteins predominantly migrated as single bands of the predicted size (130 kDa) on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and judged to be greater than 90% pure (data not shown). At least three independent protein purifications of the purified wild-type and mutant recombinant FANCJ proteins were performed, yielding specific ATPase activities in the presence of the forked duplex DBA effector comparable with those previously published (36Gupta R. Sharma S. Doherty K.M. Sommers J.A. Cantor S.B. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6673-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 25 min–1 for FANCJ-WT and 170 min–1 for FANCJ-M299I.

Open table in a new tab For triplex DNA substrates with a pyrimidine third strand, the plasmid pSupF5, which contains a duplex sequence that serves as a target for a third strand designated TC30, was used (40Brosh Jr., R.M.

Cleavage of the plasmid with NdeI released fragments of 4 and 0.6 kilobase pairs. The triplex site lies 1800 bases from one end of the large fragment. Triplexes were prepared by incubation of 3 pmol of the indicated 5′-32P-labeled TC30 oligonucleotide or TC30 with a 15-nt 5′-ssDNA tail, designated 5′-15nt-TC30 (Table 1) (based on the molecular weights of the reaction components) overnight at room temperature with 6 pmol of NdeI-cleaved plasmid in triplex annealing buffer containing 33 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 66 mm KOAc, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm spermine. The complexes were then separated from unbound oligonucleotide by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel A-5 M resin equilibrated in triplex annealing buffer. Triplex substrates were stored at 4 °C for 1 week and found to be stable for functional assays. Restriction protection of the XbaI site, which resides in the triplex target site was performed and demonstrated for the restriction fragment-based triplex substrate, as previously described (40Brosh Jr., R.M. Majumdar A. Desai S. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3024-3030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplex complexes isolated by gel chromatography were separated from free oligonucleotide by ethanol precipitation from 2.5 m ammonium acetate. They were suspended in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermine, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and digested with XbaI at 37 °C. The 5′-tailed blunt triplex substrate with a pyrimidine third stand, which contained a triplex region without underlying duplex extensions on either side of the triplex site, consisted of a 30-bp duplex (TC30W and TC30C; Table 1) annealed to 5′-15nt-TC30 under the annealing conditions described above. The 5′-tailed blunt triplex with a purine third strand consisted of a 30-bp duplex (25 pmol, PUR30W and PUR30C; Table 1) annealed to 10 pmol of radiolabeled 5′-15nt-TC30PUR. Annealing was performed in the presence of 30 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm LiCl, 0.1 mm spermine at room temperature overnight. The triplex substrate with a purine third strand was gel-purified and electroeluted to separate it from G-quadruplex, which migrated much more slowly on the native gel. Triplex substrates were constructed containing a purine third strand with underlying duplex that had either a purine strand with a 15-nt 5′ tail (5′-15nt-PUR30W) or a pyrimidine strand with a 15-nt 5′ tail (5′-15nt-PUR30C). For both substrates, the purine strand of the underlying duplex was radiolabeled. The radiolabeled 5′-15nt-PUR30W or PUR30W was annealed to PYR30C or 5′-15nt-PYR30C, respectively, at equimolar concentrations. Annealing was performed under the same buffer conditions and temperature as the corresponding 5′-tailed triplex substrate with a purine strand, except 10 pmol of duplex was annealed to 100 pmol of the purine third strand (TC30PUR). Streptavidin Displacement Assays-Streptavidin displacement reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 10 fmol of the specified DNA substrate (0.5 nm final substrate concentration), and the indicated concentrations of FANCJ helicase. For streptavidin displacement reactions, 10 fmol of DNA substrate was preincubated with 100 nm streptavidin (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Streptavidin bound to the DNA substrate was detected by a slower migrating gel-shifted species on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. Reactions were initiated by adding FANCJ prior to the addition of biotin (1 μm) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min (unless otherwise noted), followed by a quench with the addition of 10 μl of stop buffer (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). Products were resolved on nondenaturing 12% (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels and quantitated. A PhosphorImager was used for detection, and the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) was used for quantitation of the reaction products. The percentage displacement was calculated. The data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments, with S.D. values shown by error bars. Duplex DNA Helicase Assays-RECQ1 and BLM helicase assays with forked duplex substrates were performed under RECQ1 reaction conditions, as described previously (38Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Choudhary S.

Triplex Displacement Assays-Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 10 fmol of the specified triplex DNA substrate (0.5 nm DNA substrate concentration), and the indicated FANCJ concentrations. Reactions were initiated by the addition of FANCJ and then incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. A 10-μl aliquot of loading buffer (40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) was added to the mixture at the end of incubation, and products were resolved on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (10 or 12% acrylamide as indicated in the figure legend, 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol) at 4 °C. Radiolabeled DNA species on polyacrylamide gels were visualized with a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). ssDNA Protection Assays-To form the nucleoprotein filament, 32P-labeled ssDNA (number 1; 5′-ACA GCA CCA GAT TCA GCA ATT AAG CTC TAA GCC ATC CGC AAA AAT GAC CTC TTA TCA AAA GGA-3′; 3 μm, nucleotides) was incubated with human RAD51 protein (1 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml), 20 mm phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase (30 units/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Then FANCJ (in the indicated concentrations) was added to the reaction mixture (10 μl, total) followed by incubation for 10 min. Finally, 1 μl of E. coli exonuclease I (0.25 units; New England Biolabs) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by a 15-min incubation. The products were deproteinized, analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized, and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Inhibition of D-loop Formation by FANCJ-The procedure for monitoring D-loop formation was as previously described (27Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In brief, to form the nucleoprotein filament, 32P-labeled ssDNA (number 90; Table 1; 3 μm, nucleotides) was incubated with human RAD51 protein (1 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml), 20 mm phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase (30 units/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. FANCJ (in the indicated concentrations) and RPA (200 nm) were added, followed by a 10-min incubation. Then 2 mm calcium chloride was added, and the reactions were incubated for another 10 min. D-loop formation was initiated by the addition of pUC19 supercoiled DNA (scDNA) (50 μm, nucleotides). D-loop formation was terminated after a 15-min incubation. The products were deproteinized in the presence of 1.5% SDS and proteinase K (800 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C and then mixed with 0.10 volume of loading buffer (70% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels, visualized, and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). FANCJ Displaces Streptavidin Bound to an Internal Biotinylated Deoxyoligonucleotide in a Manner That Is Dependent on the Location of Conjugated Biotin-To investigate the possibility that FANCJ utilizes its motor ATPase function for catalytic activities other than DNA unwinding, we tested the ability of FANCJ to disrupt a model protein-DNA interaction of high affinity presented by a biotinylated DNA substrate prebound with streptavidin at a specific location.

https://openalex.org/W2011622863,"The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells might be improved by replacing the reprogramming transgenes with small molecules. To provide cells suitable for small-molecule screening, Markoulaki et al. segregate the transgenes Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc through breeding, creating mice carrying all possible combinations of the four factors. Proviruses carrying drug-inducible Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc used to derive 'primary' induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were segregated through germline transmission, generating mice and cells carrying subsets of the reprogramming factors. Drug treatment produced 'secondary' iPS cells only when the missing factor was introduced. This approach creates a defined system for studying reprogramming mechanisms and allows screening of genetically homogeneous cells for compounds that can replace any transcription factor required for iPS cell derivation."

We investigated if a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 6q23 was significantly associated with HbF and F cell levels in individuals of African descent. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 24-kb intergenic region, 33-kb upstream of the HBS1L gene and 80-kb upstream of the MYB gene, were typed in 177 healthy Afro-Caribbean subjects (AC) of approximately 7% European admixture, 631 healthy Afro-Germans (AG, a group of African and German descendents located in rural Jamaica with about 20% European admixture), 87 West African and Afro-Caribbean individuals with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS), as well as 75 Northern Europeans, which served as a contrasting population. Association with a tag SNP for the locus was detected in all four groups (AC, P = 0.005, AG, P = 0.002, HbSS patients, P = 0.019, Europeans, P = 1.5×10−7). The association signal varied across the interval in the African-descended groups, while it is more uniform in Europeans. The 6q QTL for HbF traits is present in populations of African origin and is also acting in sickle cell anaemia patients. We have started to distinguish effects originating from European and African ancestral populations in our admixed study populations."
https://openalex.org/W2164919442,"Variation in the length of simple DNA triplet repeats has been linked to phenotypic variability in microbes and to several human disorders. Population-level forces driving triplet repeat contraction and expansion in multicellular organisms are, however, not well understood. We have identified a triplet repeat-associated genetic defect in an Arabidopsis thaliana variety collected from the wild. The Bur-0 strain carries a dramatically expanded TTC/GAA repeat in the intron of the ISOPROPYL MALATE ISOMERASE LARGE SUB UNIT1 (IIL1; At4g13430) gene. The repeat expansion causes an environment-dependent reduction in IIL1 activity and severely impairs growth of this strain, whereas contraction of the expanded repeat can reverse the detrimental phenotype. The Bur-0 IIL1 defect thus presents a genetically tractable model for triplet repeat expansions and their variability in natural populations."

Methodology and Results We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation in the hypervariable segments I and II (HVS-I and HVS-II) and haplogroup-specific mutations in coding regions in 445 individuals from seven east Asian populations (Korean, Korean-Chinese, Mongolian, Manchurian, Han (Beijing), Vietnamese and Thais). In addition, published mtDNA haplogroup data (N = 3307), mtDNA HVS-I sequences (N = 2313), Y chromosome haplogroup data (N = 1697) and Y chromosome STR data (N = 2713) were analyzed to elucidate the genetic structure of East Asian populations. All the mtDNA profiles studied here were classified into subsets of haplogroups common in East Asia, with just two exceptions. In general, the Korean mtDNA profiles revealed similarities to other northeastern Asian populations through analysis of individual haplogroup distributions, genetic distances between populations or an analysis of molecular variance, although a minor southern contribution was also suggested. Reanalysis of Y-chromosomal data confirmed both the overall similarity to other northeastern populations, and also a larger paternal contribution from southeastern populations. Conclusion The present work provides evidence that peopling of Korea can be seen as a complex process, interpreted as an early northern Asian settlement with at least one subsequent male-biased southern-to-northern migration, possibly associated with the spread of rice agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2113722812,"In obesity and diabetes, an imbalance in fatty acid uptake and fatty acid utilization leads to excess accumulation of lipid in non-adipose tissues. This lipid overload is associated with cellular dysfunction and cell death, which contribute to organ failure, a phenomenon termed lipotoxicity. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of lipid-mediated cell death, we generated and characterized a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line that is resistant to palmitate-induced cell death. In this mutant, random insertion of a retroviral promoter trap has disrupted the gene for the non-coding RNA, growth arrested DNA-damage inducible gene 7 (gadd7). Here we report that gadd7 is induced by lipotoxic stress in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent fashion and is necessary for both lipid- and general oxidative stress-mediated cell death. Depletion of gadd7 by mutagenesis or short hairpin RNA knockdown significantly reduces lipid and non-lipid induced ROS. Furthermore, depletion of gadd7 delays and diminishes ROS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. Together these data are the first to implicate a non-coding RNA in a feed-forward loop with oxidative stress and its induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.

Cellular homeostasis can be perturbed by a myriad of stimuli, including metabolic imbalance, oxidative stress, and aberrant protein folding. In response to such stressors, cells induce specific molecular pathways that commonly involve activation of signaling cascades or alterations in gene expression (1Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). These responses enable cells to adapt to relatively modest stress and regain homeostasis. However, if the stress is extreme or prolonged, cells are unable to re-establish homeostasis and in turn, activate pathways that result in cell death.

Similarly, lipid accumulation in the pancreas, kidney, and liver in obesity and diabetes is associated with organ dysfunction (13Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Studies from our laboratory and others show that lipotoxicity can be modeled in established cell lines by supplementation of culture media with pathophysiological concentrations of the saturated FFA, palmitate. In these studies palmitate supplementation of diverse cell types leads to cell death through the accumulation of ROS and induction of ER stress (21Borradaile N.M. Buhman K.K. Listenberger L.L.

Scavenging ROS with antioxidants not only inhibits lipotoxic cell death, but also significantly diminishes induction of the ER stress response, suggesting that lipid-mediated oxidative stress leads to ER stress (21Borradaile N.M. Buhman K.K. Listenberger L.L. Magee C.J. Morimoto E.T. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Pathophysiological concentrations of palmitate also lead to rapid remodeling of ER membrane lipids that may directly impair ER structure and function (28Borradaile N.M. Han X. Harp J.D. Gale S.E. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2726-2737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Although, oxidative stress and ER stress responses are known to be integral steps in lipotoxicity, the precise molecular mechanisms by which excess lipid orchestrates these stress responses remain unresolved. In an effort to elucidate how cells respond to lipid metabolic stress, we used retroviral promoter trap mutagenesis and selection in palmitate-supplemented media to isolate Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that are resistant to lipotoxicity (21Borradaile N.M. Buhman K.K. Listenberger L.L. Magee C.J. Morimoto E.T. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Herein we describe a mutant with a disruption in gadd7, a gene that leads to expression of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) previously described as a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-inducible transcript (29Crawford D.R. Schools G.P. Salmon S.L. Davies K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that gadd7 participates in a feed-forward loop that regulates the response to oxidative stress. Materials-Palmitate was from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian) and [14C]palmitate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Staurosporine and actinomycin D were from Calbiochem. Vitamin E, H2O2, phloretin, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), xanthine, and xanthine oxidase were from Sigma. Cell Culture-CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and CHO-derived cell lines were maintained in high glucose (4.5 mg/ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1)) media with 5% non-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 50 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. For lipotoxicity experiments, cell culture media was supplemented with 500 μm palmitate complexed to bovine serum albumin at a 2:1 m ratio, as described previously (25Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). For antioxidant studies, cells were pretreated with 400 μm vitamin E for 1 h or with 5 mm NAC for 5 h, then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and co-treated with 500 μm palmitate and 400 μm vitamin E or 5 mm NAC. To induce ER stress, cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin or 1 mm thapsigargin. For ROS induction cells were treated with 2.3 mm H2O2 in growth media or with 100 μm xanthine and 15–150 microunits/ml xanthine oxidase in PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.92 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 0.6% bovine serum albumin or in growth media. Generation of CHO Cell Mutants-Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein pseudotyped murine retrovirus encoding the ROSAβgeo retroviral promoter trap (31Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) was generated as described previously (32Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transduced with retrovirus at a low multiplicity of infection and mutants were isolated as described previously (21Borradaile N.M. Buhman K.K. Listenberger L.L. Magee C.J. Morimoto E.T. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Number of retroviral insertions within the mutant cell genome was assessed by Southern blot. Genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs) separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the ROSAβgeo proviral sequence. Cell Death and DNA Fragmentation Assays-Cell death was assessed by membrane permeability to propidium iodide (PI) staining as described previously (25Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 105) were plated into 35-mm wells 1 day prior to treatment. Following treatments, cells were harvested by trypsinization and stained with 1 μm PI. Percentage of PI-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry, quantifying 104 cells/sample. Apoptosis was assessed by quantifying DNA cleavage using a DNA fragment end labeling kit (TUNEL; Calbiochem). Percentage of DNA fragment end-labeled cells was quantified by flow cytometry, quantifying 104 cells/sample. Identification of Trapped Gene-The endogenous gene disrupted by retroviral insertion was identified by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using an oligonucleotide tag and ROSAβgeo sequences (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit; Clontech). The 5′ RACE product was TA cloned and sequenced. Gene identification and directed PCR were carried out as described previously (21Borradaile N.M. Buhman K.K. Listenberger L.L. Magee C.J. Morimoto E.T. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Directed PCR primers used to verify retroviral integration within the gadd7 gene were: gadd7 forward, 5′-GGG AAG CTG AGG TTT TTC C-3′; gadd7 reverse, 5′-CAC ACC AGT CTC AAC TCC C-3′; and ROSAβgeo reverse, 5′-CTC AGG TCA AAT TCA GAC GG-3′. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR)-Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified for 40 PCR cycles using SYBR Green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems) and 10 nm template-specific primers in a ABI Prism 7500 sequence detector. Primer sequences to gadd7 (forward, 5′-ACA ATG ACG CCA TCG TTT TCT-3′; reverse, 5′-TGT CCT CCA TCT GGG CAT TT-3′), grp78 (forward, 5′-GCC TCA TCG GAC GCA CTT-3′; reverse, 5′-AAC CAC CTT GAA TGG CAA GAA-3′), and β-actin (forward, 5′-GGC TCC CAG CAC CAT GAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCC ACC GAT CCA CAC AGA GT-3′) were used in qPCR. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold method as described by the manufacturer. Changes in gadd7 and grp78 RNA expression levels were calculated following normalization to β-actin expression. Plasmids and Transient Transfection-gadd7 was cloned by PCR into pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA-gadd7. QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used to create three constructs, each with replacement of one gadd7 open reading frame (ORF) stop codon with AgeI and PacI restriction sites. A double-stranded oligo containing three tandem Myc sequences and a stop codon, flanked by AgeI and PacI restriction sites, was generated (IDT) and ligated downstream of the gadd7 ORFs in the three constructs to create in-frame carboxyl-terminal Myc tags. The Myc-tagged NPC2 sequence was generated by PCR and cloned into the ΔU3 vector. All PCR-derived segments were confirmed by sequencing. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol and assayed 48 h post-transfection. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy-Cells (5 × 105) were plated onto 0.8% gelatin-coated glass coverslips 48 h before transfection with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabolized with Triton X-100, and stained with α-Myc antibody (1:800, clone 9E10, Upstate Biotechnology) and Cy5-coupled donkey α-mouse secondary antibody (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescently labeled cells were visualized at ×40 using a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope, equipped with an AxioCam MR5 camera. The percentage of Myc-labeled cells was determined by quantifying Cy5 fluorescence in 600 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing cells/sample, analyzed in three independent experiments. Generation of gadd7 shRNA Clones-Hamster gadd7 cDNA sequence (gi: 703070) was used to design siRNA oligonucleotides using Ambion's siRNA Target Finder Program (ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_finder.html). gadd7 sense and antisense siRNA sequences were 5′-GAU GAG AAA GUG CAG UAU UUU-3′ and 5′-AAU ACU GCA CUU UCU CAU CUU-3′, respectively, and scrambled sense and antisense siRNA sequences were 5′-AAG AUG AGC AUA GGA UGU U-3′ and 5′-AAC AUC CUA UGC UCA-3′, respectively. shRNA oligonucleotides were designed from these siRNA sequences and each cloned into a pSilencer 4.1-CMV hygro vector (Ambion) containing a hygromycin resistance cassette. shRNA vectors were transfected into CHO cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at limiting dilutions and treated with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin. Clonal lines were isolated, and gadd7 knockdown assessed by qPCR. Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation-Cells (1 × 105) were plated in 12-well plates 32 h prior to various treatments. Cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.92 mm CaCl2, and 3 μm 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA, Invitrogen) in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then rinsed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and quenched with culture media. Mean fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry on 104 cells/sample. xbp-1 mRNA Splicing-Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed using hamster xbp-1 primers flanking the xbp-1 splice site as reported previously (33Sorensen S. Ranheim T. Bakken K.S. Leren T.P. Kulseth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 468-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were separated by non-denaturing PAGE on a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel, which was then stained with ethidium bromide. Immunoblot Analyses-Whole cell protein lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Protease Complete inhibitor mixture (Roche), and 1× phosphatase inhibitors I and II (Sigma). Nuclear lysates were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction reagents (Pierce Scientific). Proteins (30 μg) were resolved by 12 (for CHOP) or 10% (for JNK) SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were probed with CHOP (F-168, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), phospho-JNK (9251, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), total JNK (9252, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), β-actin (A 2066, Sigma, 1:2000), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (F 0167, Sigma, 1:2000) antibodies. Proteins were visualized using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:10,000) and chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Band intensities were quantified by densitometry (Quantity One Basic Software). Disruption of gadd7 Confers Resistance to Lipotoxicity-We carried out a genetic screen in CHO cells using the ROSAβgeo retroviral promoter trap vector to identify genes critical for the lipotoxic response by selecting for mutants in media supplemented with a pathophysiological concentration of palmitate (500 μm palmitic acid complexed to bovine serum albumin at a 2:1 molar ratio) (21Borradaile N.M. Buhman K.K. Listenberger L.L. Magee C.J. Morimoto E.T. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). From this screen we isolated mutant cell line 2E1. To characterize 2E1 cells further, we supplemented wild-type (WT) and mutant cells with palmitate or other inducers of cell death and quantified resistance to cell death and apoptosis by PI staining and TUNEL assay, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Compared with WT CHO cells, mutant 2E1 cells were significantly resistant to palmitate-induced cell death (WT 70% versus 2E1 16% PI positive) and apoptosis (WT 54% versus 2E1 5% TUNEL positive). This resistance was relatively palmitate-specific, because mutant and WT cells were similarly sensitive to the apoptotic inducers, staurosporine and actinomycin D. These data indicate that mutant 2E1 is not generally resistant to cell death or apoptosis. Southern blot analysis was used to characterize the insertion of the provirus in the genome of 2E1 cells. DNA from WT and mutant cells was digested with restriction enzymes whose sites are present in the retroviral vector sequence, and analyzed by Southern blot, probing for the ROSAβgeo sequence (Fig. 1C). Only one hybridizing band was observed for each digest, indicating there is a single retroviral integration in mutant 2E1, consistent with the low multiplicity of infection used in the mutagenesis method. To identify the gene disrupted in mutant 2E1, we performed 5′ RACE using cDNA from the mutant. The sequence obtained corresponds to 39 nucleotides from the 5′ region of the previously identified ncRNA gadd7 (Fig. 2A). We carried out directed PCR using primers to gadd7 and ROSAβgeo to confirm that gadd7 was the site of proviral insertion (Fig. 2B). Using gadd7 forward and ROSAβgeo reverse primers, a PCR product corresponding to the gadd7-retroviral fusion transcript was obtained in mutant cDNA, but not in WT cDNA, demonstrating that the fusion transcript is present only in the mutant cells. A product was obtained in WT and mutant cDNA using gadd7 forward and reverse primers, indicating that both cell types contain at least one WT allele. Although not strictly quantitative, the gadd7 PCR product produced from the mutant cDNA is of a lower intensity. Together with data from Southern blotting, these findings suggest that the provirus disrupted one of two gadd7 alleles in mutant 2E1, creating a model of haploinsufficiency. To quantitatively assess the level of gadd7 expression in 2E1 cells, basal gadd7 RNA levels were measured in WT and mutant cells by qPCR and values were normalized to β-actin RNA expression (Fig. 2C). Relative to WT cells, gadd7 expression was 50% lower in 2E1 cells, consistent with a model of haploinsufficiency. Because gadd7 expression is increased by various stress stimuli, we asked whether lipotoxic stress affected gadd7 expression. WT and mutant cells were supplemented with palmitate for varying times, and gadd7 expression was measured by qPCR (Fig. 2D). gadd7 expression increased in a time-dependent manner in both WT and mutant cells. However, compared with WT cells, mutant cells expressed lower levels of gadd7 at all time points and the magnitude of induction in mutant cells was substantially diminished. These results indicate that lipotoxic stress is an inducer of gadd7 expression. Confirmation of gadd7 as a Non-coding RNA-gadd7 contains three putative small ORFs predicted to encode peptides 38, 37, and 43 amino acids in length (Fig. 3A). In vitro translation studies conducted by two independent groups showed no detectable protein products were produced from gadd7 RNA (29Crawford D.R. Schools G.P. Salmon S.L. Davies K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), leading to the classification of gadd7 as a ncRNA. To address the possibility that small peptides might have been missed in SDS-PAGE analyses, we generated gadd7 ORF fusion constructs by replacing each predicted gadd7 stop codon with a triple Myc epitope tag in-frame followed by a stop codon (ORF1-Myc, ORF2-Myc, and ORF3-Myc). The fusion constructs were co-transfected into WT cells along with a construct for GFP, and immunofluorescence was used for detection of fusion peptides (Fig. 3, B and C). Cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged NPC2 construct in parallel for comparison of translation efficiency with a bona fide small ORF of 151 amino acids (34Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). For ORF1-Myc, sporadic, low level Myc expression was observed in 5% of transfected cells, whereas for NPC2-Myc high level Myc expression was observed in 85% of transfected cells. No expression of the Myc epitope tag was detected in ORF2-Myc or ORF3-Myc transfected cells. The level of epitope tag expression in ORF1-Myc-transfected cells is extremely low, compared with NPC2-Myc-transfected cells and is unlikely to have biological significance. Together, our studies are consistent with a model in which gadd7 functions at the level of RNA. Knockdown of gadd7 Recapitulates Mutant Phenotype-To confirm that disruption of gadd7 expression leads to a lipotoxicity-resistant phenotype, we used shRNA technology to determine whether directed knockdown of gadd7 expression in WT cells recapitulates the palmitate-resistant phenotype. We isolated two independent stable cell lines expressing shRNA directed against gadd7 (KD1 and KD2) and a cell line expressing a scrambled shRNA (SCR). Compared with the SCR control, basal gadd7 expression in KD1 and KD2 cells was decreased 20% (Fig. 4A, left panel). Under lipotoxic conditions, gadd7 expression was decreased 45 and 48% in KD1 and KD2, respectively (Fig. 4A, right panel). Compared with SCR cells, KD1 and KD2 cells were significantly protected from cell death (38 and 32% reduction in PI positivity, respectively, Fig. 4B). These studies provide independent evidence supporting our model in which gadd7 loss of function is protective against lipotoxicity. gadd7 Functions as a Regulator of Lipid-mediated Oxidative Stress-We next sought to determine where gadd7 acts in the lipotoxic pathway. To assess whether resistance of 2E1 cells to lipotoxicity was due to impairment in the import of FFAs, initial rates of palmitate uptake were measured in WT and 2E1 cells pulsed for 1 min with 14C-labeled palmitate. Levels of palmitate uptake were equivalent in the two cell lines, indicating that resistance to palmitate-induced cell death in 2E1 cells is not due to impaired FFA uptake (supplemental Fig. S1). St"

Here, we report a new and effective strategy for inhibiting HCV replication using 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), an inhibitor of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone with a key role in stabilizing the conformation of many oncogenic signaling proteins. We examined the inhibitory effects of 17-AAG on HCV replication in an HCV replicon cell culture system. In HCV replicon cells treated with 17-AAG, we found that HCV RNA replication was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner, and interestingly, the only HCV protein degraded in these cells was NS3 (nonstructural protein 3). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NS3 directly interacted with Hsp90, as did proteins expressed from ΔNS3 protease expression vectors. These results suggest that the suppression of HCV RNA replication is due to the destabilization of NS3 in disruption of the Hsp90 chaperone complex by 17-AAG.

Hsp90 (heat-shock protein 90) is a molecular chaperone that plays a key role in the conformational maturation of many cellular proteins.

Hsp90 inhibitors are currently showing great promise as novel pharmacological agents for anticancer therapy.

The benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin and its less toxic analogue 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) directly bind to the ATP/ADP binding pocket of Hsp90 (34McClellan A.J.

Commun. 2007; 353: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) also reported that inhibition of Hsp90 is highly effective in suppressing HCV genome replication. Hsp90 may directly or indirectly interact with any of the proteins NS3 through NS5B to regulate replication of the HCV replicon. More recently, Okamoto et al. (39Okamoto T. Nishimura Y. Ichimura T. Suzuki K. Miyamura T. Suzuki T. Moriishi K. Matsuura Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) reported that Hsp90 could bind to FKBP8 (FK506-binding protein 8) and form a complex with NS5A. The interaction with FKBP8 has also been shown to be the mechanism by which Hsp90 regulates HCV RNA replication, a process in which Hsp90 clearly plays an important role. In this study, we have demonstrated that NS3 also forms a complex with Hsp90, which is critical for HCV replication. On the basis of the findings that treating HCV replicon cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, suppressed HCV RNA replication, and that the only HCV protein degraded in these cells was NS3, we suggest a crucial role for Hsp90-NS3 protein complexes in the HCV life cycle.

Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation Analyses-Cells were lysed in 1× CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay buffer (Roche Applied Sciences). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and these were blocked with 5% skimmed milk. The primary antibodies used were monoclonal or polyclonal antibody against FLAG-M5 (Sigma), Hsp70 (Sigma), Hsp90 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), Hsp90α (Calbiochem), Hsp90β (Calbiochem), and Hsf-1 (Calbiochem).

Immunoprecipitation from cell lysates was carried out using anti-FLAG M5 antibody (Sigma) and the Protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt Assay-HCV replicon cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/well in a final culture volume of 100 μl for 72 h before the addition of increasing concentrations of 17-AAG. After incubation for 3 days, viable cell numbers were determined using the Celltiter 96 Aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The value of the background absorbance at 490 nm (A490) of wells without cells was subtracted. The percentages of viable cells were then calculated using the formula, (A490 of 17-AAG-treated sample/A490 of untreated cells) × 100. Plasmids and Transfection-The pFLAG-CMV-NS3 vector was constructed by subcloning a DNA fragment encoding full-length NS3, Δhelicase, Δprotease, ΔPH 1, ΔPH 2, and ΔH 1 into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pFLAG-CMV™-2 expression vector (Sigma), so that the amino-terminal FLAG epitope was fused in frame with NS3. The core expression vector was a gift from Dr. M. Kohara. The vector was transfected into 293T cells using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hsp90 Inhibitor 17-AAG Suppresses HCV RNA Replication-To investigate the effect of 17-AAG on HCV replication, cells containing a full HCV genome replicon (NNC#2) or a subgenomic replicon (#50-1) were treated with 17-AAG (Fig. 1, A and B). Both of the HCV replicon cell lines were treated for 72 h with different concentrations of 17-AAG or with DMSO as a control. In cells treated with 50 nm 17-AAG, HCV RNA replication was suppressed by 99% in both of the HCV replicon cell lines, and the inhibition of RNA replication occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 17-AAG for HCV replication were 0.3 nm in NNC#2 cells and 0.1 nm in #50-1 cells. Furthermore, we used a tetrazolium-based [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay to determine the viability of NNC#2 and #50-1 cells in the presence of 17-AAG. 17-AAG showed no toxicity to NNC#2 and #50-1 cells at 50 nm, (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that 17-AAG had a greater inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication than 100 units/ml interferon-α.FIGURE 2Hsp90 inhibits HCV RNA replication in HCV replicon cells.

When NNC#2 cells were cultured with 50 nm 17-AAG only on day0(white squares), the level of HCV RNA was reduced by 2 log on day 3 but had increased to control levels by day 12 (Fig. 3B). However, when 50 nm 17-AAG was added to the cells at 3-day intervals for 15 days (black squares), the observed significant reduction in HCV RNA (by 3 log) was sustained from day 3 to day 15. We used trypan blue staining to check that long term treatment with 17-AAG did not induce cellular toxicity (Fig. 3A). Our results suggested that 17-AAG has the potential to safely induce long term suppression in HCV replication. Reduced Expression of NS3 Protein in 17-AAG-treated HCV Replicon Cells-To investigate the mechanism by which 17-AAG inhibited HCV replication, we analyzed the expression of HCV core, E1, E2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins by Western blotting. NNC#2 cells treated with increasing doses of 17-AAG showed a marked reduction in the expression of NS3 (Fig. 4A) after 3 days, in common with the level of HCV RNA (Fig. 2A). However, levels of the other proteins were unchanged. This dose-dependent inhibition suggested that NS3 was more sensitive to 17-AAG than the other proteins. Similar effects on NS3 expression and RNA replication were seen in #50-1 cells treated with 17-AAG (Fig. 4A). Another effect of 17-AAG treatment seen in these cells was an increase in Hsp70 expression and a slight increase in Hsp90 expression (Fig. 4B). The induction of Hsp70 expression suggested that Hsp90 inhibition by 17-AAG strongly activated HSF-1 (heat-shock transcription factor 1) (43Sittler A. Lurz R. Ueder G. Priller J. Lehrach H. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Wanker E.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We also examined the levels of HCV core and NS5B protein expression in NNC#2 cells treated with 50 nm 17-AAG. Reduced levels of these proteins were seen in NNC#2 cells on day 6, and both HCV core and NS5B protein were undetectable on day 9 (Fig. 4C). To determine whether 17-AAG promoted the degradation of NS3, we next looked at the effect of 17-AAG on #50-1 cells in which proteasomal degradation was also inhibited. Although 17-AAG treatment still induced a reduction in the NS3 protein level in #50-1 cells (Fig. 4D), the degradation of NS3 was completely blocked in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. This suggested that the pharmacological effect of 17-AAG was dependent on the proteasome system (44Bonvini P. Dalla Rosa H. Vignes N. Rosolen A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 45Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol.

Protein Folding in Hsp90-NS3 Interaction-To investigate the role of Hsp90 in HCV NS3 activation, the FLAG-NS3 protein was transfected into 293T cells, with or without 17-AAG, and the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. The expression of NS3 from FLAG-NS3 was reduced in the presence of 17-AAG (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Hsp90 is involved in HCV NS3 degradation, possibly through a physical interaction. We confirmed this specific interaction by immunoprecipitating 293T cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody. This clearly showed that FLAG and Hsp90 co-precipitated, suggesting that NS3 was bound to the chaperone complex formed with Hsp90 (Fig. 5B). NS3 mutants lacking the protease and helicase regions were generated in order to identify the region responsible for the interaction with Hsp90 (Fig. 5C). FLAG-NS3, FLAG-NS3-Δhelicase, or FLAG-NS3-Δprotease were transfected into 293T cells, and anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5D). Although FLAG-NS3-Δprotease was clearly co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp90, no protein band corresponding to FLAG-NS3-Δhelicase was detected (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the NS3 helicase region mediates binding to Hsp90. To confirm this finding, plasmids expressing different NS3 helicase mutants fused with FLAG (ΔPH 1, ΔPH 2, and ΔH 1) were constructed (Fig. 5E). Expressing these NS3 helicase mutants in 293T cells and analyzing their immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG antibody by Western blotting showed that, although all of the NS3 helicase mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG-antibody, no Hsp90 was co-precipitated (Fig. 5F). We also confirmed that the NS3 helicase region mediated the specific interaction with Hsp90 by transfecting FLAG-NS3 and FLAG-NS3 deletion mutants into 293T cells pretreated with 17-AAG (Fig. 5G). The proteins expressed by FLAG-NS3 and FLAG-NS3-Δprotease were degraded in cells pretreated with 17-AAG, whereas no degradation of the ΔPH 2 and ΔH 1 NS3 mutants lacking helicase regions was seen (Fig. 5G). Further, when pEF-core was expressed in 293T cells, core was unable to co-immunoprecipitate Hsp90, and no degradation of core protein was observed (Fig. 5G). Our data demonstrate that 17-AGG destabilizes several binding proteins (NS3 and NS3-Δprotease) to Hsp90 but stablilizes some nonbinding proteins (the ΔPH 2 and ΔH 1 NS3 mutants lacking helicase regions and core) to Hsp90. In previous reports (46Blagosklonny M.V. Toretsky J. Bohen S. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8379-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), similar effects were observed when wild-type and mutated p53 were translated in the presence of geldanamycin. These results further supported the hypothesis that Hsp90 has a role in folding the NS3 helicase domain and that this has an important role in stabilizing the full-length NS3 protein. A protein complex that includes NS3 and Hsp90 is therefore implicated in the control of HCV replication. The Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, is known to have highly selective effects on tumor cells that are a result of its high affinity for Hsp90 client oncoproteins, which are incorporated into the Hsp90-dependent multichaperone complex, thereby increasing their binding affinity for 17-AAG more than 100-fold (47Kamal A. Thao L. Sensintaffar J. Zhang L. Boehm M.F. Fritz L.C. Burrows F.J. Nature. 2003; 425: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). This high selectivity effectively minimizes the toxic side effects of 17-AAG so that it is a good candidate for clinical application, especially in treating neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we observed the inhibitory effects of 17-AAG on the replication of an HCV subgenomic replicon that lacked NS2. On the other hand, Waxman et al. (37Waxman L. Whitney M. Pollok B.A. Kuo L.C. Darke P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13931-13935Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated a role for Hsp90 in promoting the cleavage of HCV NS2/3 protein using NS2/3 translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and expressed in Jurkat cells. Because the replicon cells used in our study genetically lacked NS2, our results suggest that Hsp90 may directly interact with the NS3 protein in the HCV replicon. In cell lines in which 17-AAG was a potent inhibitor of HCV replication, with IC50 values of 3–10 nm, we also found strong evidence that the association between HCV Hsp90 and NS3, but not other NS proteins, was the essential mechanism controlling the preferential degradation of NS3 after 17-AAG treatments. Furthermore, we showed that NS3 interacted with Hsp90 through the NS3 helicase domain. It was also clear that the expression of NS3 protein with helicase activity in 293T cells pretreated with 17-AAG was reduced, but the expression of NS3 mutants lacking the helicase regions (ΔPH 2 and ΔH1) was not. The role of Hsp90 in achieving and/or stabilizing the NS3 protein was suggested by the fact that only 17-AGG bound to Hsp90 was capable of affecting NS3. The use of Hsp90 inhibitors represents a novel strategy for the development of anti-HCV therapies. We are grateful to M. Sato, R. Tobita, and Y. Katumura for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2147661805,"In humans, heparin-binding protein (HBP) and the potent chemotactic lipid leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) are important mediators of innate immune responses. Here we show that human neutrophils (PMNs) challenged with LTB(4) (30 s to 5 min) release HBP as determined by Western blot analysis. This response peaks at 100 nM of agonist and is mediated by the BLT1 receptor. Protein phosphatase-1 (30 microM) and wortmannin (0.5 microM) block the LTB(4)-mediated HBP release from PMNs, which suggests involvement of the 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase intracellular pathway during degranulation. Furthermore, postsecretory supernatants from LTB(4)-stimulated PMNs induce intracellular calcium mobilization in endothelial cells in vitro and increase in vascular permeability in vivo, as assessed in a mouse model of pleurisy. Selective removal of HBP from the supernatant significantly reduces these activities attributing a key role to HBP in the LTB(4)-induced change in vascular permeability. This lipid-protein axis could offer novel opportunities for pharmacological intervention in key steps of the vascular response to inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2033884991,"p300 is a well known histone acetyltransferase and coactivator that plays pivotal roles in many physiological processes. Despite extensive research for the functions of p300 in embryogenesis and transcription regulation, its roles in regulating embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency are poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigated the self-renewal ability and early differentiation process in both wild-type mouse ES cells and ES cells derived from p300 knock-out (p300-/-) mice. We found that p300 ablation did not affect self-renewal capacity overtly when ES cells were maintained under undifferentiated conditions. However, the absence of p300 caused a significantly abnormal expression pattern of germ layer markers when differentiation was induced by embryoid body (EB) formation. Interestingly, the expression level of pluripotency marker Nanog but not Oct4 was markedly lower in EBs from p300-/- ES cells compared with that in EBs from wild-type ES cells. Exogenous expression of Nanog rescued abnormal expression of extra-embryonic endoderm marker partially but not mesoderm and ectoderm markers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p300 was directly involved in modulating Nanog expression.

Mouse embryonic stem (ES) 2The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; EB, embryoid body; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR. cells are self-renewing and pluripotent cell lines derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst of preimplantation embryos. The pluripotent state and self-renewing ability of ES cells are maintained by both extracellular and intracellular factors. Transcription factor Oct4 is a key regulator of the pluripotent state (1Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2884) Google Scholar). Cooperatively with transcription factor Sox2, Oct4 activates expression of genes promoting self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells but suppresses genes associated with differentiation (2Niwa H. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 3Masui S. Nakatake Y. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Okochi H. Okuda A. Matoba R. Sharov A.A. Ko M.S. Niwa H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Nanog is another important regulator specifically expressed in pluripotent cells in preimplantation mouse embryos and undifferentiated ES cells. In the absence of Nanog, mouse embryos die shortly after implantation, and ES cells in culture lose the ability to self-renew, differentiating into the extra-embryonic endoderm lineage (4Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 5Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Thus, both Oct4 and Nanog are absolutely required for the maintenance of ES cell characteristics. More recently, they were shown to be able to reprogram differentiated somatic cells, together with other factors such as Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Lin28 (6Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18651) Google Scholar, 7Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. Slukvin I.I. Thomson J.A. Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (8088) Google Scholar). Obviously, it is extremely important to understand how Oct4 and Nanog expression is controlled as a basis for novel strategies to maintain ES cell self-renewal or to direct their differentiation and perhaps to induce pluripotency in differentiated somatic cells. Extensive research has been conducted to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying Oct4 expression regulation since its discovery nearly two decades ago. However, less is known about Nanog expression regulation. Nevertheless, it is drawing increasing attention. Kuroda et al. (8Kuroda T. Tada M. Kubota H. Kimura H. Hatano S.Y. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Tada T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) reported that Oct4 and Sox2 activate Nanog expression. In contrast, p53 and Tcf3 were reported to suppress Nanog expression in mouse ES cells, respectively (9Pereira L. Yi F. Merrill B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7479-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Lin T. Chao C. Saito S. Mazur S.J. Murphy M.E. Appella E. Xu Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), suggesting that the steady-state level of Nanog expression in undifferentiated ES cells is controlled by the balance between its activators and repressors. In addition, regulation of Nanog expression by T (Brachyury) and Stat3 was investigated during an early stage of ES cell specification toward mesoderm lineage (11Suzuki A. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Morita M. Matsui T. Nakashima K. Gage F.H. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10294-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The finding suggests that strict control of Nanog expression exists in differentiating as well as undifferentiated ES cells. p300 is a well known transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase activity and plays pivotal roles in a wide range of biological and cellular processes (12Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies in mice have demonstrated that p300 knock-out leads to embryonic lethality at or before embryonic day 11.5 with severe central nervous system and heart abnormalities (14Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Further study showed that expression of p300 is regulated in a stage- and tissue-specific manner during mouse embryogenesis (15Partanen A. Motoyama J. Hui C.C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 487-494PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its important position in development and cellular functions, the role of p300 in regulation of self-renewal and cell fate decision of ES cells remains largely unexplored. Considering its essential role in embryogenesis and its close association with transcription regulation, understanding the functional contribution of p300 to maintaining ES cell identity and controlling expression of pluripotency genes should shed light on the molecular mechanisms governing the basic features of ES cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether p300 plays any role in the process of ES cell self-renewal and differentiation. With the availability of p300-/- ES cells, we studied the role of p300 in maintenance of self-renewal and further compared morphological features and molecular events between wild-type and p300-deficient ES cells during leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal and aggregation-induced differentiation. The results demonstrate that p300 is required for ES cells to undergo early differentiation appropriately, partially through its positively regulatory effect on Nanog expression. ES Cell Culture-Mouse ES cell lines with genotypes of p300+/+ and p300-/- (gifts from Andrew Kung) were cultured in an undifferentiated state under standard conditions (16Roth J.F. Shikama N. Henzen C. Desbaillets I. Lutz W. Marino S. Wittwer J. Schorle H. Gassmann M. Eckner R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5186-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The CGR8 ES cell line (a gift from Austin Smith and Ian Chambers) was cultured under feeder-free conditions as described previously (17Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction-The pPyCAGIP vector and p300/pCMVβ were gifts from Austin Smith and Tony Kouzarides, respectively. Full-length cDNA fragments encoding Nanog and p300 were subcloned into the pPyCAGIP vector, yielding Nanog/pPyCAGIP and p300/pPyCAGIP plasmids. The Nanog reporter plasmid Nanog-4.8kb/pGL3, composed of the 5′ upstream -4.8 kb (-4,828/+190, relative to the transcription start site), was a gift from Da-Yong Wu (18Wu D.Y. Yao Z. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Nanog-3.8kb reporter was generated by subcloning the 5′ upstream fragment (-3,794/+190) from Nanog-4.8kb/pGL3 into a pGL3-Basic vector. EB Formation-p300+/+ and p300-/- ES cells were trypsinized to small clumps containing three to five cells. The cell suspension was applied to gelatin-coated dishes and kept in a 37 °C incubator for 45 min to let feeder cells attach to dishes. EBs were formed by suspending ES cells in ES cell culture medium without LIF and were harvested at the indicated time points. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR)-RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions for TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and subjected to qPCR with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a thermal cycler (ABI PRISM 7900). The amount of target cDNA in different samples was calculated by dividing the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA amount in each sample for normalization. Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table S1. Western Blot Analysis-Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Xu H.M. Liao B. Zhang Q.J. Wang B.B. Li H. Zhong X.M. Sheng H.Z. Zhao Y.X. Zhao Y.M. Jin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23495-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For quantification, films were scanned using a photodensitometer (UMAX) and analyzed by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies used in this study included p300 monoclonal antibody (RW128, Upstate), affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Nanog and Oct4 (produced in our laboratory), and tubulin polyclonal antibody (Sigma). Colony Formation Assay-p300+/+ and p300-/- ES cells were trypsinized into single cells. 2 × 103 cells were plated in 35-mm cell culture dishes with a feeder layer in the presence of LIF. After culture for 7 days, cells were stained using the alkaline phosphatase substrate kit III (Vector Laboratories). Colonies were counted and classified into three categories as undifferentiated, mixed, and differentiated. Reporter Assays-p300-/- ES cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were harvested for luciferase activity measurement with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays-CGR8 ES cells or p300+/+ and p300-/- ES cells were cultured without LIF and feeder cells for 2 days and subjected to ChIP assay as described previously (20Zhang Z. Liao B. Xu M. Jin Y. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3042-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies against p300 (Upstate), acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (acetyl-H3K9; Abcam), acetylated histone H3 lysine 14 (acetyl-H3K14; Upstate), and acetylated histone H3 lysines 9 and 14 (acetyl-H3K9/14; Upstate) were used. The target sequences were amplified by specific primers shown in supplemental Table S2. p300 Expression Level Changes Dynamically during ES Cell Differentiation-To determine the expression pattern of p300 in pluripotent and differentiated ES cells, we examined p300 mRNA and protein levels during EB formation with wild-type ES cells. qPCR analysis showed that the p300 mRNA level gradually increased with EB formation up to 10 days (Fig. 1A). The p300 protein level fluctuated during the same time course (Fig. 1, B and C). A high level of p300 protein was seen on EB days 0 and 2. Unexpectedly, it declined to a much lower level from days 4 to 10. The observed discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels of p300 during the EB formation process was probably due to post-translational modifications that occurred during differentiation (21Brouillard F. Cremisi C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39509-39516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The distinct dynamic change in the p300 expression level may implicate the important role of p300 in different stages of ES cell differentiation. p300 Is Required for Proper Differentiation Process of ES Cells-To find out the function of p300 in maintaining self-renewal of ES cells, a colony formation assay was performed (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). There was little difference in the calculative percentage of the three kinds of colonies (undifferentiated, mixed, and differentiated) between p300+/+ and p300-/- ES cells. Moreover, our data show that deletion of p300 did not affect the cell cycle profile (supplemental Table S3) and the cell growth rate (data not shown). These findings suggest that p300 is dispensable for ES cell self-renewal in an undifferentiated state. We further examined the molecular markers in undifferentiated p300+/+ and p300-/- ES cells by qPCR (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the result of colony formation assays, pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 were expressed at similar levels in p300+/+ and p300-/- ES cells. Surprisingly, the endoderm marker Gata6 was found to be markedly higher in p300-/- ES cells. In contrast, the ectoderm marker Fgf5 was expressed at a lower level in p300-/- ES cells than in wild-type ones. Subsequently, the role of p300 during spontaneous EB formation was examined. We found that EBs formed from p300-/- ES cells were smaller during the first 2 or 3 days, as had been reported by other researchers (16Roth J.F. Shikama N. Henzen C. Desbaillets I. Lutz W. Marino S. Wittwer J. Schorle H. Gassmann M. Eckner R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5186-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Rebel V.I. Kung A.L. Tanner E.A. Yang H. Bronson R.T. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14789-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, no apparent cell death was observed in EBs of p300-/- ES cells as in those of p300+/+ ES cells. Notably, multiple stacks of cell layers outlining the surface of EBs from p300-/- ES cells were observed (Fig. 2C, upper panel). Normally, only one or two layers of extra-embryonic endoderm cells exist in the outer layer of EBs (23Shimoda M. Kanai-Azuma M. Hara K. Miyazaki S. Kanai Y. Monden M. Miyazaki J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3859-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To investigate the nature of abnormal EBs from p300-/- ES cells, the mRNA level of three embryonic germ layer markers, including Gata6 (endoderm), Brachyury (T) (mesoderm), and Fgf5 (ectoderm), was examined during the EB formation process by qPCR. As shown in Fig. 2D, dynamic expression patterns of all three marker genes in EBs of p300-/- ES cells were different from those of p300+/+ ES cells. For example, the Gata6 expression level was significantly higher in EBs of p300-/- ES cells at all time points examined. This result agrees with the observation of overgrowth of extra-embryonic endoderm-like cells in the outer layer of their EBs because it is well known that Gata6 promotes extra-embryonic endoderm differentiation in mouse ES cells (24Fujikura J. Yamato E. Yonemura S. Hosoda K. Masui S. Nakao K. Miyazaki Ji J. Niwa H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The results indicate that ablation of p300 could lead to abnormal expression of several germ layer markers, implying that p300 is required for maintaining an orderly differentiation process during ES cell in vitro differentiation. Nanog Expression Is Reduced in the Absence of p300 during ES Cell Differentiation-Because the absence of p300 affected proper expression of molecular markers of multiple germ layers, we wanted to know whether Oct4 and Nanog, well known key regulators of ES cells, were involved in the process. To this end, we measured mRNA and protein levels of Oct4 and Nanog during EB formation. qPCR analysis showed that in wild-type ES cells the Nanog transcript level was down-regulated markedly on EB day 2 and gradually rose up until day 10, which is in agreement with a previous report (9Pereira L. Yi F. Merrill B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7479-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Of note, an evidently lower level of Nanog transcript in EBs of p300-/- ES cells was detected from EB day 2 to 10 compared with that in EBs of wild-type ES cells, although the general expression trend along EB formation was similar in these two ES cell types (Fig. 3A, left panel). Similarly, the Nanog protein level in EBs of p300-/- ES cells was evidently lower than that in EBs of wild-type ES cells (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, we did not find a significant difference in the Oct4 mRNA level between the two ES cell types (Fig. 3A, right panel), although the protein level of Oct4 seemed lower in EBs of p300-/- ES cells than in EBs of p300+/+ ES cells after EB day 6 (Fig. 3, B, right panel, and C). Taken together, the findings demonstrate that transcription of Nanog during differentiation is specifically dependent on the presence of p300. Overexpression of Nanog Rescues Phenotypes in EBs of p300-/- ES Cells-We were interested in knowing whether the reduction in Nanog expression was responsible for phenotypes detected in the EBs of p300-/- ES cells because it was reported that down-regulation of Nanog expression could lead to ES cell differentiation (4Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 25Hough S.R. Clements I. Welch P.J. Wiederholt K.A. Stem Cells (Durham). 2006; 24: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We overexpressed Nanog in p300-/- ES cells to test whether this could rescue the phenotypes (Fig. 4A). When EB formation assays were performed with the three ES cell lines (wild-type, p300-/-, and p300-/- +Nanog ES cells), the stacks of endoderm-like cells in the outer layer of EBs of p300-/- ES cells disappeared with Nanog overexpression (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Nanog could, at least in part, rescue the abnormal morphology of EBs seen in the absence of p300. To further define the rescuing ability of Nanog at a molecular level, we quantified the transcript levels of several germ layer markers in EBs from all three ES cell types at different stages (Fig. 4C). Consistent with our morphological observation, significantly high levels of the extra-embryonic endoderm markers Gata6, Gata4, and Ihh detected in EBs of p300-/- ES cells were obviously corrected by overexpression of Nanog, although their expression levels did not recover completely to those in EBs of wild-type ES cells. In contrast, aberrant expression of other marker genes, T and Fgf5, in EBs of p300-/- ES cells was not affected by overexpression of Nanog. These results indicate that improper regulation of Nanog expression during ES cell differentiation is probably one of the causes of the phenotypes seen in EBs of p300-/- ES cells. p300 Participates in Regulation of Nanog Expression-On the basis of the above results, we hypothesized that p300 might participate in regulating Nanog expression. To verify this idea, we evaluated the effect of p300 on activity of the reporter containing the 5′ upstream regulatory region of Nanog (Nanog-4.8kb) in p300-/- ES cells (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, p300 enhanced the Nanog-4.8kb reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that p300 was able to promote Nanog expression at a transcriptional level. Moreover, stimulation of p300 upon Nanog transcription was consistently observed regardless of the presence or absence of LIF in the culture medium (data not shown). To further define in which region of the Nanog regulatory sequence p300 performed its activation function, we repeated the reporter assay with a truncated form of the Nanog reporter, Nanog-3.8kb (Fig. 5, A and C). With reporter plasmids alone, the luciferase activity of the Nanog-3.8kb reporter was lower than that of the Nanog-4.8kb reporter, consistent with a previous report (18Wu D.Y. Yao Z. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Importantly, addition of p300 did not enhance the activity of the Nanog-3.8kb reporter, whereas the same dose of p300 activated the Nanog-4.8kb reporter significantly. The results suggest that the region from -3.8 to -4.8 kb may contain an important regulatory element for Nanog expression in ES cells and that p300 probably regulates Nanog expression through its action in this region, which has been reported to harbor an early mesoderm progenitor enhancer regulated by Stat3 and T (11Suzuki A. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Morita M. Matsui T. Nakashima K. Gage F.H. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10294-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). p300 May Regulate Nanog Expression by Epigenetic Modification of Histone Acetylation-To elucidate the mechanism by which p300 regulates Nanog expression, we first determined whether p300 was directly associated with the regulatory region of Nanog by ChIP assays. In line with the results of reporter assays, we detected significant recruitment of p300 protein to the distal regulatory region of Nanog containing the T- and Stat3-binding site (Nanog T-Stat3) but not to the proximal enhancer (Nanog PE) (Fig. 6A). In addition, weak association of p300 with the distal enhancer (Nanog DE) was also observed. Thus, it appears that p300 directly regulates Nanog expression primarily through its binding to the distal regulatory region during ES cell differentiation. We next focused on the acetylation modification state of histone at the regulatory region of Nanog, considering the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300. Having known that the 9th (H3K9) and 14th (H3K14) lysine residues of histone H3 are substrates of p300 and that their acetylation usually serves as markers of transcriptionally active chromatin (26McManus K.J. Hendzel M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7611-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), ChIP assays were conducted with specific antibodies against acetyl-H3K9, acetyl-H3K14, or both. When p300+/+ and p300-/- ES cells were induced into differentiation by withdrawal of LIF for 2 days, which was sufficient to trigger differential Nanog expression in p300-/- ES cells (data not shown), acetylated histone H3 at the Nanog T-Stat3-binding site, detected by antibodies against acetyl-H3K9 and acetyl-H3K9/14, decreased significantly in p300-/- ES cells compared with that in p300+/+ ES cells (Fig. 6B). In contrast, there was no difference in the signal detected by an acetyl-H3K14 antibody, implying that p300 plays a role in H3K9 acetylation but not H3K14 acetylation at this particular site. Furthermore, deletion of p300 did not compromise H3K9 or H3K14 acetylation at the Nanog DE or Nanog PE regions. Instead, an increase in acetyl-H3K14 associated with Nanog PE was detected. The result corresponds well with our earlier finding that p300 was predominantly recruited to the Nanog T-Stat3 region (Fig. 6A). Thus, our data imply that transcriptional regulation of Nanog by p300 may be mediated through epigenetic modification of histone acetylation at the T-Stat3-binding site of the Nanog distal regulatory region during ES cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the roles of p300 in keeping ES cell self-renewal and differentiation running properly. We show that deletion of p300 in ES cells markedly disturbs normal differentiation processes, although the self-renewal capacity appears not to be affected overtly. Moreover, our data indicate that reduced Nanog expression in the absence of p300 is responsible for the abnormal differentiation toward the extra-embryonic endoderm lineage during EB formation. Finally, we demonstrate that p300 positively participates in Nanog transcriptional regulation probably by acetylation of histone at the distal regulatory region of Nanog. The study provides the first evidence for the role and potential mechanism of p300 in the control of ES cell fate decision during early differentiation. The roles of p300 in cell differentiation and signal transduction pathways have been investigated previously (27Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Particularly, p300 was demonstrated to be essential for ES cells to differentiate into hematopoietic and myogenic cells in vitro, respectively (16Roth J.F. Shikama N. Henzen C. Desbaillets I. Lutz W. Marino S. Wittwer J. Schorle H. Gassmann M. Eckner R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5186-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Rebel V.I. Kung A.L. Tanner E.A. Yang H. Bronson R.T. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14789-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the defects caused by p300 ablation in these studies were detected after the ES cells had undergone considerable extensive differentiation. So far, little is known about what roles p300 plays in ES cell self-renewal and differentiation into three primitive germ layers during the early differentiation process in vitro, which mimic postimplantation embryonic tissues in vivo (28Desbaillets I. Ziegler U. Groscurth P. Gassmann M. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In this study, we consistently observed a difference in expression of endoderm and ectoderm markers between wild-type and p300-deficient ES cells when they were cultured in an undifferentiated state. However, what keeps p300-/- ES cells in an undifferentiated state even in the presence of aberrant expression of certain differentiation genes is unknown. Although p300-/- ES cells still possessed the ability to undergo self-renewal, they seemed predisposed toward differentiation. Indeed, p300-/- ES cells responded to differentiation-inducing cues differently from wild-type ES cells. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time that p300 may regulate the expression of certain early differentiation genes and that it is required for ES cells to maintain a normal early differentiation process. The finding may provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the impaired hematopoietic and myogenic differentiation detected in later stages of differentiation processes reported in previous studies (16Roth J.F. Shikama N. Henzen C. Desbaillets I. Lutz W. Marino S. Wittwer J. Schorle H. Gassmann M. Eckner R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5186-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Rebel V.I. Kung A.L.

The finding that down-regulation of Nanog is responsible for abnormal extra-embryonic endoderm differentiation in EBs of p300-/- ES cells is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the essential role of Nanog in suppression of extra-embryonic endoderm differentiation (4Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 25Hough S.R. Clements I. Welch P.J. Wiederholt K.A. Stem Cells (Durham). 2006; 24: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The results point out that maintenance of pluripotency genes at an appropriate level is critical not only in the undifferentiated state but also during the differentiation of ES cells. However, the inability of Nanog overexpression to rescue the aberrant expression of other lineage markers implies that factors other than Nanog may mediate p300 deficiency-dependent phenotypes, which needs further analysis. In addition, we discovered that Nanog expression is under direct regulation of p300, which adds another factor to the list of the known regulators of Nanog expression, including Oct4 and Sox2 (8Kuroda T.

Currently, it is not clear how p300 exerts its control over Nanog expression during early events of ES cell differentiation. The transcriptional regulation functions of p300 are known to be exerted through multiple mechanisms. First, it regulates transcription through its interaction with a wide range of DNA-binding transcriptional factors, such as p53, E2F, AP1, MyoD, and NF-κB (13Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it functions in both acetyltransferase activity-dependent and -independent manners. Recent genome-wide mapping of p300-binding sequences in ES cells revealed that most p300-binding sites were associated with three to six other transcription factors, including Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, followed by Smad1, Esrrb, Klf4, and Stat3 at a lower probability (31Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. Loh Y.H. Yeo H.C. Yeo Z.X. Narang V. Govindarajan K.R. Leong B. Shahab A. Ruan Y. Bourque G. Sung W.K. Clarke N.D. Wei C.L. Ng H.H. Cell. 2008; 133: 1106-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that p300 associated with a distal regulatory region of Nanog that contains binding sites for T and Stat3, supporting the possibility that p300 may activate Nanog expression through association with T or Stat3. As a matter of fact, it was reported that p300-mediated Stat3 acetylation could activate Stat3 sequence-specific DNA binding and transcription (32Wang R. Cherukuri P. Luo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11528-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Further investigation is under way to address this issue. In addition, p300 has the ability to influence chromatin state by modulating nucleosomal histones. Our finding that acetylation of H3K9 in the distal regulatory region of Nanog was reduced in p300-/- ES cells suggests that epigenetic modification of the core histone may be involved in Nanog expression regulation by p300 during ES cell differentiation. Interestingly, we observed an increase in acetyl-histone H3K14 associated with Nanog PE, whereas association of p300 with the site was not detected. This phenomenon could be brought about by an indirect influence of p300 knock-out. Growing evidence demonstrates that ES cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled by epigenetic factors that affect transcription of key regulators for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency (33Bibikova M. Laurent L.C. Ren B. Loring J.F. Fan J.B. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For instance, DNA methyltransferase was shown to methylate the promoters of Oct4 and Nanog (34Li J.Y. Pu M.T. Hirasawa R. Li B.Z. Huang Y.N. Zeng R. Jing N.H. Chen T. Li E. Sasaki H. Xu G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8748-8759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, the Jmjd2c histone H3K9 demethylase has been shown to be a positive regulator for Nanog expression (35Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. George J. Ng H.H. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2545-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ChIP assays revealed that histones H3 and H4 were highly acetylated at the Nanog locus in ES cells (36Hattori N. Imao Y. Nishino K. Hattori N. Ohgane J. Yagi S. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Nanog is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms involving both DNA methylation and histone modifications. Despite these findings, the acetyltransferase(s) associated with Nanog expression in ES cells has not yet been identified. p300 is the first acetyltransferase demonstrated to have the capacity to modulate Nanog expression. However, whether the histone acetyltransferase activity is required for its role in the regulation of Nanog expression is not known yet.

We report observational evidence of dust forming around a carbon star in a nearby galaxy with a low abundance of heavy elements, 25 times lower than the solar abundance. The production of dust by a carbon star in a galaxy with such primitive abundances raises the possibility that carbon stars contributed carbonaceous dust in the early universe."

The PIC traverses the nuclear envelope, and within the nucleus the viral DNA is subsequently inserted into the chromosomes of the infected host, an event specifically catalyzed by IN. HIV-1 IN and RT (a heterodimeric enzyme of 66- and 51-kDa subunits) are initially synthesized as part of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, which is subsequently processed by HIV-1 protease during viral maturation to produce active IN and RT. IN (288 amino acids; 32 kDa) comprises three domains: an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (residues 1–50), a catalytic core domain (residues 51–212), and a C-terminal domain (CTD; residues 213–288) that binds DNA nonspecifically (reviewed in Ref. 8Holmes-Son M.L.

Virol. 2004; 78: 5056-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The significance of this IN-RT interaction in the context of viral replication has not yet been firmly established. In vitro studies with purified IN and RT, however, have shown that HIV-1 IN can stimulate both the initiation and elongation modes of RT-catalyzed reverse transcription by enhancing RT processivity (23Dobard C.W. Briones M.S. Chow S.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10037-10046Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To aid our ongoing studies of functional interactions between IN and RT during HIV-1 replication, we have characterized in detail the RT-binding surface on the IN CTD using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, identifying particular IN CTD amino acids that form contacts with RT through chemical shift perturbation experiments. In addition, we have assessed kinetic parameters and binding constants for both IN CTD-RT and IN-RT interactions using SPR. This experimental approach allows us to define and quantify the IN-RT interaction to a level that is not possible through co-immunoprecipitation or other fusion protein pulldown techniques. With the intention of perturbing IN-RT interactions, we introduced an alanine substitution for lysine at position 258 (K258A) within the IN CTD and subsequently used SPR to characterize the effect of this substitution upon IN·RT complex formation. Lys258 in IN lies at the putative RT-binding site identified here by NMR, and the IN K258A substitution has been previously shown to significantly impair reverse transcription in infected cells (20Lu R. Ghory H.Z. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10356-10368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We found that the K258A substitution substantially weakened IN CTD-RT interactions. Finally, we introduced various IN amino acid substitutions at the putative RT-binding surface into the NL4-3 viral clone, and replication of viruses containing these substitutions was significantly impaired in tissue culture assays. Collectively, the observations presented here suggest that IN-RT contacts are biologically relevant during HIV-1 replication and that an IN CTD·RT complex may provide a useful predictive model that can guide studies of IN-RT interactions in the viral life cycle. Expression Plasmids and Protein Purification-Full-length HIV-1 IN with a 7 × His tag (MHHHHHHHIVPRGSHM) at the N terminus was produced using pT7-7 (His)H-IN, an expression plasmid bearing the IN coding sequence from HIV-1 NL4-3 (24Appa R.S.

The expression plasmid encoding IN residues 220–270 (IN 220–270) with a 6 × His tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM) at the N terminus was provided by Dr. Robert Craigie (National Institutes of Health). Mutagenic primers and a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis protocol (25Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23 (574): 570-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) were employed to introduce a specific mutation within the IN 220–270 expression plasmid to yield the IN 220–270 protein sequence bearing a K258A substitution (IN 220–270/K258A). All IN constructs were expressed in CodonPlus Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) and were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid immobilized metal affinity chromatography. RT was expressed in E. coli cells (M15::pDMI.1 strain) using a plasmid (p6HRT-PROT) with dual inducible expression cassettes for (6 × His tag)-p66 and untagged HIV-1 protease. In this expression system, partial cleavage of the p66 product by protease generates the His-tagged p66/p51 RT heterodimer (26Le Grice S.F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). RT was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by cation exchange chromatography, and SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of highly (>95%) pure RT heterodimer. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Virus Preparation and Replication Kinetics-Generation of the HIV-1 NL4-3 molecular clones (27Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bearing the IN single amino acid substitutions W243E and V250E were prepared by first introducing the desired substitutions into pSK-SC001, a pBluescript-derived subcloning vector containing an engineered AgeI site and the 2.3-kilobase pair AgeI-EcoRI fragment of NL4-3 (nucleotide positions 3486–5744), which encompasses the IN gene. Mutagenic primers and a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis protocol (25Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23 (574): 570-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) were used to introduce W243E and V250E substitutions into the IN coding sequence in pSK-SC001. The modified AgeI-EcoRI fragment was then excised from the subcloning vector and ligated into NL4-3 that had been sequentially digested with AgeI and then EcoRI. Top10 cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the ligation product, plated on LB agar containing 80 μg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 30 °C. The presence of the desired mutation within the IN gene was confirmed by sequencing. Virus stocks were prepared by transfecting 293T cells grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium containing l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed in 75-cm2 flasks with PolyFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) using 8 μg of plasmid DNA bearing the wild-type or mutant HIV-1 clone. Medium containing virus was collected 36–48 h later and gravity-filtered through 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filters, and the levels of p24 antigen contained in the viral supernatant were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer). One hundred nanograms of p24 equivalent of viral stocks were added to 2 × 106 CEM cells grown at 37 °C in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) having 100 IU/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was removed 12 h postinfection and replaced with 3 ml of fresh medium. Aliquots of the culture medium were then collected for p24 analysis every 2 days after the infection, with the cells being split 1:3 following these collections of viral supernatant. Mock infections were performed using wild-type virus that had been heat-inactivated by treatment at 95 °C for 4 min. NMR Experiments with 15N-labeled IN 220–270 and RT-15N-labeled IN 220–270 was expressed in E. coli cells using M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl, and the 15N-labeled, His-tagged protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified RT heterodimer was dialyzed at 4 °C in NMR buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA), and the chemical shift perturbation experiment was performed by adding aliquots of an unlabeled RT heterodimer to 200 μm 15N-labeled IN 220–270 (concentration calculated assuming monomeric IN 220–270) in NMR buffer with 93% H2O, 7% D2O. Successive aliquots of RT were added to IN 220–270 to produce IN 220–270:RT molar ratios of 10:1 and 5:1, and 2:1. Molar ratios were calculated assuming monomeric amounts of IN 220–270. After each addition, a two-dimensional 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum (28Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2423) Google Scholar) of the sample was recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker 800 MHz Avance spectrometer. The same buffer and temperature conditions used in the NMR structure determination of IN 220–270 (29Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9826-9833Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) were also employed in our NMR experiments. Prior to performing titrations with RT, a preliminary spectrum of free 15N-labeled IN 220–270 was collected for the purpose of establishing peak assignments, which were made by comparison of peak positions with the NMR data archived at the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1IHV). Structural representations for IN 220–270 were produced using the program MacPyMOL (30DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). SPR Experiments with IN and RT-SPR experiments using IN, IN 220–270, IN 220–270/K258A, and RT were performed on a Biacore T100 instrument. The carboxydextran surface of a CM5 chip (Biacore) was activated by injecting a 1:1 (by volume) mixture of 400 mm 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride: 100 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide over two flow cells, followed by immobilization of ∼1300 response units (RU) of recombinant RT on one of the flow cells. The remaining flow cell was left unmodified and used as a reference. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by injecting 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5) across both flow cells. Concentrations of 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.3, 15.6, 7.8, 3.9, and 0 nm (serial 2-fold dilutions) of the various IN constructs were injected across both flow cells. All of these experiments at a given concentration were performed in triplicate, and double-referencing (i.e. both solvent subtraction and correction for nonspecific binding to the unmodified reference flow cell) was employed to produce signals resulting only from IN-RT interactions. All of the SPR experiments were performed at 25 °C in a running buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (SPR buffer) using a 50 μl/min flow rate. Regeneration of the chip surface between individual experiments was accomplished using a 120 s pulse of 10 mm glycine (pH 2.5) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. In addition, the running buffers for experiments with IN and IN 220–270 contained 1% and 0.011% glycerol, respectively, to match residual glycerol levels in the samples that were injected across the chip surface. The association and dissociation phases of all of these experiments were 240 and 300 s, respectively. Similar experiments using 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μm BSA were performed in duplicate as negative controls. Assessment of the validity of 1:1 or two-state conformational exchange binding models, as well as the calculation of binding parameters, was performed using Biacore T100 Evaluation software (Biacore). Residual χ2 values are a measure of the average squared difference between experimental data and fitted models and were calculated using the formula χ2 =Σ(RUexp - RUfitted)2/n, where the summation takes place over n time points in the sensorgrams, and RUexp and RUfitted are the experimental and fitted response unit values, respectively, at a given time point. Analytical Ultracentrifugation-The oligomeric state of IN 220–270 in both NMR and SPR buffers was assessed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using absorption optics at 280 nm. IN 220–270 in NMR buffer was analyzed at a concentration of 150 μm at 20 °C in a 3-mm-path length double sector cell and at a concentration of 93 μm at 25 °C in a 12-mm path length six-sector cell. Absorbance values in this data set were corrected for differences in cell path length, and partial specific volumes for ensuing calculations were derived from the IN 220–270 amino acid composition and corrected for temperature (v̄25 °C = 0.734 ml/g and v̄20 °C = 0.732 ml/g) (31Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar, 32Laue T.M. Shah B.D.

The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). IN 220–270 was analyzed in SPR buffer at concentrations of 150, 93, and 31 μm at 25 °C in a 12-mm-path length six-sector cell. Sedimentation equilibrium profiles for IN 220–270 in both NMR and SPR buffers were measured at speeds of 20,000, 24,000, and 30,000 rpm. For the two buffer conditions, the absorbance profiles at each speed were initially fitted by a nonlinear least squares algorithm within Beckman Origin-based software (version 3.01) to an exponential curve corresponding to a single ideal species, yielding weight-averaged molecular weight values for the IN 220–270 sample. The data set encompassing the entire collection of scans corresponding to different rotor speeds and protein loading concentrations were globally fitted to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model (using the “multifit” option) to obtain a dimer dissociation constant for each buffer condition. Higher order association models ultimately resulted in poorer fits and thus were not analyzed further. NMR Spectroscopy to Map the RT-binding Surface on the IN CTD-To obtain a detailed map of the RT-binding surface on the IN CTD, we performed NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments with 15N-labeled IN 220–270 and unlabeled RT. A preliminary HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled IN 220–270 indicated excellent agreement between observed peak chemical shifts and NMR chemical shift data archived at the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1IHV), allowing straightforward peak assignment. For mapping experiments, a HSQC spectrum of the free 15N-labeled IN 220–270 was collected, and successive aliquots of unlabeled RT were subsequently added to produce IN 220–270:RT molar ratios of 10:1, 5:1, and 2:1, with a 15N-1H HSQC spectrum being collected after each titration (Fig. 1). The peaks showed no changes in chemical shift as the titration progressed, and most IN 220–270 signals showed relatively gradual reductions in peak intensity during the course of the titration. At a 2:1 IN 220–270:RT molar ratio, most of the peaks in the acquired spectrum became broadened to the noise level (data not shown), and so no further titrations were performed. Amide backbone peaks associated with nine residues showed significant decreases in intensity during the titration, as compared with most other peaks in the spectra: Arg231, Leu242, Trp243, Gly247, Ala248, Val250, Ile251, Gln252, and Lys258 (Fig. 1). With the exception of Arg231, these residues mapped to one side of the IN 220–270 structure, thus identifying a putative RT-binding surface (Fig. 2). Arg231 is located within a stretch of amino acids connecting strands β1 and β2 in the NMR structure (29Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9826-9833Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and is positioned close to the putative RT-binding surface. The signal decreases observed during the titration suggest that these nine residues experience intermediate exchange on the NMR timescale (i.e. chemical exchange occurs at a frequency that is on the order of the difference between free and bound amide group chemical shift) (33Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1993: 153-182Google Scholar, 34Palmer III, A.G. Kroenke C.D. Loria J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 204-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Finally, the selective broadening of the peaks for the above nine amino acids indicates that binding of IN 220–270 to RT is specific, as nonspecific binding would produce uniform changes across all of the peaks in the spectra. SPR Studies to Characterize IN-RT Interactions-Previous co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown studies of IN-RT interactions provided relatively qualitative measures of IN-RT affinity. To provide a quantitative measurement of IN-RT binding affinity and kinetics, SPR experiments using RT and either full-length IN or IN 220–270 were performed. RT was immobilized via lysine residues to a CM5 chip using amine coupling chemistry. The crystal structure for RT (Protein Data Bank code 1HMV) shows that lysines lie throughout the RT surface; thus the cross-linking method is anticipated to attach RT to the chip surface in a random orientation. As such, any putative IN-binding site on RT is expected to be accessible for some percentage of the immobilized RT molecules. The p66/p51 heterodimer exhibits long term stability under the conditions employed for SPR experiments (35Divita G. Rittinger K. Restle T. Immendorfer U. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16337-16346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and therefore the RT heterodimer species (rather than isolated p66 and p51 subunits) are anticipated to be immobilized on the biosensor chip surface. Purified IN or IN 220–270 was passed over the immobilized RT at concentrations of 0–500 nm, and sensorgrams were recorded. The sensorgrams clearly show that both IN and IN 220–270 bound immobilized RT under these experimental conditions (Fig. 3). Analogous experiments using BSA as a negative control indicated no binding to RT (Fig. 3), and BSA present in 10-fold molar excess of IN 220–270 did not influence IN 220–270 binding to RT (data not shown), indicating that IN·RT complex formation is not due to nonspecific protein-protein interactions. A “two-state conformational exchange” binding model, where an initial bimolecular encounter to form a nascent species is followed by a conformational transition to a stable complex, has been recently described for the IN-RT interaction (22Herschhorn A. Oz-Gleenberg I. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and this model was fitted to the sensorgram data to extract binding parameters. The quality of the fit for the two-state conformational exchange model was assessed by a residual χ2 value, a parameter that measures the difference between the fitted model and the experimental data. A simple bimolecular “1:1 binding” model was also fitted to the sensorgram data for comparison purposes. Experiments with both IN and IN 220–270 resulted in suboptimum fits of the 1:1 binding model, with relatively high χ2 values (6.67 and 22.3 for IN and IN 220–270, respectively). 2–3-fold decreases in χ2 were achieved when fitting the two-state conformational exchange model to the IN and IN 220–270 data sets (3.55 and 8.82, respectively; Fig. 3 and Table 1), A+Bka1⇋kd1AB*ka2⇋kd2ABEq. 1 and the resulting dissociation constants (KD) for IN and IN 220–270 binding to RT were 61.2 and 87.3 nm, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Both the kinetic parameters and the dissociation constant for the full-length IN-RT interaction were in good agreement with previously published measurements (22Herschhorn A. Oz-Gleenberg I. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Fitted binding parameters for two-state conformational exchange reaction See Reaction 1, which shows the two-state reaction with conformational exchange.ka1kd1ka2kd2KDX2m–1 s–1s–1s–1s–1nmIN 220–2705.45 (± 0.10) × 1051.19 (± 0.02) × 10–14.11 (± 0.02) × 10–32.75 (± 0.01) × 10–387.3 ± 2.28.82IN4.82 (± 0.04) × 1041.45 (± 0.02) × 10–26.23 (± 0.10) × 10–31.59 (± 0.03) × 10–361.2 ± 1.63.55IN 220–270/K258A1.55 (± 0.01) × 1043.25 (± 0.03) × 10–24.64 (± 0.03) × 10–32.69 (± 0.02) × 10–3769.5 ± 9.90.97 Open table in a new tab Although the dissociation constants for IN and IN 220–270 binding to RT were similar, two of the kinetic parameters found for these two systems differed: both the initial on-rate and off-rate values (ka1 and kd1, respectively) for IN binding to RT were ∼10-fold lower than those found for IN 220–270 (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The reduction in ka1 for IN·RT complex formation, compared with that for IN 220–270 binding to RT, might be attributed to steric hindrance from the IN N-terminal zinc-binding domain or catalytic core domain, with these domains possibly preventing the IN CTD from gaining clear access to the binding site on RT. In such a situation, the smaller IN 220–270 construct might gain access to the binding site more freely. The reduced kd1 found for IN·RT complex formation, as compared with that found in experiments involving IN 220–270, suggests increased stabilization of the IN·RT complex at this particular step in the binding mechanism. The added stability could possibly arise from IN N-terminal zinc-binding domain and catalytic core domain residues, which may contribute to RT binding. Altogether, the differences in individual kinetic parameters suggest that the mechanistic details for IN and IN 220–270 binding to RT are not entirely the same, even though the overall dissociation constants for these two systems are comparable. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analysis of IN 220–270-A previous study has reported that 1 mm IN 220–270 in NMR buffer is predominantly dimeric (29Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9826-9833Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The current NMR experiments with IN 220–270 were performed at concentrations appreciably lower than 1 mm (100–200 μm), and the current SPR experiments were performed at much lower concentrations (3.9–500 nm) and in the presence of nondenaturing detergent (0.05% Tween 20). As such, some proportion of the dimeric IN 220–270 may have dissociated to its monomeric form under our NMR and SPR experimental conditions. To measure the extent of IN 220–270 self-association in our NMR and SPR experiments, IN 220–270 in both NMR and SPR buffers was analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium techniques. IN 220–270 sedimentation equilibrium profiles at 150 and 93 μm in NMR buffer were initially fitted to a single ideal species model. This fit showed a distinct decrease in apparent molec"

The molecular mechanism is, however, unknown. We report here on the biophysical analysis in living HeLa cells of the ABCA1 lipid microenvironment at the plasma membrane. The modifications of membrane attributes induced by ABCA1 were assessed at both the outer and inner leaflet by monitoring either the lifetime of membrane inserted fluorescent lipid analogues by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) or, respectively, the membrane translocation of cationic sensors. Analysis of the partitioning of dedicated probes in plasma membrane blebs vesiculated from these cells allowed visualization of ABCA1 partitioning into the liquid disordered-like phase and corroborated the idea that ABCA1 destabilizes the lipid arrangement at the membrane. Specificity was demonstrated by comparison with cells expressing an inactive transporter. The physiological relevance of these modifications was finally demonstrated by the reduced membrane mobility and function of transferrin receptors under the influence of an active ABCA1. Collectively, these data assess that the control of both transversal and lateral lipid distribution at the membrane is the primary function of ABCA1 and positions the effluxes of cholesterol from cell membranes downstream to the redistribution of the sterol into readily extractable membrane pools."
https://openalex.org/W2101856908,"Both signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and SALL4 are important in maintaining the pluripotent and self-renewal state of embryonic stem cells. We hypothesized that STAT3, a latent transcriptional factor, may regulate the gene expression of SALL4. In support of this hypothesis, DNA sequence analysis of the SALL4 gene promoter revealed four putative STAT3-binding sites. Using a SALL4-luciferase reporter gene assay, we found that modulation of the STAT3 activity significantly up-regulated the luciferase activity. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, the segment of the SALL4 promoter showing the highest affinity to STAT3 was localized to -366 to -163, in which there was only one putative STAT3 binding site starting at -199. Site-directed mutagenesis of all four putative STAT3-binding sites in the SALL4 promoter significantly reduced its responsiveness to STAT3, although the most dramatic effect was seen at the binding site starting at -199. We further tested the functional relationship between STAT3 and SALL4 using MDA-MB-231, a breast cell line carrying constitutive SALL4 expression and STAT3 activity. Down-regulation of the STAT3 activity using a dominant-negative construct resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of SALL4. To conclude, our data suggest that STAT3 and SALL4 probably cooperate in both physiological and pathological states."
https://openalex.org/W2127738488,"Dicer1, an essential component of RNA interference and the microRNA pathway, has many important roles in the morphogenesis of developing tissues. Dicer1 null mice have been reported to die at E7.5; therefore it is impossible to study its function in adult tissues. We previously reported that Dicer1-hypomorphic mice, whose Dicer1 expression was reduced to 20% in all tissues, were unexpectedly viable. Here we analyzed these mice to ascertain whether the down-regulation of Dicer1 expression has any influence on adult tissues. Interestingly, all tissues of adult (8–10 week old) Dicer1-hypomorphic mice were histologically normal except for the pancreas, whose development was normal at the fetal and neonatal stages; however, morphologic abnormalities in Dicer1-hypomorphic mice were detected after 4 weeks of age. This suggested that Dicer1 is important for maintaining the adult pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W2011647356,"Background Glaucoma is the world's second leading cause of bilateral blindness with progressive loss of vision due to retinal ganglion cell death. Myocilin has been associated with congenital glaucoma and 2–4% of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) cases, but the pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Among several hypotheses, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) has emerged as a possible disease mechanism. Methodology / Principal Findings We used a transgenic Drosophila model to analyze whole-genome transcriptional profiles in flies that express human wild-type or mutant MYOC in their eyes. The transgenic flies display ocular fluid discharge, reflecting ocular hypertension, and a progressive decline in their behavioral responses to light. Transcriptional analysis shows that genes associated with the UPR, ubiquitination, and proteolysis, as well as metabolism of reactive oxygen species and photoreceptor activity undergo altered transcriptional regulation. Following up on the results from these transcriptional analyses, we used immunoblots to demonstrate the formation of MYOC aggregates and showed that the formation of such aggregates leads to induction of the UPR, as evident from activation of the fluorescent UPR marker, xbp1-EGFP. Conclusions / Significance Our results show that aggregation of MYOC in the endoplasmic reticulum activates the UPR, an evolutionarily conserved stress pathway that culminates in apoptosis. We infer from the Drosophila model that MYOC-associated ocular hypertension in the human eye may result from aggregation of MYOC and induction of the UPR in trabecular meshwork cells. This process could occur at a late age with wild-type MYOC, but might be accelerated by MYOC mutants to account for juvenile onset glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2064576699,"Cyclin E/Cdk2 is a key regulator in G1-S transition. We have identified a novel cyclin E/Cdk2 substrate called Ankrd17 (ankyrin repeat protein 17) using the TAP tag purification technique. Ankrd17 protein contains two clusters of a total 25 ankyrin repeats at its N terminus, one NES (nuclear exporting signal) and one NLS (nuclear localization signal) in the middle, and one RXL motif at its C terminus. Ankrd17 is expressed in various tissues and associates with cyclin E/Cdk2 in an RXL-dependent manner. It can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 at 3 phosphorylation sites (Ser1791, Ser1794, and Ser2150). Overexpression of Ankrd17 promotes S phase entry, whereas depletion of Ankrd17 expression by small interfering RNA inhibits DNA replication and blocks cell cycle progression as well as up-regulates the expression of p53 and p21. Ankrd17 is localized to the nucleus and interacts with DNA replication factors including MCM family members, Cdc6 and PCNA. Depletion of Ankrd17 results in decreased loading of Cdc6 and PCNA onto DNA suggesting that Ankrd17 may be directly involved in the DNA replication process.

Cells without NPAT fail to enter S phase from quiescence (20Ye X. Wei Y. Nalepa G. Harper J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8586-8600Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 is another protein phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 at G1/S transition to activate its histone acetyltransferase activity (21Ait-Si-Ali S. Polesskaya A. Filleur S. Ferreira R. Duquet A. Robin P. Vervish A. Trouche D. Cabon F. Harel-Bellan A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2430-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and may function as a cofactor for many transcription factors including E2F (22Wang H. Larris B. Peiris T.H. Zhang L. Le Lay J. Gao Y. Greenbaum L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24679-24688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cyclin E/Cdk2 phosphorylates E2F-5 and increases its transcriptional activity through CBP/p300 recruitment (23Morris L. Allen K.E. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cyclin E/Cdk2 also phosphorylates centrosomal proteins that regulate centrosome duplication. Phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM) by cyclin E/Cdk2 promotes NPM release from the centrosome, thereby stimulating centrosomal duplication (24Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y.

Phosphorylation on Thr (199) by cyclin E (and A)/Cdk2 targets NPM to nuclear speckles, and enhances the RNA binding activity of NPM (26Tarapore P. Shinmura K. Suzuki H. Tokuyama Y. Kim S.H. Mayeda A. Fukasawa K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CP110 is another centrosomal cyclin E/Cdk2 substrate that plays an essential, but poorly understood role in the centrosome cycle (27Chen Z. Indjeian V.B. McManus M. Wang L. Dynlacht B.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cyclin E/Cdk2 cooperates with Cdc6 to allow the formation of prereplication complexes during the G1-S transition (28Coverley D. Laman H. Laskey R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, cyclin E/Cdk2 was found to be involved in the phosphorylation of MCM family members MCM2 and MCM3 that play essential roles in eukaryotic DNA replication (29Montagnoli A. Valsasina B.

Aggarwal P. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 8079-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The FOXM1 forkhead protein, originally identified as a proliferation-associated transcriptional regulator, was found as a novel cyclin E/Cdk2 substrate that functions in cell cycle progression, genetic stability, and tumorigenesis (31Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Lilischkis R. Luscher B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Although cyclin/Cdks are orderly activated during cell cycle progression, it is their phosphorylation substrates that carry out the ordered cellular changes that lead to cell division. However, many of these substrates remain unknown. To better understand the mechanism of cell cycle regulation, we took the approach of TAP tag purification to identify the new substrates of cyclin E/Cdk2. Here we report that human ankyrin repeat protein 17 (Ankrd17) is a novel substrate for cyclin E/Cdk2. Ankrd17 positively regulates cell cycle progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTAP Tag Purification of Cdk2-associated Proteins-pMSCV-c-FLAG-HA-Cdk2 retroviral vector was transfected into the virus packaging cell line phoenix, the viruses were harvested 48 h after transfection and subjected to infect 293T cells. The infected cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml). About 2 × 109 cells were lysed with cross-linking lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Roche), dithiobissulfosuccinimidyl propionate (DTSSP) (0.25 μg/ml) (Pierce)). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG beads (Sigma), washed with TAP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) (0.25 mg/ml). The elution was incubated with anti-HA beads (Sigma), washed with TAP buffer, and eluted with HA peptide (0.25 mg/ml). For the control purpose, we used cell lysates transfected with empty vector and similarly immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads followed by anti-HA beads (data not shown). The elution was run on a 4–12% Nupage BisTris gel (Invitrogen), stained with Sigma EZ blue staining solution, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis.Plasmids and Antibodies-The mammalian expression vectors for cyclin E and Cdk2 have been described previously (32Ye X. Nalepa G. Welcker M. Kessler B.M. Spooner E. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Clurman B.E. Harper J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50110-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Ankrd17 expression vectors (pCMV-FLAG-Ankrd17) were made by cloning the full-length cDNA into pCMV-FLAG vector at KpnI/NotI. The Ankrd17AQA mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis at the RQL (amino acids 1745–1747) site. The pET41b-Ankrd17RQL was made by cloning the Ankrd17 cDNA (nucleotides 5041–5463) into pET41b (Novagen) at the BamHI/XhoI site. The pET41b-Ankrd17AQA was made from pET41b-Ankrd17RQL by site-directed mutagenesis (R → A, L → A). Rabbit anti-Ankrd17 polyclonal antibody was prepared using GST fusion protein containing amino acids 2074–2352 of Ankrd17 as the immunogen. Rabbit anti-Ankrd17 polyclonal antibody was generated against GST-Ankrd17 (amino acids 1681–1821). Rabbit anti-MCM3 and MCM5 polyclonal antibodies were generated against GST-MCM3 (amino acids 490–807) and GST-MCM5 (amino acids 644–734), respectively.The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal rabbit antibody to cyclin E, cyclin D, cyclin A, p53, Cdc45, and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); monoclonal antibodies to cyclin E, p21, p27, Cdc6, PCNA, MCM7, and Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and FLAG (Sigma).RNA Analyses-Total RNAs were prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses were done by following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Primers for Ankrd17 were: upstream, 5′-TCA TCA TCA CCA GTG GTT TC TTC-3′; downstream, 5′-GGT AGG ACA CAT AAT CTT CT TG-3′. Primers for hGAPDH as internal control were: upstream, 5′-GGT CAT CCC TGA GCT GAA CG-3′, downstream, 5′-TCC GTT GTC ATA CCA GGA AAT-3′.GST Pull-down Assays and Co-immunoprecipitation-GST fusion proteins were purified from bacteria with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads were incubated with the lysates from 293T cells transfected with Myc-cyclin E and Myc-Cdk2 in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor) (Roche Applied Science). The beads then washed with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and the proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with Myc (9E10) antibody. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, total cell lysates were incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads. After another 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses with chemiluminescence (Pierce).Cell Synchronization-U2OS cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by a double thymidine/mimosine block as previously described (33Braden W.A. Lenihan J.M. Lan Z. Luce K.S. Zagorski W. Bosco E. Reed M.F. Cook J.G. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7667-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, U2OS cells were incubated for 16 h in Complete medium with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) released in fresh medium for 9 h and incubated a second time with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 16 h. At this point, >90% of cells were in G1/S as assessed by flow cytometry. For S phase synchronization, cells were released from this second block for 4 h. After 8 h, most of the cells were in G2 phase. To obtain cells synchronized in mitosis, cells were incubated for 18 h in the presence of 2 mm thymidine, and then released for 6 h in fresh medium; then 40 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) was added for 6 h. Mitotic cells were collected from this population by the shake-off procedure, to avoid contamination with G2 cells. Cells in G1 phase were obtained from this pool of cells by reseeding them in fresh medium and allowing them to end mitosis for 3–5 h, and discarding the non-attached cells by shake-off.To synchronize HeLa cell in prometaphase, 50 ng/ml nocodazole was added in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). After 24 h, mitotic cells were shaken off, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in prewarmed fresh medium without nocodazole. Cells were collected at the indicated time to prepare total cell extracts and chromatin-bound protein. A total of 106 cells from each fraction were used for cytofluorometric analysis of DNA content.Cell Fractionation-Cells were incubated in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA with protease inhibitors) for 10 min, followed by 20 strokes of a Dounce B homogenizer. The lysates were spun down for 5 min at 500 × g, and the supernatant was designated the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed three times in wash buffer (hypotonic lysis buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and then treated with nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 30 min. The sample was spun at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant designated the nuclear fraction. Western blots were probed with nuclear (MCM3), cytosolic (β-tubulin) markers. To obtain chromatin-enriched fractions, cells were separated into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. Briefly, cells were lysed in cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose), containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors for 20 min on ice. Protein extracts were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant was collected and labeled as the soluble fraction. The pellet was washed once with CSK buffer for 5 min on ice, centrifuged for 4 min at 1000 × g, and resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. For MNase or NaCl extraction, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of CSK buffer supplemented with the indicated amounts of NaCl or MNase (Fermentas) with 1 mm CaCl2 and incubated at the indicated temperature. After incubation, insoluble and soluble materials were separated by centrifugation. Insoluble fraction was resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer.Immunofluorescence Assays-For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd for 10 min, fixed, and incubated in 3 n HCl for 10 min, and stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (Molecular Probes). Nuclear DNA was revealed with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. The cells were observed under a Leica confocal microscope.In Vitro Kinase Assay-1 μg of GST-Ankrd17 protein was incubated with or without GST-cyclin E or GST-cyclin A and GST-Cdk2 in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 mm cold ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by autoradiography.Mass Spectrometry-pCMV-FLAG-Ankrd17 was transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Subsequently, FLAG-Ankrd17 was enriched using immobilized FLAG antibodies and further isolated using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions by 8% (w/v) gels. Protein bands were stained by Colloidal Blue (Invitrogen). Gel bands correlated to Ankrd17 protein were excised, and proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Ankrd17 phosphopeptides were further enriched using a commercial immobilized metal affinity chromatography disc (Pierce). After immobilized metal affinity chromatography, the peptides were desalted with ZiptipC18 (Millipore), and eluted by 7 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and loaded into a PicoTip EMITTER (tip: 1 μm) (new objective). The mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a QTRAP3200 instrument equipped with a nano-ESI source (Applied Biosystems). Peptides were sequenced in an off-line tuning mode. In short, potential phosphopeptides were detected by precursor ion scan (for m/z 79 in negative mode), then the enhanced resolution scan was performed to determine the charge state of the peptide ion, and enhanced product ion scan was performed to obtain collision-induced dissociation MS/MS spectrum of the peptide. The mass spectral data were searched against a data base (SwissProt) using the Mascot searching algorithm (Matrix Science). Phosphopeptides of Ankrd17 were identified based on the following search criteria: trypsin used with up to two missed cleavages, phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, or Tyr, carbamidomethylation of cysteine, oxidized methionine. All amino acid modifications were set as variable modifications.Transient Transfection and Flow Cytometry Analysis-Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were done on 60-mm dishes using the indicated plasmid DNA, together with pCMV-CD20 plasmid for the selection of transfected cells. Cells were harvested at the indicated time after transfection, fixed in ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a FACScan instrument.RNA Interference-RNA interference was carried out using double strand RNA purchased from Invitrogen. The synthetic siRNA duplexes corresponding to the Ankrd17 mRNA sequences 5′-UUA GAA UGC GUA UUA AUG CCA GCC C-3′ (Ankrd17 siRNA1), 5′-UUA ACU GAG UGA CAU CUG GUG GAG G-3′ (Ankrd17 siRNA2) and 5′-UGU ACA AGU AGA UAG AGA AUU ACU G-3′ (Ankrd17 siRNA3) were used to inhibit Ankrd17 protein expression. A synthetic siRNA duplex (Cat#12935-300, Invitrogen) was used as a negative control. Transfection of siRNA into cells was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. U2OS cells were plated in a six-well plate and transfected with 40 nm siRNA using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen).RESULTSAssociation of Ankrd17 with Cdk2 in Vitro and in Vivo-To identify potential Cdk2-associated proteins, a TAP tag purification procedure was performed. 293T cells were transduced with Cdk2 expression retrovirus pMSCV-c-FLAG-HA-Cdk2. Empty retrovirus pMSCV-c-FLAG-HA, which does not express Cdk2, was also included in the experiment as a control. The transduced cells were lysed and subjected to double immunoprecipitation, first with anti-FLAG beads and then with anti-HA beads. The elution was separated on a 4–12% Nupage SDS-PAGE and resolved proteins were visualized by staining with Sigma EZ blue (Fig. 1A). The proteins were excised from the gel and subjected to trypsin digestion followed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry analysis. The mass spectrum results showed that some proteins were known Cdk2 interacting proteins such as cyclin E, cyclin A, p21, and pRb, but also some new proteins were identified as potential Cdk2-associated partners (Fig. 1B). One of them is a novel ankyrin repeat protein 17 (Ankrd17), which was also identified as a relevant cyclin E/Cdk2 substrate with the use of expression cloning (data not shown).To confirm the direct interaction of Ankrd17 with Cdk2, GST-Ankrd17 (amino acids 1681–1819) was used for the GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 1C). In addition, because cyclin E was known to complex with Cdk2, we also examined the interaction of Ankrd17 with cyclin E. The result showed that Ankrd17 interacts with cyclin E/Cdk2 (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The presence of RXL motifs in Ankrd17, together with interaction with cyclin E/Cdk2, suggested that Ankrd17 is a substrate for cyclin E/Cdk2, as RXL motifs are often found in substrates of cyclin kinase and are involved in the interaction between cyclins and their substrates (5Brown N.R.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To see if the RXL motif in Ankrd17 was responsible for the interaction with cyclin E/Cdk2, RXL mutants were generated, such as GST-Ankrd17AQA and pCMV-FLAG-Ankrd17AQA and tested in GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, respectively. Results showed that in both assays, whereas wild type Ankrd17 was found to be associated with cyclin E/Cdk2, the Ankrd17AQA mutants failed to interact with the kinase complex (Fig. 1, lane 4 of panel C; lane 6 of panel D). These data suggested that the RXL motif of Ankrd17 is critical for cyclin E/Cdk2 binding. To further demonstrate the interaction between Ankrd17 and Cdk2 as well as cyclin E in vivo, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged Ankrd17 (pCMV-FLAG-Ankrd17) were introduced into 293T cells by transfection. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with cyclin E and Cdk2 antibodies. The tagged Ankrd17 protein was found to be associated with cyclin E/Cdk2 (Fig. 1D, lane 5), indicating that Ankrd17 interacts with the cyclin E/Cdk2 complex in cells. To further confirm the interaction between endogenous Ankrd17 and cyclin E/Cdk2 in vivo, the cell lysates from 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with Ankrd17 antibody and immunoblotted with Cdk2 antibody. The result showed that endogenous Ankrd17 binds to Cdk2 (Fig. 1E). The cell lysates were also immunoprecipitated with cyclin E antibody and immunoblotted with Ankrd17 antibody. The data showed that endogenous Ankrd17 was associated with cyclin E (Fig. 1F).Characterization of Ankrd17-Ankrd17 is encoded by a non-annotated gene located at human chromosome 4q13.3. Ankrd17 has two isoforms (a and b). Full-length cDNA of Ankrd17 of isoform b has an open reading frame of 7059 bp with a calculated molecular mass of 260 kDa (2352 amino acids) (Fig. 2A). It was ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 2B). Predicted Ankrd17 protein consists of 2 clusters with a total of 25 ankyrin repeats at its N-terminal, one NES site, one NLS site, one KH domain, and one RXL motif at its C-terminal.FIGURE 2Characteristics of Ankrd17 protein. A, structure of ankyrin repeat protein Ankrd17. B, Ankrd17 expressed in different tissues. RNA from different human tissues were isolated and 1 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcriptase-PCR with Ankrd17 primers and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers as internal control. C, Ankrd17 was localized in the nucleus in U2OS and HeLa cells. U2OS and HeLa cells were fractionated as cytosolic supernatant (C) and nuclear fraction (N). The lysates were subjected to immunoblot with Ankrd17, β-tubulin, and MCM antibodies. TCE refers to total cell lysate. D, the phosphorylation sites of Ankrd17 identified by mass spectral analysis. 293T cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-Ankrd17, pCS2mt-cyclin E, and pCMV-Myc-Cdk2. Cell lysates were harvested and Ankrd17 protein was immunoprecipitated with FLAG beads and subjected for mass spectrometry analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the localization of Ankrd17, the U2OS and HeLa cell lysates were fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions and immunoblotted with Ankrd17, β-tubulin, and MCM3 antibodies. The result indicated that Ankrd17 was localized in the nucleus in both cell lines (Fig. 2C).To examine the phosphorylation sites of Ankrd17, Ankrd17 purified from 293T cells after transfection with a pCMV-FLAG-Ankrd17 expression plasmid was subjected to a mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 2D). Three phosphorylation sites in Ankrd17 at Ser1791, Ser1794, and Ser2150 were identified in this assay.Phosphorylation of Ankrd17 by Cyclin E/Cdk2 in Vitro-The interaction of Ankrd17 with the cyclin E/Cdk2 complex and involvement of the RXL motif in the interaction suggested that Ankrd17 is a substrate of cyclin E/Cdk2. To examine whether Ankrd17 can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2, GST-Ankrd17 (amino acids 1681–1819) and GST-Ankrd17AQA protein were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of purified GST-cyclin E and Cdk2. As shown in the Fig. 3A, GST-Ankrd17 can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2, indicating that the Ankrd17 is a substrate for cyclin E/Cdk2. In contrast, GST-Ankrd17AQA was not efficiently phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2. The GST-cyclin A/Cdk2 was also included in the kinase assay, the result showed that Ankrd17 was phosphorylated more specifically by cyclin E/Cdk2 than cyclin A/Cdk2 (Fig. 3B). According to the mass spectrometry data as shown in Fig. 2D, Ser1791 and Ser1794 in Ankrd17 were phosphorylated in vivo. To test whether Ankrd17 Ser1791 and Ser1794 were phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2, GST Ankrd17 S1737A/S1740A/S1791A/S1794A and triple mutants were generated and subjected to in vitro kinase assay, the result showed that the phosphorylation of Ankrd17 were decreased when Ser1791 and Ser1794 were mutated to Ala, whereas its phosphorylation was recovered to 86 and 93% when they were changed back to Ser, respectively (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, Ser1740 in Ankrd17 was also important for its phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lane 4). Because GST-Ankrd17 S1737A/S1740A/S1791A/S1794A still could be phosphorylated, it implied that there were othe"

https://openalex.org/W1973705361,"The β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 and potassium channel Kir6.2 serves a key role in insulin secretion regulation by linking glucose metabolism to cell excitability. Mutations in SUR1 or Kir6.2 that decrease channel function are typically associated with congenital hyperinsulinism, whereas those that increase channel function are associated with neonatal diabetes. Here we report that two hyperinsulinism-associated SUR1 missense mutations, R74W and E128K, surprisingly reduce channel inhibition by intracellular ATP, a gating defect expected to yield the opposite disease phenotype neonatal diabetes. Under normal conditions, both mutant channels showed poor surface expression due to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, accounting for the loss of channel function phenotype in the congenital hyperinsulinism patients. This trafficking defect, however, could be corrected by treating cells with the oral hypoglycemic drugs sulfonylureas, which we have shown previously to act as small molecule chemical chaperones for KATP channels. The R74W and E128K mutants thus rescued to the cell surface paradoxically exhibited ATP sensitivity 6- and 12-fold lower than wild-type channels, respectively. Further analyses revealed a nucleotide-independent decrease in mutant channel intrinsic open probability, suggesting the mutations may reduce ATP sensitivity by causing functional uncoupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2. In insulin-secreting cells, rescue of both mutant channels to the cell surface led to hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reduced insulin secretion upon glucose stimulation. Our results show that sulfonylureas, as chemical chaperones, can dictate manifestation of the two opposite insulin secretion defects by altering the expression levels of the disease mutants.

The β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) 3The abbreviations used are: KATP, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; CHI, congenital hyperinsulinism; PNDM, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Po, open probability; TMD, transmembrane domain; WT, wild type; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RMP, resting membrane potential. 3The abbreviations used are: KATP, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; CHI, congenital hyperinsulinism; PNDM, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Po, open probability; TMD, transmembrane domain; WT, wild type; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RMP, resting membrane potential. channels are essential for triggering glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as they couple metabolic signals to electrical signals (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Each channel is a complex of four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits, encoded by ABCC8, and four pore-forming Kir6.2 inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits, encoded by KCNJ11 (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 that perturb the expression and/or gating of the channel lead to channel dysfunction and insulin secretion disorders. Whereas a net loss in channel activity results in congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), a net gain of channel function causes permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) (2Ashcroft F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). SUR1 and Kir6.2 co-assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form channel complexes; successful assembly overcomes the arginine-lysine-arginine (RKR) ER retention motif in SUR1 and Kir6.2 to permit channel trafficking to the plasma membrane (3Neagoe I. Schwappach B. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 887-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Heusser K. Yuan H. Neagoe I. Tarasov A.I. Ashcroft F.M. Schwappach B. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Quality surveillance mechanisms are in place to prevent misfolded or unassembled channel subunits from exiting the ER where the retained proteins are eventually degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (5Yan F.F. Lin C.W. Cartier E.A. Shyng S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1351-C1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane, channel activities are regulated by intracellular ATP and MgADP (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). ATP inhibits channel activity by binding to Kir6.2, whereas MgADP stimulates channel activity by interacting with the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of SUR1 (6Nichols C.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). A Kir6.2 C-terminal truncation mutant lacking the last 36 amino acids and the -RKR- ER retention signal (Kir6.2ΔC) can form channels that are still sensitive to ATP inhibition even in the absence of SUR1 (7Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2ΔC channels is substantially lower than wild-type (WT) channels, indicating SUR1 hypersensitizes Kir6.2 to ATP inhibition (7Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 8Enkvetchakul D. Loussouarn G. Makhina E. Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2334-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SUR1 markedly increases the intrinsic open probability (Po) of Kir6.2 channels in the absence of intracellular nucleotides (6Nichols C.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the first transmembrane domain of SUR1, known as TMD0, is sufficient to increase the Po of Kir6.2ΔC channels (9Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TMD0 further reduces the ATP sensitivity of the Kir6.2ΔC channel, suggesting other SUR1 domains are necessary to hypersensitize Kir6.2 channels to ATP inhibition (9Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Proks P. Arnold A.L. Bruining J. Girard C. Flanagan S.E. Larkin B. Colclough K. Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Ellard S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Precisely how TMD0 couples to Kir6.2 to modulate channel gating remains to be elucidated. Characterized by persistent insulin secretion despite severe hypoglycemia in neonates and infants, CHI frequently results from loss of function KATP channel mutations (12Dunne M.J. Cosgrove K.E. Shepherd R.M. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 239-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These mutations typically reduce channel activity by preventing channel expression at the cell surface, diminishing channel response to MgADP stimulation and/or reducing channel Po (2Ashcroft F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). By contrast, mutations from the opposite disease phenotype, PNDM, increase channel activity via reduced channel sensitivity to ATP inhibition or enhanced channel response to MgADP stimulation (2Ashcroft F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that channel trafficking defects caused by CHI mutations in the TMD0 of SUR1 can be overcome by the oral hypoglycemic drugs sulfonylureas, which act as chemical chaperones to increase the biogenesis efficiency of these mutant channels (13Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Yan F.F. Casey J. Shyng S.L.

Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we report two mutants, R74W and E128K, which, upon rescue to the cell surface, surprisingly revealed reduced ATP sensitivity-gating defects. Such defects are typically associated with PNDM mutations. Indeed, sulfonylurea-rescued surface expression of these two channels in insulin-secreting cells caused hyperpolarized membrane potentials and blunted insulin secretion in high glucose. Interestingly, unlike previously reported ATP-insensitive mutants, which tend to have increased intrinsic Po, the R74W and E128K mutants showed reduced intrinsic Po. The finding suggests R74W and E128K diminish channel ATP sensitivity by a distinct mechanism that likely involves functional uncoupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2. Molecular Biology-Rat Kir6.2 cDNA is in pCDNAI/Amp vector and SUR1 or N terminus FLAG-epitope (DYKDDDDK)-tagged SUR1 (fSUR1) in pECE (16Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. SUR1 and Kir6.2 recombinant adenoviruses were constructed using the AdEasy kit (Stratagene) as described previously (15Yan F.F. Lin Y.W. MacMullen C. Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Lin C.W. Lin Y.W. Yan F.F. Casey J. Kochhar M. Pratt E.B. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Virus Infection and Insulin Secretion Assay-INS-1 cells (clone 832/13) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 11.1 mm d-glucose plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (18Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). For fSUR1 and Kir6.2 expression, recombinant viruses containing WT or mutant fSUR1 and WT Kir6.2 with desired titers were used to infect cells as described previously (19Lin C.W. Yan F. Shimamura S. Barg S. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2852-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells at ∼50% confluency were washed with PBS and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing a mixture of viruses each with a multiplicity of infection that yielded desired protein expression levels. At the end of the incubation, 2× growth medium was added, and the cells were cultured at 37 °C until experiments. Insulin secretion assays were performed as described previously (17Lin C.W. Lin Y.W. Yan F.F. Casey J. Kochhar M. Pratt E.B. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at ∼5 × 105/well were infected with viruses as described above. Twenty-four hours post-infection, the culture medium was replaced by RPMI 1640 with 5 mm glucose, and cells were incubated for at least 18 h. Cells were treated with 300 μm tolbutamide during the last 4 h of incubation to rescue mutant channel surface expression. Insulin secretion was assayed in HEPES balanced salt solution buffer consisting of (in mm) 114 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.16 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, 2.5 CaCl2, 25.5 NaHCO3, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (pH ∼ 7.2). Cells were washed twice with pre-warmed (37 °C) HEPES buffer with 3 mm glucose followed by 2-h incubation in the same buffer prior to stimulation with 0.8 ml/well pre-warmed HEPES buffer containing 3 or 12 mm glucose for 2 h. The medium was harvested, and the amount of insulin was determined using Immunochem-coated tube insulin radioimmuno-assay from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Insulin content in the medium was divided by the total cellular insulin content to correct for the number of cells. The resulting value was then normalized to that observed in uninfected cells at 3 mm glucose and expressed as -fold increase in insulin secretion. Rat Pancreatic Islet Preparation-Animals were treated in accordance with institutional regulations. Rats aged 6-8 weeks were injected with 5 ml of cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen) containing 0.3 mg/ml Liberase R1 (Roche Applied Science) from the common bile duct, the distant conjunction to intestine was completely blocked by clamping. Pancreas were then dissected and minced before incubating in a total volume of 10 ml of HBSS at 37 °C for 30 min to allow digestion to occur. Digestions were stopped with the addition of 45 ml of HBSS containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min, supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of HBSS plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Pancreatic islets were visualized by adding 0.5 mg/ml diphenylthiocarbazone (Sigma) and were placed individually into fresh HBSS and then into RPMI media containing 5 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin supplements. Approximately 400 islets were maintained for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 before infection with viruses. Virus infection was carried out as in INS-1 cells described above. About 100 islets matched in size were used for each infection. The multiplicity of infection of each adenovirus was 10-fold higher than that used for INS-1 cells to achieve the desired protein expression level. Infected islets were treated with sulfonylureas the following day for 12 h and then harvested with lysis buffer for Western blot as described below. Immunoblotting, Immunostaining, and Chemiluminescence Assays-INS-1 cells or rat islets infected with fSUR1 and Kir6.2 viruses were treated with or without glibenclamide (5 μm) or tolbutamide (300 μm) for 12-24 h before being processed for immunoblotting or immunofluorescent staining as described previously (13Yan F.

Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0/5 mm EDTA/150 mm NaCl/1% Nonidet P-40 with Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) 48-72 h post-transfection or infection. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred to nitrocellulose, analyzed by M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto, Pierce). For surface staining, living cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml in Opti-MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS, then fixed with cold (-20 °C) methanol for 10 min and incubated with Cy-3 conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson) for 30 min at room temperature. After 3 × 10 min washes in PBS/0.1% BSA and 1 × 10 min wash in PBS, cells were viewed with an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. For chemiluminescence assays, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, preblocked in PBS/0.5% BSA for 30 min, incubated in M2 anti-FLAG antibody (10 μg/ml) for an hour, washed 4 × 30 min in PBS/0.5% BSA, incubated in HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for 20 min, and washed again 4 × 30 min in PBS/0.5% BSA. Chemiluminescence was quantified using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) following 5-s incubation in Power Signal ELISA Femto luminol solution (Pierce). All steps after fixation were performed at room temperature. Results of each experiment are the average of two dishes, and each data point shown in the figure is the average of three experiments. Patch Clamp Recordings-Inside-out patch clamp recordings in COSm6 and INS-1 cells were performed using an Axopatch 1D amplifier and pClamp9 acquisition software (Axon Inc.) (13Yan F. Lin C.W.

Micropipettes were pulled from non-heparinized Kimble glass on a horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument). The bath and pipette solution (K-INT) was: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm K-HEPES, 1 mm K-EGTA, pH 7.4, and pipette resistance was ∼1.5 MΩ. For ATP dose-response experiments, 1 mm EDTA was added to K-INT to prevent channel rundown (20Lin Y.W. Jia T. Weinsoft A.M. Shyng S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For MgADP stimulation, free Mg2+ concentration was 1 mm. All currents were measured at -50 mV membrane potential at room temperature. Whole cell patch clamp recording was used to measure INS-1 cell membrane potential (19Lin C.W. Yan F. Shimamura S. Barg S. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2852-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One day after virus infection, INS-1 cells were preincubated in 5 mm glucose RPMI medium for 18 h followed by incubation in 12 mm glucose for 3 h before recording (17Lin C.W. Lin Y.W. Yan F.F. Casey J. Kochhar M. Pratt E.B. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Lin C.W. Yan F. Shimamura S. Barg S. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2852-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). During recording, cells were bathed in Tyrode's solution consisting of (in mm): 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 3 NaHCO3, 0.16 NaH2PO4, with 12 mm glucose. Pipette solution contained (in mm): 10 KCl, 130 K+-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 3 MgCl2, and 5 ATP. Data Analysis-ATP dose-response curve fitting was performed with Origin6.1. Single channel open probability (Po) analysis was carried out using the pCLAMP9 automated channel-event detector and via amplitude histogram examination. Briefly, data collected within the first 90 s of inside-out patch excision were binned by amplitude using 0.05-pA increments. Histograms were fit with Gaussian distributions and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for each was determined. Po was calculated as AUCchannel-open/(AUCchannel-open + AUCchannel-closed). For estimation of channel open probability by stationary noise analysis, short recordings (∼1 s) of macroscopic currents in K-INT/EDTA or K-INT/EDTA plus 5 mm ATP at -50mV were used. For the mutants that are relatively insensitive to ATP inhibition, we reversed the polarity of currents observed in K-INT plus 10 mm BaCl2 at +50 mV and used that as the baseline. Currents were sampled at 50 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Mean current (I) and variance (σ2) in the absence of ATP were obtained by subtraction of the mean current and variance of the baseline. Single channel current (i) was assumed to be -3.6 pA at -50mV in symmetrical K-INT solution (corresponding to single channel conductance of 72 picosiemens). Po was then calculated using the equation: Po = 1 - (σ2/(i × I)) (21Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Dempster J. The Laboratory Computer: A Practical Guide for Physiologists and Neuroscientists. Academic Press, New York2001Google Scholar). All data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using an independent two-population two-tailed Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The R74W and E128K Mutations Reduce Channel Sensitivity to ATP-Previously, we reported several CHI-associated SUR1 mutations that reduce surface expression of KATP channels could be rescued to the cell surface efficiently by sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide and tolbutamide (13Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Yan F.F. Lin Y.W. MacMullen C. Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These mutations are all in the TMD0 of SUR1 (amino acids 1-196) and include G7R, N24K, F27S, R74W, A116P, E128K, and V187D. The functional properties of rescued A116P and V187D mutant channels had been characterized in detail and shown to be normal (13Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test if the other five rescued TMD0-SUR1 mutant channels also have normal nucleotide sensitivities, we performed inside-out patch clamp recordings from COSm6 cells co-transfected with Kir6.2 and WT-SUR1 or mutant-SUR1. Cells were treated with 300 μm tolbutamide overnight followed by 2-h washout to increase mutant channel expression at the cell surface before recording. Note tolbutamide was used in this and subsequent functional experiments because of its low affinity and reversible binding to KATP channels to allow rapid washout. Of the five mutants, G7R, N24K, and F27S had WT-like or slightly increased ATP sensitivity, and either normal or reduced MgADP response that is commonly associated with CHI mutations (Fig. 1) (23Shyng S.L. Ferrigni T. Shepard J.B. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Permutt M.A. Nichols C.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To our surprise, however, two of the mutants, R74W and E128K, exhibited significantly reduced ATP sensitivities (Fig. 2, A and B). The R74W mutation has been reported in two focal cases (disease causing a paternally derived mutation that was expressed due to loss of heterozygosity for the maternal allele) (24Suchi M. MacMullen C.M. Thornton P.S. Adzick N.S. Ganguly A. Ruchelli E.D. Stanley C.A. Mod. Pathol. 2006; 19: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The disease in both cases was similar to other focal cases: severe neonatal onset hypoglycemia, failed medical therapy with diazoxide, required surgery, and cured by local resection of the lesion (24Suchi M. MacMullen C.M. Thornton P.S. Adzick N.S. Ganguly A. Ruchelli E.D. Stanley C.A. Mod. Pathol. 2006; 19: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). R74W was also reported as a compound heterozygous mutation with another mutation, R1215Q, in a patient with diffuse HI who failed medical therapy with diazoxide and required a near-total pancreatectomy (15Yan F.F.

The E128K mutation occurred in homozygous form in a child with diffuse hyperinsulinism, severe neonatal onset hypoglycemia, failed diazoxide therapy, and required near-total pancreatectomy for control of hypoglycemia (15Yan F.F.

ATP sensitivity was measured by inside-out patch clamp recording in COSm6 cells transfected with Kir6.2 and WT or mutant SUR1. A, representative traces of WT and mutant channels from cells treated with 300 μm tolbutamide overnight followed by 2-h washout prior to the recording. Scale bars: WT: 500 pA, 5 s; R74W and E128K: 50 pA, 5 s. B, ATP dose-response relationships. Parameters describing best-fit curves to the Hill equation (Irel = 1/(1 + ([ATP]/IC50)H)), including the [ATP] necessary for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) and Hill coefficient (H), are shown. Error bars represent ± S.E. of 3-7 patches. Note the IC50 values obtained using the K-INT/EDTA solution are higher than those reported by others as inclusion of EDTA significantly reduces rundown by minimizing Mg2+-dependent breakdown of membrane phosphoinositides (20Lin Y.W. Jia T. Weinsoft A.M. Shyng S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). C, representative traces of WT and mutant channels from cells that have not been pretreated with tolbutamide, indicating the decrease in ATP sensitivity observed in A and B is not due to the chemical chaperone rescue procedure. Scale bars: WT: 500 pA, 10 s; R74W and E128K: 20 pA, 10 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reduced ATP sensitivity-gating defect is typically linked to PNDM and has never been reported in CHI mutations. To ensure the altered ATP sensitivities were not due to the rescue procedure, we examined ATP inhibition in cells not pretreated with tolbutamide. Although expression levels of R74W and E128K mutants were very low, sufficient currents in a small fraction of transfected cells (identified by co-transfected GFP) were detected. ATP inhibition was as ineffective as in the tolbutamide-rescued channels (Fig. 2C), indicating the defect is intrinsic to the mutant channels. Mechanisms of Reduced ATP Inhibition in R74W and E128K Channels-Several studies have shown that PNDM-causing SUR1 or Kir6.2 mutations can reduce channel ATP sensitivity by enhancing channel response to Mg-nucleotide stimulation (26de Wet H. Rees M.G. Shimomura K. Aittoniemi J. Patch A.M. Flanagan S.E. Ellard S. Hattersley A.T. Sansom M.S. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18988-18992Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Proks P. Girard C. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In inside-out patches, MgADP stimulated channel activity in both R74W and E128K mutants (Fig. 3A); however, because the mutants were much less sensitive to nucleotide inhibition, it is difficult to directly compare their MgADP sensitivities to WT channels. We therefore tested the effect of R74W or E128K on channel ATP sensitivity in the background of SUR1-NBD mutations such as G1479D and G1479R in NBD2 and K719M in NBD1, which are known to abolish channel response to MgADP stimulation (28Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In the E128K/G1479R double mutants, ATP sensitivity was as reduced as the E128K mutant; the R74W/G1479D double mutant also showed significantly reduced ATP sensitivity, although to a lesser degree than the R74W single mutant (Fig. 3, B and C). We also combined E128K with NBD1 mutation K719M (E128K/K719M), and the resulting channels were as insensitive to ATP as E128K (not shown). These results indicate that, even if the mutations increased Mg-nucleotide stimulation, this effect alone could not explain the reduced ATP sensitivity in R74W and E128K.

https://openalex.org/W2050581390,"Computational models of motor control have often explained the straightness of horizontal planar reaching movements as a consequence of optimal control. Departure from rectilinearity is thus regarded as sub-optimal. Here we examine if subjects may instead select to make curved trajectories following adaptation to force fields and visuomotor rotations. Separate subjects adapted to force fields with or without visual feedback of their hand trajectory and were retested after 24 hours. Following adaptation, comparable accuracies were achieved in two ways: with visual feedback, adapted trajectories in force fields were straight whereas without it, they remained curved. The results suggest that trajectory shape is not always straight, but is also influenced by the calibration of available feedback signals for the state estimation required by the task. In a follow-up experiment, where additional subjects learned a visuomotor rotation immediately after force field, the trajectories learned in force fields (straight or curved) were transferred when directions of the perturbations were similar but not when directions were opposing. This demonstrates a strong bias by prior experience to keep using a recently acquired control policy that continues to produce successful performance inspite of differences in tasks and feedback conditions. On relearning of force fields on the second day, facilitation by intervening visuomotor rotations occurred only when required motor adjustments and calibration of feedback signals were similar in both tasks. These results suggest that both the available feedback signals and prior history of learning influence the choice and maintenance of control policy during adaptations."

Although it is well defined that PML NB is a site recruiting sumoylated proteins, the mechanism by which PML protein regulates the process remains unclear. Here we show that PML3, a specific PML isoform, interacts with and recruits TIP60 to PML NBs. Our biochemical characterization demonstrates that PML3 physically interacts with TIP60 via its N-terminal 364 amino acids. Importantly, this portion of TIP60 is sufficient to target to the PML NBs, suggesting that PML3-TIP60 interaction is sufficient for targeting TIP60 to the NBs. The PML3-TIP60 interaction is specific, since the region of TIP60 binding is not conserved in other PML isoforms. The physical interaction between PML3 and TIP60 protects TIP60 from Mdm2-mediated degradation, suggesting that PML3 competes with MDM2 for binding to TIP60. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis indicates that the PML3-TIP60 interaction modulates the nuclear body distribution and mobility of TIP60. Conversely, the distribution and mobility of TIP60 are perturbed in PML3-deficient cells, accompanied by aberrations in DNA damage-repairing response. Thus, PML3 orchestrates the distribution, dynamics, and function of TIP60.

Besides histone acetylase activity on chromatin remodeling, recent data indicate that TIP60 has more divergent functions in many processes. In transcriptional regulation, TIP60 can acetylate various transcriptional factors besides histones.

Interaction of TIP60 with BLC-3 regulates the transcriptional activity of NFκB (8Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); The ability of c-MYC to activate transcription relies in part on the recruitment of cofactor complexes containing TIP60, which directly acetylates c-MYC (9Patel J.H.

Moreover, the kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) activation is dependent on its acetylation by TIP60 in response to DNA double break repair (10Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), indicating that TIP60 plays crucial roles in DNA damage response. Indeed, mounting evidence implies that TIP60 functions at multiple levels in DNA damage repair, and its histone acetyltransferase activity acts as an upstream component in DNA damage checkpoint activation (11Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). So far, regulation of TIP60 by post-translational modification has been documented. Similar to p53, TIP60 is subjected to proteasome-dependent proteolysis by interacting physically with Mdm2, a specific E3 ligase in ubiquitination cascade and accumulates following UV irradiation, indicating that ubiquitination of TIP60 could be part of the mechanism in tumorigenesis induced by Mdm2 and p53 following cellular stress (12Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Combining biochemical assay with mass spectrometric analysis, Lemercier et al. (13Lemercier C. Legube G. Caron C. Louwagie M. Garin J. Trouche D. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4713-4718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) revealed that TIP60 can be phosphorylated at Ser86 and Ser90, whereas TIP60 histone acetyltransferase activity is controlled by its phosphorylation. Specifically, the phosphorylation of Ser90 is modulated by cyclin B/Cdc2; accordingly, phosphorylated TIP60 is accumulated after drug-induced arrest of cells in G2/M or at the G2/M transition, which strongly suggests a cell cycle-dependent control of TIP60 activity. As a histone acetyltransferase, TIP60 can also be acetylated by p300/CREB-binding protein in the zinc finger domain at Lys268 and Lys282, although the impact of acetylation on TIP60 function has yet to be elucidated (14Col E. Caron C. Chable-Bessia C. Legube G. Gazzeri S. Komatsu Y. et al.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified that TIP60 is a novel substrate of sumoylation, and SUMO attachment remarkably translocates TIP60 to PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs), which is a well defined pool of sumoylatable substrates. Significantly, p53 is recruited by sumoylated TIP60 to PML NBs in response to UV irradiation (15Cheng Z. Ke Y. Ding X. Wang F. Wang H. Wang W. Ahmed K. Liu Z. Xu Y. Aikhionbare F. Yan H. Liu J.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that PML NBs are an essential location to monitor TIP60 function. PML NBs are subnuclear protein structures from 0.3 to 1.0 μm in diameter and were first identified as nuclear domain 10 (ND10) by human autoantibodies recognizing Sp100 protein (16Ascoli C.A. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 17Maul G.G. Negorev D. Bell P. Ishov A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Numerous dynamic components of PML NBs, including ATM, Chk2, p53, TIP60, Mdm2, Daxx, SUMO-1, and Ubc9, prominently implicate a role for PML NBs in DNA repair, apoptosis, gene regulation, and post-translational modification (18Hofmann T.G. Will H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Dellaire G. Bazett-Jones D.P. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the PML NB is a highly dynamic molecular machine that undergoes dramatic structural and numerical changes during cell cycle and in response to various cellular conditions, the plasticity of PML NB is essential to sustain normal cell growth and development, since perturbation of PML NB plasticity and structure has been observed in human diseases such as in acute promyelocytic leukemia (20Hodges M. Tissot C. Howe K. Grimwade D. Freemont P.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 64: 297-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, during treatment with therapeutic agents, such as As2O3, the disrupted PML NBs reorganize to a normal NB pattern (21Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. Blood. 1998; 92: 4308-4316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PML NBs are potential targets for acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy. Among the factors essential for the integrity of PML NBs, sumoylation plays a key role in the formation of mature PML NBs. Not only is sumoylation of PML protein an indispensable prerequisite to sustain PML NB integrity (22Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but also multiple sumoylated substrates reside in PML NBs, including p53 and TIP60 (15Cheng Z. Ke Y. Ding X. Wang F. Wang H. Wang W. Ahmed K. Liu Z. Xu Y. Aikhionbare F. Yan H. Liu J. Xue Y. Yu J. Powell M. Liang S. Wu Q. Reddy S.E. Hu R. Huang H. Jin C. Yao X.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2586-2599Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), indicating that SUMO modification may mediate the translocalization or that PML NBs are locations where sumoylation takes place. Once nonsumoylatable PML protein in which conservative SUMO attachment sites are mutated is overexpressed, the integrity of PML NBs is disrupted (20Hodges M. Tissot C. Howe K. Grimwade D. Freemont P.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 64: 297-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, the disrupted PML NBs derive from the expression of PML-RARα fusion protein, which is found fused to the retinoic acid receptor-α as a consequence of the t(15Cheng Z.

Under As2O3 treatment, the reorganized integrity of PML NBs is due to the induced sumoylated PML-RARα and relocalization of PML protein to NBs (27Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. Puvion F. Koken M. Honore N. Doubeikovsky A. Duprez E. Pandolfi P.P. Puvion E. Freemont P. de Thé H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Although the nuclear antigen Sp100 was the first characterized protein to localize in PML NBs, the PML protein is the major structural component of the PML NBs. According to C-terminal sequence variation, seven PML isoforms have been identified (28Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, most studies on these isoforms have concentrated on PML3, which has been revealed to interact with p53, increasing p53 transcriptional activity and recruiting it to PML NBs following cellular stress (29Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Given our novel discovery that sumoylated TIP60 targets to PML NBs and the functional similarity of p53 and TIP60, we are intrigued to explore the impact of PML3 on TIP60 functions in PML NBs. In this study, we present evidence that PML3 recruits TIP60 into PML NBs by specifically mutual binding, and we also observe that the interaction of the two proteins is independent of their sumoylation. In addition, we demonstrate that PML3 protects TIP60 from degradation by sequestering Mdm2 binding through a ubiquitination cascade reaction. Significantly, we confirm that physical interaction allows PML3 to control the dynamics of TIP60 in PML NBs. Collectively, this study provides a novel mechanism to further understand the interactive network among TIP60, PML3, and Mdm2 in transcriptional regulation and tumorigenesis. Cell Culture and Transfection and Small Interfering RNA Experiment-HeLa cells, H1299 cells, U2OS cells, and 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, 100 mg/ml) and l-glutamine (30 mg/ml) were obtained from Cellgro. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone. For cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma) treatment, cells were treated with CHX (30 μg/ml) to inhibit protein translation at a desirable time after 24 h of transfection. For MG132 and INF-α treatments, cells were cultured in media containing MG132 (20 μm) and INF-α (2 kilounits/ml) for a desirable time. For UV-irradiation treatment, cells were cultured in media and irradiated with UV (100 J/m2) using a cross-linker (Hoefer). Lipofectamine 2000 for transfection was obtained from Invitrogen. For cell transfection, cells were plated at the appropriate dilution and then transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer. Antibodies, Plasmids, and Small Interfering RNA-The monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences; anti-FLAG and tubulin were from Sigma; anti-GST, anti-HA, and anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) antibodies were all purchased from Cell Signaling. The polyclonal anti-PML and anti-TIP60 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The affinity-purified anti-PML3 rabbit antibody was characterized as described previously (30Xu Z.X. Zou W.X. Lin P. Chang S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, including rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG. Details of constructs will be provided upon request. Anti-PML3 small interfering RNA was described by Xu et al. (30Xu Z.X. Zou W.X. Lin P. Chang S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and purchased from Dharmacon. The small interfering RNA sequence is as follows: PML3, 5′-AATGAAAGTGGGTTCTCCTGG-3. Immunoprecipitation, in Vivo and in Vitro Binding Assay, and Western Blotting Analysis-Whole cell protein extracts were obtained by lysing cells in SDS-containing lysis buffer. For Western blotting, aliquots of total cell extracts were resolved on a 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, following transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk diluted in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma). Proteins of interest in membrane were detected by incubating with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Then the membrane was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature and developed with the standard ECL detection method under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, transfected cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with a complete protease-inhibitor mixture. The scraped cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with occasional light vortexing, followed by 15 min of centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was incubated with FLAG antibody-conjugated FLAG M2 beads at 4 °C for 1 h or more. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For in vivo binding assays, transfected 293T cells with FLAG-PML3, FLAG-PML4, and FLAG-PML-RARα were lysed in 300 mm NaCl-containing lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). The lysates were then diluted twice and incubated with 4 μg of MBP-TIP60 or MBP alone. For the in vitro binding assay, GST fusion protein-bound Sepharose beads were used as an affinity matrix to isolate proteins interacting with TIP60 by purified MBP-tagged full-length and mutant of TIP60 that were expressed in bacteria. Briefly, the GST-PML3 fusion protein-bound Sepharose beads were incubated with purified proteins for 4 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, the beads were extensively washed with PBS and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by fractionation of bound proteins on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting using an appropriate antibody. Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures. Immunofluorescence Staining-For immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on glass coverslips. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were fixed in PBS supplemented with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Triton for 5 min. After a 30-min incubation in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS), cells were stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with the secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. After several washes, coverslips were mounted in Dabco 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and analyzed with a microscope. Florescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Analysis-For FRAP analysis, HeLa cells were cultured in a glass-bottom culture dish (MatTek) with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were visualized by an inverted microscope (Leica SP5) with a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture PlanApo objective and observed by using an argon laser at 543-nm excitation and 560-700-nm band pass emission filters for RFP or argon laser at 488-nm excitation and 500-530-nm band pass emission filters for GFP. An ∼2-μm2 bleach spot was generated by using the 70% power setting of the appropriate excitation laser. The times of 50% fluorescence intensity recovery (t½) at the bleached area from 10 independent experiments were quantified. PML3 Recruits TIP60 to the Nuclear Bodies-It is well defined that TIP60 co-localizes with p53 in PML NBs to share similar biological significance, and PML3 recruits p53 to the NBs (12Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 31Legube G. Linares L.K. Tyteca S. Caron C. Scheffner M. Chevillard-Briet M. Trouche D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44825-44833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Taking into account our latest observation that UV radiation promotes the translocation of TIP60 to the PML NBs (15Cheng Z. Ke Y. Ding X. Wang F. Wang H. Wang W. Ahmed K. Liu Z. Xu Y. Aikhionbare F. Yan H. Liu J. Xue Y. Yu J. Powell M. Liang S. Wu Q. Reddy S.E. Hu R. Huang H. Jin C. Yao X. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we are intrigued to investigate whether PML3 assist the redistribution of TIP60 to PML NBs. To this end, we initially examined the localization of TIP60 under various conditions. U2OS cells stained with TIP60 antibody to detect endogenous TIP60 or HeLa cells transfected with GFP-TIP60 presented no PML NB localization, indicated by PML or PML3 polyantibody staining (Fig. 1A, a and b), whereas overexpression of PML3 or UV treatment distinctly strengthened TIP60 localization in PML NBs in size and quantity (Fig. 1B, a and b). Expressing PML3 alone also recruited TIP60 into PML NBs with or without UV irradiation (Fig. S1). Since TIP60 has been identified as a novel site-specific sumoylatable substrate (15Cheng Z. Ke Y. Ding X. Wang F. Wang H. Wang W. Ahmed K. Liu Z. Xu Y. Aikhionbare F. Yan H. Liu J. Xue Y. Yu J. Powell M. Liang S. Wu Q. Reddy S.E. Hu R. Huang H. Jin C. Yao X. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we next examined whether PML3 impacts on the distribution of nonsumoylatable TIP60 mutant (TIP60dm), in which two SUMO-conjugating sites (Lys430 and Lys451) were replaced by arginines. GFP-TIP60dm is diffused in whole nucleus (Fig. 1A, c). However, co-expression with FLAG-PML3 resulted in an apparent enrichment of TIP60dm in the PML body (Fig. 1B, c), suggesting that targeting of TIP60 to the PML body is independent of its sumoylation. Moreover, we sought to repress PML3 protein level using siRNA and examine if the localization of TIP160 depends on PML3. As shown in Fig. 1D, siRNA oligonucleotide-targeted PML3 selectively suppressed PML3 protein level without altering PML4 and tubulin levels. As reported previously, UV irradiation induced concentration of TIP60 in NBs, where it co-localized with PML3 (Fig. 1E, a). As predicted, repression of PML3 abolished the UV-induced NB localization of TIP60 (Fig. 1E, b), indicating that PML3 is required for NB localization of TIP60. PML3 Interacts with and Specifies TIP60 Localization to the PML Body-To examine further whether PML3 recruits TIP60 to NB due to their physical interaction, we used PML3 antibody to carry out immunoprecipitation experiments with cell lysates from U2OS cells irradiated in vivo. As expected, UV irradiation of U2OS cells resulted in up-regulation of TIP60 expression and a concomitant increase in the amount of TIP60 co-immunoprecipitated with PML3 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Conversely, we use TIP60 antibody to perform immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 2B, TIP60 also co-immunoprecipitated with PML3, which demonstrates that PML3 can interact with TIP60. Previous studies showed that sumoylation plays an important role in PML NBs assembly and relocalization of other components into PML NBs (32Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V.

Cell. 2006; 24: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We then examined whether sumoylation of PML3 or TIP60 is essential for their interaction. We used co-immunoprecipitation experiments from transfected 293T cells in vivo and found that co-expression of FLAG-PML3 with GFP-TIP60 or GFP-TIP60dm and immunoprecipitation of PML3 led to co-immunoprecipitation of TIP60 or TIP60dm (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3), and immunoprecipitation of TIP60 and TIP60dm also led to co-immunoprecipitation of PML3 (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). These observations therefore demonstrate that SUMO modification of TIP60 does not affect its interaction with PML3. To confirm that recruitment of TIP60 into PML NBs depends on SUMO modification of PML3, we initially generated a nonsumoylatable form of PML3 in which all three known SUMO conjugation sites (Lys65, Lys160, and Lys490) were mutated to arginine (Fig. 2E). As expected, wild type GFP-PML3 exhibited a typical sumoylated pattern, whereas nonsumoylatable GFP-PML33R mutant contained no detectable SUMO conjugation as judged by PML3 Western blotting analysis (Fig. S1A). We next examined whether sumoylation of PML3 is essential for the NB distribution of TIP60. As shown in Fig. S1B, FLAG-tagged PML33R diffused in whole nucleus in HeLa cells, whereas wild type PML3 was readily apparent in the PML NBs, consistent with previous observations (e.g. see Ref. 34Fu C.

Overexpression of FLAG-PML3 efficiently recruited TIP60 into PML NBs (Fig. 2F, a), whereas PML33R sequestered the PML NBs localization of TIP60 (Fig. 2F, b). To examine whether sumoylation of PML3 determines the PML3-TIP60 interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from transfected 293T cells in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2G, the level of TIP60 co-immunoprecipitated by PML33R or PML3 is virtually the same (Fig. 2G, lanes 2 and 3). These findings therefore implicate that SUMO modification of PML3 is indispensable for TIP60 translocalization to PML NBs but is dispensable for interaction between PML3 and TIP60. To confirm their directly physical interaction, we carried out a pull-down assay in which GST-tagged recombinant PML3 was purified on glutathione-agarose beads and used as an affinity matrix to absorb purified MBP-TIP60 and MBP-TIP60dm proteins in solution. We found that GST-PML3 efficiently bound to MBP-TIP60 and MBP-TIP60dm proteins (Fig. 2H, lanes 5 and 8), indicating a specific physical interaction between PML3 and TIP60 and TIP60dm in vitro. These findings therefore verify that PML3 physically interacts with TIP60 independent of their sumoylation status. However, SUMO modification of PML3 is indispensable for TIP60 localization to the nuclear bodies. Mapping the TIP60 Region Responsible for PML3 Binding and NB Localization-As our data show, PML3 physically interacts with TIP60 and recruits TIP60 into PML NBs. To map the precise region of TIP60 required for PML binding, we generated various TIP60 deletion mutants according to its functional domains depicted in Fig. 3A and transiently transfected 293T cells to express GFP-tagged TIP60 proteins and FLAG-tagged PML3 proteins. The immunoprecipitates were then washed and resolved in SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C, FLAG-PML3 immunoprecipitation pulls down GFP-tagged TIP60 deletion mutants containing amino acids 1-211, 1-364, 212-364, and 212-511 but not 365-511 (indicated with asterisks), demonstrating that the N-terminal region of TIP60-(1-364) is responsible for the PML3 binding. Consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results, GFP-tagged TIP60 deletion mutants containing amino acids 1-211, 1-364, 212-364, and 212-511 are co-localized with FLAG-PML3 in the NBs (Fig. 3B, a-d), whereas GFP-TIP60-(361-511) failed to localize to PML NBs despite overexpression of PML3 (Fig. 3B, e). Thus, we conclude that the N terminus (amino acids 1-364) of TIP60 containing the chromodomain and zinc finger is required for PML3 association and responsible for its targeting to NBs. TIP60 Specifies PML3 Association by Binding to C-terminal PML3-It has been reported that overexpression of PML-RARα fusion protein leads to the disruption of PML NBs due mainly to an inhibition of SUMO-binding activity located to the C terminus of PML (20Hodges M.

Pandolfi P.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We thus also introduced PML-RARα (Fig. 4A) to examine whether TIP60 recruitment to PML NBs was specific to PML3 but not the PML-RARα product. To begin with, FLAG-PML-RARα and GFP-TIP60 were co-transfected into HeLa cells to investigate the localization of the two exogenously expressed products by immunofluorescence. As expected, FLAG-PML-RARα appeared to diffuse throughout the nucleus rather than concentrate at the NBs, confirming that PML-RARα disrupts the integrity of PML NBs (Fig. 4B, c). Although exogenous expression of wild type FLAG-PML3 promotes the localization of TIP60 to the NBs (Fig. 4B, a), FLAG-PML-RARα abrogates the TIP60 localization into PML NBs. In the PML-RARα-expressing cells, GFP-TIP60 is diffused throughout the nucleus (Fig. 4B, c). Since the PML-RARα fusion protein lacks the PML C-terminal region (Fig. 4A), we hypothesized that this domain is required to recruit TIP60 into NBs. Among seven isoforms of the PML protein, PML4 shares the highest similarity with PML3, which only presents a slight variation from the C terminus of PML4 (Fig. 4A) (28Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To test the"

We identified 213 unique RISs from the patient's peripheral blood samples by linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR). While vector integration patterns were similar to that previously reported, only 3.76% of RISs were common among early (up to 3 months) and late samples (beyond 1 year). Additionally, common integration sites were enriched among late samples (14.9% vs. 36.8%, respectively). Three RISs were found near or within known oncogenes, but 2 were limited to early timepoints. Interestingly, an integration site near the MDS1 gene was detected in long-term follow-up samples; however, the overall contribution of MDS1 integrated clone remained stably low during follow-up."

LigA has a distinctive modular structure in which a nucleotidyltransferase catalytic domain is flanked by an upstream NMN-binding module and by downstream OB-fold, zinc finger, helix-hairpin-helix, and BRCT domains. Here we conducted a structure-function analysis of the nucleotidyltransferase domain of Escherichia coli LigA, guided by the crystal structure of the LigA-DNA-adenylate intermediate. We tested the effects of 29 alanine and conservative mutations at 15 amino acids on ligase activity in vitro and in vivo.

Finer analysis of the mutational effects revealed step-specific functions for Arg136, which is essential for the reaction of LigA with NAD+ to form the covalent ligase-AMP intermediate (step 1) and for the transfer of AMP to the nick 5′-PO4 to form the DNA-adenylate intermediate (step 2) but is dispensable for phosphodiester formation at a preadenylylated nick (step 3).

Escherichia coli NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) is the founding member of a family of DNA replication/repair enzymes present in all known bacteria as well as certain halophilic archaea (1Zhao A. Gray F. MacNeill S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LigA seals 3′-OH/5′-PO4 DNA nicks via three nucleotidyl transfer reactions: (i) LigA reacts with NAD+ to form a covalent ligase-(lysyl-N)-AMP intermediate and release NMN; (ii) LigA-AMP binds to nicked DNA and transfers the adenylate to the 5′-PO4 strand to form an adenylylated nicked intermediate, AppDNA; and (iii) LigA remains bound to the adenylylated nick and directs the attack of the 3′-OH on the 5′ phosphoanhydride linkage, resulting in a repaired phosphodiester and release of AMP (2Little J.W.

Each step of the ligation pathway depends on a different subset of the LigA domain modules, with only the NTase domain being required for all steps. Domain Ia is unique to NAD+-dependent ligases and is the determinant of NAD+ specificity (7Gajiwala K.S. Pinko C. Structure. 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol.

During the ligase adenylylation reaction (step 1), the Ia domain binds the NMN moiety of NAD+ via contacts to essential conserved amino acids (Tyr22, His23, Asp32, Tyr35, and Asp36 in E. coli LigA) and thereby orients the NMN leaving group apical to the attacking lysine nucleophile (Lys115 in E. coli LigA) (11Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9685-9700Google Scholar). Deleting the Ia domain abolishes ligase adenylylation without affecting phosphodiester formation at a preadenylylated nick (step 3). A fragment of LigA comprising only the Ia and NTase domains suffices for ligase adenylylation (13Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol.

The several C-terminal domains of NAD+-dependent ligases are thereby implicated in recognition of the nicked DNA substrate. The crystal structure of E. coli LigA bound to the nicked DNA-adenylate intermediate consolidated this point by showing that LigA encircles the DNA helix as a C-shaped protein clamp (9Nandakumar J. Nair P.A. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA interface entails extensive DNA contacts by the NTase, OB, and helix-hairpin-helix domains over a 19-bp segment of duplex DNA centered about the nick (see Fig. 1). A structure-guided mutational analysis (17Wang L.K. Nair P.A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23343-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) pinpointed essential functional groups in the OB domain that engage the DNA phosphodiester backbone flanking the nick (Arg333), penetrate the minor grove and distort the nick (Val383 and Ile384), or stabilize the OB fold (Arg379). The essential constituents of the helix-hairpin-helix domain include four glycines (Gly455, Gly489, Gly521, and Gly553) that bind the phosphate backbone across the minor groove at the outer margins of the LigA-DNA interface; Arg487, which penetrates the minor groove at the outer margin on the 3′-OH side of the nick; and Arg446, which promotes protein clamp formation via contacts to the nucleotidyltransferase domain (17Wang L.K. Nair P.A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23343-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The zinc finger module appears to play a purely structural role in bridging the OB and helix-hairpin-helix domains (9Nandakumar J. Nair P.A. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Zn2+ coordination is critical for E. coli LigA activity, insofar as single alanine substitutions at three of the four cysteines (Cys408, Cys411, and Cys432) suppressed nick sealing by 3 orders of magnitude (18Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis revealed that the BRCT domain of E. coli LigA is required in its entirety for effective nick sealing in vitro (17Wang L.K. Nair P.A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23343-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, a structural interpretation of this result is elusive because no electron density was observed for this segment of DNA-bound E. coli LigA (9Nandakumar J. Nair P.A. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Whereas NAD+ and DNA recognition are aided by the flanking domains discussed above, the chemical steps of nick sealing are performed by the NTase domain. Initial mutational analyses of the NTase domain of E. coli LigA (18Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12137-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) focused on: (i) residues within a set of conserved peptide motifs that define the “covalent nucleotidyl-transferase superfamily,” which includes ATP-dependent DNA ligases, ATP-dependent RNA ligases, and GTP-dependent mRNA capping enzymes (20Shuman S. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); and (ii) amino acids unique to and conserved among members of the NAD+-dependent DNA ligases clade. Ten individual residues of the NTase domain were identified as critical for E. coli LigA function: Lys115 (the site of covalent AMP attachment), Asp117, Gly118, Glu173, Arg200, Arg208, Arg277, Asp285, Lys290, and Lys314 (19Zhu H.

Structure. 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) revealed atomic contacts with the AMP moiety that could plausibly account for the essentiality of Glu173 (which coordinates the ribose O2′), Lys290 (which donates a hydrogen bond to adenine-N1), and Lys314 (which coordinates the AMP phosphate (see Fig. 2C). The roles of Arg200 and Arg208 were illuminated by the crystal structure of the LigA-DNA-adenylate intermediate. Arg200 and Arg208 reside within a conserved α-helical peptide (197ANPRNAAAGSLRQ209) that engages the DNA minor groove on the 3′ side of the nick. Arg200 is located at the nick, where it: (i) stacks over and makes van der Waals’ contacts with the terminal nucleoside sugar of the 3′-OH strand, (ii) contacts via water the 3′-OH terminal base, and (iii) forms a salt bridge to the essential Asp117 side chain (see Fig. 2B). Arg208 penetrates deeply into the minor groove, where it contacts several nucleoside sugars and bases (see Fig. 2B). Here, we used the E. coli LigA-DNA crystal structure to guide a new round of mutational analysis of the NTase domain, focusing on side chains that make atomic contacts to the DNA duplex and the 5′-adenylate. We thereby identified several conserved amino acid functional groups essential for nick sealing in vitro and in vivo. New mechanistic insights were gleaned from an analysis of mutational effects on individual steps of the ligation pathway. Ligase Mutants-Missense and nonsense mutations were introduced by PCR into the pET-EcoLigA expression plasmid as described previously (12Benarroch D. Shuman S. Virology. 2006; 353: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The entire ligA gene was sequenced in every case to confirm the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during PCR amplification and cloning. The expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Mutant and wild type ligases were purified from the soluble lysates of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced BL21(DE3) cells by nickel-agarose chromatography as described (12Benarroch D. Shuman S. Virology. 2006; 353: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nick Ligation-Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm NAD+, 1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled nicked duplex DNA substrate, and aliquots of serial 2-fold dilutions of wild type or mutant ligases were incubated at 22 °C for 20 min. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1.25 mm EDTA). The extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. The specific activities of wild type and mutant ligases were determined from the slopes of the titration curves in the linear range of enzyme dependence. The activities of the mutant ligases were normalized to the specific activity of wild type LigA protein purified in parallel with that mutant and assayed in a parallel with the same preparation of radiolabeled DNA substrate. On average, the wild type LigA sealed 63 ± 21 fmol of nicks/fmol of input enzyme (average value for 20 different titration experiments with three different preparations of LigA and multiple different preparations of 32P-labeled singly nicked DNA substrate). Ligase Adenylylation-Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm [32P-adenylate]NAD (purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 8 pmol of wild type or mutant LigA were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min. The reactions were quenched with SDS, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ligase-[32P]AMP adduct was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix imager. Ligation at a Preadenylated Nick-The nicked DNA-adenylate substrate was prepared as described previously (19Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12137-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, the 5′ adenylated 32P-labeled 18-mer strand (AppDNA) was prepared by in vitro reaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis LigC with a singly nicked three-piece duplex DNA containing a 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer strand at the nick. The AppDNA strand was then purified by PAGE, and the nicked DNA-adenylate substrate was formed by annealing the purified AppDNA strand to the complementary 36-mer and a 3′-OH acceptor strand at a molar ratio of 1:4:4. AppDNA ligation reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 600 fmol of nicked DNA-adenylate substrate, and 6 pmol of wild type or mutant LigA proteins were incubated at 22 °C. The sealing reactions were initiated by adding ligase. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 min and quenched immediately with EDTA and formamide. The products were resolved by denaturing PAGE, and the extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a Fujix imager. At maximum, ∼80% of the input AppDNA strand was ligated at the reaction end point. (This reflects incomplete annealing of the labeled AppDNA to the template and 3′-OH strands.) A plot of the kinetic profile of AppDNA sealing by wild type LigA (with each datum being the average of 11 separate experiments) fit to a single exponential with a rate constant of 0.64 ± 0.019 min–1, as calculated in Prism by nonlinear regression curve fitting. Assay of LigA Activity in Vivo by Complementation of cdc9Δ-NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments containing LigA mutant alleles were excised from their respective pET-based LigA plasmids and inserted into pYX1-His (CEN TRP1). In this vector, expression of ligA is under the control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. The pYX1-LIGA plasmids were transformed into a yeast cdc9Δ strain bearing a CEN URA3 CDC9 plasmid. Trp+ isolates were streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml of 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA). Lethal mutations (–growth) were those that formed no FOA-resistant colonies at 25° or 30 °C. The viable cdc9Δ ligA yeast strains were tested for growth on YPD agar at 25 and 30 °C. +++ indicates colony size indistinguishable from a cdc9Δ strain expressing wild type LigA; ++ indicates smaller colony size; and + indicates pinpoint colonies. New Round of Alanine Scanning of the LigA NTase Domain-The NTase domain of E. coli LigA contains an adenylate-binding pocket composed of a cage of β strands and interstrand loops that includes the six defining motifs (I, Ia, III, IIIa, IV, and V) of the covalent nucleotidyl-transferase superfamily (20Shuman S. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The motif I (115KLDG) lysine nucleophile is located in a loop between the two antiparallel β sheets that form the binding site for the reactive AppN dinucleotide of the nicked DNA-adenylate intermediate. Lys115 contacts the 5′-phosphate of the AppDNA strand (see Fig. 2B). Motif Ia (135TRG137) is located within an interstrand loop that contacts both sides of the nick. The pyrophosphate bridge of AppN is coordinated by motif Ia residue Arg136 and by Ser81 (see Fig. 2A). The two phosphodiesters flanking the nick 5′ terminus (AppNpNpN) are engaged by Asn84, directly and via water (see Fig. 2B). The three phosphodiesters flanking the 3′-OH side of the nick are coordinated by: (i) the motif Ia Thr135 side chain to NpNpNpNOH; (ii) the motif Ia Arg136 side chain to NpNpNpNOH; and (iii) Gln72 via water to NpNpNpNOH (see Fig. 2A). Asn201 engages in a network of water-mediated contacts to the nucleosides at the 3′-OH nick terminus (see Fig. 2B). Here we probed the roles of residues Gln72, Ser81, Asn84, Thr135, Arg136 and Asn201 that bind the DNA at and near the nick by replacing them individually with alanine. The NTase domain also contacts the DNA duplex at sites remote from the nick. Arg97, Arg101, and Arg308 make electrostatic interactions with adjacent phosphates of the template DNA strand on the 5′-phosphate side of nick (Figs. 1 and 2A). Gln209 and Arg218 make direct and water-mediated contacts with two adjacent template strand phosphates on the 3′-OH side of the nick (Figs. 1 and 2B). Each of these residues was subjected presently to alanine substitution. We included three additional conserved LigA residues in the alanine scan: Arg305, situated near the nick 5′ AppN terminus (Fig. 2A); Arg171, which donates hydrogen bonds to multiple main chain and side chain atoms within the NTase domain (Fig. 2A); and Ser206, which interacts with Arg218 near the DNA minor grove (Fig. 2B). The wild type and mutated E. coli LigA proteins were produced as N-terminal His10 fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 3A). The extent of ligation of singly nicked 3′-OH/5′PO4 DNA by wild type LigA, and each mutant was gauged as a function of input enzyme, and the specific activities were normalized to the wild type value (defined as 100%). The results are compiled in Table 1. Our operational definition of a functionally important residue is one at which alanine substitution reduced specific activity in nick joining to ≤10% of wild type LigA. By this criterion, five of the targeted residues were deemed important: Arg136, Arg171, Ser81, Arg218, and Arg308 (Table 1).TABLE 1Effects of alanine mutations on LigA functionLigALigase activitycdc9Δ complementationLig-AMPNon-DNA atomic contacts% of WT% of WTWild type100+++100Q72A38+++92S81A6+++44NAD+ β-PO4N84A21+++92R97A17+++83R101A28+++70R97A/R101A5-70T135A22+++42R136A<0.1-<0.1NAD+ β-PO4S81A/R136A<0.1-<0.1R171A1-7Ser122, Glu169, Val77, Pro78N201A26+++19Asn198S206A39+++70Arg218Q209A33+++62R218A2-120Ser206R305A14+++43Pro58, Arg61R308A9-71 Open table in a new tab By contrast, the alanine mutations at nine other positions reduced activity to between 14 and 39% of wild type LigA. We surmise that the contacts of these residues to DNA or other protein constituents seen in the crystal structure contribute to nick sealing, although not enough to meet our criterion of significance. In some cases, an apparently “nonessential” side chain engages in potentially redundant atomic contacts. For example, the effects of loss of the hydrogen bond from Thr135 Oγ to a phosphate near the 3′-OH end might be softened by the fact that the main chain amide of nearby Gly137 donates a hydrogen bond to the same nonbridging phosphate oxygen as Thr135 (Fig. 2A). In the same vein, whereas Arg101 and Arg308 make ionic interactions with the same phosphate oxygen atom (Fig. 2A), the R308A mutation (9% of wild type activity) is more deleterious than R101A (28%). Residues Gln209 and Arg218 share a water-mediated phosphate contact to the template strand (Fig. 2B), yet the R218A change (2% of wild type activity) was much more harmful than Q209A (33%). The effects of losing the direct hydrogen bond between Gln209 and the vicinal phosphate might be masked by the hydrogen bond to the same nonbridging oxygen atom from the main chain amide nitrogen of Leu210 (Figs. 1 and 2B). The Arg97 and Arg101 side chains project from the same face of an α helix (89EESFLANKRVQDR101) and help dock the α helix to the template DNA strand by ionic contacts to adjacent phosphates (Fig. 2A), in which case the impact of the R97A change (17% of wild type activity) might be checked by the backup contacts of Arg101 (a seemingly inessential side chain, insofar as the R101A mutant had 70% of wild type activity). To test this idea, we produced a R97A/R101A double mutant of LigA and found that its specific activity in nick sealing was 5% of the wild type value (Table 1). This result is consistent with functional redundancy of Arg97 and Arg101 at the LigA-DNA interface. Effects of Alanine Mutations on EcoLigA Function in Vivo in Yeast-A deletion of the gene encoding the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP-dependent DNA ligase Cdc9 can be complemented by expression of LigA (18Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Viability of the yeast cdc9Δ strain is contingent on maintenance of an extrachromosomal CDC9 gene on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Hence, cdc9Δ cells cannot grow on medium containing FOA (a drug that selects against the URA3 CDC9 plasmid), but they can grow on FOA if the cells have been transformed with a CEN TRP1 plasmid expressing wild type LigA under the control of the constitutive yeast TPI1 promoter. Here we tested by the plasmid shuffle assay (18Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) whether the LigA-Ala mutants were functional in yeast. We found that mutations R136A, R171A, and R218A that reduced nicked sealing activity to ≤2% of wild type LigA were all lethal in vivo, i.e. they were unable to support growth of cdc9Δ on FOA at 25 or 30 °C (scored as – in Table 1). The impaired R308A mutant (9% as active as wild type LigA in vitro) and the R97A-R101A double mutant (5% activity in vitro) were also unable to complement cdc9Δ. By contrast, the nine alanine mutants that retained more than 10% of wild type nick joining activity in vitro were functional in cdc9Δ complementation in vivo. These results suggest that growth of the cdc9Δ strain depends on a threshold level of LigA nick sealing activity. The exception to this correlation was S81A, which had 6% of wild type nick joining activity in vitro but still supported yeast growth. All of the viable cdc9Δ ligA-Ala strains (including S81A) grew as well as the “wild type” cdc9Δ ligA strain on YPD agar medium at 25 and 30 °C, as gauged by colony size (scored as +++ in Table 1). Structure-Activity Relationships at Key Residues of the NTase Domain-We tested the effects of conservative lysine and glutamine substitutions for the four essential arginine residues identified above in the alanine scan (Arg136, Arg171, Arg218, and Arg308) and for Arg97, which reduced ligase activity by a factor of six. We also introduced conservative changes at Lys290, an important residue that makes a hydrogen bond to the adenine-N1 of NAD+ and AppDNA (Figs. 1 and 2C). We showed previously that the K290A mutant of E. coli LigA was lethal in yeast and had 8-fold lower nick sealing activity in vitro than wild type LigA (19Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12137-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we replaced Lys290 with arginine and glutamine. Twelve conservative LigA mutants were produced in E. coli and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickelagarose chromatography (Fig. 3B). The specific activities of the mutants in nick joining were determined. The conservative mutants were also tested for activity in yeast cdc9Δ complementation. The results are compiled in Table 2.TABLE 2Effects of conservative mutations on LigA functionLigALigase activitycdc9Δ complementationLig-AMP% of WT% of WTWild type100+++100R97K63+++108R97Q30+++122R136K0.2-15R136Q<0.1-0.7S81A/R136K0.1-0.1R171K15+++17R171Q3-5R218K19++57R218Q4-87K290R8+63K290Q3-64R308K80+++110R308Q4-61 Open table in a new tab We found that Arg136 was strictly essential for LigA activity in vitro and in vivo. The R136K and R136Q mutants were 0.2 and <0.1% as active as wild type LigA in nick sealing and were lethal in vivo in yeast. We surmise that the multidentate contacts of Arg136 with either the NAD+ β phosphate (Fig. 2C) or the phosphates of the nicked DNA-adenylate (Fig. 2B) are critical for LigA activity, rather than mere positive charge on this side chain. By contrast, positive charge appears to suffice in the case of Arg308. Whereas the R308Q mutation (4% as active as wild type LigA and lethal in yeast) mimicked the effects of R308A, the lysine substitution restored nick sealing to 80% of wild type and revived activity in vivo in yeast (Table 2). We infer that lysine can recapitulate the monodentate contact to the DNA phosphate observed for Arg308 in the LigA crystal structure (Fig. 2A). Glutamine substitutions for Arg171 and Arg218 had no salutary effect compared with the alanine mutations, i.e. R171Q and R218Q were lethal in yeast and were 3 and 4% as active in nick sealing as wild type LigA, respectively (Table 2). However, the introduction of lysine raised nick sealing activity above our 10% cut-off criterion (to 15% for R171K and 19% for R218K), which allowed for survival of the cdc9Δ R171K and cdc9Δ R218K yeast strains (Table 2). We surmise that LigA activity relies on a positively charged side chain at positions 171 and 218, although optimal activity is attained with arginine. Note that Arg171 makes hydrogen bonds from all three guanidinium nitrogens to main chain and side chain atoms of the NTase domain. The terminal guanidinium nitrogens of Arg218 donate hydrogen bonds to Ser206 Oγ and a DNA-bound water, respectively (Fig. 2B). Replacing the adenine-binding Lys290 residue with glutamine elicited a 30-fold reduction in nick sealing and ablated LigA activity in vivo in yeast (Table 2). The K290R mutant was only slightly better at nick sealing in vitro (8% of wild type activity). Yeast cdc9Δ K290R cells were viable but grew poorly (Table 2). The decrement in nick sealing activity upon the loss of Arg97 (17% of wild type activity) was partially remedied by glutamine (30% activity) and lysine (63% activity), both of which supported growth of cdc9Δ (Table 2). Mutational Effects on Phosphodiester Formation at a Preadenylated Nick-The third step of the ligation pathway entails attack of the 3′-OH of the nick on the 5′-PO4 of the DNA-adenylate to form a phosphodiester and release AMP. We assayed step 3 in isolation using a preadenylated nicked 36-bp DNA substrate labeled with 32P at the 5′-PO4 of the 18-mer DNA-adenylate strand; this substrate was incubated with LigA in the presence of magnesium without added NAD+. Under condition of enzyme excess, wild type E. coli LigA sealed the nicked DNA-adenylate with pseudo-first order kinetics (Fig. 4). LigA mutants with alanine and conservative substitutions for Arg136, Ser81, Arg171, Arg218, and Arg308 were tested in parallel with wild type LigA (Fig. 4). A striking finding was that elimination of the motif I Arg136 side chain, which abolished overall nick sealing, had little effect on the rate of phosphodiester synthesis at a preadenylated nick (Fig. 4A, R136A). This result was surprising to us in light of the extensive set of contacts made by Arg136 to the phosphates at the nick in the crystal structure (Fig. 2A), which is taken to mimic the Michaelis complex for the step 3 reaction (9Nandakumar J.
