https://openalex.org/W1968528916,"FOR the purpose of studying the metabolism in insects of a radioactive bromine analogue of DDT, (Br*C6H4)2 CH.CCl3 (I), a method was required for the separation and estimation of (I) and the possible metabolites, (Br*C6H4)2 C : CCl2 (II), and (Br*C6H4)2 CH.COOH (III), on the micro-mole scale. It was important that the method itself should not bring about any decomposition of unchanged (I)."

Chevalieri, which is unable to ferment maltose and is therefore of the recessive formula mm, and obtained a hybrid Mm. All the 4-spored asci isolated from this interspecific hybrid yielded two fermenters to two non-fermenters of maltose."
https://openalex.org/W2071262633,"ON reduction by lithium aluminium hydride, amides usually give amines1: it has now been found that N-methyl phenanthridones behave rather differently, yielding quaternary (phenanthridinium) compounds. Phenanthridones are reduced to phenanthridines. Thus, N-methyl phenanthridone and N-3-dimethyl phenanthridone (m.p. 139°; found: C, 80.6; H, 5.8; N, 6.15 per cent; calc. for C15H13ON: C, 80.7; H, 5.8; N, 6.3 per cent) reduced in ethereal solution on the 300-mgm. scale gave respectively 60 and 55 per cent yields of the quaternary iodides (3-methyl phenanthridine methiodide, m.p. 278°; found: C, 53.8; H, 4.1; N, 4.5; I, 37.4 per cent; calc. for C15H14NI: C, 53.75; H, 4.2; N, 4.18; I, 37.9 per cent). The analogous N-methyl quinolone likewise gave N-methyl quinolinium chloride (identified as its platinichloride), but the reaction was less easy, two hours refluxing in dibutyl ether giving a 20 per cent yield. Among the reduction products of N-methyl pyridone, only a trace of quaternary compound (isolated as picrate) was found, together with methylamine (7 per cent isolated as the platinichloride)."

This work has shown that the thickness of the cuticle of mammalian hair depends upon the arrangement of the component scales."

https://openalex.org/W1982138744,"A METHOD for the reductive methylation of peptides and amino-acids, recently published by Bowman1, was used by him to identify as its N-dimethyl derivative the amino-acid in a peptide bearing the free amino-group. Advantage was taken of the ready solubility of these derivatives in alcohol. This elegant method is, however, not immediately suitable for micro-quantities. As N-dimethylamino acids do not give a colour with ninhydrin, paper chromatography2 of the hydrolysate of a methylated peptide should show the absence of the end amino-acid when compared with the hydrolysate of the original peptide. Should this particular amino-acid also occur elsewhere in the peptide, then a diminution of the intensity of the relevant ninhydrin spot is to be expected."

https://openalex.org/W2033180460,"IN a communication in the Zeitschrift für Naturforschung of August 2, 1950, we have reported our attempts to prove the presence of tritium (H3) in the atmosphere. The free atmospheric hydrogen, which is found in the air in a concentration of 5 × 10−7, was burned with copper oxide out of the helium–neon fraction of an air-liquefaction plant. The water was electrolysed down to one-fortieth of its volume in order to enrich the tritium twenty times. The tritium-containing hydrogen of the enriched water was used to make ethane, the activity of which could easily be examined. According to our measurements, about one mole of elementary tritium is present in the whole dry atmosphere of the earth, or one atom of tritium in 10 cm.3 of air. Evidently this tritium has been produced by nuclear fission in the upper layers of the atmosphere, and did not take part in the atmospheric water circulation, but has remained elementary hydrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2094086521,"IN the study of the mechanism of epidermal carcinogenesis, it is perhaps not surprising that attention has been mainly directed to the epithelium of the epidermis itself. Nevertheless, changes occur in the dermis and subcutis which can be distinguished from the effects of non-specific irritants, and it has been suggested that these changes are of importance in the carcinogenic reaction1. As it is now technically possible to make pure epidermal grafts2, the opportunity has been taken to test this hypothesis by transferring the epidermis of a carcinogen-treated site to an untreated body-site, and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W2017508724,"POTASSIUM permanganate (1 per cent solution, containing 2 per cent sodium carbonate) has been recommended1 as a spraying reagent for detecting carbohydrates on paper chromatograms. When testing this reagent on a chromatogram irrigated with butanol/acetic acid and carrying amino-acids as well as carbohydrates, an anomalous spot was observed, which was traced to methionine. It has now been found that if a paper chromatogram be lightly sprayed with the permanganate reagent, methionine, tryptophane, tyrosine and (more weakly) proline and histidine immediately appear as yellow spots on a red background. As the paper dries the colour difference tends to disappear, leaving the spots and background different shades of brown. The spots should therefore be marked at once. Cysteine also gives a spot, but does not normally occur on a paper chromatogram2. Threonine, hydroxyproline, lysine and glycine show up on standing a few minutes. Other amino-acids normally occurring in protein hydrolysates do not show at the concentrations encountered in paper chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W2033009298,"MEASUREMENTS have been made of the superconducting transition temperatures and critical fields of nearly pure tin isotopes separated by the electromagnetic method; the mean atomic weights provisionally determined by mass spectrograph were 116.2 ± 0.2, 120.0 ± 0.2 and 123.6 ± 0.4. Samples of about 15 mgm. in the form of cylinders 1 cm. long cast in silica tubes were used, and transitions were studied (a) by observing the magnetic moment in a constant small magnetic field (2 gauss) as the temperature was lowered, and (b) by measuring magnetization curves at constant temperatures. The magnetic moments were measured by a ballistic method1, and to improve relative accuracy all three samples were studied together. The transitions were sharp (∼0.01° K. width), and the transition temperatures (Tc), defined as the temperatures (extrapolated to zero field) at which the ratio of magnetic moment to field had half its superconducting value, could be determined with a precision of order 0.001° K. relative to each other. The values of Tc expressed on the 1949 scale2 were:"

The cellulose and the experimental technique were those described previously1. The heat of wetting decreases with the rise of temperature as shown by the following values, which represent the means of several experimental results at each temperature: The decrease appears to be linear in the range tested, and amounts to about 0.042 cal./degree/gm. cellulose."
https://openalex.org/W1978447335,"ABOUT thirty years ago Uvarov brought forward the ‘phase’ theory of locusts and showed that young hoppers when crowded together developed differences in colour, structure, behaviour and physiology from similar larvæ kept individually separate. The former were known as the phase ‘gregaria’ and the latter as ‘solitaria’. Gregaria are always darker in colour than solitaria."

https://openalex.org/W1965031456,"SODIUM azide, a substance which has been widely used in the study of various metabolic problems, is known to have three main effects: (a) it combines with several metallo-proteins, in particular with haematin compounds, a9d thus strongly inhibits respiration1; (b) it inhibits processes of assimilation and synthesis in micro-organisms2; and (c) it interferes with the oxidative metabolism of cells by preventing the uptake of inorganic phosphate3. The last two effects arise probably from the same cause4. The inhibition of respiration is usually very strong and will tend to mask any other effects. Some cases of azide-resistant respiration have been reported5; but the phenomenon could not be explained."
https://openalex.org/W1999259235,"THE ability of living trees to resist attack by common fungi which destroy dead branches and lumber from these same trees seems to be in need of explanation. This problem is made more interesting by the fact that some wood-destroying fungi, such as Schizophyllum commune Fries, are in general unable to cause serious trouble even in wounded living trees."

https://openalex.org/W2024504720,"IN the course of an investigation of nerve endings in the rat diaphragm, it was noticed by Dr. J. A. Hewitt and one of us (C. S.) that the muscle fibres seemed to be of two types, reminiscent somewhat of the well-known pale and red fibres in voluntary muscles described by Jordan1 and several others. The ‘red’ variety seemed to be more numerous than the other. Staining with iron haematoxylin after alcohol fixation (ideal for skeletal muscle) confirmed that there were two types, but unfortunately did not reveal any further distinguishing detail. It was then decided to attempt their differentiation at the higher magnifications now possible with the electron microscope."

Progress was satisfactory until they were about 1 in. long (8 weeks), when considerable numbers died suddenly, suggesting an epidemic infection. Two days previously there had been an unusual number of people present in the room. As many pathogenic agents are susceptible to penicillin, we added 10 units/ml. to the water of the aquarium, which was then not changed for 24 hr. After this, there were no more deaths. Shortly afterwards we had similar losses among our edible frogs, kept in a shallow tank. Penicillin was added to the water, a higher concentration—20 units/ml.—being used to allow for the slower entry into the larger animals. There was an immediate and striking reduction in the mortality-rate to a figure no greater than normally experienced with these animals at that season."
