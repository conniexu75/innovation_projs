https://openalex.org/W3210357390,"An increasing number of studies across many research fields from biomedical engineering to finance are employing measures of entropy to quantify the regularity, variability or randomness of time series and image data. Entropy, as it relates to information theory and dynamical systems theory, can be estimated in many ways, with newly developed methods being continuously introduced in the scientific literature. Despite the growing interest in entropic time series and image analysis, there is a shortage of validated, open-source software tools that enable researchers to apply these methods. To date, packages for performing entropy analysis are often run using graphical user interfaces, lack the necessary supporting documentation, or do not include functions for more advanced entropy methods, such as cross-entropy, multiscale cross-entropy or bidimensional entropy. In light of this, this paper introduces EntropyHub , an open-source toolkit for performing entropic time series analysis in MATLAB, Python and Julia. EntropyHub (version 0.1) provides an extensive range of more than forty functions for estimating cross-, multiscale, multiscale cross-, and bidimensional entropy, each including a number of keyword arguments that allows the user to specify multiple parameters in the entropy calculation. Instructions for installation, descriptions of function syntax, and examples of use are fully detailed in the supporting documentation, available on the EntropyHub website– www.EntropyHub.xyz . Compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems, EntropyHub is hosted on GitHub, as well as the native package repository for MATLAB, Python and Julia, respectively. The goal of EntropyHub is to integrate the many established entropy methods into one complete resource, providing tools that make advanced entropic time series analysis straightforward and reproducible."

We aimed to investigate the TyG index in relation to cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs and mortality.This retrospective study included 114,603 subjects. The TyG index was categorized into four quartiles by sex: Q1, <8.249 and <8.063; Q2, 8.249‒<8.614 and 8.063‒<8.403; Q3, 8.614‒< 8.998 and 8.403‒<8.752; and Q4, ≥8.998 and ≥8.752, in men and women, respectively. To calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary outcomes (CCVDs and all-cause mortality) and secondary outcomes (cardiovascular diseases [CVDs], cerebrovascular diseases [CbVDs], CCVD-related deaths, or all-cause deaths), Cox proportional hazards regression models were adopted.Compared to Q1, the HRs (95% CIs) for the primary outcomes of Q2, Q3, and Q4 were 1.062 (0.981‒1.150), 1.110 (1.024-1.204), and 1.151 (1.058-1.252) in men and 1.099 (0.986-1.226), 1.046 (0.938-1.166), and 1.063 (0.954-1.184) in women, respectively, after adjusted for age, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, economic status, and anti-hypertensive medications. Fully adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for CVDs of Q2, Q3, and Q4 were 1.114 (0.969-1.282), 1.185 (1.031-1.363), and 1.232 (1.068-1.422) in men and 1.238 (1.017-1.508), 1.183 (0.971-1.440), and 1.238 (1.018-1.505) in women, respectively. The adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for ischemic CbVDs of Q2, Q3, and Q4 were 1.005 (0.850-1.187), 1.225 (1.041-1.441), and 1.232 (1.039-1.460) in men and 1.040 (0.821-1.316), 1.226 (0.981-1.532), and 1.312 (1.054-1.634) in women, respectively, while the TyG index was negatively associated with hemorrhagic CbVDs in women but not in men. The TyG index was not significantly associated with CCVD-related death or all-cause death in either sex.Elevated TyG index was positively associated with the primary outcomes (CCVDs and all-cause mortality) in men and predicted higher risk of CVDs and ischemic CbVDs in both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W3107926165,"Latin American governments swiftly implemented income assistance programs to sustain families’ livelihoods during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. This paper analyzes the potential coverage and generosity of these measures and assesses the suitability of current safety nets to deal with unexpected negative income shocks in 10 Latin American countries. The expansion of pre-existing programs (most notably conditional cash transfers and non-contributory pensions) during the COVID-19 crisis was generally insufficient to compensate for the inability to work among the poorest segments of the population. When COVID-19 ad hoc programs are analyzed, the coverage and replacement rates of regular labor income among households in the first quintile of the country’s labor income distribution increase substantially. Yet, these programs present substantial coverage challenges among families composed of fundamentally informal workers who are non-poor, but are at a high risk of poverty. These results highlight the limitations of the fragmented nature of social protection systems in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3208475285,"Epidemics of COVID-19 in student populations at universities were a key concern for the 2020-2021 school year. The University of California (UC) System developed a set of recommendations to reduce campus infection rates. SARS-CoV-2 test results are summarized for the ten UC campuses during the Fall 2020 term.UC mitigation efforts included protocols for the arrival of students living on-campus students, non-pharmaceutical interventions, daily symptom monitoring, symptomatic testing, asymptomatic surveillance testing, isolation and quarantine protocols, student ambassador programs for health education, campus health and safety pledges, and lowered density of on-campus student housing. We used data from UC campuses, the UC Health-California Department of Public Health Data Modeling Consortium, and the U.S. Census to estimate the proportion of each campus' student populations that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and compared it to the fraction individuals aged 20-29 years who tested positive in their respective counties.SARS-CoV-2 cases in campus populations were generally low in September and October 2020, but increased in November and especially December, and were highest in early to mid-January 2021, mirroring case trajectories in their respective counties. Many students were infected during the Thanksgiving and winter holiday recesses and were detected as cases upon returning to campus. The proportion of students who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Fall 2020 ranged from 1.2% to 5.2% for students living on campus and was similar to students living off campus. For most UC campuses the proportion of students testing positive was lower than that for the 20-29-year-old population in which campuses were located.The layered mitigation approach used on UC campuses, informed by public health science and augmented perhaps by a more compliant population, likely minimized campus transmission and outbreaks and limited transmission to surrounding communities. University policies that include these mitigation efforts in Fall 2020 along with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, may alleviate some local concerns about college students returning to communities and facilitate resumption of normal campus operations and in-person instruction."
https://openalex.org/W3209141704,"Since 2016, fall armyworm (FAW) has threatened sub-Saharan 'Africa's fragile food systems and economic performance. Yet, there is limited evidence on this transboundary pest's economic and food security impacts in the region. Additionally, the health and environmental consequences of the insecticides being used to control FAW have not been studied. This paper presents evidence on the impacts of FAW on maize production, food security, and human and environmental health. We use a combination of an agroecology-based community survey and nationally representative data from an agricultural household survey to achieve our objectives. The results indicate that the pest causes an average annual loss of 36% in maize production, reducing 0.67 million tonnes of maize (0.225 million tonnes per year) between 2017 and 2019. The total economic loss is US$ 200 million, or 0.08% of the gross domestic product. The lost production could have met the per capita maize consumption of 4 million people. We also find that insecticides to control FAW have more significant toxic effects on the environment than on humans. This paper highlights governments and development partners need to invest in sustainable FAW control strategies to reduce maize production loss, improve food security, and protect human and environmental health."
https://openalex.org/W3209164696,"Diabetic nephropathy is one of the common microvascular complications of diabetes. Iron death is a recently reported way of cell death. To explore the effects of iron death on diabetic nephropathy, iron death score of diabetic nephropathy was analyzed based on the network and pathway levels. Furthermore, markers related to iron death were screened. Using RNA-seq data of diabetic nephropathy, samples were clustered uniformly and the disease was classified. Differentially expressed gene analysis was conducted on the typed disease samples, and the WGCNA algorithm was used to obtain key modules. String database was used to perform protein interaction analysis on key module genes for the selection of Hub genes. Moreover, principal component analysis method was applied to get transcription factors and non-coding genes, which interact with the Hub gene. All samples can be divided into two categories and principal component analysis shows that the two categories are significantly different. Hub genes (FPR3, C3AR1, CD14, ITGB2, RAC2 and ITGAM) related to iron death in diabetic nephropathy were obtained through gene expression differential analysis between different subtypes. Non-coding genes that interact with Hub genes, including hsa-miR-572, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-miR-208a-3p, hsa-miR-153-3p and hsa-miR-29c-3p, may be related to diabetic nephropathy. Transcription factors HIF1α, KLF4, KLF5, RUNX1, SP1, VDR and WT1 may be related to diabetic nephropathy. The above factors and Hub genes are collectively involved in the occurrence and development of diabetic nephropathy, which can be further studied in the future. Moreover, these factors and genes may be potential target for therapeutic drugs."

The retrospective data analysis on isolates associated with pistachios was performed utilizing short-read and long-read sequencing technologies. The sequence data were analyzed using two methods: the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis and Whole Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (wgMLST). The year-long storage study evaluated the survival of five strains of Salmonella on pistachios stored at 25 °C at 35% and 54% relative humidity (RH). Our results demonstrate: i) evidence of persistent Salmonella Senftenberg and Salmonella Montevideo strains in pistachio environments, some of which may be due to clonal resident strains and some of which may be due to preharvest contamination; ii) presence of the Copper Homeostasis and Silver Resistance Island (CHASRI) in Salmonella Senftenberg and Montevideo strains in the pistachio supply chain; and iii) the use of metagenomic analysis is a novel tool for determining the composition of serovar survival in a cocktail inoculated storage study."
https://openalex.org/W3210763617,"High maternal mortality ratio in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been linked to inadequate medical care for pregnant women due to limited health facility delivery utilization. Thus, this study, examined the association between age at first childbirth and health facility delivery among women of reproductive age in Nigeria.The study used the most recent secondary dataset from Nigeria's Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) conducted in 2018. Only women aged15-49 were considered for the study (N = 34,193). Bi-variate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between age at first birth and place of delivery. The results were presented as crude odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.The results showed that the prevalence of health facility deliveries was 41% in Nigeria. Women who had their first birth below age 20 [aOR = 0.82; 95%(CI = 0.74-0.90)] were less likely to give birth at health facilities compared to those who had their first birth at age 20 and above.Our findings suggest the need to design interventions that will encourage women of reproductive age in Nigeria who are younger than 20 years to give birth in health facilities to avoid the risks of maternal complications associated with home delivery. Such interventions should include male involvement in antenatal care visits and the education of both partners and young women on the importance of health facility delivery."

Pea (Pisum sativum) is a nutritious pulse crop with potential to assist in tackling hidden hunger. Here we report seed ionomic data of 96 diverse pea accessions collected via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We found a 100 g serving of peas provides the following average percent daily value for U.S. recommendations: 8% Ca, 39% Mg, 73% Cu, 37% Fe, 63% Mn, 45% Zn, 28% K, and 43% P. Correlations were observed between the majority of minerals tested suggesting strong interrelationships between mineral concentration levels. Hierarchical clustering identified fifteen accessions with high-ranking mineral concentrations. Thirty accessions could be compared to earlier inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) data, which revealed significant differences particularly for elements at extreme low or high levels of accumulation. These results improve our understanding of the range of variation in mineral content found in peas and provide additional mineral data resources for germplasm selection."

X-ray images of lung become the key to the diagnosis of this disease, skilled doctors in the diagnosis of a certain degree of subjectivity, if the use of computer-aided medical diagnosis to automatically detect lung abnormalities, will improve the accuracy of diagnosis. This research aims to introduce a deep learning technology based on the combination of Xception neural network and long-term short-term memory (LSTM), which can realize automatic diagnosis of patients with pneumonia in X-ray images. First, the model uses the Xception network to extract the deep features of the data, passes the extracted features to the LSTM, and then the LSTM detects the extracted features, and finally selects the most needed features. Secondly, in the training set samples, the traditional cross-entropy loss cannot more balance the mismatch between categories. Therefore, this research combines Pearson's feature selection ideas, fusion of the correlation between the two loss functions, and optimizes the problem. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate of this paper is 96%, the receiver operator characteristic curve accuracy rate is 99%, the precision rate is 98%, the recall rate is 91%, and the F1 score accuracy rate is 94%. Compared with the existing technical methods, the research has achieved expected results on the currently available datasets.

https://openalex.org/W3208553368,"Nasal obstruction caused by nasal septal deviation is very bothersome and, therefore, can affect the patient's emotional state. However, little is known about the effect of nasal septal deviation (NSD) on the neuropsychiatric aspects of patients. Therefore, this study aims to verify the higher incidence of anxiety, depression, and migraine in patients diagnosed with NSD compared to general populations using big data.This retrospective cohort study collected subjects from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database. Adjustments were made to minimize the confounding of variables for age, sex, residence type, income levels, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis between the two groups. The primary endpoint of this study was newly diagnosed anxiety, depression, and migraine between January 2009 and December 2018. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, logarithmic rank test, and Cox proportional regression test were used for statistical analysis.Among a total of 135,769 subjects in the NHIS database, 48,495 patients with NSD (NSD group) and 54,475 control subjects (control group) were selected. Patients with NSD had an increased risk of anxiety, depression, and migraine compared to the control group. In the NSD group, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were 1.236 (95% CI, 1.198-1.276) for anxiety, 1.289 (95% CI, 1.238-1.343) for depression, and 1.251 (95% CI, 1.214-1.290) for migraine.NSD is associated with a higher incidence of anxiety, depression, and migraine. Therefore, it is suggested that physicians carefully consider psychoneurological distress and employ therapeutic strategies to minimize these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3208977195,"Anemia among children aged 6-59 months remains a major public health problem in low-and high-income countries including Ethiopia. Anemia is associated with significant consequences on the health of children such as under-five morbidity and mortality, increased risk of infection, and poor academic performance. The prevalence of anemia in Ethiopia has varied across areas. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the geographic weighted regression analysis of anemia and its associated factors among children aged 6-59 months in Ethiopia.This study was based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A total weighted sample of 8482 children aged 6-59 months was included. For the spatial analysis, Arc-GIS version 10.7 and SaTScan version 9.6 statistical software were used. Spatial regression was done to identify factors associated with the hotspots of anemia and model comparison was based on adjusted R2 and Corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc). For the associated factors, the multilevel robust Poisson regression was fitted since the prevalence of anemia was greater than 10%. Variables with a p-value < 0.2 in the bi-variable analysis were considered for the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable multilevel robust Poisson regression analysis, the adjusted prevalence ratio with the 95% confidence interval was reported to declare the statistical significance and strength of association.The prevalence of anemia among children aged 6-59 months was 57.56% (95%CI: 56.50%, 58.61%) with significant spatial variation across regions in Ethiopia. The significant hot spot areas of anemia among children aged 6-59 months were detected in the central, west, and east Afar, Somali, Dire Dawa, Harari, and northwest Gambella regions. Mothers who had anemia, a child aged 23-59 months, mothers aged 15-19 years, and coming from a household with a poorer or poorest household were significant predictors of the spatial variations of anemia among children aged 6-59 months. In the multilevel robust Poisson analysis, born to mothers aged 30-39 (APR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.92) and 40-49 years (APR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.83), mothers who didn't have formal education (APR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.20), Children in the poorest household wealth index (APR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29), being 4-6 (APR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.13) and above 6 order of birth (APR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.23), children born to anemic mothers (APR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.29), children aged 24-59 months (APR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.73), stunted children (APR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.13) and underweight children (APR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.13) were significantly associated with anemia among children aged 6-59 months.Anemia is still a public health problem for children in Ethiopia. Residing in a geographic area where a high proportion of children born to mothers aged 15-19 years, a child aged 6-23 months, coming from a household with poorer or poorest wealth index, and mothers with anemia increased the risk of experiencing anemia among children aged 6-59 months. Maternal education, maternal age, child age, household wealth, stunting, underweight, birth order, and maternal anemia were significant predictors of anemia among children. The detailed map of anemia hot spots among children aged 6-59 months and its predictors could assist program planners and decision-makers to design targeted public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3210091192,"Anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) will be diagnosed in an estimated 9,080 adults in the United States this year, and rates have been rising over the last several decades. Most people that develop anal SCC have associated human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (~85-95%), with approximately 5-15% of anal SCC cases occurring in HPV-negative patients from unknown etiology. This study identified and characterized the Kras-driven, female sex hormone-dependent development of anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the LSL-KrasG12D; Pdx1-Cre (KC) mouse model that is not dependent on papillomavirus infection. One hundred percent of female KC mice develop anal SCC, while no male KC mice develop tumors. Both male and female KC anal tissue express Pdx1 and Cre-recombinase mRNA, and the activated mutant KrasG12D gene. Although the driver gene mutation KrasG12D is present in anus of both sexes, only female KC mice develop Kras-mutant induced anal SCC. To understand the sex-dependent differences, KC male mice were castrated and KC female mice were ovariectomized. Castrated KC males displayed an unchanged phenotype with no anal tumor formation. In contrast, ovariectomized KC females demonstrated a marked reduction in anal SCC development, with only 15% developing anal SCC. Finally, exogenous administration of estrogen rescued the tumor development in ovariectomized KC female mice and induced tumor development in castrated KC males. These results confirm that the anal SCC is estrogen mediated. The delineation of the role of female sex hormones in mediating mutant Kras to drive anal SCC pathogenesis highlights a subtype of anal SCC that is independent of papillomavirus infection. These findings may have clinical applicability for the papillomavirus-negative subset of anal SCC patients that typically respond poorly to standard of care chemoradiation."

Binary logistic regression models with the response being a planned career in one of four medical specialties (internal medicine, pediatrics, OB/GYN, and general surgery/surgical specialties) at medical school entry and graduation. Regression models included demographics, student attitudes, debt, academic metrics, and medical school experiences.Comparatively, women were less likely to be interested in internal medicine and surgery and more interested in pediatrics and OB/GYN at matriculation. URiM students expressed more interest in OB/GYN and surgery when starting medical school. At graduation, women were less likely to plan for internal medicine and surgery and were more interested in pursuing OB/GYN and pediatrics. URiM students were more likely to plan for a career in internal medicine and less likely to choose pediatrics.From matriculation to graduation, women have relatively stable preferences regarding planned medical specialties. In contrast, URiM students' specialty plans shifted over time among the four specialties, with variation in preferences occurring between matriculation and graduation."

However, there are limited studies conducted to identify the risk factors of overweight and obesity in Ethiopia, especially among men. Therefore, this study aimed to assess individual and community level determinants of overweight and obesity among urban men in Ethiopia.This study used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A weighted sample of 2259 urban men aged 15-59 years were included in this analysis. A multilevel logistic regression model was used to assess the determinants of overweight and obesity among the study participants.Men aged 30-44 years old (AOR = 3.1, 95% CI: 2.3-4.11), 45-59 years old (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI: 3.4-6.9), married (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.2), with secondary education (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.6-4.7), with higher education (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI: 2.1-6.2), watching television at least once a week (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.7), being from high rich communities (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5-3.7), and living in three metropolises (Addis Ababa, Harari, Diredawa) were more likely to be overweight or obese (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-2.9). However, currently unemployed men were less likely to be overweight or obese (AOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.7).Being older age, being married, having higher educational status, having higher frequency of watching television, being residents of three metropolises (Addis Ababa, Harari, and Diredawa), and being from high rich communities were found to be predictors of overweight and obesity in Ethiopian men. Therefore, it is essential to design strategies and programs to reduce or prevent overweight and obesity with special focus on the identified risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3208080302,"A system to differentiate and quantify liquid and headspace vapor leaks from closed system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) is presented. CSTDs are designed to reduce or eliminate hazardous drug (HD) exposure risk when compounding and administering HDs. CSTDs may leak liquid, headspace, or a mixture of the two. The amount of HD contained in liquid and headspace leaks may be substantially different. Use of a test solution containing two VOCs with differences in ratios of VOC concentrations in the headspace and liquid enables source apportionment of leaked material. SIFT-MS was used to detect VOCs from liquid and headspace leaks in the vapor phase. Included in this report is a novel method to determine the origin and magnitude of leaks from CSTDs. A limit of leak detection of 24 μL of headspace vapor and 0.14 μL of test liquid were found using Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS)."
https://openalex.org/W3208180219,"Stent edge dissection (SED) is a well-known predictor of worse clinical outcomes. However, impact of SED after current-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation remains unknown since there was no study using only current-generation DES to assess impact of SED. This study aimed to investigate a relationship between SED detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and clinical outcomes after current-generation DES implantation.This study enrolled 175 patients receiving OCT after current-generation DES implantation. The SED group was compared with the non-SED group in terms of the primary study endpoints which was the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) composed of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (TV-MI), and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR).Of 175 patients, SED detected by OCT was observed in 32 patients, while 143 patients did not show SED. In the crude population, the SED group showed a significantly higher incidence of CD-TLR, definite stent thrombosis, TV-MI and cardiac death relative to the non-SED group. After adjustment by an inverse probability weighted methods, the SED group showed a significantly higher incidence of MACE compared with the non-SED group (hazard ratio 3.43, 95% confidence interval 1.09-10.81, p = 0.035). Fibrocalcific or lipidic plaques, greater lumen eccentricity, and stent-oversizing were the predictors of SED.SED detected by OCT after the current-generation DES implantation led to unfavorable outcomes. Aggressive post-dilatation around the stent edge might worse clinical outcomes due to SED, although achievement of optimal stent expansion is strongly encouraged to improve clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3208612757,"How can we limit wealth disparities while stimulating economic flows in sustainable societies? To examine the link between these concepts, we propose an econophysics asset exchange model with the surplus stock of the wealthy. The wealthy are one of the two exchange agents and have more assets than the poor. Our simulation model converts the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy to a new variable parameter alongside the saving rate and introduces the total exchange (flow) and rank correlation coefficient (metabolism) as new evaluation indexes, adding to the Gini index (disparities), thereby assessing both wealth distribution and the relationships among the disparities, flow, and metabolism. We show that these result in a gamma-like wealth distribution, and our model reveals a trade-off between limiting disparities and vitalizing the market. To limit disparities and increase flow and metabolism, we also find the need to restrain savings and use the wealthy surplus stock. This relationship is explicitly expressed in the new equation introduced herein. The insights gained by uncovering the root of disparities may present a persuasive case for investments in social security measures or social businesses involving stock redistribution or sharing."
https://openalex.org/W3209036206,"Large-scale conformational changes are essential for proteins to function properly. Given that these transition events rarely occur, however, it is challenging to comprehend their underlying mechanisms through experimental and theoretical approaches. In this study, we propose a new computational methodology called internal coordinate normal mode-guided elastic network interpolation (ICONGENI) to predict conformational transition pathways in proteins. Its basic approach is to sample intermediate conformations by interpolating the interatomic distance between two end-point conformations with the degrees of freedom constrained by the low-frequency dynamics afforded by normal mode analysis in internal coordinates. For validation of ICONGENI, it is applied to proteins that undergo open-closed transitions, and the simulation results (i.e., simulated transition pathways) are compared with those of another technique, to demonstrate that ICONGENI can explore highly reliable pathways in terms of thermal and chemical stability. Furthermore, we generate an ensemble of transition pathways through ICONGENI and investigate the possibility of using this method to reveal the transition mechanisms even when there are unknown metastable states on rough energy landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W3209207935,"Patients with hemoglobinopathies have been reported to have higher rates of pulmonary complications. Few studies have investigated the association between thalassemia and asthma in children.We used the data of one million individuals randomly selected from the Registry for Beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Research Database. One thalassemic child was matched with four control children without thalassemia according to sex, birth year, birth season, prematurity, and previous enteroviral infection.A total of 800 hundred thalassemic children and 3200 controls were included. Children with thalassemia had higher rates of developing asthma (41.81 vs 25.70 per 1000 person-years, P < 0.001) than the non-thalassemia controls with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-1.58). Boys in the thalassemia cohort had a significantly higher adjusted incidence hazard ratio (IRR) of asthma than those in the non-thalassemia cohort (adjusted IRR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.02-1.73). The risk of atopic and nonatopic asthma was higher in the thalassemia cohort than in the non-thalassemia cohort (IRR = 1.3, 1.61, respectively).Children with thalassemia were more likely to develop asthma. More attention should be paid to the early diagnosis of asthma and prevention of asthma attacks."

During MBCT, occurrence of AEs was monitored prospectively, systematically, and actively (n = 72). Patients who reported AEs were invited for semi-structured interviews after completing MBCT (n = 29). Interviews were analysed with directed content analysis, using an existing framework by Lindahl et al.AEs were reported by 29 patients, in seven of whom the experiences could not be attributed to MBCT during the interview. AEs were reported most frequently up to week 3 and declined afterwards. Baseline anxiety appeared to be a risk factor for developing AEs. Seven existing domains of AEs were observed: cognitive, perceptual, affective, somatic, conative, sense of self, and social. Influencing factors were subdivided into predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and mitigating factors. With hindsight, more than half of patients considered the reported AEs as therapeutic rather than harmful.Although the occurrence of AEs in MBCT for patients with BD is not rare, even in this population with severe mental illness they were not serious or had lasting bad effects. In fact, most of them were seen by the patients as being part of a therapeutic process, although some patients only experienced AEs as negative."
https://openalex.org/W3210269999,"The interaction of socio-demographic and ecological factors with Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection risk by age and the household clustering of infections between individuals are poorly understood.This study examined 1,832 individuals aged 5-90 years across 916 households in Mayuge District, Uganda. S. mansoni infection status and intensity were measured using Kato-Katz microscopy. Socio-demographic and ecological factors were examined as predictors of infection status and intensity using logistic and negative binomial regression models, respectively, with standard errors clustered by household. A subgroup analysis of children was conducted to examine the correlation of infection status between children and their caretakers.Infection varied within age groups based on the distance to Lake Victoria. Children aged 9-17 years and young adults aged 18-29 years who lived ≤0.50km from Lake Victoria were more likely to be infected compared to individuals of the same age who lived further away from the lake. Infections clustered within households. Children whose caretakers were heavily infected were 2.67 times more likely to be infected.These findings demonstrate the focality of schistosome transmission and its dependence on socio-demographic, ecological and household factors. Future research should investigate the sampling of households within communities as a means of progressing towards precision mapping of S. mansoni infections."

Proposals submitted to the MSCA actions awere subject to the Ethics Appraisal Procedure. In this work we explored the ethics appraisal procedure in MSCA H2020.Using a retrospective analysis of pooled anonymized data, we explored the ethics appraisal procedure on proposals submitted to Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) during the entire Horizon 2020 program period (N = 79,670).Our results showed that one of the most frequently identified ethics categories was Data protection. We also detected slight differences between applicants' and the ethics reviewers' awareness of ethical issues. Trajectory analysis of all ethics screened proposals appearing on main lists showed that a minimal portion of all screened submissions required additional ethics checks in the project implementation phase.Personal data protection is one of the most represented ethics categories indicated among MSCA actions which exhaust ethics assessment efforts and may lead to ""overkills"" in ethics requirements. Excluding the majority of personal data protection assessment from the ethics assessment, except for parts which are directly related to ethics like ""Informed consent procedures"", might be necessary in the future. A gap in understanding of ethics issues between applicants and reviewers' points to the necessity to further educate researchers on research ethics issues."
https://openalex.org/W3210874184,"When emerging technologies transform an organization's way of working, explorative business process management (BPM) becomes a new challenge. Although digital innovations can boost process efficacy and business productivity, employees do not necessarily accept the implied work changes. We therefore looked at the increased digitalization efforts during the COVID-19 lockdowns, during which employees were forced to drastically rethink work by heavily depending on technology for communication and almost all business tasks. This global setting allowed us to scrutinize disruptive work changes and how employees can cope with disruptive work adaptations. We also looked into the explorative skillset needed to adapt to these changes. To theorize about an explorative BPM acceptance model, eleven hypotheses were supported based on a solid theoretical foundation. We followed a quantitative research design using partial least squares for structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) at the university administration settings in two regions, including purposive sampling. Data analysis covered both a measurement model assessment and structural model assessment. Our findings reveal that employees' perceived work modalities, feeling creative and feeling flexible are more promising features than perceived influence and attitude related to explorative work and skill development. We also offer novel insights into explorative business process management (BPM) skills, and which skills are more productive in uncertain or dynamic working conditions. This research is a learning path for managers struggling with flexible or competitive business environments, and more specifically to facilitate employee willingness."

It is well characterized in several plants such as Arabidopsis and rice however the knowledge about MAPKKKs in tea plant is largely unknown. In the present study, MAPKKK genes of tea were obtained through a genome wide search using Arabidopsis thaliana as the reference genome. Among 59 candidate MAPKKK genes in tea, 17 genes were MEKK-like, 31 genes were Raf-like and 11 genes were ZIK- like. Additionally, phylogenetic relationships were established along with structural analysis, which includes gene structure, its location as well as conserved motifs, cis-acting regulatory elements and functional domain signatures that were systematically examined. Also, on the basis of one orthologous gene found between tea and Arabidopsis, functional interaction was carried out in C. sinensis based on an Arabidopsis association model. The expressional profiles indicated major involvement of MAPKKK genes from tea in response to various abiotic stress factors. Taken together, this study provides the targets for additional inclusive identification, functional study, and provides comprehensive knowledge for a better understanding of the MAPKKK cascade regulatory network in C. sinensis."
https://openalex.org/W3208227320,"In population genetics, the amount of information for an analytical task is governed by the number of individuals sampled and the amount of genetic information measured on each of those individuals. In this work, we assessed the numbers of individual yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and genetic markers required for ocean-basin scale inferences. We assessed this for three distinct data analysis tasks that are often employed: testing for differences between genetic profiles; stock delineation, and; assignment of individuals to stocks. For all analytical tasks, we used real (not simulated) data from four sampling locations that span the tropical Pacific Ocean. Whilst spatially separated, the genetic differences between the sampling sites were not substantial, a maximum of approximately Fst = 0.02, which is quite typical of large pelagic fish. We repeatedly sub-sampled the data, mimicking a new survey, and performed the analyses. False positive rates were also assessed by re-sampling and randomly assigning fish to groups. Varying the sample sizes indicated that some analytical tasks, namely profile testing, required relatively few individuals per sampling location (n ≳ 10) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, m ≳ 256). Stock delineation required more individuals per sampling location (n ≳ 25). Assignment of fish to sampling locations required substantially more individuals, more in fact than we had available (n > 50), although this sample size could be reduced to n ≳ 30 when individual fish were assumed to belong to one of the groups sampled. With these results, designers of molecular ecological surveys for yellowfin tuna, and users of information from them, can assess whether the information content is adequate for the required inferential task."
https://openalex.org/W3208650064,"Early childhood is a vital part of human life because most of the brain developments occur in this particular period. Early childhood disability is a significant global public health burden, which can negatively impact the children's quality of life and their overall productivity. It is also a major social and economic problem in Bangladesh. Therefore, it is very important to understand the associated factors for early childhood disability, which may help disability prevention, better management and policy formulation. The main objective of this study is to investigate the child, family, and community-level factors associated with early childhood disability in Bangladesh.A cross sectional nationally representative data was derived from Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), 2019. A total of 14,072 Bangladeshi children under five years of age were selected for this study. Various types of statistical analysis (simple, bivariate, multivariable) were performed. To assess the bivariate relationship between chosen categorical variables (independent) and early childhood disability (dependent), a chi-square test was used. The multivariable ordinal logistic regression was used to find out the association of disability with child, family, and community-level factors.The results show that 2.0% of the children have at least one disability and 0.8% have more disabilities. Several factors namely not attending in early childhood education [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13-1.17 Ρ = 0.01], having mother's functional difficulty (OR = 1.23; 95% (CI) = 0.58-1.88 Ρ <0.001), unhappy mother's life (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.30-1.39 Ρ <0.001), parents without internet access (OR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.06-1.29 Ρ = 0.03) and parents using mobile phone (OR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.09-0.95 Ρ = 0.02) were found to be important for early childhood disability in Bangladesh.Early childhood disability is still neglected in Bangladesh and further epidemiological studies are recommended. The findings of this study may help policy makers and relevant stakeholders to develop interventions for reducing the overall burden of early childhood disability."
https://openalex.org/W3208949653,"Background Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a valid, scalable biomarker of stress. We aimed to examine associations between HRV and psychosocial outcomes in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. Methods This was a secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial testing a resilience intervention in AYAs with cancer. Two widely used HRV metrics, the standard deviation of normal to normal beats (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were derived from electrocardiograms. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) survey measures included quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and resilience. Linear regression models were used to test associations between HRV and PRO scores. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test differences in median HRV values among participant subgroups. Results Among the n = 76 patients with available electrocardiograms, the mean age was 16 years (SD 3y), 63% were white, and leukemia/lymphoma was the most common diagnosis. Compared to healthy adolescents, AYAs with cancer had lower median HRV (SDNN [Females: 31.9 (12.8–50.7) vs 66.4 (46.0–86.8), p&lt;0.01; Males: 29.9 (11.5–47.9) vs 63.2 (48.4–84.6), p&lt;0.01]; RMSSD [Females: 28.2 (11.1–45.5) vs 69.0 (49.1–99.6), p&lt;0.01; Males: 27.9 (8.6–48.6) vs 58.7 (44.8–88.2), p&lt;0.01]). There was no statistically significant association between PRO measures and SDNN or RMSSD in either an unadjusted or adjusted linear regression models. Conclusion In this secondary analysis, we did not find an association between HRV and psychosocial PROs among AYAs with cancer. HRV measures were lower than for healthy adolescents. Larger prospective studies in AYA biopsychosocial research are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3209161311,"A lack of comparative data across laboratories is often a barrier to the uptake and adoption of new technologies. Furthermore, data generated by different immunoassay methods may be incomparable due to a lack of harmonization. In this multicenter study, we describe validation experiments conducted in a single lab and cross-lab comparisons of assay results to assess the performance characteristics of the Q-plex™ 7-plex Human Micronutrient Array (7-plex), an immunoassay that simultaneously quantifies seven biomarkers associated with micronutrient (MN) deficiencies, inflammation and malarial antigenemia using plasma or serum; alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein, ferritin, histidine-rich protein 2, retinol binding protein 4, soluble transferrin receptor, and thyroglobulin. Validations included repeated testing (n = 20 separately prepared experiments on 10 assay plates) in a single lab to assess precision and linearity. Seven independent laboratories tested 76 identical heparin plasma samples collected from a cohort of pregnant women in Niger using the same 7-plex assay to assess differences in results across laboratories. In the analytical validation experiments, intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were acceptable at <6% and <15% respectively and assay linearity was 96% to 99% with the exception of ferritin, which had marginal performance in some tests. Cross-laboratory comparisons showed generally good agreement between laboratories in all analyte results for the panel of 76 plasma specimens, with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values averaging ≥0.8 for all analytes. Excluding plates that would fail routine quality control (QC) standards, the inter-assay variation was acceptable for all analytes except sTfR, which had an average inter-assay coefficient of variation of ≥20%. This initial cross-laboratory study demonstrates that the 7-plex test protocol can be implemented by users with some experience in immunoassay methods, but familiarity with the multiplexed protocol was not essential."

https://openalex.org/W3210057932,"Microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses challenge the food industry; however, environmental studies of these microorganisms on raw grain, prior to food processing, are uncommon. Bacillus cereus sensu lato is a diverse group of bacteria that is common in our everyday environment and occupy a wide array of niches. While some of these bacteria are beneficial to agriculture due to their entomopathogenic properties, others can cause foodborne illness; therefore, characterization of these bacteria is important from both agricultural and food safety standpoints. We performed a survey of wheat and flax grain samples in 2018 (n = 508) and 2017 (n = 636) and discovered that B. cereus was present in the majority of grain samples, as 56.3% and 85.2%, in two years respectively. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genomics of 109 presumptive B. cereus isolates indicates that most of the isolates were closely related and formed two genetically distinct groups. Comparisons to the available genomes of reference strains suggested that the members of these two groups are not closely related to strains previously reported to cause foodborne illness. From the same data set, another, genetically more diverse group of B. cereus was inferred, which had varying levels of similarity to previously reported strains that caused disease. Genomic analysis and PCR amplification of genes linked to toxin production indicated that most of the isolates carry the genes nheA and hbID, while other toxin genes and gene clusters, such as ces, were infrequent. This report of B. cereus on grain from Canada is the first of its kind and demonstrates the value of surveillance of bacteria naturally associated with raw agricultural commodities such as cereal grain and oilseeds."
https://openalex.org/W3210347378,"Chronic conditions are prolonged and complex, leading patients to seek multiple forms of care alongside conventional treatment, including complementary medicine (CM). These multiple forms of care are often used concomitantly, requiring patient-provider communication about treatments used in order to manage potential risks. In response, this study describes rates and reasons for disclosure/non-disclosure of conventional medicine use to CM practitioners, and CM use to medical doctors, by individuals with chronic conditions. A survey was conducted online in July and August 2017 amongst the Australian adult population. Participants with chronic conditions were asked about their disclosure-related communication with CM practitioners (massage therapist, chiropractor, acupuncturist, naturopath) and medical doctors. Patients consulting different professions reported varying disclosure rates and reasons. Full disclosure (disclosed ALL) to medical doctors was higher (62.7%-79.5%) than full disclosure to CM practitioners (41.2%-56.9%). The most strongly reported reason for disclosing to both MDs and CM practitioners was I wanted them to fully understand my health status, while for non-disclosure it was They did not ask me about my CM/medicine use. Reasons regarding concerns or expectations around the consultation or patient-provider relationship were also influential. The findings suggest that patient disclosure of treatment use in clinical consultation for chronic conditions may be improved through patient education about its importance, direct provider inquiry, and supportive patient-provider partnerships. Provision of optimal patient care for those with chronic conditions requires greater attention to patient-provider communication surrounding patients' wider care and treatment use."

While 18.6% reported some discomfort experienced with the collection process, 72.2% stated that they would be willing to test weekly if enrolled in a long-term study.High engagement and positive feedback from participants, as well as the quality of self-collected specimens, point to the usefulness of this fully remote, self-collection-based study design for future safer and efficient population-level serological surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3210943721,"Pain's disruptive effects on cognition are well documented. The seminal goal-pursuit account of pain suggests that cognitive disruption is less likely if participants are motivated to attended to a focal goal and not a pain goal.Existing theory is unclear about the conceptualisation and operationalisation of 'focal goal'. This study aims to clarify how goals should be conceptualised and further seeks to test the theory of the goal-pursuit account.In a pre-registered laboratory experiment, 56 participants completed an arithmetic task in high-reward/low-reward and pain/control conditions. Pain was induced via cold-water immersion.High levels of reported effort exertion predicted cognitive-task performance, whereas desire for rewards did not. Post-hoc analyses further suggest that additional effort in the pain condition compensated for pain's disruptive effects, but when this extra effort was not exerted, performance deficits were observed in pain, compared to control, conditions.Results suggest that 'motivation', or commitment to a focal goal, is best understood as effort exertion and not as a positive desire to achieve a goal. These results solidify existing theory and aid researchers in operationalising these constructs."
https://openalex.org/W3208347542,"This study examines the relationship between women's prospective fertility intentions and child health, measured via access to healthcare facilities for children and postpartum maternal behaviors that are indicative of future child health. We analyze two waves of nationally representative data (2005 and 2012) from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS). The analytic sample includes 3,442 non-pregnant, currently married women aged 18-40 in 2005 who participated in both rounds of the IHDS, and had at least one birth between 2005 and 2012. We investigate the influence of women's prospective fertility intentions on access to benefits from the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), indicators of breastfeeding as recommended by the World Health Organization, and official documentation of births via birth certificates or registration. We find that 58 percent of births among women in the sample were labeled as unwanted. We use an adaptation of propensity score matching-the inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) estimator-and show that, after accounting for maternal and household characteristics that are known to be associated with maternal and child health, children who resulted from unwanted births were less likely to obtain any benefits or immunizations from the ICDS, to be breastfed within one hour of birth, and to have an official birth certificate. Results from this study have direct policy significance given the evidence that women's fertility intentions can have negative implications for child health and wellbeing in the short and longer term."
https://openalex.org/W3208768830,"The rise of digital media has increased the opportunities for individuals to self-select political content online. This development has stimulated empirical research on how people select political information, especially when political beliefs are at stake. In the present paper, we tested a series of theory-derived assumptions about antecedents and consequences of selective exposure to confirmative political information and opinions in the digital arena. We conducted an online survey with German Internet users (N = 897, April 2016) and assessed political attitudes, media use and general beliefs in the context of the so-called ""migration crisis"". 28% of the participants in our sample reported exposure to a confirmative information environment. They are more likely to hear or read about political opinions on migration and political asylum that are similar to their own compared to cross-cutting content. We found no evidence for the assumption that the technological affordances of the Internet foster this form of selective political exposure. Instead, our analyses indicate that conservatism is a positive predictor of selecting confirmative information environments when it comes to migration and political asylum. We also gathered evidence that this relation is mediated by perceived threat and that selective political exposure is linked to truly false consensus beliefs. Our findings inform supply- and demand-side explanations of selective political exposure online. We discuss the relevance for psychological theories about the motivational underpinnings of selective exposure."

Our results show that, unlike the effect of the cultural drift where the noise is just controlled by an external parameter, the intrinsic noise never allows the system to reach a frozen state in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we show that when the intrinsic noise affects the agents’ variables, the system’s behaviour is also different from the case when it affects the network of their interactions."

https://openalex.org/W3210880528,"The first case of COVID-19 in Nigeria was recorded on February 27, 2020, being an imported case by an Italian expatriate, to the country. Since then, there has been steady increase in the number of cases. However, the number of cases in Nigeria is low in comparison to cases reported by other countries with similar large populations, despite the poor health system prevailing in the country. This has been mainly attributed to the low testing capacity in Nigeria among other factors. Therefore, there is a need for innovative ways to increase the number of persons testing for COVID-19. The aim of the study was to pilot a nasopharyngeal swab self-sample collection model that would help increase COVID-19 testing while ensuring minimal person-to-person contact being experienced at the testing center. 216 participants took part in this study which was carried out at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research between June and July 2020. Amongst the 216 participants, 174 tested negatives for both self-collected samples and samples collected by Professionals, 30 tested positive for both arms, with discrepancies occurring in 6 samples where the self-collected samples were positive while the ones collected by the professionals were negative. The same occurred in another set of 6 samples with the self-collected samples being negative and the professional-collected sample coming out positive, with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 96.7%. The results of the interrater analysis are Kappa = 0.800 (95% CI, 0.690 to 0.910) which implies an outstanding agreement between the two COVID-19 sampling methods. Furthermore, since p< 0.001 Kappa (k) coefficient is statistically different from zero, our findings have shown that self-collected samples can be reliable in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3211041403,"Early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients have a one-in-four risk of regional metastasis (LN+), which is also the most significant prognostic factor for survival. As there are no validated biomarkers for predicting LN+ in early-stage OSCC, elective neck dissection often leads to over-treatment and under-treatment. We present a machine-learning-based model using the quantitative nuclear phenotype of cancer cells from the primary tumor to predict the risk of nodal disease.Tumor specimens were obtained from 35 patients diagnosed with primary OSCC and received surgery with curative intent. Of the 35 patients, 29 had well (G1) or moderately (G2) differentiated tumors, and six had poorly differentiated tumors. From each, two consecutive sections were stained for hematoxylin & eosin and Feulgen-thionin staining. The slides were scanned, and images were processed to curate nuclear morphometric features for each nucleus, measuring nuclear morphology, DNA amount, and chromatin texture/organization. The nuclei (n = 384,041) from 15 G1 and 14 G2 tumors were randomly split into 80% training and 20% test set to build the predictive model by using Random Forest (RF) analysis which give each tumor cell a score, NRS. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was 99.6% and 90.7% for the training and test sets, respectively. At the cutoff score of 0.5 as the median NRS of each region of interest (n = 481), the AUC was 95.1%. We then developed a patient-level model based on the percentage of cells with an NRS ≥ 0.5. The prediction performance showed AUC of 97.7% among the 80% (n = 23 patient) training set and with the cutoff of 61% positive cells achieved 100% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. When applying the 61% cutoff to the 20% test set patients, the model achieved 100% accuracy.Our findings may have a clinical impact with an easy, accurate, and objective biomarker from routine pathology tissue, providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve neck management decisions in early-stage OSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3211282468,"Despite substantial literature on the effect of empathy on parenting, empathy research has historically suffered from definitional and methodological limitations. Parental empathy can be characterized as parents' ability to recognize, take the perspective of, and appropriately react to children's emotions. Current parental empathy assessment largely relies on self-report measures of dispositional empathy, but many argue parental empathy is distinct from dispositional empathy. Despite efforts to measure parental empathy implicitly, such analog approaches are labor intensive. The current report describes the preliminary development of the Empathy Measure for Parents Analog Task (EMPAT), two novel analog measures of parental empathy: one EMPAT analog uses audio stimuli and a second version uses written evocative scripts. After piloting with a sample of undergraduate students (Study 1), the measures were then administered to a sample of 212 parents (Study 2). For each study, the accuracy of the audio and script stimuli were first confirmed by examination of frequency distributions, then exploratory factor analyses were conducted to determine factor structure for each emotion subscale (i.e., Happy, Mad, Sad, Scared), and finally the composition of each emotion subscale was confirmed with scale reliability analyses. Correlations between each EMPAT version and measures of dispositional empathy, parental empathy, and positive parenting indicators were examined to assess the initial validity of the EMPAT measures. The new analog tasks demonstrated good reliability as well as preliminary evidence of validity, with potential utility in assessing cognitive elements of empathy in particular. With continued efforts to examine measure validity, the implications of these studies suggest the EMPAT tasks show promise in providing improved implicit, efficient assessments of child-directed empathy, which may be important for understanding positive and problematic parenting."

The results demonstrated that although the scientist were recognized for their contributions to science and technology, the majority of recipients were not prolific researchers, and some were not influential. Notably, one scientist had not been granted a single patent. This indicated that scientific and technological contributions may not necessarily correspond with influential scientific publications and patents. Moreover, only two scientists had filed for patents before publishing, and they also invested more time developing technological inventions. Most recipients were science- or technology-oriented scientists. Few scientists balanced their publishing and patenting activities, and demonstrated excellent research and technology performance."
https://openalex.org/W3207990146,"Dynamical systems can be subject to critical transitions where a system's state abruptly shifts from one stable equilibrium to another. To a certain extent such transitions can be predicted with a set of methods known as early warning signals. These methods are often developed and tested on systems simulated with equation-based approaches that focus on the aggregate dynamics of a system. Many ecological phenomena however seem to necessitate the consideration of a system's micro-level interactions since only there the actual reasons for sudden state transitions become apparent. Agent-based approaches that simulate systems from the bottom up by explicitly focusing on these micro-level interactions have only rarely been used in such investigations. This study compares the performance of a bifurcation estimation method for predicting state transitions when applied to data from an equation-based and an agent-based version of the Ising-model. The results show that the method can be applied to agent-based models and, despite its greater stochasticity, can provide useful predictions about state changes in complex systems."

The aniseikonia and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area showed no significant postoperative changes in any of the EIFL stages. Both preoperatively and during 6 months after surgery, the EIFL stage showed a significant correlation with BCVA (P ≤ 0.033), metamorphopsia (P ≤ 0.008), central macular thickness (P < 0.001), and FAZ parameters (P ≤ 0.016) at each time point, but not with aniseikonia. Significant correlations of EIFL thickness with BCVA (P = 0.028) and metamorphopsia (P = 0.006) before surgery were not persistent after surgery.Both pre- and postoperatively, the staging of EIFL, rather than its thickness, is a simple and adequate surrogate marker for visual acuity and metamorphopsia in eyes with idiopathic ERM."
https://openalex.org/W3208125290,"Pre-pubertal murine models of acute colitis are lacking. Magnetic resonance colonography (MRC) is a promising minimally invasive tool to assess colitis. We aimed to: 1/ Adapt a model of acute experimental colitis to pre-pubertal rats and determine whether MRC characteristics correlate with histological inflammation. 2/ Test this model by administering a diet supplemented in transforming growth factor β2 to reverse inflammation. Twenty-four rats were randomized at weaning to one of 3 groups: Trinitrobenzene Sulfonic Acid (TNBS) group (n = 8) fed a standard diet, that received an intra-rectal 60 mg/kg dose of TNBS-ethanol; Control group (n = 8) fed standard diet, that received a dose of intra-rectal PBS; TNBS+MODULEN group (n = 8) that received a dose of TNBS and were exclusively fed MODULEN-IBD® after induction of colitis. One week after induction of colitis, rats were assessed by MRC, colon histopathology and inflammation markers (Interleukin 1β, Tumor necrosis factor α, Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 and Cyclooxygenase 2). TNBS induced typical features of acute colitis on histopathology and MRC (increased colon wall thickness, increased colon intensity on T2-weighted images, target sign, ulcers). Treatment with MODULEN-IBD® did not reduce signs of colitis on MRC. Inflammatory marker expression did not differ among study groups."
https://openalex.org/W3208543301,"According to 2016 official estimates, almost 60% of the rural population in Mexico (16.9 million people) had income levels below the poverty line, and approximately 29.2% (8.3 million) could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most poverty research disregards gender and exclusively analyzes average income or the expected probability of being poor, we depart from these approaches by examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families. Focusing on identifying heterogeneous effects according to the sex of the household head, we apply additive quantile models to a cross-sectional dataset containing information on 4,434 women-headed and 14,877 men-headed households. For each model, we introduce 45 variables at the individual/household, community, and regional levels. Two major contributions emerge from this paper. First, the identification of a subset of significant factors whose effect is independent of the head’s sex and is relevant for poor and extremely poor families. This is found for the variables credit card ownership, access to basic housing services, education level, and satisfaction with public services. Second, results also identify a subset of significant factors with an uneven effect on income according to the sex of the head that is observed both in the poor and extremely poor households. Variables having this gendered effect are the community’s income inequality, municipal human development, social networks, access to social security, and gender-based violence against women in the public sphere. Out of these, particularly relevant is the effect of the last three factors, whose association with income has not been explored before for rural Mexico and for which the bias among sexes increases as family income grows from extreme poverty to poverty level."
https://openalex.org/W3208770605,"There is a substantial burden of respiratory disease in infants in the sub-Saharan Africa region. Many health care providers (HCPs) that initially receive infants with respiratory distress may not be adequately skilled to differentiate between mild, moderate and severe respiratory symptoms, which may contribute to poor management and outcome. Therefore, respiratory severity scores have the potential to contributing to address this gap.to field-test the use of two existing standardized bronchiolitis severity scores (LIBSS and ReSViNET) in a population of Rwandan infants (1-12 months) presenting with respiratory illnesses to urban, tertiary, pediatric hospitals and to assess the severity of respiratory distress in these infants and the treatments used.A cross-sectional, validation study, was conducted in four tertiary hospitals in Rwanda. Infants presenting with difficulty in breathing were included. The LIBSS and ReSViNET scores were independently employed by nurses and residents to assess the severity of disease in each infant.100 infants were recruited with a mean age of seven months. Infants presented with pneumonia (n = 51), bronchiolitis (n = 36) and other infectious respiratory illnesses (n = 13). Thirty-three infants had severe disease and survival was 94% using nurse applied LIBSS. Regarding inter-rater reliability, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for LIBSS and ReSViNET between nurses and residents was 0.985 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99) and 0.980 (0.97-0.99). The convergent validity (Pearson's correlation) between LIBSS and ReSViNET for nurses and residents was R = 0.836 (p<0.001) and R = 0.815 (p<0.001). The area under the Receiver Operator Curve (aROC) for admission to PICU or HDU was 0.956 (CI: 0.92-0.99, p<0.001) and 0.880 (CI: 0.80-0.96, p<0.001) for nurse completed LIBSS and ReSViNET respectively.LIBSS and ReSViNET were designed for infants with bronchiolitis in resource-rich settings. Both LIBSS and ReSViNET demonstrated good reliability and validity results, in this cohort of patients presenting to tertiary level hospitals. This early data demonstrate that these two scores have the potential to be used in conjunction with clinical reasoning to identify infants at increased risk of clinical deterioration and allow timely admission, treatment escalation and therefore support resource allocation in Rwanda."
https://openalex.org/W3209041294,"Many older adults have difficulty seeing brief visual stimuli which younger adults can easily recognize. The primary visual cortex (V1) may induce this difficulty. However, in neuroimaging studies, the V1 response change to the increase of temporal frequency of visual stimulus in older adults was unclear. Here we investigated the association between the temporal frequency of flickering stimuli and the BOLD activity within V1 in older adults, using surface-based fMRI analysis. The fMRI data from 29 healthy older participants stimulated by contrast-reversing checkerboard at temporal flicker frequencies of 2, 4, and 8 Hz were obtained. The participants also performed a useful field of view (UFOV) test. The slope coefficient of BOLD activity regarding the temporal frequency of the visual stimulus averaged within V1 regions of interest was positive and significantly different from zero. Group analysis in the V1 showed significant clusters with positive slope and no significant clusters with a negative slope. The correlation coefficient between the slope coefficient and UFOV performance was not significant. The results indicated that V1 BOLD response to a flickering visual stimulus increases as the stimulus temporal frequency increases from 2 to 8 Hz in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3210090631,"Anthrax is the highest-ranked priority zoonotic disease in Kenya with about ten human cases annually. Anthrax outbreak was reported in Kisumu East Sub County after some villagers slaughtered and ate beef from a cow suspected to have died of anthrax. We aimed at establishing the magnitude of the outbreak, described associated factors, and assessed community knowledge, attitude, and practices on anthrax.We reviewed human and animal records, conducted case search and contact tracing using standard case definitions in the period from July 1through to July 28, 2019. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess community knowledge, attitude, and practices towards anthrax. The household selection was done using multistage sampling. We cleaned and analyzed data in Ms. Excel and Epi Info. Descriptive statistics were carried out for continuous and categorical variables while analytical statistics for the association between dependent and independent variables were calculated.Out of 53 persons exposed through consumption or contact with suspicious beef, 23 cases (confirmed: 1, probable: 4, suspected: 18) were reviewed. The proportion of females was 52.17% (12/23), median age 13.5 years and range 45 years. The attack rate was 43.4% (23/53) and the case fatality rate was 4.35% (1/23). Knowledge level, determined by dividing those considered to be 'having good knowledge' on anthrax (numerator) by the total number of respondents (denominator) in the population regarding cause, transmission, symptoms and prevention was 51% for human anthrax and 52% for animal anthrax. Having good knowledge on anthrax was associated with rural residence [OR = 5.5 (95% CI 2.1-14.4; p<0.001)], having seen a case of anthrax [OR = 6.2 (95% CI 2.8-14.2; p<0.001)] and among those who present cattle for vaccination [OR = 2.6 (95% CI 1.2-5.6; p = 0.02)]. About 23.2% (26/112) would slaughter and sell beef to neighbors while 63.4% (71/112) would bury or burn the carcass. Nearly 93.8% (105/112) believed vaccination prevents anthrax. However, 5.4% (62/112) present livestock for vaccination.Most anthrax exposures were through meat consumption. Poor knowledge of the disease might hamper prevention and control efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3210474887,"Chagas disease remains a major cause of cardiovascular death in endemic areas. Focused echocardiography (FoCUS) is a point-of-care means of assessing cardiac function which can be useful for the diagnosis of cardiac involvement.This study aims evaluating the characteristics of validity and reliability of FoCUS applied on Chagas disease patients.Patients with Chagas disease coming from an endemic area were selected from a large cohort (SaMi-Trop). A simplified echocardiogram with only three images was extracted from the conventional echocardiogram performed in this cohort. The images were evaluated by an observer who was blinded to the clinical and echocardiographic data, to determine the accuracy and reliability of FoCUS for cardiac assessment. The analysis constituted of 5 prespecified variables, dichotomized in absence or presence: left ventricular (LV) size and systolic function, right ventricular (RV) size and systolic function, and LV aneurysm.We included 725 patients with a mean age of 63.4 ± 12.3 years, 483 (67%) female. Abnormal electrocardiogram was observed in 81.5% of the patients. Left and right ventricular dysfunctions were found in 103 (14%) and 49 (7%) of the patients, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 84%, 94%, 70% and 97% for LV enlargement and 81%, 93%, 68% and 97% for LV systolic dysfunction, respectively, and 46%, 99%, 60% and 98% for RV dilatation, and 37%, 100%, 100% and 96% for RV dysfunction, respectively. Inter and intraobserver agreement were 61% and 87% for LV enlargement and 63% and 92% for LV dysfunction, respectively, and 50% and 49% for RV size and 46% and 79% for RV dysfunction, respectively. LV apical aneurysm was found in 45 patients (6.2%) with the lowest sensitivity of FoCUS study (11%; 95% CI 2-28%).FoCUS showed satisfactory values of validity and reliability for assessment of cardiac chambers in patients with Chagas disease, except for apical aneurysm. This tool can identify heart disease with potential impact on patient management in the limited-resource setting."
