https://openalex.org/W2989222487,"Background Articular cartilage (AC) is mainly composed of water, type II collagen, proteoglycans (PGs) and chondrocytes. The amount of PGs in AC is routinely quantified with digital densitometry (DD) from Safranin O-stained sections, but it is unclear whether similar method could be used for collagens. Objective The aim of this study was to clarify whether collagens can be quantified from histological AC sections using DD. Material and methods Sixteen human AC samples were stained with Masson’s trichrome or Picrosirius red. Optical densities of histological stains were compared to two commonly used collagen parameters (amide I and collagen CH2 side chain peak at 1338cm-1) measured using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging. Results Optical density of Modified Masson’s trichrome staining, which included enzymatic removal of PGs before staining, correlated significantly with FTIR-derived collagen parameters at almost all depths of cartilage. The other studied staining protocols displayed significant correlations with the reference parameters at only few depth layers. Conclusions Based on our findings, modified Masson’s trichrome staining protocol is suitable for quantification of AC collagen content. Enzymatic removal of PGs prior to staining is critical as us allows better staining of the collagen. Further optimization of staining protocols may improve the results in the future studies."

Addressing barriers and augmenting facilitators to take-home naloxone (THN) access and administration could expand program reach in preventing fatal overdoses. Methods THN access (i.e., being prescribed or receiving THN) was assessed in a Baltimore, Maryland-based sample of 577 people who use opioids (PWUO) and had a history of injecting drugs. A sub-analysis examined correlates of THN administration among those with THN access and who witnessed an overdose (N = 345). Logistic generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors were used to identify facilitators and barriers to accessing and using THN. Results The majority of PWUO (66%) reported THN access. In the multivariable model, decreased THN access was associated with the fear that a person may become aggressive after being revived with THN (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35–0.85), police threaten people at an overdose event (aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.36–1.00), and insufficient overdose training (aOR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28–0.68). Enrollment in medication-assisted treatment, personally experiencing an overdose, and graduating from high school were associated with higher access. About half (49%) of PWUO with THN access and who had witnessed an overdose reported having administered THN. THN use was positively associated with “often” or “always” carrying THN (aOR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.99–6.06), witnessing more overdoses (aOR:5.18, 95% CI: 2.22–12.07), experiencing recent homelessness, and injecting in the past year. THN use was reduced among participants who did not feel that they had sufficient overdose training (aOR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32–0.96). Conclusion THN programs must bolster confidence in administering THN and address barriers to use, such as fear of a THN recipient becoming aggressive. Normative change around carrying THN is an important component in an overdose prevention strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2985688410,"Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to enhance postural stability during stimulation, and the enhancing effect has been observed to persist for several hours post-stimulation. However, these effects were observed without proper control (sham condition) and the possibility of experimental bias has not been ruled out. The lasting effect of nGVS on postural stability therefore remains in doubt. We investigated the lasting effect of nGVS on postural stability using a control (sham) condition to confirm or infirm the possibility of experimental bias. 28 participants received either nGVS or a sham stimulation. Static postural control was examined before stimulation, immediately after 30 minutes of nGVS and one-hour post-stimulation. Results showed a significant improvement of sway velocity (p<0.05) and path length (p<0.05) was observed following nGVS, as previously shown. A similar improvement of sway velocity (p<0.05) and path length (p<0.05) was observed in sham group and no significant difference was found between nGVS group and sham group (p>0.05), suggesting that the observed postural improvement in nGVS could be due to a learning effect. This finding suggests the presence of experimental bias in the nGVS effect on postural stability, and highlights the need to use a sham condition in the exploration of the nGVS effect so as to disentangle the direct effect of the electrical stimulation from a learning effect. Furthermore, numerous parameters and populations need to be tested in order to confirm or infirm the presence of a real long-lasting effect of nGVS on postural stability."
https://openalex.org/W2983873775,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that is associated with lupus nephritis, initiated by the deposition of immune complexes in the kidney; subsequently, this induces the overexpression of cytokines. Lupus nephritis is known as one of the major clinical manifestations that affect the disease severity in SLE patients. An increased number of resident periglomerular and immune cells in the kidney has the potential to affect the equilibrium of different immune cell subsets, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tregs, which may be central to the induction of tissue damage in kidney by exerting either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects, or both. This equilibrium has yet to be confirmed, as new players such as IL-25 remain undiscovered. IL-25 is a cytokine of the IL-17 family, which stimulates Th2-mediated immune response when overly expressed. Thus, the aim of this research is to determine the plasma levels of IL-25 and Th2-associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13) in SLE patients with (SLE-LN) and without lupus nephritis. Sixty-four (n = 64) SLE patients and fifteen (n = 15) healthy individuals were recruited. This study demonstrated that the IL-9, IL-10 and IL-25 had significantly increased expressions in SLE-LN, followed by SLE without LN, compared to healthy controls. Meanwhile, IL-5 and IL-6 had significantly reduced. No significant difference was observed with IL-13, while the level of IL-4 was undetectable. Furthermore, IL-9 and IL-10 were significantly correlated with the IL-25, and IL-25, IL-9 and IL-10 were positively correlated with the disease severity score, SLEDAI. In conclusion, IL-25 and its associated Th2 cytokines (IL-9 and IL-10) may be involved in SLE pathogenesis. These cytokines could be potential biomarkers in monitoring and predicting the disease severity during SLE pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2988685581,"A key characteristic of mushroom polysaccharides that elicit an immunomodulatory response is that they are rich in β-glucans and low in α-glucans. In this study we analysed nine commercially available preparations from three mushroom species, Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum), Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) and Maitake (Grifola frondosa), for β- and α-glucan content. Based on β- and α-glucan content we selected three extracts to combine into a formula and evaluated the ability of the individual extracts and formula to impact on the expression of cytokines IL-1α, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in human macrophages with and without LPS stimulation. The majority of mushroom extracts and the formula were found to be highly potent immuno-stimulators possessing EC50 values lower than 100 μg/mL. Interestingly the mushroom formula had lower EC50 values in TNF-α expression from LPS stimulated macrophages compared to the individual extracts, suggesting a potential synergistic effect of the mushroom formula. A response additivity graph and curve-shift analysis illustrated that indeed the mushroom formula exhibited an immuno-stimulatory synergistic effect on the expression of the majority of cytokines evaluated in both LPS stimulated and non-stimulated human macrophages, with IL-10 having an antagonistic response. This study represents the first report of a synergistic immuno-modulatory response in human macrophages elicited from a mushroom formula rationally derived from β- and α-glucan content."
https://openalex.org/W2989157446,"Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) is a highly prevalent bacterial species in poultry causing disease and severe economic losses. Antibiotic treatment is one of the control strategies that can be applied to contain clinical outbreaks in MS-free flocks, especially because this bacterium can be transmitted in ovo. It becomes, then, very important for veterinarians to know the antibiotic susceptibility of the circulating strains in order to choose the most appropriate first-line antibiotic molecule as a proactive role in fighting antibiotic resistance. We evaluated the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, tylosin, tilmicosin, spiramycin, tiamulin, florfenicol and lincomycin for MS isolates collected between 2012 and 2017 in Italy. A total of 154 MS isolates from different poultry commercial categories (broiler, layer, and turkey sectors) was tested using commercial MIC plates. All MS isolates showed very high MIC values of erythromycin (MIC90 ≥8 μg/mL) and enrofloxacin (MIC90 ≥16 μg/mL). MIC values of doxycycline and oxytetracycline obtained were superimposable to each other with only a one-fold dilution difference. Discrepancies between MIC values of tylosin and tilmicosin were observed. Interestingly, seven isolates showed very high MIC values of lincomycin and tilmicosin, but not all of them showed very high MIC values of tylosin. Most of the MS isolates showed low MIC values of spiramycin, but seven strains showed a MIC ≥16 μg/mL. In the observation period, the frequency of the different MIC classes varied dependently on the tested antibiotic. Interestingly, tilmicosin MICs clearly showed a time-dependent progressive shift towards high-concentration classes, indicative of an on-going selection process among MS isolates. Until standardized breakpoints become available to facilitate data interpretation, it will be fundamental to continue studying MIC value fluctuations in the meantime in order to create a significant database that would facilitate veterinarians in selecting the proper drug for treating this impactful Mycoplasma."
https://openalex.org/W2986155042,"As uncontrolled urban growth has increasingly challenged the sustainable use of urban land, it is critically important to model urban growth from different perspectives. Using the SLEUTH (Slope, Land use, Exclusion, Urban, Transportation, and Hill-shade) model, the historical data of Hefei in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were collected and input to simulate urban growth from 2015 to 2040. Three different urban growth scenarios were considered, namely a historical growth scenario, an urban planning growth scenario, and a land suitability growth scenario. Prediction results show that by 2040 urban built-up land would increase to 1434 km2 in the historical growth scenario, to 1190 km2 in the urban planning growth scenario, and to 1217 km2 in the land suitability growth scenario. We conclude that (1) exclusion layers without effective limits might result in unreasonable prediction of future built-up land; (2) based on the general land use map, the urban growth prediction took the governmental policies into account and could reveal the development hotspots in urban planning; and (3) the land suitability scenario prediction was the result of the trade-off between ecological land and built-up land as it used the MCR -based (minimum cumulative resistance model) land suitability assessment result. It would help to form a compact urban space and avoid excessive protection of farmland and ecological land. Findings derived from this study may provide urban planners with interesting insights on formulating urban planning strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2985523023,"Introduction Studies have demonstrated leptin involvement in the physiology and pathophysiology of pregnancy and suggest that leptin may be a prognostic marker for some complications of pregnancy although the association remains unclear. To date no studies have reported leptin reference intervals established in normal pregnancy, which could be used for interpreting the differences in leptin levels found in normal and pathological pregnancies. Objective To determine leptin concentrations at delivery, in maternal serum in normal pregnancy and in cord blood and to establish reference intervals for leptin. Material and methods The study was performed in 194 pregnant women without any comorbid health conditions. Leptin concentrations in maternal serum and in cord blood were measured by ELISA and subsequently analyzed by gestational age (weeks), maternal Body Mass Index (BMI), mode of delivery and infant gender and birth weight. For comparative analyses of normally distributed variables, parametric tests such as the Student–t were used to test the assumption of homogeneity or non-homogeneity of variance and a One-Way ANOVA when more than two groups were compared. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between normally distributed variables (p<0.05). The reference intervals for leptin were obtained by referring to the central 95% of laboratory test values. Results In normal pregnant women, the mean serum leptin concentration at delivery was 37.17 ± 28.07 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 33.19–41.14 ng/mL. The mean leptin concentration in cord blood was 14.78 ± 15.97 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 12.32–17.67 ng/mL. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations (r = 0.37; p = 0.00). Mean leptin concentrations in cord blood increased with gestational age (p = 0.00). No statistically significant differences in maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations were found in regard to mode of delivery and neonatal gender. A statistically significant correlation was found between maternal serum leptin and third-trimester BMI (r = 0.22; p = 0.00), but there was no association between maternal BMI and cord blood leptin concentration. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between cord blood leptin concentration and birth weight (r = 0.23; p = 0.00). Conclusions Reference intervals for leptin in maternal serum and in cord blood established in normal pregnancy could be used in clinical practice for interpreting the differences in leptin concentrations found in normal pregnancy and in complications of pregnancy. The results indicate a strong association between maternal serum leptin levels and obesity and between cord blood leptin levels and birth weight."
https://openalex.org/W2987044352,"Background Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that mediate cellular communication in health and multiple diseases, including cancer. However, its role in head and neck cancer has been poorly defined. Here, we investigated the relevance of exosomes in the signaling between larynx cancer cells and macrophages. Methods Exosomes from THP1 macrophages and BICR18 cells (a larynx squamous cell carcinoma cell line) were purified and their role in the cancer cell migration, macrophage phenotype and immunosuppressive activity was evaluated. The activation of STAT3 signal transduction in macrophages in response to exosomes obtained from cancer cells was also evaluated. Results Macrophages foster the cancer cell migration and this effect is mediated by exosome signaling. On the other hand, exosomes also induce the expression of IL-10 in macrophages and PD-L1 in cancer cells, thus resulting in the promotion of an immunosuppressive environment. Moreover, we observed that the effects induced in cancer cells are mediated by the exosome-depending activation of STAT-3 signal transduction pathway. Conclusions Our study indicates that exosomes released by both macrophages and cancer cells plays a critical role in tumor progression in larynx cancer and might be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in head and neck cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2989314635,"Skeletal muscle plasticity is reflected by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and breakdown, with basal muscle tissue protein synthesis rates ranging between 0.02 and 0.09%/h. Though it is evident that other musculoskeletal tissues should also express some level of plasticity, data on protein synthesis rates of most of these tissues in vivo in humans is limited. Six otherwise healthy patients (62±3 y), scheduled to undergo unilateral total knee arthroplasty, were subjected to primed continuous intravenous infusions with L-[ring-13C6]-Phenylalanine throughout the surgical procedure. Tissue samples obtained during surgery included muscle, tendon, cruciate ligaments, cartilage, bone, menisci, fat, and synovium. Tissue-specific fractional protein synthesis rates (%/h) were assessed by measuring the incorporation of L-[ring-13C6]-Phenylalanine in tissue protein and were compared with muscle tissue protein synthesis rates using a paired t test. Tendon, bone, cartilage, Hoffa’s fat pad, anterior and posterior cruciate ligament, and menisci tissue protein synthesis rates averaged 0.06±0.01, 0.03±0.01, 0.04±0.01, 0.11±0.03, 0.07±0.02, 0.04±0.01, and 0.04±0.01%/h, respectively, and did not significantly differ from skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates (0.04±0.01%/h; P>0.05). Synovium derived protein (0.13±0.03%/h) and intercondylar notch bone tissue protein synthesis rates (0.03±0.01%/h) were respectively higher and lower compared to skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Basal protein synthesis rates in various musculoskeletal tissues are within the same range of skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates, with fractional muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage, ligament, menisci, fat, and synovium protein synthesis rates ranging between 0.02 and 0.13% per hour in vivo in humans.

https://openalex.org/W2984716265,"Environmental exposure to metals is ubiquitous, but its relation to androgen hormone levels is not well understood, especially in children and adolescents. This study aimed to explore the relationship between blood metal concentrations (lead, cadmium, total mercury, selenium, and manganese) and serum total testosterone (TT) levels in 6–19-year-old children and adolescents in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2012. Weighted multivariable linear regression models using NHANES sampling weights were employed to evaluate the association between log-transformed serum TT and each metal categories in male and female children (age 6-11years) and adolescents (age 12–19 years). We established that blood cadmium and manganese levels were associated with significantly higher serum TT levels in the female adolescents. Additionally, the blood selenium levels in male adolescents were related to significantly higher serum TT. No significant associations between blood lead or total mercury levels and TT were observed in children or adolescents of either sex. These findings suggest that environmental exposure to certain metals could affect serum TT levels in adolescents, which might have important implications for the health of adolescents. Further research is required to confirm and extend our present findings."
https://openalex.org/W2986368593,"With changes in ice cover duration, nutrient loading, and anoxia risk, it is important to understand the mechanisms that control nitrogen cycling and oxygen depletion in lakes through winter. Current understanding is largely limited to description of changes in chemistry, with few measurements of the processes driving winter changes, how they differ across lakes, and how they are impacted by under-ice conditions. Nitrification is a process which consumes oxygen and ammonium (NH4+), and supplies nitrate (NO3–). To date, nitrification has been measured under ice cover in only two lakes globally. Here, we used 15NH4+ enrichment to measure rates of pelagic nitrification in thirteen water bodies in two ecozones. Our work demonstrates ecologically important rates of nitrification can occur despite low water temperatures, impacting NH4+, NO3– and, most importantly, oxygen concentrations. However, high rates are not the norm. When, where and why is nitrification important in winter? We found that nitrification rates were highest in a eutrophic lake chain downstream of a wastewater treatment effluent (mean: 226.5 μg N L-1 d-1), and in a semi-saline prairie lake (110.0 μg N L-1 d-1). In the boreal shield, a eutrophic lake had nitrification rates exceeding those of an oligotrophic lake by 6-fold. Supplementing our results with literature data we found NH4+ concentrations were the strongest predictor of nitrification rates across lentic ecosystems in winter. Higher nitrification rates were associated with higher concentrations of NH4+, NO3– and nitrous oxide (N2O). While more work is required to understand the switch between high and low nitrification rates and strengthen our understanding of winter nitrogen cycling, this work demonstrates that high nitrification rates can occur in winter."

The clinical effectiveness of four NAIs (oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir, and peramivir) was evaluated against influenza A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, and B viruses. Additionally, fever duration in patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1pdm09 with the H275Y mutation was evaluated.Patients aged <20 years who visited outpatient clinics in Japan with influenza-like illnesses were enrolled during 4 influenza seasons from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016. After obtaining informed consent, patients who tested positive for influenza with rapid tests received one of the four NAIs. Patients recorded their body temperature daily for 8 days from the first visit. The influenza strain was identified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to evaluate factors influencing fever duration. In children aged ≤5 years treated with oseltamivir, fever duration in oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1pdm09-infected patients was compared to that in oseltamivir-sensitive A/H1N1pdm09-infected patients.Of the 1,368 patients analyzed, 297 (21.7%), 683 (49.9%), and 388 (28.4%) were infected with influenza A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, and B, respectively. In multivariable analysis factors associated with significantly prolonged fever duration included: treatment with laninamivir (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78, p = 0.006, compared to oseltamivir), influenza B (HR: 0.58, p<0.001, compared to influenza A/H1N1pdm09), and a higher body temperature at the clinic visit (HR: 0.87 per degree Celsius, p<0.001). Increasing age was associated with a significantly shorter duration of fever (HR: 1.31 for 6-9 years old, p<0.001; and HR: 1.65 for 10-19 years old, p<0.001, respectively, compared to 0-5 years old). Following treatment with oseltamivir, fever duration was significantly longer for oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1pdm09-infected patients (n = 5) than for oseltamivir-sensitive A/H1N1pdm09 infected patients (n = 111) (mean, 89 versus 40 hours, p<0.001).Our results revealed characteristic information on the effectiveness of the four NAIs and also on oseltamivir-resistant viruses that may affect patients' clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W2986499305,"For a decade, experts have suggested integrating mental health care into primary care to help bridge mental health Treatment Gap. General Practitioners (GPs) are the first port-of-call for many patients with mental ill-health. In Indonesia, the WHO mhGAP is being systematically introduced to its network of 10,000 primary care clinics as an add-on mental health training for pairs of GPs and Nurses, since the end of 2015. In one of 34 provinces, there exists an integrated care model: the co-location of clinical psychologists in primary care clinics. This trial evaluates patient outcomes among those provided mental health care by GPs with those treated by clinical psychologists in primary care.In this partially-randomised, pragmatic, two-arm cluster non-inferiority trial, 14 primary care clinics were assigned to receive the WHO mhGAP training and 14 clinics with the co-location framework were assigned to the Specialist arm. Participants (patients) were blinded to the existence of the other pathway, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. All adult primary care patients who screened positive for psychiatric morbidity were eligible. GPs offered psychosocial and/or pharmacological interventions and Clinical Psychologists offered psychosocial interventions. The primary outcome was health and social functioning as measured by the HoNOS and secondary outcomes include disability measured by WHODAS 2.0, health-related quality of life measured by EQ-5D-3L, and resource use and costs evaluated from a health services perspective, at six months.153 patients completed the outcome assessment following GP care alongside 141 patients following Clinical Psychologists care. Outcomes of GP care were proven to be statistically not inferior to Clinical Psychologists in reducing symptoms of social and physical impairment, reducing disability, and improving health-related quality of life at six months. Economic analyses indicate lower costs and better outcomes in the Specialist arm and suggest a 50% probability of WHO mhGAP framework being cost-effective at the Indonesian willingness to pay threshold per QALY.General Practitioners supported by nurses in primary care clinics could effectively manage mild to moderate mental health issues commonly found among primary care patients. They provide non-stigmatising mental health care within community context, helping to reduce the mental health Treatment Gap.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02700490."
https://openalex.org/W2986778401,"Background Alcohol use is a major contributor to the burden of disease, including long-term non-communicable diseases. Alcohol can also interact with and counter the effects of medications. This study addresses how people with long term conditions, who take multiple medications, experience and understand their alcohol use. The study objective is to explore how people conceptualise the risks posed to their own health from their concurrent alcohol and medicines use. Methods and findings Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 24 people in the North of England taking medication for long term conditions who drank alcohol twice a week or more often. Transcripts were analysed using a modified framework method with a constructionist thematic analysis. Alcohol was consumed recreationally and to aid with symptoms of sleeplessness, stress and pain. Interviewees were concerned about the felt effects of concurrent alcohol and medicines use and sought ways to minimise the negative effects. Interviewees associated their own drinking with short-term reward, pleasure and relief. Risky drinking was located elsewhere, in the drinking of others. People made experiential, embodied sense of health harms and did not seem aware of, or convinced by, (or in some cases appeared resigned to) future harms to their own health from alcohol use. The study has limitations common to exploratory qualitative studies. Conclusions Health risk communication should be better informed about how people with long-term health conditions perceive health outcomes over time, and how they adopt experience-based safety strategies in contexts in which alcohol consumption is heavily promoted and weakly regulated, whilst medicines adherence is expected. Supporting people to make active and informed connections between medicines, alcohol and potential personal health harms requires more than a one-way style of risk communication if it is to be perceived as opening up rather than restricting choice."
https://openalex.org/W2983130584,"The characterization of interactions between melatonin, one main ingredient of medicines regulating sleeping rhythms, and basic components of cellular plasma membranes (phospholipids, cholesterol, metal ions and water) is very important to elucidate the main mechanisms for the introduction of melatonin into cells and also to identify its local structure and microscopic dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations of melatonin inside mixtures of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol in NaCl solution at physiological concentration have been performed at 303.15 K to systematically explore melatonin-cholesterol, melatonin-lipid and melatonin-water interactions. Properties such as the area per lipid and thickness of the membrane as well as selected radial distribution functions, binding free energies, angular distributions, atomic spectral densities and translational diffusion of melatonin are reported. The presence of cholesterol significantly affects the behavior of melatonin, which is mainly buried into the interfaces of membranes. Introducing cholesterol into the system helps melatonin change from folded to extended configurations more easily. Our results suggest that there exists a competition between the binding of melatonin to phospholipids and to cholesterol by means of hydrogen-bonds. Spectral densities of melatonin reported in this work, in overall good agreement with experimental data, revealed the participation of each atom of melatonin to its complete spectrum. Melatonin self-diffusion coefficients are of the order of 10−7 cm2/s and they significantly increase when cholesterol is addeed to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2983991827,"This study aimed to investigate the associations of body mass index (BMI) and metabolically unhealthy weight with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and cancer mortality as well as the effect of age on the associations. This prospective study enrolled Japanese individuals in the general population. Participants were divided into eight phenotypes according to the BMI classification and metabolic status. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Cox regression hazard model. In total, 10,824 individuals with a mean age of 55.3 years were evaluated. During a mean follow-up of 18.4 years (198,776 person-years), 2,274 participants died. Among the metabolically unhealthy, the association between BMI and mortality was J-shaped after adjustment for various confounders (multivariable HR [95% CI] for all-cause mortality: underweight, 2.0 [1.5–2.7]; obesity 2.8 [2.1–3.6]). The association remained the same in metabolically unhealthy participants aged <65 years and ≥65 years. The results were compatible in the analyses restricted to subjects who never smoked. Regardless of age, metabolically unhealthy underweight (MUHU) have approximately a 3-fold higher risk of CVD mortality, compared with metabolically healthy normal weight. Not only metabolically unhealthy obesity, but also MUHU was strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality. More attention should be given to the health issues of metabolically unhealthy participants without obesity, particularly those with MUHU."
https://openalex.org/W2984037772,"Waste biomass from the palm oil industry is currently burned as a means of disposal and solutions are required to reduce the environmental impact. Whilst some waste biomass can be recycled to provide green energy such as biogas, this investigation aimed to optimise experimental conditions for recycling palm waste into substrate for insects, farmed as a sustainable high-protein animal feed. NMR spectroscopy and LC-HRMS were used to analyse the composition of palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) under experimental conditions optimised to produce nutritious substrate rather than biogas. Statistical pattern recognition techniques were used to investigate differences in composition for various combinations of pre-processing and anaerobic digestion (AD) methods. Pre-processing methods included steaming, pressure cooking, composting, microwaving, and breaking down the EFB using ionic liquids. AD conditions which were modified in combination with pre-processing methods were ratios of EFB:digestate and pH. Results show that the selection of pre-processing method affects the breakdown of the palm waste and subsequently the substrate composition and biogas production. Although large-scale insect feeding trials will be required to determine nutritional content, we found that conditions can be optimised to recycle palm waste for the production of substrate for insect rearing. Pre-processing EFB using ionic liquid before AD at pH6 with a 2:1 digestate:EFB ratio were found to be the best combination of experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2986887347,"Candida bloodstream infection (BSI) represents a growing infective problem frequently associated to biofilm production due to the utilization of intravascular devices. Candida species distribution (n = 612 strains), their biofilm production and hospital antifungal drug consumption were evaluated in different wards of a tertiary care academic hospital in Italy during the years 2011-2016. In the considered time window, an increasing number of Candida BSI (p = 0.005) and of biofilm producing strains were observed (p<0.0001). Although C. albicans was the species more frequently isolated in BSI with a major biofilm production, an increased involvement of non-albicans species was reported, particularly of C. parapsilosis that displayed a high frequency in catheter infections, and lower biofilm production compared to C. albicans. Although trends of biofilm production were substantially stable in time, a decreasing biofilm production by C. parapsilosis in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was observed (p = 0.0041). Principal component analysis displayed a change in antifungal drugs consumption driven by two mutually independent temporal trends, i.e. voriconazole use in the general medicine wards initially, and fluconazole use mainly in the ICU; these factors explain 68.9% and 25.7% of total variance respectively. Moreover, a significant trend (p = 0.003) in fluconazole use during the whole time period considered emerged, particularly in the ICU (p = 0.017), but also in the general medicine wards (p = 0.03). These trends paralleled with significant increase MIC90 of fluconazole (p = 0.05), particularly for C. parapsilosis in the ICU (p = 0.04), with a general and significant decreased trend of the MIC90 values of caspofungin (p = 0.04), and with significant increased MIC50 values for amphotericin B (p = 0.01) over the study period. In conclusion, drug utilization in our hospital turned out to be a putative influencing factor on the ecology of the species, on the increase in time of the biofilm producing strains and on the Candida antifungal susceptibility profile, thus influencing clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W2989542284,"This study considered the effects of repeated bouts of short-term resistive exercise in old (age: 64.5±5.5 years; n = 10) and young men (age: 25.1±4.9 years; n = 10) who performed six knee extension exercise bouts over two weeks using various markers of exercise-induced muscle damage and electromyographic activity. We found that time-course changes in quadriceps isometric torque, creatine kinase activity, and muscle soreness in the two groups were similar. However, recovery in the acute torque deficit was mediated by more favourable electromyographic activity changes in the young group than in the older adults group. Muscle elastic energy storage and re-use assessed with dynamometry was selectively improved in the young group by the end of the protocol. Serum myoglobin concentration increased selectively in old group, and remained elevated with further bouts, suggesting higher sarcolemma vulnerability and less effective metabolic adaptation in the older adults, which, however, did not affect muscle contractility."
https://openalex.org/W2988734941,"This study was conducted to evaluate various factors affecting fertility following insemination of dromedary camels. In experiment 1, camels were either bred by natural mating (NM) or inseminated in the body of uterus with whole, split (50:50) or 1 mL of undiluted ejaculate. In experiment 2, camels were inseminated with fresh diluted semen either in the body of the uterus or tip of the uterine horn and at either the time of ovulation induction (0 h), 24 or 30 h later. In experiment 3, camels were inseminated at the tip of the uterine horn with different doses of fresh diluted semen (75, 150 or 300 x 106 motile spermatozoa) or with 150 x 106 motile spermatozoa diluted with different extenders (Green buffer, Optixcell or Triladyl). In experiment 4, camels were inseminated in the tip of the uterine horn with diluted (Triladyl or Optixcell) liquid-stored semen or diluted (Triladyl) frozen-thawed semen consisting of either 300 or 500 x 106 motile spermatozoa. The pregnancy rate in camels bred by NM was similar to camels inseminated with whole undiluted ejaculates whereas insemination with 1 mL undiluted ejaculate resulted in lower pregnancy compared to whole and split undiluted ejaculates (P < 0.05). Deposition of semen in the uterine body resulted in lower pregnancy rates compared to deposition in the tip of the horn (35.3% versus 72.2%, P < 0.05) but insemination at the time of ovulation induction and 24 h later resulted in higher pregnancy rate to camels inseminated at 30 h after induction (68.4 and 70.0% versus 23.5%; P < 0.05). Artificial insemination with 75 x 106 motile spermatozoa resulted in lower pregnancy rates compared to 150 and 300 x 106 motile spermatozoa doses (40.9% versus 65.2 and 70.0%, respectively) and pregnancy rate was not affected by extenders. Insemination of chilled motile spermatozoa stored in either Triladyl or Optixcell resulted in similar pregnancy rates, regardless of insemination dose, although an upward trend with increasing sperm number was apparent (Triladyl; 11.1% versus 21.1% and Optixcell; 5.9% versus 12.5%, for 300 x 106 and 500 x 106 groups, respectively; P > 0.05). No pregnancies were obtained with frozen thawed semen. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the success of camel AI is highly dependent on sperm dose, location of semen deposition, timing of insemination and semen type. Further studies are required to determine the reason for the compromised fertility of preserved semen despite apparent high in vitro quality."
https://openalex.org/W2989130972,"Peritonitis is a major and the most significant complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although some predictors of peritonitis in PD patients are known, the association between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and peritonitis has not been characterized. Here, we examined whether PPI use is a risk factor for the development of peritonitis, based on a single-center retrospective analysis of 230 consecutive Japanese PD patients at Narita Memorial Hospital. We assessed the association between PPI use and subsequent first episode of peritonitis using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, following adjustment for clinically relevant factors. The median follow-up period was 36 months (interquartile range, 19-57 months). In total, 86 patients (37.4%) developed peritonitis. Analysis with multivariate Cox proportional hazards models revealed the following significant predictors of peritonitis: PPI use (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-2.66; P = 0.016) and low serum albumin level (per g/dl adjusted HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39-0.90; P = 0.014). Thus, PPI use was independently associated with PD-related peritonitis. The results suggest that nephrology physicians should exercise caution when prescribing PPIs for PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2983261111,"This study investigated the effect of caffeine on neuromuscular function, power and sprint performance during the days following an eccentric-based exercise. Using a randomly counterbalanced, crossover and double-blinded design, eleven male jumpers and sprinters (age: 18.7 ± 2.7 years) performed a half-squat exercise (4 x 12 repetitions at 70% of 1 RM), with eccentric action emphasized by using a flexible strip attached to their knees (Tirante Musculador®). They ingested either a capsule of placebo or caffeine (5 mg.kg-1 body mass) 24, 48 and 72 h after. Neuromuscular function and muscle power (vertical countermovement-jump test) were assessed before and after the half-squat exercise and 50 min after the placebo or caffeine ingestion at each time-point post-exercise. Sprint performance was measured at pre-test and 75 min after the placebo or caffeine ingestion at each time-point post-exercise. Maximal voluntary contraction (overall fatigue) and twitch torque (peripheral fatigue) reduced after the half-squat exercise (-11 and -28%, respectively, P < 0.05) but returned to baseline 24 h post-exercise (P > 0.05) and were not affected by caffeine ingestion (P > 0.05). The voluntary activation (central fatigue) and sprint performance were not altered throughout the experiment and were not different between caffeine and placebo. However, caffeine increased height and power during the vertical countermovement-jump test at 48 and 72 h post half-squat exercise, when compared to the placebo (P < 0.05). In conclusion, caffeine improves muscle power 48 and 72 h after an eccentric-based exercise, but it has no effect on neuromuscular function and sprint performance."
https://openalex.org/W2984127804,"Epilepsy is a significant contributor to worldwide disability. In epilepsy, disability can be broadly divided into two components: ictal (pertaining to the burden of unpredictable seizures and associated medical complications including death) and interictal (pertaining to more pervasive debilitating changes in cognitive and emotional behavior). In this study, we objectively and noninvasively appraise aspects of ictal and interictal behavior in mice using instrumented home-cage chambers designed to assay kinematic and appetitive behavioral measures. Through daily intraperitoneal injections of the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) applied to C57BL/6J mice, we coordinately measure how “behavioral severity” (complex dynamic changes in movement and sheltering behavior) and convulsive severity (latency and occurrence of convulsive seizures) evolve or kindle with repeated injections. By closely studying long epochs between PTZ injections, we identify an interictal syndrome of nocturnal hypoactivity and increased sheltering behavior which remits with the cessation of seizure induction. We observe elements of this interictal behavioral syndrome in seizure-prone DBA/2J mice and in mice with a pathogenic Scn1a mutation (modeling Dravet syndrome). Through analyzing their responses to PTZ, we illustrate how convulsive severity and “behavioral” severity are distinct and independent aspects of the overall severity of a PTZ-induced seizure. Our results illustrate the utility of an ethologically centered automated approach to quantitatively appraise murine expressions of disability in mouse models of seizures and epilepsy. In doing so, this study highlights the very unique psychopharmacological profile of PTZ."
https://openalex.org/W2985337914,"The precise effect of low frequency stimulation (LFS) as a newly postulated, anticonvulsant therapeutic approach on seizure-induced changes in synaptic transmission has not been completely determined.In this study, the LFS effect on impaired, synaptic plasticity in kindled rats was investigated.Hippocampal kindled rats received LFS (4 trials consisting of one train of 200 monophasic square waves, 0.1 ms pulse duration, 1 Hz) on four occasions. LTP induction was evaluated using whole-cell recordings of evoked excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs respectively) in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices. In addition, the hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs), and the gene expression of NR2A, GluR2 and γ2 were evaluated.LTP induction was attenuated in excitatory and inhibitory synapses in hippocampal slices of kindled rats. When LFS was applied in kindled animals, LTP was induced in EPSPs and IPSPs. Moreover, LFS increased and decreased the threshold intensities of EPSCs and IPSCs respectively. In kindled animals, NR2A gene expression increased, while γ2 gene expression decreased. GluR2 gene expression did not significantly change. Applying LFS in kindled animals mitigated these changes: No significant differences were observed in NR2A, γ2 and GluR2 gene expression in the kindled+LFS and control groups.The application of LFS in kindled animals restored LTP induction in both EPSPs and IPSPs, and returned the threshold intensity for induction of EPSCs, IPSCs and gene expression to similar levels as controls."
https://openalex.org/W2986762872,"As the oyster aquaculture industry grows and becomes incorporated into management practices, it is important to understand its effects on local environments. This study investigated how water quality and hydrodynamics varied among farms as well as inside versus outside the extent of caged grow-out areas located in southern Chesapeake Bay. Current speed and water quality variables (chlorophyll-a fluorescence, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen) were measured along multiple transects within and adjacent to four oyster farms during two seasons. At the scale of individual aquaculture sites, we were able to detect statistically significant differences in current speed and water quality variables between the areas inside and outside the farms. However, the magnitudes of the water quality differences were minor. Differences between sites and between seasons for water quality variables were typically an order of magnitude greater than those observed within each site (i.e. inside and outside the farm footprint). The relatively small effect of the presence of oysters on water quality is likely attributable to a combination of high background variability, relatively high flushing rates, relatively low oyster density, and small farm footprints. Minimal impacts overall suggest that low-density oyster farms located in adequately-flushed areas are unlikely to negatively impact local water quality."
https://openalex.org/W2989481456,"Background Needlestick injury (NSI) is one of the most burdensome professional hazards in any medical setting; it can lead to transmission of fatal infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus. In the United States, the annual cost burden was estimated as somewhere between $118 million to $591 million; in the United Kingdom it is approximated to be £500,000 (US$919,117.65) per the National Health Service. Method This is the first published paper on the national cost burden of NSIs in Japan. A systematic literature review was conducted to review previous study design in global studies and to extract parameter values from Japanese studies. We conducted abstract searches through PubMed and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society (Ichushi), together with grey literature and snowball searches. A simple economic model was developed to calculate cost burden of NSIs from a societal perspective over a one-year time horizon. We assumed all NSIs are reported and perfect adherence in post NSI management that presented in the labour compensation scheme. Local guidelines were also referenced to extract resource utilization. Lastly, a deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted and a scenario analysis which considered a payer perspective was also included. Result and conclusion The national cost burden of in-hospital NSIs is estimated as ¥33.4 billion (US$302 million) annually, based on an average cost per NSI of ¥63,711 (US$577) and number of NSIs at 525,000/year. 70% of the cost is due to initial laboratory tests, followed by productivity loss, estimated at 20% of the total cost. Cost of contaminated NSIs remains at 5% of the total cost. Change in number of NSIs significantly influences outcomes. Variation in post-exposure management practices suggests a need for NSI specific National guidelines and holistic labour compensation scheme development in Japan."

In the present study, the characteristics of the inlet start, unstart and buzz phenomena in a scramjet engine inlet model are investigated using numerical analysis with the RANS-based OpenFOAM solver. The results for the inlet start case with a small computational domain that includes only the inlet-isolator part are in good agreement with existing numerical and experimental results. However, for the inlet unstart case, the computational domain must be wide enough to consider the interactions between the upstream of the inlet and the internal flow of the inlet to predict the inlet unstart and buzz phenomena in the inlet test model. The present results show fairly good agreement with existing experimental results with the buzz phenomenon. The effects of boundary layer profiles on the buzz oscillation frequency and amplitude are also addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2983789179,"The diversity of gymnotid electric fishes has been intensely studied over the past 25 years, with 35 species named since 1994, compared to 11 species in the previous 236 years. Substantial effort has also been applied in recent years to documenting gymnotid interrelationships, with seven systematic studies published using morphological and molecular datasets. Nevertheless, until now, all gymnotids have been assigned to one of just two supraspecific taxa, the subfamily Electrophorinae with one genus Electrophorus and three valid species and the subfamily Gymnotine also with one genus Gymnotus and 43 valid species. This simple classification has obscured the substantial phenotypic and lineage diversity within the subfamily Gymnotine and hampered ecological and evolutionary studies of gymnotid biology. Here we present the most well-resolved and taxon-complete phylogeny of the Gymnotidae to date, including materials from all but one of the valid species. This phylogeny was constructed using a five-gene molecular dataset and a 115-character morphological dataset, enabling the inclusion of several species for which molecular data are still lacking. This phylogeny was time-calibrated using biogeographical priors in the absence of a fossil record. The tree topology is similar to those of previous studies, recovering all the major clades previously recognized with informal names. We propose a new gymnotid classification including two subfamilies (Electrophorinae and Gymnotinae) and six subgenera within the genus Gymnotus. Each subgenus exhibits a distinctive biogeographic distribution, within which most species have allopatric distributions and the subgenera are diverged from one another by an estimated 5-35 million years. We further provide robust taxonomic diagnoses, descriptions and identification keys to all gymnotid subgenera and all but four species. This new taxonomy more equitably partitions species diversity among supra-specific taxa, employing the previously vacant subgenus and subfamily ranks. This new taxonomy renders known gymnotid diversity more accessible to study by highlighting the deep divergences (chronological, geographical, genetic and morphological) among its several clades."
https://openalex.org/W2983809561,"Botulism is a rare, serious, and sometimes fatal paralytic illness caused by exposure to neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. Patients with documented or suspected exposure to botulinum toxin serotypes A-G can be treated with BAT® [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)-(Equine)] product, which was approved in 2013 in the United States (US). Patients with botulism have demonstrated greater clinical benefit with early BAT product treatment (≤2 days from symptom onset) versus late treatment (>2 days).Economic outcomes associated with improved clinical outcome benefits of BAT product treatment have not yet been reported. This ad hoc analysis aimed to estimate and compare costs associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and mechanical ventilation for patients with botulism administered BAT product treatment early or late.Clinical outcomes data for early and late BAT product treatment were obtained from a patient registry conducted between October 2014 and July 2017. Total per patient mean daily costs were estimated based on information from published literature. Total population costs per group were calculated by multiplying estimated mean cost per patient by the average annual number of non-infant botulism cases in the US.Mean per patient costs were 2.5 times lower for patients treated with BAT product early versus late. On average in the US, early BAT product treatment could save greater than $3.9 million per year versus late treatment.Substantial economic savings can be achieved with early BAT product treatment. The findings support the recommendation for public health authorities to ensure antitoxin treatment is readily available in sufficient quantities to manage botulism cases, including sporadic outbreaks and potential mass exposure biological attacks."
https://openalex.org/W2984149798,"Certain bacterial species target the polysaccharide glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of animal extracellular matrices for colonization and/or infection. GAGs such as hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate consist of repeating disaccharide units of uronate and amino sugar residues, and are depolymerized to unsaturated disaccharides by bacterial extracellular or cell-surface polysaccharide lyase. The disaccharides are degraded and metabolized by cytoplasmic enzymes such as unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, isomerase, and reductase. The genes encoding these enzymes are assembled to form a GAG genetic cluster. Here, we demonstrate the Streptococcus agalactiae phosphotransferase system (PTS) for import of unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide. S. agalactiae NEM316 was found to depolymerize and assimilate hyaluronan, whereas its mutant with a disruption in the PTS genes included in the GAG cluster was unable to grow on hyaluronan, while retaining the ability to depolymerize hyaluronan. Using toluene-treated wild-type cells, the PTS activity for import of unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide was significantly higher than that observed in the absence of the substrate. In contrast, the PTS mutant was unable to import unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide, indicating that the corresponding PTS is the only importer of fragmented hyaluronan, which is suitable for PTS to phosphorylate the substrate at the C-6 position. This is distinct from Streptobacillus moniliformis ATP-binding cassette transporter for import of sulfated and non-sulfated fragmented GAGs without substrate modification. The three-dimensional structure of streptococcal EIIA, one of the PTS components, was found to contain a Rossman-fold motif by X-ray crystallization. Docking of EIIA with another component EIIB by modeling provided structural insights into the phosphate transfer mechanism. This study is the first to identify the substrate (unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide) recognized and imported by the streptococcal PTS. The PTS and ABC transporter for import of GAGs shed light on bacterial clever colonization/infection system targeting various animal polysaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2984962053,"To assess the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the correlated risk factors among male clients of female sex workers (FSWs) in a Chinese-Vietnamese border region in Yunnan Province, China.A cross-sectional survey was conducted between 2014 and 2015 in Hekou County, Yunnan Province, China. Convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods were used to recruit male clients for a questionnaire survey to collect information on demographics, sexual behavior, and drug use. Blood and urine samples were collected for testing of HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and drug use. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine factors correlated with HIV infection.Of 776 respondents who participated in the study, 721 (92.91%) were Chinese and 55 (7.09%) were Vietnamese. Overall HIV prevalence in male clients of FSWs was 2.06%, 128 (16.49%) were infected with HSV-2, and five (0.64%) tested syphilis-positive. Two-thirds (68.81%) of respondents reported always using condoms with FSWs, and 89.05% reported condom use in the last episode of commercial sex. Male clients from Vietnam were significantly more likely to take morphine (9.09%) compared with Chinese male clients of FSWs. Age ≥50 years (OR: 8.11, 95%CI: 1.26-52.16) and morphine positivity (OR: 7.35, 95%CI: 1.42-38.06) were associated with HIV infection in the multivariate logistic regression model.The relatively high proportion of male clients of FSWs who have numerous sexual partners and use condoms less frequently make them serve as important bridges for HIV transmission from FSWs to the low-risk general population. The positive association between morphine positivity and HIV infection confirmed illegal drug use as another important route for acquiring HIV infection in addition to sexual transmission, indicating that innovative interventions addressing both drug use and risky sexual behaviors are greatly required for male clients. Respondents aged ≥50 years have a higher risk of HIV infection, which emphasizes that older male clients of FSWs should be focused in future HIV prevention interventions in the border regions of China."
https://openalex.org/W2988361670,"Background Ki-67 is known to be useful in estimating the fraction of proliferation tumor cells in various malignancies. We tried to investigate clinical association of Ki-67 (MIB-1) expression with the oncological outcomes in patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) after the radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data of 1,561 patients who underwent RP for localized PCa. According to the propensity score having Ki-67 expression, 183 patients with positive Ki-67 expression were matched to 549 patients without Ki-67 expression. By using multivariate Cox-proportional hazards models and logistic regression tests, the prognostic value of each variable was tested. Results After propensity score matching, positive Ki-67 group showed significant worse clinical characteristics and pathologic outcomes than negative Ki-67 group. The multivariate analysis showed that the Ki-67 expression was significantly associated with several adverse pathologic outcomes including higher pathologic stage (p = 0.006), higher grade group (p = 0.005), seminal vesicle invasion (p = 0.036), and positive surgical margin (p = 0.025). The group with Ki-67 expression showed significant worse biochemical recurrence-free survival (p<0.001) than negative Ki-67 group. Subsequent multivariate Cox analyses showed that Ki-67 was independent predictor for BCR after RP (HR 1.549, 95% CI 1.187–2.021, p = 0.001). Conclusion In our study, high Ki-67 expression was significantly related with adverse pathological and finally with worse biochemical recurrence-free survival. Further studies are needed to validate the prognostic value of Ki-67 more exactly in PCa patients."
https://openalex.org/W2983939873,"Objectives To evaluate the incidence, risk factors and the clinical outcome of micro-dislodgement (MD) with a contemporary self-expandable prosthesis during transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Methods MD was defined as movement of the prosthesis of at least 1.5 mm upwards or downwards from its position directly before release compared to its final position. Patients were grouped according to the occurrence (+MD) or absence (-MD) of MD. Baseline characteristics, imaging data and outcome parameters were retrospectively analyzed. Results We identified 258 eligible patients. MD occurred in 31.8% (n = 82) of cases with a mean magnitude of 2.8 mm ± 2.2 in relation to the left coronary cusp and 3.0 mm ± 2.1 to the non-coronary cusp. Clinical and hemodynamic outcomes were similar in both groups with consistency over a follow-up period of three months. A larger aortic valve area (AVA) (-MD vs. +MD: 0.6 cm2 ± 0.3 vs. 0.7cm2 ± 0.2; p = 0.014), was the only independent risk factor for the occurrence of MD in a multivariate regression analysis (OR 5.3; 95% CI: 1.1–24.9; p = 0.036). Conclusions MD occurred in nearly one third of patients and did not affect clinical and hemodynamic outcome. A larger AVA seems to be a potential risk factor for MD."
https://openalex.org/W2987013199,"We recently described a hydrodynamic mechanism for cytoplasmic transfer between cells, termed cell-projection pumping (CPP). Earlier image analysis related altered SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell morphology, to what we now recognize as CPP uptake of fibroblast cytoplasm. We here examine SAOS-2 phenotype following co-culture with human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) in which organelles were pre-labelled with a fluorescent lipophilic marker. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed of HDF and SAOS-2, cultured either alone or together. FACS forward scatter is proportionate to cell size, and increased for SAOS-2 with high levels of HDF fluorescence uptake (p < 0.004). FACS side scatter is proportionate to internal cell complexity, and increased in SAOS-2 with increasing uptake of HDF fluorescence (p < 0.004), consistent with uptake of HDF organelles. Scratch migration assays revealed that HDF migrated more quickly than SAOS-2 in both isolated cell culture, and following co-culture (p < 0.004). Notably, SAOS-2 with high levels of HDF labelling migrated faster compared with SAOS-2 with low HDF labelling (p < 0.008). A slight and unconvincing reduction in SAOS-2 proliferation was seen (p < 0.02). Similar results were obtained in single additional experiments with A673 and H312 cancer cells. Forward and side scatter results suggest organellar transfer by CPP increases cancer cell morphological diversity. This may contribute to histological pleomorphism relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Also, increased migration of sub-populations of cancer cells with high CPP organellar uptake, may contribute to invasion and metastasis in-vivo. We thus suggest relevance of CPP to cancer diagnosis and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2987729872,"Nitrate signaling integrates and coordinates gene expression and plant growth; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Our previous study revealed that rice calcineurin B-like protein 1 (OsCBL1) modulates lateral root elongation by affecting auxin biosynthesis. Here, we report that OsCBL1 also modulates nitrate signaling to regulate rice seedlings growth. Compared with wild-type seedlings, seedlings of OsCBL1-knockdown (OsCBL1-KD) plants showed a suppressed growth phenotype, which included reduced root and shoot fresh weights and shorter radicles, crown roots, and lateral roots, when grown in nitrogen-free conditions. Although the growth defects of OsCBL1-KD plants could be partially rescued by the addition of nitrate to the growth conditions, the nitrate uptake capability of the OsCBL1-KD plants did not differ from that of wild-type plants as assessed via nitrate content and 15NO3- influx experiments. The nitrate-regulated expression of nitrate signal sentinel genes (OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2) was affected in the OsCBL1-KD plants under both long- and short-term nitrate treatments. Overall, our results showed a novel role for OsCBL1 in the regulation of nitrate signaling and nitrate-mediated rice growth."
https://openalex.org/W2984445489,"Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a set of clinical and laboratory abnormalities where renal function loss is noted. The high prevalence of comorbidity of people living with CKD, its economic impact and its prognosis have made it a public health problem, justifying the need to implement preventive measures. Objective To analyse the mortality and incidence of hospital admissions for CKD. Methods Ecological study with a time series design using secondary microdata of deaths and hospital admissions from patients with CKD from 1996 to 2017 in the State of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Results The average mortality rate of CKD during the studied years was 2.92 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. During this period global mortality was a stationary phenomenon. In women, the trend of mortality from 2005 on increased 7,87% per year. Between 2008 and 2017, the average incidence hospital admissions due to CKD per year was 45.76 per 100,000 inhabitants. It was observed that the overall hospital admission increased by the equivalent of 6.23% per year. More than a half of mortality and hospitalisations correspond to male patients over 50 years of age. In terms of mortality, 32.99% corresponded to Caucasian patients, while 35.13% of hospitalisations were mixed race. Conclusion We found that age and gender are factors associated with deaths and hospitalisations for chronic kidney disease. While hospitalisation increases 6.23% per year, global mortality remains stationary. However, from 2005 onwards a trend towards increasing of 7.87%/annual in mortality was observed in women."
https://openalex.org/W2985970836,"Background Advanced practice registered nursing (APRN) competencies exist, but there is no structure supporting the operationalization of the competencies by APRN educators. The development of a Mastery Rubric (MR) for APRNs provides a developmental trajectory that supports educational institutions, educators, students, and APRNs. A MR describes the explicit knowledge, skills, and abilities as performed by the individual moving from novice (student) through graduation and into the APRN career. Method A curriculum development tool, the Mastery Rubric (MR), was created to structure the curriculum and career of the nurse practitioner (NP), the MR-NP. Cognitive task analysis (CTA) yielded the first of the three required elements for any MR: a list of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be established through the curriculum. The European guild structure and Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive behaviors provided the second element of the MR, the specific developmental stages that are relevant for the curriculum. The Body of Work method of standard setting was used to create the third required element of the MR, performance level descriptors (PLDs) for each KSA at each of these stages. Although the CTA was informed by the competencies, it was still necessary to formally assess the alignment of competencies with the resulting KSAs; this was achieved via Degrees of Freedom Analysis (DoFA). Validity evidence was obtained from this Analysis and from the DoFA of the KSAs’ alignment with principles of andragogy, and with learning outcomes assessment criteria. These analyses are the first time the national competencies for the NP have been evaluated in this manner. Results CTA of the 43 NP Competencies led to seven KSAs that support a developmental trajectory for instruction and documenting achievement towards independent performance on the competencies. The Competencies were objectively evaluable for the first time since their publication due to the psychometric validity attributes of the PLD-derived developmental trajectory. Three qualitatively distinct performance levels for the independent practitioner make the previously implicit developmental requirements of the competencies explicit for the first time. Discussion The MR-NP provides the first articulated and observable developmental trajectory for the NP competencies, during and beyond the formal curriculum. A focus on psychometric validity was brought to bear on how learners would demonstrate their development, and ultimately their achievement, of the competencies. The MR-NP goes beyond the competencies with trajectories and PLDs that can engage both learner and instructor in this developmental process throughout the career."
https://openalex.org/W2986831696,"Although high intensity physical activities may represent a great proportion of the total energy expenditure in active people, only sparse studies have investigated the accuracy of wearable monitors to assess activity related energy expenditure (AEE) during high intensity exercises. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of the Actiheart, a light portable monitor estimating AEE based on heart rate (HR) and activity counts (ACT), during two popular activities (running and cycling) performed at high intensities. The benefit of an individual calibration of the HR-AEE relationship established during a preliminary maximal test was also evaluated.AEE was estimated in eighteen active adults (4 women and 14 men; 25 ± 4 yr) with indirect calorimetry using a respiratory gas analysis system (reference method) and the Actiheart during 5-min running and cycling at 60, 75 and 85% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) previously determined during a maximal test performed on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. For the Actiheart, AEE was estimated either using the group or individual calibrated equations available in the dedicated software, and their respective HR, ACT or combined HR/ACT algorithms.When the HR algorithm was used for cycling and the HR or HR/ACT algorithms for running, AEE measured by the Actiheart increased proportionally to exercise intensity from 60 to 85% VO2max (P<0.001). Compared to indirect calorimetry, the Actiheart group calibrated equations slightly to moderately underestimated (3 to 20%) AEE for the three exercise intensities (P<0.001). Accuracy of AEE estimation was greatly improved by individual calibration of the HR-AEE relationship (underestimation below 5% and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.79-0.93) compared to group calibration (ICC: 0.64-0.79).The Actiheart enables to assess AEE during high intensity running and cycling when the appropriate algorithm is applied. Since an underestimation was present for group calibration, an individual and sport-specific calibration should be performed when a high accuracy is required."
https://openalex.org/W2988338192,"The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether nitric oxide (NO) released into the circulation by a noninvasive technology called whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) could increase mucociliary clearance (MCC). It was based on observations by others that nitric oxide donor drugs increase ciliary beat frequency of nasal epithelium without increasing mucociliary clearance. Tracheal mucous velocity (TMV), a reflection of MCC, was measured in sheep after 1-hour treatment of WBPA and repeated after pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME to demonstrated action of NO. Aerosolized human neutrophil elastase (HNE) was administered to sheep to suppress TMV as might occur in cystic fibrosis and other inflammatory lung diseases. WBPA increased TMV to a peak of 136% of baseline 1h after intervention, an effect blocked by L-NAME. HNE reduced TMV to 55% of baseline but slowing was reversed by WBPA, protection lost in the presence of L-NAME. NO released into the circulation from eNOS by WBPA can acutely access airway epithelium for improving MCC slowed in cystic fibrosis and other inflammatory lung diseases as a means of enhancing host defense against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2989256619,"Women from low and middle income countries are generally more likely to have sub-optimal calcium intake. The objective of this study was to assess serum calcium disorders and correlates in late pregnancy.We conducted from December 2018 to April 2019, a cross-sectional hospital-based study targeting pregnant women in late pregnancy in the Nkongsamba Regional Hospital. Data were collected by measurement of parameters (weight, height, blood pressure and foetal birthweight), administration of a semi-structured questionnaire and analysis of blood samples collected from each participant. Absorption spectrophotometry was used to measure serum calcium and albumin concentrations and corrected serum calcium calculated from the Payne's equation. With a statistical significant threshold set at p-value = 0.05, the odds ratio was used as a measure of the strength of association between hypocalcaemia and maternofoetal variables.We enrolled a total of 354 consenting participants with a mean age of 27.41±5.84 years. The prevalence of hypocalcaemia in late pregnancy was 58.76 [53.42-63.90]%. The rate of calcium supplementation in pregnancy was 57.63[52.28-62.80]% with a mean duration of supplementation of 3.69±1.47 months. When controlled for marital status, age, level of education, and gestational age at delivery, pregnant women with systolic blood pressures below 130 mmHg were significantly less likely to have hypocalcaemia than their counterparts with higher systolic blood pressures (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.41[0.18-0.89], p-value = 0.020). No statistically significant associations were found between diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, foetal birth weight and hypocalcaemia.Hypocalcaemia in late pregnancy is highly prevalent (59%) among women accessing reproductive services at the Nkongsamba Regional Hospital. There is also a wide gap in calcium supplementation compared to World Health Organization recommendations. Hypocalcaemia is significantly associated to higher systolic blood pressure in pregnancy. Systematic calcium supplementation and consumption of high calcium containing locally available meals should be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W2986567530,"Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases can frequently coexist. Understanding their link may improve disease management. We aimed at assessing the associations of chronic bronchitis (CB), asthma and rhinitis with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors in the general population.We used data collected in the Gene Environment Interactions in Respiratory Diseases study, an Italian multicentre, multicase-control study. Among 2463 participants (age 21-86, female 50%) who underwent standardized interviews, skin prick and lung function tests, we identified 254 cases of CB without airflow obstruction, 418 cases of asthma without CB, 959 cases of rhinitis alone, and 832 controls. The associations of respiratory diseases with reported cardiovascular risk factors (lifestyles, hypertension, dyslipidaemia), heart disorders (myocardial infarction, coronary thrombosis, angina, aorta or heart surgery) and intermittent claudication were estimated through relative risk ratios (RRR) by multinomial logistic regression models.Compared to controls, CB cases were more likely to be heavy smokers, alcohol consumers, physically inactive, and to suffer from hypertension or dyslipidaemia; rhinitis cases were less obese but more likely to have hypertension. Asthma was significantly associated with current smoking. After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, heart disorders were associated with CB (RRR[95%CI]: 1.58[1.12-2.22]) and rhinitis (1.35[0.98-1.85]) and intermittent claudication was associated with CB (3.43[2.52-4.67]), asthma (1.51[1.04-2.21]) and rhinitis (2.03[1.34-3.07]).CB, asthma and rhinitis were associated with cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. In particular, CB shared with cardiovascular diseases almost all risk factors and was strongly associated with a higher risk of heart disorders and intermittent claudication."
https://openalex.org/W2987111184,"Information regarding the significance of platelet (PLT) count on outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients who are treated with anticoagulants is limited.We conducted a monocentric observational retrospective cohort study of AF patients treated with either warfarin (n = 6287) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (n = 5240). Patient were divided into 3 subgroups; low, normal and high PLT for counts < 150 K/ μl, 150-450 K/ μl and > 450 K/ μl, respectively. A multivariate Cox-regression was used to evaluate the association between PLT subgroups and clinical outcomes.During follow-up [median = 40.6 months (IQR 17.6-60)], mortality (HR 1.36, 95 CI 1.1-1.74, p = 0.01) and rate of myocardial infarction (MI) (HR 2.4, 95 CI 1.28-4.57, p = 0.007) were higher in patients with high compared to normal PLT. Transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident (TIA/CVA) rate was lower in patients with low compared to normal PLT (HR 0.69, 95 CI 0.51-0.93, p = 0.02). A comparison between NOACs and warfarin demonstrated a significantly better clinical outcome for patients on NOACs in both the low (lower mortality rates) and normal PLT subgroup (lower mortality, TIA/CVA and systemic emboli rates). For patients on NOACs, low and high compared to normal PLT were associated with a higher combined outcome (HR 1.12, 95 CI 1-1.38, p = 0.047), and a higher systemic emboli rate (HR 7.07, 95 CI 1.66-30.25, p = 0.008), respectively.Abnormal PLT count is associated with different clinical outcome of AF patients on anticoagulants. Further studies are needed in order assess whether PLT level should influence strategies of anticoagulation."
https://openalex.org/W2989539044,"High yields of mechanized intensive rice-based cropping systems, e.g. double-season cropping using early- and late-season rice, are important to ensure national food security in China. However, few studies addressing the relationship between grain weight and grain yield of early-season rice under machine-transplanted conditions. A field experiment was conducted to determine the critical grain-filling characteristics and related physiological aspects that contribute to high grain weight in machine-transplanted early-season rice. The results showed that grain yield was significantly positively correlated with grain weight but not with panicles per m2, spikelets per panicle, and spikelet-filling percentage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that there was a significant positive correlation between grain weight and mean grain-filling rate, which was significantly positively correlated with harvest index and grain cytokinin content. These results indicate that high grain-filling rate driven by good transport of assimilates to grains and strong grain sink strength is responsible for high grain weight in machine-transplanted early-season rice."
https://openalex.org/W2983620508,"Light Touch (LT) has been shown to reduce postural sway in a wide range of populations. While LT is believed to provide additional sensory information for balance modulation, the nature of this information and its specific effect on balance are yet unclear. In order to better understand LT and to potentially harness its advantages for a practical balance aid, we investigated the effect of LT as provided by a haptic robot. Postural sway during standing balance was reduced when the LT force (~ 1 N) applied to the high back area was dependent on the trunk velocity. Additional information on trunk position, provided through orthogonal vibrations, further reduced the sway position-metric of balance but did not further improve the velocity-metric of balance. Our results suggest that limited and noisy information on trunk velocity encoded in LT is sufficient to influence standing balance."
https://openalex.org/W2985614858,"Positive attitudes towards ethnic-racial identity (ERI) is a key factor in Aboriginal Australian children's development. The present study aims to offer evidence of construct and criterion validity, reliability, and measurement invariance of a brief measure of Aboriginal children's ERI affirmation.Data was from 424 children aged 10-12 years (mean 10.5 years; SD 0.56) participating in the 8th wave of the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC). Information on ERI was obtained from 4 child-reported items. Sociodemographic characteristics and child social and emotional outcomes were caregiver-reported. A factorial structure was tested by Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The estimation method was weighted least squares with mean and variance adjusted test statistic (WLSMV). For reliability verification, the ordinal α and Ω hierarchical α were assessed. For construct validity, a generalized linear model with log-Poisson link estimated the association between ERI and children's social and emotional outcomes. We hypothesized that children with positive ERI would have lower behavioural and emotional difficulties.We found evidence of excellent fit for a unidimensional model of ERI affirmation after adjusting for correlated uniqueness between items 1 and 3 (χ2(2) = 0.06, p = 0.80; RMSEA = 0.000 [90% CI 0.000-0.080], p = 0.088; CFI = 1.000). Internal consistency reliability was considered adequate (ordinal α = 0.83; Ω hierarchical α = 0.72). The unidimensional model was shown to be invariant among boys and girls (Δχ2 (4) = 6.20, p = 0.18; ΔCFI = 0.000). Higher ERI was associated with lower risk of problematic scores (>17) on the SDQ (Risk Ratioa = 0.91, 95% CI 0.64, 1.29).The four LSIC items perform as a brief measure of Aboriginal children ERI affirmation among boys and girls. Results contribute much needed evidence for LSIC's ongoing success and to future research on Aboriginal children's development and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W2984947637,"Pollution prevention (P2) has become an integral part of the U.S. environmental policy that emphasizes the benefits of preventing pollution generation at the source over treatment or recycling after the generation of wastes. This study extends the existing literature on the effect of voluntary adoption of P2 in reducing toxic wastes by examining the extent to which it reduces pollution substitution. We use facility panel data from the Toxics Release Inventory from 1991 to 2011 to examine the effect of the adoption of P2 techniques on the ratios of water releases to air releases, amounts of treatment to total releases, and amounts of recycling to total releases while controlling for endogeneity of the adoption of P2 techniques and facility fixed effects. We find that the adoption of P2 techniques reduces toxic air and water releases equally, but it is associated with increases in treated and recycled wastes over total releases to the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2987069026,"Millions of children are suffering from tuberculosis (TB) worldwide and often end-up with fatal outcome especially in resource-poor settings. Tuberculin skin test (TST) is a conventionally used diagnostic test, less sensitive but highly specific for the diagnosis of clinical TB especially in undernourished children. However, we do not have any data on the role of TST positivity among the children who received nutritional intervention. Our aim was to examine the growth differences between TST-positive and TST-negative undernourished children aged 12 to 18 months who received nutritional intervention prospectively for 90 feeding days. Our further aim was to explore the determinants of TST positivity at enrollment. TB screening as one of the secondary causes of malnutrition was performed on 243 stunted [length for age Z score (LAZ) <-2 standard deviations] or at-risk of stunting (LAZ score between <-1 and -2 standard deviations) children in a community-based intervention study designed to improve their growth parameters. Differences of growth between TST-positives (n = 29) and TST-negatives (n = 214) were compared using paired samples t-test and multivariable linear regression from anthropometric data collected before and after nutritional intervention. Multivariable logistic regression was used to find out possible predictors of TST positivity using baseline sociodemographic data. Of the 243 children screened, 29 (11.9%) were TST-positive and 11 (4.5%) had clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB. Statistically significant improvement of LAZ and weight for age Z-score (WAZ) were observed among the TST-negative participants at the end of intervention period (p = 0.03 for LAZ and p = 0.01 for WAZ). However, we did not find any association between TST status and response to nutritional intervention in our multivariable linear regression models. Our study findings demonstrated a positive impact of nutritional intervention on growth parameters among TST-negative participants."
https://openalex.org/W2988066905,"The Kocher-Monro trajectory to the cerebral ventricular system represents one of the most common surgical procedures in the field of neurosurgery. Several studies have analyzed the specific white matter disruption produced during this intervention, which has no reported adverse neurological outcomes. In this study, a graph-theoretical approach was applied to quantify the structural alterations in whole-brain level connectivity. To this end, 132 subjects were randomly selected from the Human Connectome Project dataset and used to create 3 independent 44 subjects groups. Two of the groups underwent a simulated left/right Kocher-Monro trajectory and the third was kept as a control group. For the right Kocher-Monro approach, the nodal analysis revealed decreased strength in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the transected hemisphere. The network-based statistic analysis revealed a set of right lateralized subnetworks with decreased connectivity strength that is consistent with a subset of the Default Mode Network, Salience Network, and Cingulo-Opercular Network. These findings could allow for a better understanding of structural alterations caused by Kocher-Monro approaches that could reveal previously undetected clinical alterations and inform the process of designing safer and less invasive cerebral ventricular approaches."
