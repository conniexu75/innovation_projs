When Aspergillus flavus was grown on media containing nL-leucine-l-C~4, n-leucine-1-Cr4, uniformly labeled L-leucine-Cl4 or L-isoleucine-C!r4, significant amounts of radioactivity were found in mycelial leucine or isoleucine, and in aspergillic acid. 2 When the aspergillic acid isolated from medium containing nn-leucine-l-C4 was degraded to leucine and isoleucine isomers, the radioactivity was found in carbon atom 1 of leucine and none in the isoleucine isomers. 3. When the aspergillic acid isolated from medium containing uniformly labeled L-isoleucine-Cl4 and a small amount of leucine- Cl4 was degraded, most of the radioactivity was found in isoleu- tine isomers and a small amount in leucine. 4. The set-butyl side chain of aspergillic acid has the same optical configuration as that of carbon atom 3 of L-isoleucine. 5. The results support the hypothesis that aspergillic acid is synthesized by A. flavus from lcucine and isoleucine."

https://openalex.org/W2033941080,Discrepancies in the growth curves for the sodium requirement of the cricket indicate that hormology may play an important role in the response to essential nutrients as well as to toxic compounds. Differentiation between stimulation of growth by a nonnutritive action and support of growth by an essential nutrient is difficult.

Red fluorescence of uroporphyrin was observed localized in the epidermal rhabdites and subepidermal rhabdite-containing gland cells. Fluorescence was observed in isolated rhabdites of homogenates, but was not seen in rhabdites of the living animal. The identity of rhabdites was established by their location, shape, size, and acid-ophilic staining properties."

The increase of oxygen consumption after the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) is explained as being a result of dissociation between oxidative and phosphorylative processes. Similarly, thyroxine accelerates oxidation by uncoupling an oxidative phosphorylation. But DNP does not prevent the phenomena of hypothyroidism other than basal metabolism1, and fails to change lipid metabolism1,2 and nitrogen excretion, the effects of which are known to follow thyroxine administration1. Therefore, it was interesting to compare the effects of these agents on carbohydrate metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2041731604,"WORK upon Korotkov's sounds led me1 to the conclusion that the arterial system could be regarded as an energy transmission line, into which the heart launches energy at two levels, namely, waves with a frequency of 3–15 c.p.s. and waves with a frequency of 256–512 c.p.s. The theory required that the sound waves, resulting from forces of cavitation, be transmitted throughout the arteries, with a velocity much higher than that of the waves of low frequency, to explain the development of arterial stationary waves."
https://openalex.org/W1977390661,"THE difficulty of explaining conditioning in terms of a simple neuronal model has been discussed by Burns1. The problem lies in the fact that the only relatively long-lasting type of facilitation that has so far been experimentally demonstrated involves presynaptic terminals so that activity of neurones in the unconditioned reflex pathway cannot be expected to facilitate synaptic connexions from neurones which converge on to them from another afferent pathway, Eccles has proposed a rather complex neuronal model to avoid this difficulty2. Even this is admitted to be inadequate since it requires that the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli be applied simultaneously, and even then could only provide a low-level bombardment of the synapses which must be facilitated unless additional reverberating circuits are included. There is evidence to suggest that reverberating circuits do play a part in the early stages of conditioning3,4, but no complete model including them has been proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2065635357,"THE recent communication of Tewari and Bourne1 on the neurokeratin network of peripheral nerve fibres is valuable not only for its intrinsic content but also because it validates the histological procedures, findings and arguments derived therefrom, by which it was concluded that neurokeratin formations are part of the architecture of the nerve fibres and not artefacts2,3. It is sad to think that Nageotte4, who saw the structures in peripheral nerve fibres described by me2,3 and by Tewari and Bourne, looked on them as artefacts. One of the strongest anatomical arguments against the notion of artefact is that the disposition of neurokeratin in spinal cord axons and in the preterminal axons found in spinal cord, in brain stem and in cerebral and cerebellar cortices is quite different from that characteristic of peripheral nerve trunks, even although the material examined was fixed and prepared for sectioning under strictly comparable conditions in all instances."
https://openalex.org/W4247869309,"THE premise that linear and continuous sequences of nucleotides in the genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in most organisms, ribonucleic acid (RNA) in some viruses) specify corresponding linear and continuous sequences of amino-acids in the proteins, that is, the gene products of these organisms, is so fundamental to present-day thinking in the field of molecular biology that it has rightfully been referred to as the ‘central dogma’1,2. Another premise, inherent in this dogma, is the principle of colinearity of the genetic map with the nucleotide sequence and the definition of a mutation as an alteration in this sequence giving rise in turn to an altered structure in the product proteins. The conclusion has therefore been implicit that every mutation must necessarily result in some alteration in a gene product."
