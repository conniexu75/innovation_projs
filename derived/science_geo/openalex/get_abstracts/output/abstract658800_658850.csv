https://openalex.org/W3082694457,"Influenza viruses remain a major public health threat. Seasonal influenza vaccination in humans primarily stimulates pre-existing memory B cells, which differentiate into a transient wave of circulating antibody-secreting plasmablasts1-3. This recall response contributes to 'original antigenic sin'-the selective increase of antibody species elicited by previous exposures to influenza virus antigens4. It remains unclear whether such vaccination can also induce germinal centre reactions in the draining lymph nodes, where diversification and maturation of recruited B cells can occur5. Here we used ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration to serially sample the draining lymph nodes and investigate the dynamics and specificity of germinal centre B cell responses after influenza vaccination in humans. Germinal centre B cells that bind to influenza vaccine could be detected as early as one week after vaccination. In three out of eight participants, we detected vaccine-binding germinal centre B cells up to nine weeks after vaccination. Between 12% and 88% of the responding germinal centre B cell clones overlapped with B cells detected among early circulating plasmablasts. These shared B cell clones had high frequencies of somatic hypermutation and encoded broadly cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. By contrast, vaccine-induced B cell clones detected only in the germinal centre compartment exhibited significantly lower frequencies of somatic hypermutation and predominantly encoded strain-specific monoclonal antibodies, which suggests a naive B cell origin. Some of these strain-specific monoclonal antibodies recognized epitopes that were not targeted by the early plasmablast response. Thus, influenza virus vaccination in humans can elicit a germinal centre reaction that recruits B cell clones that can target new epitopes, thereby broadening the spectrum of vaccine-induced protective antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3082740036,"Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that is caused by the accumulation of oxidized phospholipids, leading to membrane damage and cell lysis1,2. Although other types of necrotic death such as pyroptosis and necroptosis are mediated by active mechanisms of execution3-6, ferroptosis is thought to result from the accumulation of unrepaired cell damage1. Previous studies have suggested that ferroptosis has the ability to spread through cell populations in a wave-like manner, resulting in a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of cell death7,8. Here we investigate the mechanism of ferroptosis execution and discover that ferroptotic cell rupture is mediated by plasma membrane pores, similarly to cell lysis in pyroptosis and necroptosis3,4. We further find that intercellular propagation of death occurs following treatment with some ferroptosis-inducing agents, including erastin2,9 and C' dot nanoparticles8, but not upon direct inhibition of the ferroptosis-inhibiting enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)10. Propagation of a ferroptosis-inducing signal occurs upstream of cell rupture and involves the spreading of a cell swelling effect through cell populations in a lipid peroxide- and iron-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3081828282,"Cellular metabolism regulates immune cell activation, differentiation and effector functions, but current metabolic approaches lack single-cell resolution and simultaneous characterization of cellular phenotype. In this study, we developed an approach to characterize the metabolic regulome of single cells together with their phenotypic identity. The method, termed single-cell metabolic regulome profiling (scMEP), quantifies proteins that regulate metabolic pathway activity using high-dimensional antibody-based technologies. We employed mass cytometry (cytometry by time of flight, CyTOF) to benchmark scMEP against bulk metabolic assays by reconstructing the metabolic remodeling of in vitro-activated naive and memory CD8+ T cells. We applied the approach to clinical samples and identified tissue-restricted, metabolically repressed cytotoxic T cells in human colorectal carcinoma. Combining our method with multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF), we uncovered the spatial organization of metabolic programs in human tissues, which indicated exclusion of metabolically repressed immune cells from the tumor-immune boundary. Overall, our approach enables robust approximation of metabolic and functional states in individual cells."
https://openalex.org/W3082794621,"Aberrant aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in neurons is a hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degeneration caused by haploinsufficiency in the gene encoding progranulin1,2. However, the mechanism leading to TDP-43 proteinopathy remains unclear. Here we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that progranulin deficiency promotes microglial transition from a homeostatic to a disease-specific state that causes endolysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration in mice. These defects persist even when Grn-/- microglia are cultured ex vivo. In addition, single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals selective loss of excitatory neurons at disease end-stage, which is characterized by prominent nuclear and cytoplasmic TDP-43 granules and nuclear pore defects. Remarkably, conditioned media from Grn-/- microglia are sufficient to promote TDP-43 granule formation, nuclear pore defects and cell death in excitatory neurons via the complement activation pathway. Consistent with these results, deletion of the genes encoding C1qa and C3 mitigates microglial toxicity and rescues TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration. These results uncover previously unappreciated contributions of chronic microglial toxicity to TDP-43 proteinopathy during neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3082986453,"Juvenile social isolation reduces sociability in adulthood, but the underlying neural circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that, in male mice, 2 weeks of social isolation immediately following weaning leads to a failure to activate medial prefrontal cortex neurons projecting to the posterior paraventricular thalamus (mPFC→pPVT) during social exposure in adulthood. Chemogenetic or optogenetic suppression of mPFC→pPVT activity in adulthood was sufficient to induce sociability deficits without affecting anxiety-related behaviors or preference toward rewarding food. Juvenile isolation led to both reduced excitability of mPFC→pPVT neurons and increased inhibitory input drive from low-threshold-spiking somatostatin interneurons in adulthood, suggesting a circuit mechanism underlying sociability deficits. Chemogenetic or optogenetic stimulation of mPFC→pPVT neurons in adulthood could rescue the sociability deficits caused by juvenile isolation. Our study identifies a pair of specific medial prefrontal cortex excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations required for sociability that are profoundly affected by juvenile social experience. Yamamuro et al. show that juvenile social isolation disrupts prefrontal neurons projecting to the paraventricular thalamus and associated prefrontal somatostatin interneurons, and thereby impairs sociability in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2884505086,"Background Cancer care represents a substantial and rapidly rising healthcare cost in Australia. Our aim was to provide accurate population-based estimates of the health services cost of cancer care using large-scale linked patient-level data. Methods We analysed data for incident cancers diagnosed 2006–2010 and followed to 2014 among 266,793 eligible participants in the 45 and Up Study. Health system costs included Medicare and pharmaceutical claims, inpatient hospital episodes and emergency department presentations. Costs for cancer cases and matched cancer-free controls were compared, to estimate monthly/annual excess costs of cancer care by cancer type, before and after diagnosis and by phase of care (initial, continuing, terminal). Total costs incurred in 2013 were also estimated for all people diagnosed in Australia 2009–2013. Results 7624 participants diagnosed with cancer were matched with up to three controls. The mean excess cost of care per case was AUD$1,622 for the year before diagnosis, $33,944 for the first year post-diagnosis and $8,796 for the second year post-diagnosis, with considerable variation by cancer type. Mean annual cost after the initial treatment phase was $4,474/case and the mean cost for the last year of life was $49,733/case. In 2013 the cost for cancers among people in Australia diagnosed during 2009–2013 was ~$6.3billion (0.4% of Gross Domestic Product; $272 per capita), with the largest costs for colorectal cancer ($1.1billion), breast cancer ($0.8billion), lung cancer ($0.6billion) and prostate cancer ($0.5billion). Conclusions The cost of cancer care is substantial and varies by cancer type and time since diagnosis. These findings emphasise the economic importance of effective primary and secondary cancer prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3082264507,"FOXA1 functions as a pioneer transcription factor by facilitating the access to chromatin for steroid hormone receptors, such as androgen receptor and estrogen receptor1-4, but mechanisms regulating its binding to chromatin remain elusive. LSD1 (KDM1A) acts as a transcriptional repressor by demethylating mono/dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2)5,6, but also acts as a steroid hormone receptor coactivator through mechanisms that are unclear. Here we show, in prostate cancer cells, that LSD1 associates with FOXA1 and active enhancer markers, and that LSD1 inhibition globally disrupts FOXA1 chromatin binding. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LSD1 positively regulates FOXA1 binding by demethylating lysine 270, adjacent to the wing2 region of the FOXA1 DNA-binding domain. Acting through FOXA1, LSD1 inhibition broadly disrupted androgen-receptor binding and its transcriptional output, and dramatically decreased prostate cancer growth alone and in synergy with androgen-receptor antagonist treatment in vivo. These mechanistic insights suggest new therapeutic strategies in steroid-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3082935000,"Introduction Residency applications via virtual-interview could potentially mitigate the extensive cost and time required for customary in-person interviews. We outline the perception of medical students and residents on the use of virtual-interview for residency applications in lieu of in-person interviews. Methods We obtained 1824 responses from medical students and residents through an online questionnaire between March2019-Feb2020 in Texas-United States. The survey had 11 statements (five in favor of in-person interviews and 6 in favor of virtual interviews) that respondents could rank on a 5-point Likert scale. All statements’ scores were summed based on the response given by each participant to create a total score between 11 and 55. The perception of the two groups was analyzed using an independent sample T-test and ANOVA. Results We received a total of 1711 responses from medical students and 113 from medical residents. Respondents were more female (82.2% of medical students and 47.8% of residents), with a mean age of 22.87±3.42 years old for medical students and 28.72±4.35 years old for residents. Both groups preferred in-person interviews; however, the residents were significantly more in favor (P = 0.03). Both groups agree that virtual-interviews should be as an option, though this was considerably higher in the medical students (P = 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, “travel distance” and “type of medical school” had a significant impact on choosing the virtual-interviews in both groups (p<0.01). Conclusions In-person interviews are favored by both medical students and residents compared to virtual-interview services in normal circumstances. However, both groups agree that programs should offer the option of having virtual-interviews as an available choice. Distance to an interview location and the type of medical school were the factors that had a significant impact on perception of using virtual-interviews. Knowing about the applicants’ attitude toward residency interviews and the national circumstances are essential when preparing the interview guides. Our findings are limited by the small sample size and the low response rate. Further extensive studies are warranted to better understand the perception of residency applicants toward virtual-interviews to improve the interview process in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W3082756623,"Rapid wound detection by distant leukocytes is essential for antimicrobial defence and post-infection survival1. The reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide and the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid are among the earliest known mediators of this process2-4. It is unknown whether or how these highly conserved cues collaborate to achieve wound detection over distances of several hundreds of micrometres within a few minutes. To investigate this, we locally applied arachidonic acid and skin-permeable peroxide by micropipette perfusion to unwounded zebrafish tail fins. As in wounds, arachidonic acid rapidly attracted leukocytes through dual oxidase (Duox) and 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5a). Peroxide promoted chemotaxis to arachidonic acid without being chemotactic on its own. Intravital biosensor imaging showed that wound peroxide and arachidonic acid converged on half-millimetre-long lipid peroxidation gradients that promoted leukocyte attraction. Our data suggest that lipid peroxidation functions as a spatial redox relay that enables long-range detection of early wound cues by immune cells, outlining a beneficial role for this otherwise toxic process."
https://openalex.org/W3081657721,"The translational power of human microbiome studies is limited by high interindividual variation. We describe a dimensionality reduction tool, compositional tensor factorization (CTF), that incorporates information from the same host across multiple samples to reveal patterns driving differences in microbial composition across phenotypes. CTF identifies robust patterns in sparse compositional datasets, allowing for the detection of microbial changes associated with specific phenotypes that are reproducible across datasets. Gut microbiome composition is associated with phenotypes as revealed by a dimensionality reduction tool."
https://openalex.org/W3082154494,"The nuclear receptor-binding SET domain (NSD) family of histone methyltransferases is associated with various malignancies, including aggressive acute leukemia with NUP98-NSD1 translocation. While NSD proteins represent attractive drug targets, their catalytic SET domains exist in autoinhibited conformation, presenting notable challenges for inhibitor development. Here, we employed a fragment-based screening strategy followed by chemical optimization, which resulted in the development of the first-in-class irreversible small-molecule inhibitors of the nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) SET domain. The crystal structure of NSD1 in complex with covalently bound ligand reveals a conformational change in the autoinhibitory loop of the SET domain and formation of a channel-like pocket suitable for targeting with small molecules. Our covalent lead—compound BT5—demonstrates on-target activity in NUP98-NSD1 leukemia cells, including inhibition of histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation and downregulation of target genes, and impaired colony formation in an NUP98-NSD1 patient sample. This study will facilitate the development of the next generation of potent and selective inhibitors of the NSD histone methyltransferases. An irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of histone methyltransferase NSD1 is developed, which binds covalently to the C2062 residue in the catalytic SET domain and represses H3K36 dimethylation and target gene expression in leukemia cells."
https://openalex.org/W3081862669,"An effective strategy to cure HIV will likely require a potent and sustained antiviral T cell response. Here we explored the utility of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, expressing the CD4 ectodomain to confer specificity for the HIV envelope, to mitigate HIV-induced pathogenesis in bone marrow, liver, thymus (BLT) humanized mice. CAR T cells expressing the 4-1BB/CD3-ζ endodomain were insufficient to prevent viral rebound and CD4+ T cell loss after the discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. Through iterative improvements to the CAR T cell product, we developed Dual-CAR T cells that simultaneously expressed both 4-1BB/CD3-ζ and CD28/CD3-ζ endodomains. Dual-CAR T cells exhibited expansion kinetics that exceeded 4-1BB-, CD28- and third-generation costimulated CAR T cells, elicited effector functions equivalent to CD28-costimulated CAR T cells and prevented HIV-induced CD4+ T cell loss despite persistent viremia. Moreover, when Dual-CAR T cells were protected from HIV infection through expression of the C34-CXCR4 fusion inhibitor, these cells significantly reduced acute-phase viremia, as well as accelerated HIV suppression in the presence of antiretroviral therapy and reduced tissue viral burden. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the enhanced therapeutic potency of a novel Dual-CAR T cell product with the potential to effectively treat HIV infection."

https://openalex.org/W3082341865,"Animal chromosomes are partitioned into contact domains. Pathogenic domain disruptions can result from chromosomal rearrangements or perturbation of architectural factors. However, such broad-scale alterations are insufficient to define the minimal requirements for domain formation. Moreover, to what extent domains can be engineered is just beginning to be explored. In an attempt to create contact domains, we inserted a 2-kb DNA sequence underlying a tissue-invariant domain boundary-containing a CTCF-binding site (CBS) and a transcription start site (TSS)-into 16 ectopic loci across 11 chromosomes, and characterized its architectural impact. Depending on local constraints, this fragment variably formed new domains, partitioned existing ones, altered compartmentalization and initiated contacts reflecting chromatin loop extrusion. Deletions of the CBS or the TSS individually or in combination within inserts revealed its distinct contributions to genome folding. Altogether, short DNA insertions can suffice to shape the spatial genome in a manner influenced by chromatin context."
https://openalex.org/W3082751836,"Bone scaffolds are widely used as one of the main bone substitute materials. However, many bone scaffold microstructure topologies exist and it is still unclear which topology to use when designing scaffold for a specific application. The aim of the present study was to reveal the mechanism of the microstructure-driven performance of bone scaffold and thus to provide guideline on scaffold design. Finite element (FE) models of five TPMS (Diamond, Gyroid, Schwarz P, Fischer-Koch S and F-RD) and three traditional (Cube, FD-Cube and Octa) scaffolds were generated. The effective compressive and shear moduli of scaffolds were calculated from the mechanical analysis using the FE unit cell models with the periodic boundary condition. The scaffold permeability was calculated from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis using the 4×4×4 FE models. It is revealed that the surface-to-volume ratio of the Fischer-Koch S-based scaffold is the highest among the scaffolds investigated. The mechanical analysis revealed that the bending deformation dominated structures (e.g., the Diamond, the Gyroid, the Schwarz P) have higher effective shear moduli. The stretching deformation dominated structures (e.g., the Schwarz P, the Cube) have higher effective compressive moduli. For all the scaffolds, when the same amount of change in scaffold porosity is made, the corresponding change in the scaffold relative shear modulus is larger than that in the relative compressive modulus. The CFD analysis revealed that the structures with the simple and straight pores (e.g., Cube) have higher permeability than the structures with the complex pores (e.g., Fischer-Koch S). The main contribution of the present study is that the relationship between scaffold properties and the underlying microstructure is systematically investigated and thus some guidelines on the design of bone scaffolds are provided, for example, in the scenario where a high surface-to-volume ratio is required, it is suggested to use the Fischer-Koch S based scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W3081697295,"Malaria represents one of the most common infectious diseases which becoming an impellent public health problem worldwide. Antimalarial classical medications include quinine-based drugs, like chloroquine, and artesunate, a derivative of artemisinin, a molecule found in the plant Artemisia annua. Such therapeutics are very effective but show heavy side effects like drug resistance. In this study, “green” silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been prepared from two Artemisia species (A. abrotanum and A. arborescens), traditionally used in folk medicine as a remedy for different conditions, and their potential antimalarial efficacy have been assessed. AgNPs have been characterized by UV-Vis, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential, FTIR, XRD, TEM and EDX. The structural characterization has demonstrated the spheroidal shape of nanoparticles and dimensions under 50 nm, useful for biomedical studies. Zeta potential analysis have shown the stability and dispersion of green AgNPs in aqueous medium without aggregation. AgNPs hemocompatibility and antimalarial activity have been studied in Plasmodium falciparum cultures in in vitro experiments. The antiplasmodial effect has been assessed using increasing doses of AgNPs (0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL) on parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs). Obtained data showed that the hemocompatibility of AgNPs is related to their synthetic route and depends on the administered dose. A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have shown the lowest percentage of hemolytic activity on pRBCs, underlining their hemocompatibility. These results are in accordance with the lower levels of parasitemia observed after A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) treatment respect to A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), and AgNPs (3) derived from a classical chemical synthesis. Moreover, after 24 and 48 hours of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) treatment, the parasite growth was locked in the ring stage, evidencing the effect of these nanoparticles to hinder the maturation of P. falciparum. The anti-malarial activity of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) on pRBCs was demonstrated to be higher than that of A. arborescens-AgNPs (2)."
https://openalex.org/W3082372457,"Validation of heart rate responses in wearable technology devices is generally composed of laboratory-based protocols that are steady state in nature and as a result, high accuracy measures are returned. However, there is a need to understand device validity in applied settings that include varied intensities of exercise. The purpose was to determine concurrent heart rate validity during trail running. Twenty-one healthy participants volunteered (female n = 10, [mean (SD)]: age = 31 [11] years, height = 173.0 [7] cm, mass = 75.6 [13] kg). Participants were outfitted with wearable technology devices (Garmin Fenix 5 wristwatch, Jabra Elite Sport earbuds, Motiv ring, Scosche Rhythm+ forearm band, Suunto Spartan Sport watch with accompanying chest strap) and completed a self-paced 3.22 km trail run while concurrently wearing a criterion heart rate strap (Polar H7 heart rate monitor). The trail runs were out-and-back with the first 1.61 km in an uphill direction, and the 1.61 return being downhill in nature. Validity was determined through three methods: Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement (LOA), and Lin's Concordance Coefficient (rC). Validity measures overall are as follows: Garmin Fenix 5 (MAPE = 13%, LOA = -32 to 162, rC = 0.32), Jabra Elite Sport (MAPE = 23%, LOA = -464 to 503, rC = 0.38), Motiv ring (MAPE = 16%, LOA = -52 to 96, rC = 0.29), Scosche Rhythm+ (MAPE = 6%, LOA = -114 to 120, rC = 0.79), Suunto Spartan Sport (MAPE = 2%, LOA = -62 to 61, rC = 0.96). All photoplethysmography-based (PPG) devices displayed poor heart rate agreement during variable intensity trail running. Until technological advances occur in PPG-based devices allowing for acceptable agreement, heart rate in outdoor environments should be obtained using an ECG-based chest strap that can be connected to a wristwatch or other comparable receiver."
https://openalex.org/W3082519874,"Tonsillectomy is a commonly performed surgical procedure worldwide; however, the possible long-term consequences have not been fully explored. The tonsils are secondary lymphoid tissue providing a defensive barrier against pathogens. There are few data in the literature on the relationship between prior tonsillectomy and the risk of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing IBS in patients who underwent tonsillectomy using a nationwide longitudinal population-based cohort. We identified 1300 patients with tonsillectomy and 2600 matched controls from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Research Database of the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Propensity score analysis was used for matching age, gender, comorbidities, medications, and index year at a ratio of 1:2. Multiple Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio of IBS. Furthermore, sensitivity tests and a stratified analysis were conducted. The incidence of IBS was 3 per 1,000 person-years in tonsillectomy patients, which was higher than the rate of 1.8 per 1,000 person-years found in non-tonsillectomy patients. After adjustment for patients’ age, gender, comorbidities, and medications, patients who underwent tonsillectomy had a 1.84-fold risk of developing IBS compared to those without tonsillectomy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]:1.84; 95% CI, 1.09–3.09). Stratified analysis revealed that a higher adjusted HR of 3.79 (95% CI, 1.35–10.64) in patients ≥50 years old, and there was a marginally significantly higher adjusted HR of 1.98 (95% CI, 0.99–3.95) of developing IBS when the follow-up period was longer than 3 years. Tonsillectomy was associated with a higher risk of developing IBS. Physicians should provide appropriate monitoring of IBS in patients undergoing tonsillectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3081694861,"Background There is a need for a rapid diagnostic point of care test to detect Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection to prevent incorrect, lack or excess of treatment resulting from current syndromic management in low-resource settings. An assay to identify NG antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is also highly desirable to facilitate antibiotic stewardship. Here we describe the development of two target product profiles (TPPs): one for a test for etiological diagnosis of NG and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (TPP1) and one for the detection of NG AMR/susceptibility (TPP2). Methods Draft TPPs were initially developed based on a landscape analysis of existing diagnostics and expert input. TPPs were refined via an online Delphi survey with two rounds of input from 68 respondents. TPP characteristics on which <75% of non-industry respondents agreed were further discussed and revised by an expert working group. Results The need for a test to identify NG in patients with urethral or vaginal discharge was identified as a minimal requirement of TPP1, with a test that can diagnose NG in asymptomatic patients as the optimal requirement. A sensitivity of 80% was considered acceptable, either in context of syndromic management or screening high-risk populations. For TPP2, the agreed minimal requirement was for a test to be used at level 2 healthcare facilities and above, with an optimal requirement of level 1 or above. A lateral flow format was preferred for TPP1, while it was considered likely that TPP2 would require a molecular format. A total of 31 test characteristics were included in TPP1 and 27 in TPP2. Conclusions Following the working group revisions, TPPs were posted online for public feedback for two months, and are now finalized. The final TPPs are currently guiding the development of new diagnostics that meet the defined characteristics to reach the market within two years."
https://openalex.org/W3081994909,"The paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein-1 (MALT1) regulates nuclear-factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) activation downstream of surface receptors with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), such as the B-cell or T-cell receptor and has thus emerged as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. However, recent reports demonstrate the development of lethal autoimmune inflammation due to the excessive production of interferon gamma (IFN-ɣ) and defective differentiation of regulatory T-cells in genetically modified mice deficient in MALT1 paracaspase activity. To address this issue, we explored the effects of pharmacological MALT1 inhibition on the balance between T-effector and regulatory T-cells. Here we demonstrate that allosteric inhibition of MALT1 suppressed Th1, Th17 and Th1/Th17 effector responses, and inhibited T-cell dependent B-cell proliferation and antibody production. Allosteric MALT1 inhibition did not interfere with the suppressive function of human T-regulatory cells, although it impaired de novo differentiation of regulatory T-cells from naïve T-cells. Treatment with an allosteric MALT1 inhibitor alleviated the cytokine storm, including IFN-ɣ, in a mouse model of acute T-cell activation, and long-term treatment did not lead to an increase in IFN-ɣ producing CD4 cells or tissue inflammation. Together, our data demonstrate that the effects of allosteric inhibition of MALT1 differ from those seen in mice with proteolytically inactive MALT1, and thus we believe that MALT1 is a viable target for B and T-cell driven autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3081877842,"Although endocranial abnormal blood vessel impressions (ABVIs) and periosteal appositions (PAs) have been considered as paleopathological diagnostic criteria for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) based on findings of previous studies, they are not pathognomonic for tuberculosis (TB). Therefore, their utilization in the paleopathological practice can be questioned, especially in consideration that most of the previous studies were not performed on identified skeletal collections but on osteoarchaeological material and did not include statistical data analysis. To fill the aforementioned research gap, for the first time, a macroscopic investigation was conducted on identified pre-antibiotic era skeletons from the Terry Collection. A sample set of 234 individuals who died of TB (TB group) and 193 individuals who died of non-tuberculous causes (NTB group) were examined. The frequency of ABVIs and PAs, as well as other probable TB-related lesions was recorded. To determine the significance of difference (if any) in the frequencies of ABVIs and PAs between the two groups, χ2 testing of our data was performed. We found that ABVIs, PAs, and their co-occurrence with each other and with other probable TB-related lesions were more common in the TB group than in the NTB group. In addition, the χ2 comparative frequencies of ABVIs and PAs revealed a statistically significant difference between individuals who died of TB and individuals who died of NTB causes. Our findings strengthen those of previous studies that ABVIs and PAs are not specific to TBM but can be of tuberculous origin. Therefore, they do have a diagnostic value in the identification of TB in human osteoarchaeological material, especially when they simultaneously occur with other probable TB-related lesions. Their prudent utilization provides paleopathologists with a stronger basis for diagnosing TB and consequently, a more sensitive means of assessing TB frequency in past human populations."
https://openalex.org/W3081597757,"Breast cancer progression is accompanied by increased expression of extracellular and cell-surface proteases capable of degrading the extracellular matrix as well as cleaving and activating downstream targets. The type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) are a family of cell-surface proteases that play critical roles in numerous types of cancers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify novel and uncharacterized TTSPs with differential expression in breast cancer and to determine their potential roles in progression. Systematic in silico data analysis followed by immunohistochemical validation identified increased expression of the TTSP family member, TMPRSS13 (transmembrane protease, serine 13), in invasive ductal carcinoma patient tissue samples compared to normal breast tissue. To test whether loss of TMPRSS13 impacts tumor progression, TMPRSS13 was genetically ablated in the oncogene-induced transgenic MMTV-PymT tumor model. TMPRSS13 deficiency resulted in a significant decrease in overall tumor burden and growth rate, as well as a delayed formation of detectable mammary tumors, thus suggesting a causal relationship between TMPRSS13 expression and the progression of breast cancer. Complementary studies using human breast cancer cell culture models revealed that siRNA-mediated silencing of TMPRSS13 expression decreases proliferation, induces apoptosis, and attenuates invasion. Importantly, targeting TMPRSS13 expression renders aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell lines highly responsive to chemotherapy. At the molecular level, knockdown of TMPRSS13 in breast cancer cells led to increased protein levels of the tumor-suppressive protease prostasin. TMPRSS13/prostasin co-immunoprecipitation and prostasin zymogen activation experiments identified prostasin as a potential novel target for TMPRSS13. Regulation of prostasin levels may be a mechanism that contributes to the pro-oncogenic properties of TMPRSS13 in breast cancer. TMPRSS13 represents a novel candidate for targeted therapy in combination with standard of care chemotherapy agents in patients with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer or in patients with tumors refractory to endocrine therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3081528932,"The multifactorial aspects of breastfeeding require measures at many levels to identify mothers in need of breastfeeding support from healthcare professionals. Our objective was to examine the relative importance of sociodemographic, pre/perinatal-, infant-, psychosocial-, and interaction-related factors affecting duration of exclusive breastfeeding. We used self-reported data from a community-based trial including 1265 women (response rate 49%) giving birth from January 2017 to February 2018. Data on outcome, duration of exclusive breastfeeding, were collected three and nine months postpartum; data on the study variables concerning known risk factors for breastfeeding cessation were collected two weeks postpartum. Crude and multiple Cox proportional hazards models were used for statistical analyses with additional analyses for time varying effects. Factors with an independent prognostic influence on duration of exclusive breastfeeding in fully adjusted models included early skin-to-skin contact (HR = 1.18 CI:1.04-1.33), intention to breastfeed (HR = 0.77 CI: 0.73-0.80), positive outcome evaluation, meaning the value mothers attributed to breastfeeding (HR = 1.33 CI: 1.08-1.63), higher level of self-efficacy (HR = 1.46 CI: 1.24-1.72), and maternal sense of security in relation to breastfeeding (HR = 1.31 CI: 1.14-1.50). Higher maternal BMI, lower self-efficacy, shorter breastfeeding duration of previous child, and hospitalization during birth were time dependent by affecting the exclusive breastfeeding duration primarily in the first months following birth. The results suggest that target groups in special need of early breastfeeding support are defined by being hospitalized, obese, having low self-efficacy or short previous breastfeeding experience.

Although earlier studies have examined the effect of increased β-amyloid (Aβ) on Cx43 expression and function leading to neuronal damage, underlying mechanisms by which Aβ modulates Cx43 in astrocytes remain elusive. Here, using mouse primary astrocyte cultures, we have examined the cellular processes by which Aβ can alter Cx43 gap junctions. We show that Aβ25-35 impairs functional gap junction coupling yet increases hemichannel activity. Interestingly, Aβ25-35 increased the intracellular pool of Cx43 with a parallel decrease in gap junction assembly at the surface. Intracellular Cx43 was found to be partly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated cell compartments. However, forward trafficking of the newly synthesized Cx43 that already reached the Golgi was not affected in Aβ25-35-exposed astrocytes. Supporting this, treatment with 4-phenylbutyrate, a well-known chemical chaperone that improves trafficking of several transmembrane proteins, restored Aβ-induced impaired gap junction coupling between astrocytes. We further show that interruption of Cx43 endocytosis in Aβ25-35-exposed astrocytes resulted in their retention at the cell surface in the form of functional gap junctions indicating that Aβ25-35 causes rapid internalization of Cx43 gap junctions. Additionally, in silico molecular docking suggests that Aβ can bind favorably to Cx43. Our study thus provides novel insights into the cellular mechanisms by which Aβ modulates Cx43 function in astrocytes, the basic understanding of which is vital for the development of alternative therapeutic strategy targeting connexin channels in AD."

The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of several genes to the pathophysiology of early onset Parkinson’s disease in a cohort from central Spain. Methods/patients We analyzed a cohort of 117 unrelated patients with early onset Parkinson’s disease using a pipeline, based on a combination of a next-generation sequencing panel of 17 genes previously related with Parkinson’s disease and other Parkinsonisms and CNV screening. Results Twenty-six patients (22.22%) carried likely pathogenic variants in PARK2, LRRK2, PINK1, or GBA. The gene most frequently mutated was PARK2, and p.Asn52Metfs*29 was the most common variation in this gene. Pathogenic variants were not observed in genes SNCA, FBXO7, PARK7, HTRA2, DNAJC6, PLA2G6, and UCHL1. Co-occurrence of pathogenic variants involving two genes was observed in ATP13A2 and PARK2 genes, as well as LRRK2 and GIGYF2 genes. Conclusions Our results contribute to the understanding of the genetic architecture associated with early onset Parkinson’s disease, showing both PARK2 and LRRK2 play an important role in Spanish Parkinson’s disease patients. Rare variants in ATP13A2 and GIGYF2 may contribute to PD risk. However, a large proportion of genetic components remains unknown. This study might contribute to genetic diagnosis and counseling for families with early onset Parkinson’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W3082593626,"The widespread legalization of Cannabis has opened the industry to using contemporary analytical techniques for chemotype analysis. Chemotypic data has been collected on a large variety of oil profiles inherent to the cultivars that are commercially available. The unknown gene regulation and pharmacokinetics of dozens of cannabinoids offer opportunities of high interest in pharmacology research. Retailers in many medical and recreational jurisdictions are typically required to report chemical concentrations of at least some cannabinoids. Commercial cannabis laboratories have collected large chemotype datasets of diverse Cannabis cultivars. In this work a data set of 17,600 cultivars tested by Steep Hill Inc., is examined using machine learning techniques to interpolate missing chemotype observations and cluster cultivars into groups based on chemotype similarity. The results indicate cultivars cluster based on their chemotypes, and that some imputation methods work better than others at grouping these cultivars based on chemotypic identity. Due to the missing data and to the low signal to noise ratio for some less common cannabinoids, their behavior could not be accurately predicted. These findings have implications for characterizing complex interactions in cannabinoid biosynthesis and improving phenotypical classification of Cannabis cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W3081954053,"Dental enamel, the hardest tissue in the human body, is derived from dental epithelial cell ameloblast-secreted enamel matrices. Enamel mineralization occurs in a strictly synchronized manner along with ameloblast maturation in association with ion transport and pH balance, and any disruption of these processes results in enamel hypomineralization. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) function as transducers of external signals by activating associated G proteins and regulate cellular physiology. Tissue-specific GPCRs play important roles in organ development, although their activities in tooth development remain poorly understood. The present results show that the adhesion GPCR Gpr115 (Adgrf4) is highly and preferentially expressed in mature ameloblasts and plays a crucial role during enamel mineralization. To investigate the in vivo function of Gpr115, knockout (Gpr115-KO) mice were created and found to develop hypomineralized enamel, with a larger acidic area because of the dysregulation of ion composition. Transcriptomic analysis also revealed that deletion of Gpr115 disrupted pH homeostasis and ion transport processes in enamel formation. In addition, in vitro analyses using the dental epithelial cell line cervical loop-derived dental epithelial (CLDE) cell demonstrated that Gpr115 is indispensable for the expression of carbonic anhydrase 6 (Car6), which has a critical role in enamel mineralization. Furthermore, an acidic condition induced Car6 expression under the regulation of Gpr115 in CLDE cells. Thus, we concluded that Gpr115 plays an important role in enamel mineralization via regulation of Car6 expression in ameloblasts. The present findings indicate a novel function of Gpr115 in ectodermal organ development and clarify the molecular mechanism of enamel formation."
https://openalex.org/W3082065216,"Changing institutional culture to be more diverse and inclusive within the biomedical academic community is difficult for many reasons. Herein we present evidence that a collaborative model involving multiple institutions of higher education can initiate and execute individual institutional change directed at enhancing diversity and inclusion at the postdoctoral researcher (postdoc) and junior faculty level by implementing evidence-based mentoring practices. A higher education consortium, the Big Ten Academic Alliance, invited individual member institutions to send participants to one of two types of annual mentor training: 1) “Mentoring-Up” training for postdocs, a majority of whom were from underrepresented groups; 2) Mentor Facilitator training—a train-the-trainer model—for faculty and senior leadership. From 2016 to 2019, 102 postdocs and 160 senior faculty and administrative leaders participated. Postdocs reported improvements in their mentoring proficiency (87%) and improved relationships with their PIs (71%). 29% of postdoc respondents transitioned to faculty positions, and 85% of these were underrepresented and 75% were female. 59 out of the 120 faculty and administrators (49%) trained in the first three years provided mentor training on their campuses to over 3000 undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs and faculty within the project period. We conclude that early stage biomedical professionals as well as individual institutions of higher education benefited significantly from this collaborative mentee/mentor training model"
https://openalex.org/W3082624594,"Dendrobium bibenzyls and phenanthrenes such as chrysotoxine, cypripedin, gigantol and moscatilin have been reported to show promising inhibitory effects on lung cancer growth and metastasis in ex vivo human cell line models, suggesting their potential for clinical application in patients with lung cancer. However, it remains to be determined whether these therapeutic effects can be also seen in primary human cells and/or in vivo. In this study, we comparatively investigated the immune modulatory effects of bibenzyls and phenanthrenes, including a novel Dendrobium bibenzyl derivative, in primary human monocytes. All compounds were isolated and purified from a Thai orchid Dendrobium lindleyi Steud, a new source of therapeutic compounds with promising potential of tissue culture production. We detected increased frequencies of TNF- and IL-6-expressing monocytes after treatment with gigantol and cypripedin, whereas chrysotoxine and moscatilin did not alter the expression of these cytokines in monocytes. Interestingly, the new 4,5-dihydroxy-3,3′,4′-trimethoxybibenzyl derivative showed dose-dependent immune modulatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated CD14lo and CD14hi monocytes. Together, our findings show immune modulatory effects of the new bibenzyl derivative from Dendrobium lindleyi on different monocyte sub-populations. However, therapeutic consequences of these different monocyte populations on human diseases including cancer remain to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W4237787922,"Background Of all cancer types, healthcare for lung cancer is the third most costly in Australia, but there is little detailed information about these costs. Our aim was to provide detailed population-based estimates of health system costs for lung cancer care, as a benchmark prior to wider availability of targeted therapies/immunotherapy and to inform cost-effectiveness analyses of lung cancer screening and other interventions in Australia. Methods Health system costs were estimated for incident lung cancers in the Australian 45 and Up Study cohort, diagnosed between recruitment (2006–2009) and 2013. Costs to June 2016 included services reimbursed via the Medicare Benefits Schedule, medicines reimbursed via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, inpatient hospitalisations, and emergency department presentations. Costs for cases and matched, cancer-free controls were compared to derive excess costs of care. Costs were disaggregated by patient and tumour characteristics. Data for more recent cases identified in hospital records provided preliminary information on targeted therapy/immunotherapy. Results 994 eligible cases were diagnosed with lung cancer 2006–2013; 51% and 74% died within one and three years respectively. Excess costs from one-year pre-diagnosis to three years post-diagnosis averaged ~$51,900 per case. Observed costs were higher for cases diagnosed at age 45–59 ($67,700) or 60–69 ($63,500), and lower for cases aged ≥80 ($29,500) and those with unspecified histology ($31,700) or unknown stage ($36,500). Factors associated with lower costs generally related to shorter survival: older age (p<0.0001), smoking (p<0.0001) and unknown stage (p = 0.002). There was no evidence of differences by year of diagnosis or sex (both p>0.50). For 465 cases diagnosed 2014–2015, 29% had subsidised molecular testing for targeted therapy/immunotherapy and 4% had subsidised targeted therapies. Conclusions Lung cancer healthcare costs are strongly associated with survival-related factors. Costs appeared stable over the period 2006–2013. This study provides a framework for evaluating the health/economic impact of introducing lung cancer screening and other interventions in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W3081943520,"In this study, the effect of glazing-to-total-wall-area ratio on the thermal performance of different wall materials is numerically investigated in terms of heat transmission load. The investigation was performed for a South-facing wall in Elazığ, Turkey. The heat transmission load through walls and windows are determined separately for summer and winter climate conditions. In this analysis, the frame area of the window is not considered. Therefore, whereas the glazing area on uninsulated and insulated walls is increased from 0% to 100%, the heat gain and losses are calculated separately according to the glazing type. The transmission loads through the wall are determined by an implicit finite difference procedure under steady periodic conditions. Concrete, briquettes, bricks, and autoclaved aerated concrete are selected as structure materials. Results show that in the uninsulated wall, the wall material affected the glazing area, whereas in the insulated wall, the effect of wall material on glazing area is insignificant."

Thirty Sp-positive or contrived cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) were also tested. Test specimens were collected and tested at different sites, with each site testing unique specimens by technologists blinded to expected results. No significant differences in test concordances were detected for the ImmuView and BinaxNOW assays for the Sp or Lp targets for urine from patients with pneumococcal pneumonia or LD when performance from both sites were combined. At one of two test sites the ImmuView Lp assay was more sensitive than the BinaxNOW assay, with no correlation between test performance and Lp serogroup 1 monoclonal type. Urines from six of seven patients with LD caused by Legionella spp. bacteria other than Lp serogroup 1 were negative in both assays. Both tests had equivalent performance for Sp-positive CSF. The clinical sensitivities for pneumococcal pneumonia were 88.1 and 94.4% for the ImmuView and Binax assays, and 87.6 and 84.2% for the Lp assays, respectively. Test specificities for pneumococcal pneumonia were 96.2 and 97.0% for the ImmuView and Binax assays, and 99.6 and 99.1% for the Lp assays. Both assays were highly specific for Sp in pediatric urines from children with nasopharyngeal colonization by the bacterium. ImmuView and BinaxNOW assay performance was equivalent in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W3082394702,"Muscle atrophy is regulated by the balance between protein degradation and synthesis. FOXO1, a transcription factor, helps to determine this balance by activating pro-atrophic gene transcription when present in muscle fiber nuclei.

AKT activation can be promoted by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) or insulin via a pathway including IGF1 or insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and AKT. We used confocal fluorescence time-lapse imaging of FOXO1–GFP in adult isolated living muscle fibers maintained in culture to explore the effects of IGF1 and insulin on FOXO1–GFP nuclear efflux with and without pharmacological inhibitors. We observed that although AKT inhibitor blocks the IGF1- or insulin-induced effect on FOXO1 nuclear efflux, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, which we show to be effective in these fibers, do not. We also found that inhibition of the protein kinase ACK1 or ATM contributes to the suppression of FOXO1 nuclear efflux after IGF1.

Additionally, loss of muscle mass and muscle strength leads to a lack of mobility and difficulty in breathing, which cause a deterioration in quality of life and increased likelihood of morbidity (12Newman A.B.

Muscle atrophy, or loss of muscle mass, is characterized by an excess of protein degradation relative to protein synthesis in muscle. Muscle atrophy is regulated at the cellular level by several signaling pathways that modulate the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Here we investigate a major signaling pathway involved in muscle atrophy that is regulated by both insulin and IGF1. Both insulin and IGF1 play large and important roles in skeletal muscle. Interaction with insulin, IGF1, or hybrid insulin–IGF1 receptors is key in the growth, differentiation, and homeostasis of skeletal muscle (13O'Neill B.T. Lee K.Y. Klaus K. Softic S. Krumpoch M.T. Fentz J. Stanford K.I. Robinson M.M. Cai W. Kleinridders A. Pereira R.O. Hirshman M.F. Abel E.D. Accili D.

Invest. 2016; 126 (27525440): 3433-344610.1172/JCI86522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, inactivation of insulin and IGF1 receptors in skeletal muscle has been shown to cause type 2 diabetes in mice (14Garcia-Perez M.A. Pineda B. Hermenegildo C. Tarin J.J. Cano A. Isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa is favorable on bone markers but neutral on an osteoblastic cell line.Osteoporos. Int. 2009; 4 (29273088): 337-34210.1186/s13395-017-0145-7Google Scholar). These growth hormones also play roles in preventing muscle atrophy. A major downstream target of insulin and IGF1 is FOXO1, a transcription factor involved in activating pro-atrophic gene transcription. The FOXO (forkhead box class O) family is a conserved transcription factor family involved in various cellular roles including cell proliferation and cell survival (15Arden K.C. Biggs W.H. Regulation of the FoxO family of transcription factors by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–activated signaling.Arch. Biochem.

Four isoforms of FOXO exist in humans: FOXO1, FOXO3A, FOXO4, and FOXO6, and all are expressed in skeletal muscle fibers except FOXO6 (15Arden K.C. Biggs W.H. Regulation of the FoxO family of transcription factors by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–activated signaling.Arch. Biochem.

Of these, FOXO1 and FOXO3A are implicated as critical for muscle atrophy because the two isoforms promote transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligases, MURF-1, and MAFbx/ATROGIN1, which are responsible for protein degradation via the proteasome and are highly expressed during muscle atrophy (16Bodine S.C.

The phosphorylation status of FOXO1 dictates the localization of FOXO1 in either nuclei or cytoplasm of myofibers and thus determines the transcriptional activity of FOXO1. AKT (protein kinase B) is a serine/threonine specific protein kinase that, when activated, phosphorylates FOXO1 on three conserved sites (Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319) (21Zhao X. Gan L. Pan H. Kan D.

The canonical pathway for activating AKT kinase activity by IGF1/insulin begins with IGF1/insulin activating the IGF1/insulin receptors, causing receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1), resulting in activation of Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and the consequent production of PIP3 in the plasma membrane. AKT binds to plasma membrane PIP3 together with Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 1 (PDK1), which phosphorylates AKT at Thr308, and mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 2 (MTORC2), which phosphorylates AKT at Ser473, resulting in full AKT kinase activation. Among many additional actions, activated AKT phosphorylates FOXO1, promoting net loss of Foxo1 from muscle fiber nuclei in response to IGF1 and/or insulin. Using FOXO1–GFP expressed in primary cultured living adult skeletal muscle fibers studied by time-lapse fluorescence confocal imaging, we first show that AKT, but not PI3K, is necessary for the rapid and pronounced nuclear efflux of FOXO1–GFP in response to either IGF1 or insulin in adult muscle fibers. We then examine two PI3K-independent kinases: ACK1 (30Mahajan K. Coppola D. Challa S. Fang B. Chen Y.A. Zhu W. Lopez A.S. Koomen J. Engelman R.W. Rivera C. Muraoka-Cook R.S. Cheng J.Q. Schönbrunn E.

Our novel results demonstrate that PI3K-independent pathways may play an important role in the response of skeletal muscle to IGF1/insulin and thus have major implications for insulin insensitivity, type 2 diabetes, and suppression of FOXO1-mediated muscle protein breakdown and consequent muscle atrophy. In muscle fibers, changes in FOXO1 nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution reflect small differences in relatively large nuclear influx and nuclear efflux of FOXO1 (22Wimmer R.J. Liu Y. Schachter T.N.

Kinetics of nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of Foxo1 and Foxo3A in adult skeletal muscle fibers.Am. J. Physiol.

FOXO1 nucleocytoplasmic distribution is regulated by FOXO1 phosphorylation stratus, and AKT is a major kinase phosphorylating FOXO1. Consistent with AKT regulation of Foxo1 distribution, adding AKT-I VIII (1 μm), an inhibitor of both AKT1 and AKT2, shortly after the 15-min time point caused a robust increase in nuclear FOXO1–GFP fluorescence (Fig. 1, A, second row, and B, black squares and black line) compared with the control (above), confirming the involvement of AKT in promoting FOXO1 nuclear exclusion under control conditions in our adult fiber culture system. Adding only IGF1 (13 nm) shortly after the 30-min time point to fibers in another compartment of the same culture dish resulted in a robust rapid and almost complete loss of nuclear FOXO1–GFP (Fig. 1, A, third row, and B, red circles and red line), consistent with marked activation of FOXO1–GFP nuclear efflux as we have previously reported (13O'Neill B.T.

However, when the same addition of IGF1 to another compartment was preceded by addition of AKT-I VIII, the loss of nuclear FOXO1–GFP caused by IGF1 addition was completely eliminated (Fig. 1, A, bottom row, and B, red squares and red line), and the time course was essentially the same as that observed when only AKT-I VIII was added by itself, without any IGF1 (Fig. 1B, black line). Thus, the entire effect of IGF1 on FOXO1–GFP nuclear efflux was mediated by AKT. The values of the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of FOXO1–GFP (N/C, not normalized) at 90 min clearly demonstrate the results of the different conditions on nuclear FOXO1. The 90-min time point used here was the point 60 min after IGF1 addition. Control fibers have a “final” N/C of ∼2 (Fig. 1C, black circles). Fibers treated with the AKT-I VIII in the absence or presence of IGF1 have a higher FOXO1 N/C compared with control and are nearly identical to one another (Fig. 1C, black and red squares). Finally, IGF treatment without any inhibitor results in a FOXO1 N/C close to 0 (Fig. 1C, red circles). Thus, inhibiting AKT fully prevented any effect of IGF1 on FOXO1–GFP nucleocytoplasmic distribution. The lipid kinase PI3K is an intermediate player in the canonical signaling pathway (IGF1 → PI3K → AKT FOXO1) leading from IGF1 application to AKT activation, FOXO1 phosphorylation, and FOXO1 nuclear efflux, which corresponds to a decrease (i.e. inhibition) of FOXO1 transcriptional activity in the muscle fiber nuclei. We thus sought to determine the involvement of PI3K in the FOXO1 nucleocytoplasmic movements examined here. Fibers studied under the same control conditions as in Fig. 1 again showed a gradual increase and stabilization of nuclear FOXO1–GFP (Fig. 2, A, top row, and B, black circles and black line). As was the case for inhibition of AKT under control conditions in Fig. 1B, inhibition of PI3K under control conditions with BKM120 (10 μm), a novel PI3K inhibitor, drives FOXO1–GFP into fiber nuclei (Fig. 2, A, second row, and B, black squares and black line), again reaching considerably higher levels than seen in control. The N/C (not normalized) values at time 90 min clearly demonstrate these results. Control fibers respond as in the previous experiment (Fig. 2C, black circles), and treatment with the BKM120 alone causes a final N/C higher than control (Fig. 2C, black squares). This marked rise in nuclear FOXO1–GFP compared with control indicates the efficacy of the PI3K inhibitor in our experimental context. We next examined whether blocking PI3K was sufficient to block the dramatic effect of IGF on promoting FOXO1 nuclear efflux. As in Fig. 1, adding IGF1 alone shortly after the 30-min time point again resulted in a nearly complete loss of FOXO1–GFP in nuclei (Fig. 2, A, third row, and B, red circles and red line). Unexpectedly, when the IGF1 addition was preceded by the addition of PI3K inhibitor BKM120, FOXO1–GFP in nuclei still dropped rapidly (Fig. 2, A, bottom row, and B, red squares and red line), following a similar time course as when fibers were treated with IGF1 alone, without the inhibitor (Fig. 2B, red line). This result was in complete contrast to the results from the AKT inhibitor experiments (Figs. 1A, bottom row, and 1B, red line), where application of Akt inhibitor completely eliminated the effects of IGF1 on FOXO1–GFP nucleocytoplasmic distribution. However, the IGF1-induced decrease of nuclear FOXO1–GFP in the presence of BKM120 was slightly delayed compared with the response in the absence of the inhibitor, consistent with a small contribution of PI3K to the observed IGF1 induced FOXO1–GFP nuclear efflux. The N/C values (not normalized) at time 90 min clearly demonstrate these results. Treatment with IGF1 alone results in an N/C close to 0 (Fig. 2C, red circles), and similarly, treatment with both the PI3K inhibitor and IGF1 also leads to an N/C close to 0 (Fig. 2C, red squares). Here, PI3K inhibition caused nearly no change in the effect of IGF1 on FOXO1–GFP nucleocytoplasmic distribution. To ensure that this was not a particular effect of the PI3K inhibitor BKM120, we utilized two other common inhibitors of PI3K: wortmannin (10 μm) and LY294002 (25 μm). The results from these experiments (Fig. 3) mirrored results with BKM120 (Fig. 2). The nuclear FOXO1–GFP of fibers under control conditions remained approximately constant or increased gradually over the course of the experiment (Fig. 3, A and B, black circles and black line). Use of either PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 or wortmannin, caused a more rapid increase of nuclear FOXO1–GFP (Fig. 3, A and B, black squares and black line) compared with control. Adding IGF1 alone caused a rapid loss of FOXO1–GFP in myofiber nuclei (Fig. 3, A and B, red circles and red line). With the addition of either wortmannin or LY294002 prior to IGF1 addition, the effect of IGF1 addition was nearly unaffected (Fig. 3, A and B, red squares and red line) and the nuclear FOXO1–GFP fluorescence over time looked almost identical to the IGF1-only N/C ratio (Fig. 3, A and B, red circles and red line). LY294002, but not wortmannin, caused a slight but significant delay in the response to IGF1. A snapshot of individual fiber N/C values at 90 min also demonstrate these results. These results demonstrate that PI3K is not necessary for the effect of IGF1 on promoting rapid and nearly complete FOXO1 nuclear exclusion. Similarly, we tested whether the effect of insulin on FOXO1 localization could be blocked through AKT or PI3K inhibition because insulin is also believed to activate the same canonical PI3K/AKT pathway. As with IGF1, adding insulin alone shortly after the 30-min time point results in a dramatic decrease of nuclear FOXO1–GFP (Fig. 4A, red circles and solid red line). AKT inhibition with AKT-I VIII either followed or not followed by the addition of insulin results in a significant and robust increase in nuclear FOXO1–GFP and entirely abolishes the FOXO1–GFP response to insulin (Fig. 4A, dashed lines). However, like adding IGF1, adding insulin after the addition of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 still leads to FOXO1–GFP decreasing rapidly in myofiber nuclei (Fig. 4B, red squares and dashed red line). These results are reflected by the N/C values collected at 90 min. Treatment with insulin alone results in a N/C value close to 0 (Fig. 4, C and D, red circles). Treatment with AKT-I VIII (Fig. 4C, black or red squares) results in higher N/C values compared with control in both the presence and the absence of insulin. Note that an individual fiber had a particularly low response to AKT-I VIII treatment in the absence of insulin. This kind of variability occurs frequently in myofibers, as we discuss in a previous paper (32Liu Y. Russell S.J. Schneider M.F. Foxo1 nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution and unidirectional nuclear influx are the same in nuclei in a single skeletal muscle fiber but vary between fibers.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2018; 314 (29187365): C334-C348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and is commonly a result of low starting FOXO1–GFP nuclear content. Removing this fiber results in significant difference between control and inhibitor-treated fiber N/C values with a P value less than 0.02 (graph without fiber not shown). Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor followed by insulin leads to an N/C level close to 0 (Fig. 4D, red squares). These observations suggest that the signal from insulin, like IGF, is relayed to AKT without involvement of PI3K. The kinase activity of AKT is partially activated by phosphorylation of threonine 308, and full activation necessitates phosphorylation of serine 473. Next used Western blotting to determine whether AKT phosphorylation at site Ser473 was occurring. Western blotting experiments (Fig. 5A) demonstrate a major increase in AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 upon addition of IGF1 under control conditions (Fig. 5B, dark red bar). This effect is not s"

We therefore present retrospective data on perioperative anticoagulation in meningioma surgery.Data of 286 patients undergoing meningioma surgery between 2006 and 2018 were analyzed. We followed up on anticoagulation management, doses and time points of first application, laboratory values, and adverse events such as PH and TE. Pre-existing medication and hemostatic conditions were evaluated. The time course of patients was measured as overall survival, readmission within 30 days after surgery, as well as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate regression.We carried out AC with Fraxiparin and, starting in 2015, Tinzaparin in weight-adapted recommended prophylactic doses. Delayed (216 ± 228h) AC was associated with a significantly increased rate of TE (p = 0.026). Early (29 ± 21.9h) prophylactic AC, on the other hand, did not increase the risk of PH. We identified additional risk factors for PH, such as blood pressure maxima, steroid treatment, and increased white blood cell count. Patients' outcome was affected more adversely by TE than PH (+3 points in modified Rankin Scale in TE vs. +1 point in PH, p = 0.001).Early prophylactic AC is not associated with an increased rate of PH. The risks of TE seem to outweigh those of PH. Early postoperative prophylactic AC in patients undergoing intracranial meningioma resection should be considered."

We employ a Social Network Analysis (SNA) perspective, using information on more than 77 thousand co-patents from 2001–2015. These co-patents are disaggregated by three time periods and four ICT subsectors. Global measures for the network as a whole, as well as local measures on the positioning of countries in the networks are interpreted. The empirical results are highly interesting. First, international R&D collaboration networks in ICT show a dynamic transformation in becoming larger in magnitude (more countries but also more inter-linkages), less centralized and more densely connected, though with varying degrees across ICT subsectors. Second, the powerful position of the US weakens relatively compared to other, increasingly connected countries, in particular China. While China has already surpassed the US in total patenting in ICT in 2015, China is now also catching up from a network perspective shown by its growing central position over the observed time period."
https://openalex.org/W3082772402,"The term ""retroactive avoidance"" refers to a special class of effects of future stimulus presentations on past behavioral responses. Specifically, it refers to the anticipatory avoidance of aversive stimuli that were unpredictable through random selection after the response. This phenomenon is supposed to challenge the common view of the arrow of time and the direction of causality. Preliminary evidence of ""retroactive avoidance"" has been published in mainstream psychological journals and started a heated debate about the robustness and the true existence of this effect. A series of seven experiments published in 2014 in the Journal of Consciousness Studies (Maier et al., 2014) tested the influence of randomly drawn future negative picture presentations on avoidance responses based on key presses preceding them. The final study in that series used a sophisticated quantum-based random stimulus selection procedure and implemented the most severe test of retroactive avoidance within this series. Evidence for the effect, though significant, was meager and anecdotal, Bayes factor (BF10) = 2. The research presented here represents an attempt to exactly replicate the original effect with a high-power (N = 2004) preregistered multi-lab study. The results indicate that the data favored the null effect (i.e., absence of retroactive avoidance) with a BF01 = 4.38. Given the empirical strengths of the study, namely its preregistration, multi-lab approach, high power, and Bayesian analysis used, this failed replication questions the validity and robustness of the original findings. Not reaching a decisive level of Bayesian evidence and not including skeptical researchers may be considered limitations of this study. Exploratory analyses of the change in evidence for the effect across time, performed on a post-hoc basis, revealed several potentially interesting anomalies in the data that might guide future research in this area."

Pertussis vaccines confer protection but immunity wanes overtime and boosters are needed in a lifetime. Iran, eligible for the Expanded Program on Immunization that includes the primary immunization, implemented two additional booster doses using a whole-cell vaccine (wPV) at 18 months-old and about 6 years-old. Duration of protection induced by the wPVs currently in use and their impact as pre-school booster are not well documented. This study aimed at assessing vaccination compliance and at estimating the duration of protection conferred by vaccination with wPV in children aged < 15 years in Tehran, Iran. Methods Detailed information on vaccination history and capillary blood samples were obtained from 1047 children aged 3–15 years who completed the 3 doses-primary pertussis immunization, in Tehran. Anti-pertussis toxin IgG levels were quantified by ELISA. Results Compliance was very high with 93.3% of children who received the three primary and 1st booster doses in a timely manner. Timeliness of the 2nd booster was lower (63.3%). Rate of seropositive samples continuously and significantly increased from 1–2 to 5–6 years after 1st booster attaining 30.4% of children exhibiting serological sign of recent contact with B. pertussis. Second booster dating back 1 or 2 years was associated with high antibody titers, which significantly decreased within 3 years from injection. Among children who received 2nd booster injection more than 2 years before serum analysis, seroprevalence of pertussis infection was 8.4% and seropositivity rate was higher from the 10 years-old group. Conclusion Seropositivity in children aged 6–7 years with no 2nd booster supports the need for a vaccination at that age. Adolescent booster may also be considered."

Moreover, SDMA concentration is an independent predictor of development of severe heart failure (HF) in humans with cardiac disease. This study evaluates whether the serum concentration of SDMA in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is influenced by the severity of heart disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and treatment of HF. A total of 99 client-owned dogs were included in this retrospective case-control study; 78 dogs were affected by MMVD and classified according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines, and 21 were healthy controls. For each dog, history, physical examination, complete blood count, biochemical profile, thoracic radiography, 6-lead standard electrocardiogram and trans-thoracic echocardiography were available. Comparisons were performed between groups of dogs belonging to different ACVIM stages and between dogs with and without PH. The median SDMA concentration was neither significantly different among groups of dogs in different disease stages (overall P = 0.010), nor among dogs with MMVD, nor between those with [14.5 μg/dl (10.5-18.8)] and without PH [13 μg/dl (9-17.2)] (P = 0.295). The concentration of SDMA did not differ between dogs when considering the combined effect of the ACVIM group and cardiac treatment (overall P = 0.486). Furthermore, no correlation was found between SDMA concentration and radiographic and echocardiographic parameters associated with increased MMVD severity. In conclusion, this study failed to demonstrate the presence of renal impairment in dogs with MMVD, and the increase in renal parameters in some dogs in the more advanced stage of MMVD could be attributed to pre-renal azotemia."
https://openalex.org/W3081796192,"The contraction and relaxation of the heart is controlled by stimulation of the β1-adrenoreceptor (AR) signaling cascade, which leads to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and subsequent cardiac protein phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is counteracted by the main cardiac protein phosphatases, PP2A and PP1. Both kinase and phosphatases are sensitive to intramolecular disulfide formation in their catalytic subunits that inhibits their activity. Additionally, intermolecular disulfide formation between PKA type I regulatory subunits (PKA-RI) has been described to enhance PKA's affinity for protein kinase A anchoring proteins, which alters its subcellular distribution. Nitroxyl donors have been shown to affect contractility and relaxation, but the mechanistic basis for this effect is unclear. The present study investigates the impact of several nitroxyl donors and the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide on cardiac myocyte protein phosphorylation and oxidation. Although all tested compounds equally induced intermolecular disulfide formation in PKA-RI, only 1-nitrosocyclohexalycetate (NCA) and diamide induced reproducible protein phosphorylation. Phosphorylation occurred independently of β1-AR activation, but was abolished after pharmacological PKA inhibition and thus potentially attributable to increased PKA activity. NCA treatment of cardiac myocytes induced translocation of PKA and phosphatases to the myofilament compartment as shown by fractionation, immunofluorescence, and proximity ligation assays. Assessment of kinase and phosphatase activity within the myofilament fraction of cardiac myocytes after exposure to NCA revealed activation of PKA and inhibition of phosphatase activity thus explaining the increase in phosphorylation. The data suggest that the NCA-mediated effect on cardiac myocyte protein phosphorylation orchestrates alterations in the kinase/phosphatase balance."
https://openalex.org/W3081944004,"The central circadian pacemaker in mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is important for daily as well as seasonal rhythms. The SCN encodes seasonal changes in day length by adjusting phase distribution among oscillating neurons thereby shaping the output signal used for adaptation of physiology and behavior. It is well-established that brief light exposure at the beginning and end of the day, also referred to as “skeleton” light pulses, are sufficient to evoke the seasonal behavioral phenotype. However, the effect of skeleton light exposure on SCN network reorganization remains unknown. Therefore, we exposed mice to brief morning and evening light pulses that mark the time of dawn and dusk in a short winter- or a long summer day. Single-cell PER2::LUC recordings, electrophysiological recordings of SCN activity, and measurements of GABA response polarity revealed that skeleton light-regimes affected the SCN network to the same degree as full photoperiod. These results indicate the powerful, yet potentially harmful effects of even relatively short light exposures during the evening or night for nocturnal animals."

During week 5 of age, calves were tested daily in a learning task consisting of a T-maze with a milk reward (0.2 L milk) placed in one arm. Calves were subjected to an initial learning and reversal learning stage, where the reward location was changed to the opposite arm of the maze. Calves received 5 sessions/d until they met learning criterion (moving directly to correct side in 3 consecutive sessions) for initial and reversal learning. Dietary treatment did not affect pass rate or the number of sessions required to pass the initial learning stage. During the reversal learning stage, calves provided only starter had a lower pass rate (0.038, during first 8 testing session) early during testing than calves provided hay separately (0.20; P = 0.020) and tended to have a lower pass rate than calves provided hay as a mixture (0.14; P = 0.057). Calves provided only starter also tended to require more sessions to meet the learning criterion (15.8) than both calves provided hay separately (10.8; P = 0.089) and as a mixture (11.8; P = 0.10). Calves provided hay also kicked less and spent more time sniffing or licking the testing area. The results of this experiment indicate that provision of hay may affect behavioral flexibility in dairy calves."
https://openalex.org/W3082624342,"Dissemination of accurate health research information to patients and families has become increasingly important with the rise of the internet as a means of finding health information. However, the public faces several barriers to accessing research information, including paywalls and technical jargon. One method to bridge this gap between patients, families, and research is using lay summaries. SCAsource is an online knowledge translation platform where peer-reviewed research papers on ataxia are translated into lay summaries. This online platform was launched in September 2018, with the goal of making ataxia research more accessible and understandable to patients and families. A secondary goal is to provide opportunities for ataxia researchers to develop and hone their knowledge translation skills, altogether improving the quality of patient communication in the ataxia community.The aim of this study was to measure the impact of SCAsource on its readers and volunteer contributors after one year of activity. This is to ensure SCAsource is meeting its goals of (1) improving access and understanding of ataxia research to lay audiences, and (2) improving knowledge translation skills of volunteer contributors.Two online surveys were launched, one for readers and one for volunteers. Each survey had a combination of multiple-choice, Likert-scale type, and open-ended short-answer questions. Descriptive quantitative analysis was used for respondent characteristics and Likert-type data. A grounded theory coding approach was used to analyze narrative feedback data.We found that SCAsource has mutually beneficial outcomes for both lay person readers and volunteer contributors. Readers have an increased understanding of ataxia research and access to up-to-date information on recent publications. Volunteers develop knowledge translation skills and have increased confidence in communicating results to lay audiences. Areas of improvement were identified to be incorporated into the platform.We demonstrated that SCAsource improves access to information and understanding of research to lay audiences, while providing opportunities for researchers to develop knowledge translation skills. This framework can potentially be used by other rare disease organizations to launch and evaluate their own knowledge translation websites."
https://openalex.org/W3082657962,"In this study, we performed an analysis of the impact of performance enhancing polymorphisms (PEPs) on gymnastic aptitude while considering epistatic effects. Seven PEPs (rs1815739, rs8192678, rs4253778, rs6265, rs5443, rs1076560, rs362584) were considered in a case (gymnasts)-control (sedentary individuals) setting. The study sample comprised of two athletes' sets: 27 elite (aged 24.8 ± 2.1 years) and 46 sub-elite (aged 19.7 ± 2.4 years) sportsmen as well as a control group of 245 sedentary individuals (aged 22.5 ± 2.1 years). The DNA was derived from saliva and PEP alleles were determined by PCR, RT-PCR. Following Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction, logistic regression models were built. The synergistic effect for rs1815739 x rs362584 reached 5.43%. The rs1815739 x rs362584 epistatic regression model exhibited a good fit to the data (Chi-squared = 33.758, p ≈ 0) achieving a significant improvement in sportsmen identification over naïve guessing. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.715 (Z-score = 38.917, p ≈ 0). In contrast, the additive ACTN3 -SNAP-25 logistic regression model has been verified as non-significant. We demonstrate that a gene involved in the differentiation of muscle architecture-ACTN3 and a gene, which plays an important role in the nervous system-SNAP-25 interact. From the perspective originally established by the Berlin Academy of Science in 1751, the matter of communication between the brain and muscles via nerves adopts molecular manifestations. Further in-vitro investigations are required to explain the molecular details of the rs1815739 -rs362584 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3081879130,"The information available through our senses is noisy, incomplete, and to varying degrees ambiguous. The perceptual system must create stable and reliable percepts out of this restricted information. It solves this perceptual inference problem by integrating memories of previous percepts and making predictions about the perceptual future. Using ambiguous figures and a new experimental approach, we studied whether generating predictions based on regularities in the past affects processing of the present and how this is done. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured to investigate whether a highly regular temporal context of either ambiguous or unambiguous stimulus variants differently affects processing of a current stimulus and/or task execution. Further, we tested whether symbolic announcements about the immediate perceptual future can replace the past experience of regularities as a source for making predictions. Both ERP and reaction time varied as a function of stimulus ambiguity in the temporal context of a present stimulus. No such effects were found with symbolic announcements. Our results indicate that predictions about the future automatically alter processing of the present, even if the predictions are irrelevant for the present percept and task. However, direct experiences of past regularities are necessary for predicting the future whereas symbolic information about the future is not sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W3082413273,"Our aim was to identify the patterns of multimorbidity among a group of patients who visited primary care in Singapore.A cross-sectional study of electronic medical records was conducted on 437,849 individuals aged 0-99 years who visited National Healthcare Group Polyclinics from 1 Jul 2015 to 30 Jun 2016 for the management of chronic conditions. Patients' health conditions were coded with the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), and patient records were extracted for analysis. Patients' diagnosis codes were grouped by exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and patterns of multimorbidity were then identified by latent class analysis (LCA).EFA identified 19 groups of chronic conditions. Patients with at least three chronic conditions were further separated into eight classes based on demographics and probabilities of various diagnoses. We found that older patients had higher probabilities of comorbid hypertension, kidney disease and ischaemic heart disease (IHD), while younger patients had a higher probability of comorbid obesity. Female patients had higher probabilities of comorbid arthritis and anaemia, while male patients had higher probabilities of comorbid kidney diseases and IHD. Indian patients presented with a higher probability of comorbid diabetes than Chinese and Malay patients.This study demonstrated that patients with multimorbidity in primary care could be classified into eight patterns. This knowledge could be useful for more precise management of these patients in the multiethnic Asian population of Singapore. Programmes for early intervention for at-risk groups can be developed based on the findings."
https://openalex.org/W3082821653,"Background It is estimated that approximately half of new HIV diagnoses among heterosexual migrants in Victoria, Australia, were acquired post-migration. We investigated the characteristics of phylogenetic clusters in notified cases of HIV among heterosexual migrants. Methods Partial HIV pol sequences obtained from routine clinical genotype tests were linked to Victorian HIV notifications with the following exposures listed on the notification form: heterosexual sexual contact, injecting drug use, bisexual sexual contact, male-to male sexual contact or heterosexual sexual contact in combination with injecting drug use, unknown exposure. Those with heterosexual sexual contact as the only exposure were the focus of this study, with the other exposures included to better understand transmission networks. Additional reference sequences were extracted from the Los Alamos database. Maximum likelihood methods were used to infer the phylogeny and the robustness of the resulting tree was assessed using bootstrap analysis. Phylogenetic clusters were defined on the basis of bootstrap and genetic distance. Results HIV pol sequences were available for 332 of 445 HIV notifications attributed to only heterosexual sexual contact in Victoria from 2005–2014. Forty-three phylogenetic clusters containing at least one heterosexual migrant were detected, 30 (70%) of which were pairs. The characteristics of these phylogenetic clusters varied considerably by cluster size. Pairs were more likely to be composed of people living with HIV from a single country of birth (p = 0.032). Larger clusters (n≥3) were more likely to contain people born in Australian/New Zealand (p = 0.002), migrants from more than one country of birth (p = 0.013) and viral subtype-B, the most common subtype in Australia (p = 0.006). Pairs were significantly more likely to contain females (p = 0.037) and less likely to include HIV diagnoses with male-to-male sexual contact reported as a possible exposure (p<0.001) compared to larger clusters (n≥3). Conclusion Migrants appear to be at elevated risk of HIV acquisition, in part due to intimate relationships between migrants from the same country of origin, and in part due to risks associated with the broader Australian HIV epidemic. However, there was no evidence of large transmission clusters driven by heterosexual transmission between migrants. A multipronged approach to prevention of HIV among migrants is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3082642464,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease of public health concern, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. Most of these countries have challenges in diagnosis and treatment of TB in people with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (SNPTB), which remains a significant public health challenge because of the global burden of the disease. We evaluated the epidemiology and clinical presentation of SNPTB in a cohort of patients with high HIV burden. The study was a cross-sectional study among patients with SNPTB in four major hospitals that care for TB/HIV patients in north-central Nigeria. All patients 18 years and above who were newly diagnosed as SNPTB, or patients with SNPTB who had not taken TB drugs for up to 2 weeks irrespective of their HIV status were recruited. Demographic data (sex, age), smoking status, and medical history (clinical form of TB, symptoms at admission, diagnostic methods, presence of comorbidities, prior TB treatment) were obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire. Detailed clinical examination was also done on all the study subjects. Baseline results of packed cell volume, HIV test and sputum acid fast bacilli done during TB screening were retrieved from the patients' case notes and recorded. Also, the base line Chest X-ray films taken during TB screening were reviewed and reported by two radiologists blinded to each other's reports. The Xpert MTB/RIF tests and sputum culture (using LJ medium) were done in a TB reference laboratory. A total of 150 patients with SNPTB were studied. Majority of the patients were female 93 (62%). The median age of the patients was 36.5 years with greater percentage of the patients within the ages of 25-44 years 92 (61.3%). Twenty-two (14.7%) of the patients had previous TB treatment. History of cigarette smoking was obtained in only 7(4.7%) of the patients while 82 (64.1%) were HIV positive. All the patients had a history of cough for over a period of at least three weeks, while, 27 (18%) reported having hemoptysis. About 87 (58%) had fever and 110 (73.7%) had anemia, while weight loss and night sweat were reported in 98(65.3%) and 82 (54.7%) of the patients respectively. Chest x rays were reported as typical of TB in only 24 (16%) of the patients. Of the 150 sputa sample analyzed, 21/150 (14.0%) and 22/150 (14.7%) where Gene Xpert and sputum culture positive respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of Gene Xpert assay were 81.8% (18/22; 95% CI 61.5 to 92.7%) and 97.4% (112/115; 95% CI 92.6 to 99.1%), respectively. The study found cough, fever and anemia to be the commonest presentation in patient with SNPTB in a high HIV burden patient's population. There is also relatively high culture positivity among the patients. This underscores the need to expand the facilities for culture and confirmation in TB centers across the country."
https://openalex.org/W3081693628,"The San Francisco Bay outflow creates a tidally influenced low-salinity plume that affects adjacent coastal sites. In the study region, Anthopleura elegantissima (Cnidaria; Anthozoa) hosts a single symbiont, the dinoflagellate Breviolum muscatinei. Salinity, temperature, and aerial stress induce a bleaching response similar to corals where symbionts are expelled, causing further energetic stress. Using field observations of environmental conditions and symbiont abundance at sites on a gradient of exposure to estuarine outflow, along with a fully crossed multifactorial lab experiment, we tested for changes in symbiont abundance in response to various combinations of three stressors. Lab experiments were designed to mimic short term outflow events with low salinity, high temperature, and aerial exposure treatments. The lab aerial exposure treatment was a statistically significant factor in suppressing symbiont repopulation (ANOVA, p = .017). In the field, symbiont density decreased with increasing tidal height at the site closest to freshwater outflow (ANOVA, p = .007), suggesting that aerial exposure may affect symbiont density more than sea surface temperature and salinity. Unanticipated documentation of survival in 9 months of sand burial and subsequent repopulation of symbionts is reported as a six-month extension to past observations, exemplifying strong tolerance to environmental insult in this Cnidarian mutualism. The study of this symbiosis is useful in examining predicted changes in ocean conditions in tidepool communities and considering relative sources of stress."
https://openalex.org/W3081823320,"Heterodimeric capping protein (CP) binds the rapidly growing barbed ends of actin filaments and prevents the addition (or loss) of subunits. Capping activity is generally considered to be essential for actin-based motility induced by Arp2/3 complex nucleation. By stopping barbed end growth, CP favors nucleation of daughter filaments at the functionalized surface where the Arp2/3 complex is activated, thus creating polarized network growth, which is necessary for movement. However, here using an in vitro assay where Arp2/3 complex-based actin polymerization is induced on bead surfaces in the absence of CP, we produce robust polarized actin growth and motility. This is achieved either by adding the actin polymerase Ena/VASP or by boosting Arp2/3 complex activity at the surface. Another actin polymerase, the formin FMNL2, cannot substitute for CP, showing that polymerase activity alone is not enough to override the need for CP. Interfering with the polymerase activity of Ena/VASP, its surface recruitment or its bundling activity all reduce Ena/VASP's ability to maintain polarized network growth in the absence of CP. Taken together, our findings show that CP is dispensable for polarized actin growth and motility in situations where surface-directed polymerization is favored by whatever means over the growth of barbed ends in the network."
https://openalex.org/W3082004033,"The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing worldwide, and diet therapy plays a key role in treating this disease. Since most patients show difficulties in adhering to nutritional interventions, research on the association of positive psychological characteristics with greater engagement in physical health is relevant to this field. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between positive psychology attributes (optimism, hope, self-esteem, positive/negative affect and life satisfaction) and changes in diet quality and anthropometric parameters of individuals with MetS who received nutritional counseling. The study assessed 63 patients at a nutrition outpatient clinic. Anthropometric parameters and 24-hour food recall data (for evaluation of the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index—Revised–BHEI-R) were collected at the first visit and subsequent return visit (on average five months later). Psychological data were collected at the first visit using validated and standardized scales. The results were adjusted in relation to the depression scores of the patients, which were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Changes in anthropometric factors and in the BHEI-R were assessed, and their associations with the psychological attributes were investigated. The results indicated that positive affect and hope were associated with improvement in the BHEI-R scores (Cohen effect sizes -0.65 and -0.58; p = 0.012 and 0.025, respectively). A significant association was also observed between optimism and a reduction in abdominal circumference (Cohen effect size 0.56; p = 0.031). The associations remained significant even after adjusting for the BDI-II scores (p = 0.022, p = 0.037 and p = 0.05, respectively). No statistically significant associations were observed for the other attributes assessed.The study suggests that some attributes may have a greater influence on the nutritional treatment of MetS and that future studies should be conducted in order to enable effective multidisciplinary interventions to treat MetS."
