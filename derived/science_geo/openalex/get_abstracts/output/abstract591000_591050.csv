Astrocytes exist throughout the brain and tile the nervous system. Astrocytes are morphologically complex cells with thousands of processes that create characteristically “bushy” territories. The finest processes contact synapses, blood vessels, and other glia, where they mediate multiple supportive, active, and homeostatic roles (Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015Khakh B.S. Sofroniew M.V. Diversity of astrocyte functions and phenotypes in neural circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Astrocytes are also involved in disease, as evidenced by analyses of postmortem human brains and from extensive cell culture and mouse model studies (Chung et al., 2015aChung W.-S. Welsh C.A. Barres B.A. Stevens B. Do glia drive synaptic and cognitive impairment in disease?.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Despite important progress, astrocytes remain an understudied cell population, and much remains to be explored. Unlike neurons, which are extremely diverse, astrocytes are viewed as a largely homogeneous population of cells. This raises an important question: how can astrocytes be largely interchangeable and yet mediate their many separable responses? One hypothesis that has been recently advanced to explain this quandary is the possibility that astrocytes are not a homogeneous population of glue-like cells in different neural circuits (Ben Haim and Rowitch, 2017Ben Haim L. Rowitch D.H. Functional diversity of astrocytes in neural circuit regulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015Khakh B.S.

Barres B.A. Astrocyte heterogeneity: an underappreciated topic in neurobiology.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Despite being frequently invoked, with the exception of spinal cord development (Molofsky et al., 2014Molofsky A.V. Kelley K.W. Tsai H.H. Redmond S.A. Chang S.M. Madireddy L. Chan J.R. Baranzini S.E. Ullian E.M. Rowitch D.H. Astrocyte-encoded positional cues maintain sensorimotor circuit integrity.Nature. 2014; 509: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), this hypothesis is incompletely tested, although there is emerging evidence to support it in the context of aging and disease (John Lin et al., 2017John Lin C.C. Yu K. Hatcher A. Huang T.W. Lee H.K. Carlson J. Weston M.C. Chen F. Zhang Y. Zhu W. et al.Identification of diverse astrocyte populations and their malignant analogs.Nat.

Moreover, the finding that reactive astrocytes are different from healthy astrocytes (Liddelow et al., 2017Liddelow S.A. Guttenplan K.A. Clarke L.E. Bennett F.C. Bohlen C.J. Schirmer L. Bennett M.L.

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 6391-6410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) does not directly prove astrocyte diversity; rather, these studies show that astrocytes change in important ways when they are challenged. We sought to determine if astrocytes within two distinct, mature brain neural circuits were largely similar or distinct when assessed using a range of integrated approaches that would permit candid assessment of diversity at multiple biological levels. In designing our study, we benefitted from the demonstration of interneuron diversity, which emphasizes evaluations using physiology, morphology, as well as gene, protein, and cell marker expression (Kepecs and Fishell, 2014Kepecs A. Fishell G. Interneuron cell types are fit to function.Nature. 2014; 505: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). We also chose two exemplar neural circuits to test the hypothesis: the striatum and hippocampus. The striatum is the major nucleus of the basal ganglia: it integrates converging excitatory and inhibitory signals from numerous parts of the brain and is involved in action selection, habit formation, and motor function (Graybiel, 2008Graybiel A.M. Habits, rituals, and the evaluative brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 359-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The hippocampal CA1 region is the site of the majority of hippocampal output and is necessary, among other things, for establishing long-term explicit memory. The striatum consists mainly of inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons (Graybiel, 2008Graybiel A.M. Habits, rituals, and the evaluative brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 359-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), whereas the hippocampus comprises mainly excitatory glutamatergic neurons (Spruston and McBain, 2007Spruston N. McBain C. Structural and functional properties of hippocampal neurons.in: Andersen P. Morris R. Amaral D. Bliss T. O’Keefe J. The Hippocampus Book. Oxford University Press, 2007: 133-201Google Scholar). Critical functions have been ascribed to astrocytes in both the hippocampus and striatum (Araque et al., 2014Araque A. Carmignoto G. Haydon P.G. Oliet S.H. Robitaille R. Volterra A. Gliotransmitters travel in time and space.Neuron. 2014; 81: 728-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015Khakh B.S. Sofroniew M.V. Diversity of astrocyte functions and phenotypes in neural circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), but as is true for other brain areas, it is unclear how potentially interchangeable cells serve such diverse roles in hippocampal and striatal neural circuits, which themselves operate by utilizing distinct neuronal populations. Thus, the necessity to address astrocyte diversity at a basic biology level, the relevance to disease and neural circuit function, and the availability of new tools presented an opportunity to determine if astrocytes in the striatum and hippocampus were largely similar or if they displayed neural circuit specificity. We used multiple evaluations to compare adult striatal and hippocampal astrocytes under identical conditions (Figure 1A). The single-cell evaluations were performed for astrocytes in the dorsolateral (d.l.) striatum and hippocampus CA1 stratum radiatum (s.r.). Astrocyte regional density varies (Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015Khakh B.S. Sofroniew M.V. Diversity of astrocyte functions and phenotypes in neural circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the striatum contains low astrocyte numbers (Cui et al., 2016Cui Q. Pitt J.E. Pamukcu A. Poulin J.F. Mabrouk O.S. Fiske M.P. Fan I.B. Augustine E.C. Young K.A. Kennedy R.T. et al.Blunted mGluR activation disinhibits striatopallidal transmission in Parkinsonian mice.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 2431-2444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore began by comparing the density of astrocytes in the hippocampus and striatum using ScaleS brain clearing and Aldh1l1-EGFP reporter mice, which label most astrocytes (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar, Treweek and Gradinaru, 2016Treweek J.B. Gradinaru V. Extracting structural and functional features of widely distributed biological circuits with single cell resolution via tissue clearing and delivery vectors.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2016; 40: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that astrocyte densities were equally high for d.l. striatum and hippocampus CA1 s.r. at 8 ± 2 and 11 ± 1 astrocytes per 100 μm cube, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C; Movie S1; p > 0.05, n = 3 mice). We next used patch-clamp electrophysiology to directly compare hippocampal CA1 s.r. and d.l. striatal astrocytes (Figures 1D–1H). We recorded the current-voltage relation, slope conductance, and resting membrane potential (Vm) under control conditions and in the presence of 300 μM Ba2+ (Figures 1D–1H) to block Kir4.1 channels. The basic membrane properties of astrocytes in the striatum and hippocampus were similar (Table S1) and Ba2+ was effective at reducing the membrane conductance and in depolarizing Vm (Figures 1G and 1H). However, the Ba2+-sensitive currents were larger in the hippocampus than in the striatum at Vm values with greatest driving force (Figure 1F). The Ba2+-sensitive currents reversed (−86.5 mV) close to the K+ equilibrium potential. Astrocytes form extensive networks of coupled cells. We dialyzed single astrocytes via the patch pipette with biocytin, a gap-junction-permeable molecule, and post hoc assessed the extent of gap-junctional coupling. Under identical conditions, we found that the network of coupled astrocytes at ∼100 cells was not significantly different between the hippocampus and striatum, and in both brain areas, the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX; 100 μM) significantly reduced coupling (Figures 1I and 1J). However, in the presence of CBX, the extent of remaining gap-junctional coupling was significantly higher in the hippocampus (32 ± 6 cells) than the striatum (8 ± 4 cells; Figure 1J; p = 0.0239). Thus, there were significant physiological differences between astrocytes located in the d.l. striatum and hippocampus CA1 s.r. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is an important aspect of astrocyte biology (Shigetomi et al., 2016Shigetomi E. Patel S. Khakh B.S. Probing the complexities of astrocyte calcium signaling.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 300-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In accord, a rich panoply of spontaneous Ca2+ signals can be visualized with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP6f. GECIs and other reporters can be selectively delivered to astrocytes (Figure S1) using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) without detectable astrogliosis (Haustein et al., 2014Haustein M.D. Kracun S.

Imaging calcium microdomains within entire astrocyte territories and endfeet with GCaMPs expressed using adeno-associated viruses.J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 141: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Using such methods, we assessed Ca2+ signals in astrocyte somata, major branches, and microdomains in processes (Figures 2A and 2B ; Table S2; Movie S2). To determine if astrocyte Ca2+ signals were caused by neuronal activity, we applied 250 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block action potentials (APs). TTX did not decrease the frequency of astrocyte Ca2+ signals in somata, branches, or microdomains in either brain region (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2B), nor did it decrease their amplitude or duration (Table S2). Hence, in adult mouse astrocytes, spontaneous Ca2+ signals are not caused by ongoing AP-dependent neuron-astrocyte interactions. Since astrocyte Ca2+ signals vary in their dependence on Ca2+ entry and release from stores, we applied Ca2+-free extracellular buffers. The example traces and pooled data show dramatic reductions in the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ signals in all compartments for both d.l. striatal and hippocampal CA1 s.r. astrocytes (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2B). The effect of Ca2+-free buffers was equivalent between the striatum and hippocampus, indicating similar dependence on Ca2+ entry for spontaneous signals (Figure S2B). Spontaneous Ca2+ signal frequency was higher in the hippocampus than striatum under control conditions (p = 0.0469; Figure S2A; Table S2), in TTX (p = 0.0165) and in Ca2+-free conditions (p = 0.0228; Figure S2B). We examined the somatic events more closely and classified them as global events that encompassed the entire soma and some major branches or as non-global events that included only a subregion (Figure S2C). In control conditions, a significantly greater proportion of somatic events in hippocampal astrocytes were global events (Figure S2C; p = 0.0052). Although the frequency of somatic events decreased significantly with removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2B), global events were relatively spared in Ca2+-free conditions, indicating an intracellular origin (Figure S2C). The inter-regional difference remained significant in Ca2+-free buffers (Figure S2C; p = 0.032). We also assessed Ca2+ homeostasis in striatal and hippocampal astrocytes using store-depletion protocols. Astrocytes from the striatum relied more heavily on extracellular entry for basal Ca2+ levels than astrocytes from the hippocampus (Figure S2D; p = 0.0199). Other aspects were similar (p > 0.05; Figure S2D). Hence, both hippocampal and striatal astrocytes display spontaneous Ca2+ signals, but with some marked differences. We assessed AP-dependent evoked astrocyte Ca2+ signals in d.l. striatal and hippocampal CA1 s.r. astrocytes following electrical field stimulation (EFS) of cortical and Schaffer-collateral inputs (Figure 2C). In accord with recent studies (Shigetomi et al., 2016Shigetomi E. Patel S. Khakh B.S. Probing the complexities of astrocyte calcium signaling.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 300-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we found that striatal and hippocampal astrocytes responded equally weakly to EFS of glutamatergic input during brief trains of EFS (four APs at 10 Hz, p = 0.45123; Figure 2C). Hippocampal astrocytes responded more reliably to longer trains (40 APs at 10 Hz), but striatal astrocytes did not (Figure 2C). Astrocytes in both areas responded strongly to bath application of the α1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10 μM; Figure 2C). Later, we report differences in EFS-evoked glutamate release onto astrocytes. Astrocytes express Gq, Gi/o, and Gs G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that may mediate Ca2+ signals. We explored if d.l. striatal and hippocampal CA1 s.r. astrocytes differed in the ability of GPCR pathways to evoke Ca2+ signals (in 250 nM TTX). We began by using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) expressed in astrocytes (Figure 2D) to selectively stimulate GPCR Gq, Gs, and Gi pathways with hM3D, rM3D, and hM4D DREADDs, respectively (Roth, 2016Roth B.L. DREADDs for neuroscientists.Neuron. 2016; 89: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Each of these receptors was activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). In astrocytes expressing hM3D, 1 μM CNO evoked robust and equivalent increases in intracellular Ca2+ in hippocampal and striatal astrocyte somata and processes (Figures 2E and 2F). Activation of rM3D and hM4D with CNO also increased Ca2+ in striatal astrocytes, but the effects of activating Gs or Gi DREADDs were smaller in hippocampal astrocytes (Figures 2E and 2F). The similarities between activating hM3D for striatal and hippocampal astrocytes, and the differences between activating rM3D and hM4D, were evident from the kymographs and average traces (Figures 2E and 2F). To quantify these data, we plotted the CNO-evoked fold change in GCaMP6f fluorescence and compared this between striatal and hippocampal astrocytes, which confirmed the differences statistically (Figures 2G and 2H). Since Gi-coupled hM4D-evoked Ca2+ responses exhibited the greatest differences, we examined the effects on c-Fos expression. Activating striatal and hippocampal astrocytes expressing hM4D in vivo with CNO (1 mg/kg) increased c-Fos-expressing astrocytes in both the striatum and hippocampus (Figures 2I and 2J) but caused a greater increase in c-Fos levels in striatal astrocytes (Figure 2J). Thus, differences between hippocampal and striatal astrocytes in terms of Gi-coupled GPCR signaling may be reflected as differences in gene expression regulation. Next, we tested whether Ca2+ signals evoked by activation of endogenous GPCRs were different between d.l. striatal and hippocampal CA1 s.r. astrocytes. Consistent with past work, α1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10 μM) evoked similarly robust increases in striatal and hippocampal astrocyte Ca2+ (Figure S3). However, the response to 100 μM DHPG, the agonist for mGluR1/5 receptors, was weak in both regions (Figure S3C), consistent with the finding that this receptor is downregulated in adult astrocytes (Haustein et al., 2014Haustein M.D. Kracun S.

Glutamate-dependent neuroglial calcium signaling differs between young and adult brain.Science. 2013; 339: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We also tested Gi/o-coupled mGluR2/3 agonist LY354740 and measured robust Ca2+ signals in striatal somata and processes but no significant signals for hippocampal astrocytes (Figure S3), which extends the hM4D DREADD data (Figure 2E–2H). However, activation of Gi/o-coupled GABAB GPCRs (50 μM R-baclofen) evoked similar responses in striatal and hippocampal astrocytes (Figure S3C). The striatum receives dense dopaminergic input; however, we observed weak responses to activation of Gs-coupled D1/5 receptors and Gi/o-coupled D2 and D3 receptors (by 10 μM A77636, 10 μM sumanirole, and 50 μM PD128907) in striatal astrocytes (Figure S3C). Hippocampal astrocytes showed a similarly weak response. We note that agonists at endogenous GPCRs are not as specific as the use of DREADDS, because they may have actions at other cells within slices. Hence, we draw the robust conclusion based on results from the use of DREADDs as guided by results from endogenous GPCRs that activation of Gq was equally effective in striatal and hippocampal astrocytes but that activation of Gi/o was significantly more effective in striatal astrocytes. By using Aldh1l1-EGFP reporter mice and NeuN staining (Figure 3A), we measured the ratio of neurons to astrocytes in the d.l. striatum and hippocampus CA1 s.r. and found significant differences (Figure 3Di). Thus, the level of neuronal investment is distinct, despite the fact that both regions have similar astrocyte density (Figures 1B and 1C). We next used intracellular iontophoresis of Lucifer yellow (LY) in lightly fixed brain tissue (Bushong et al., 2002Bushong E.A. Martone M.E. Jones Y.Z. Ellisman M.H. Protoplasmic astrocytes in CA1 stratum radiatum occupy separate anatomical domains.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess astrocyte morphology (Figure 3B). LY filling of astrocytes revealed their bushy shapes (Movie S3). Using 3D reconstructions, we determined the volumes enclosed by single astrocytes (Figure 3C). NeuN co-staining of LY-filled astrocytes showed that ∼20 neuronal cell bodies intersected with a single d.l. striatal astrocyte territory, whereas at most one neuronal cell body intersected with hippocampal CA1 s.r. astrocytes (Figures 3C and Dii). We also found that striatal and hippocampal astrocytes displayed equivalent somatic volumes, the same number of primary branches, and the same cell volumes (Figure 3Diii–v). However, the territory volume of striatal astrocytes was significantly larger than that of hippocampal astrocytes (Figure 3Dvi). The density of excitatory synapses in the rat striatum and hippocampus is ∼0.9 and ∼2.0 per μm3 (Harris et al., 1992Harris K.M. Jensen F.E. Tsao B. Three-dimensional structure of dendritic spines and synapses in rat hippocampus (CA1) at postnatal day 15 and adult ages: implications for the maturation of synaptic physiology and long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2685-2705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ingham et al., 1998Ingham C.A. Hood S.H. Taggart P. Arbuthnott G.W. Plasticity of synapses in the rat neostriatum after unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4732-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that single striatal and hippocampal astrocyte territories encompass ∼50,700 and ∼95,200 excitatory synapses, respectively. Hence, striatal astrocyte territories are larger than hippocampal ones and impinge upon significantly greater numbers of neuronal somata, but hippocampal astrocyte territories contain more excitatory synapses. We used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to examine the proximity and interaction of astrocyte processes, presynaptic terminals, and postsynaptic spines in the d.l. striatum and hippocampus CA1 s.r. (Figures 3E and 3F; Movie S4; n = 3 mice). In the striatum, the majority of excitatory spines were thin (Figure 3G), consistent with published data (Bello-Medina et al., 2016Bello-Medina P.C. Flores G. Quirarte G.L. McGaugh J.L. Prado Alcalá R.A. Mushroom spine dynamics in medium spiny neurons of dorsal striatum associated with memory of moderate and intense training.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E6516-E6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The majority in the hippocampus were mushroom spines (Figure 3G), highlighting differences in the environments of striatal and hippocampal astrocytes. To evaluate whether astrocyte interactions with synapses differed between the two regions, we measured the vector between astrocyte processes and the center of the postsynaptic density (PSD). We found that striatal astrocyte processes were further away from PSD centers for all types of spines (Figure 3H). In addition, fewer synaptic interfaces in the striatum displayed astrocytic contacts (77% in striatum and 86% in hippocampus, Fisher’s exact test p = 0.04486). Within either region, astrocyte processes were located more distally to mushroom spine PSDs when compared to other spines (Figure 3H). This is expected as mushroom spines have larger volumes and bigger PSDs (Arellano et al., 2007Arellano J.I. Benavides-Piccione R. Defelipe J. Yuste R. Ultrastructure of dendritic spines: correlation between synaptic and spine morphologies.Front. Neurosci. 2007; 1: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Astrocyte morphology at the cellular and ultrastructural levels suggests that hippocampal astrocytes occupy smaller territories but display significantly greater and tighter physical interactions with excitatory synapses than those in the striatum. In addition to evaluations of known astrocyte properties (Figures 1, 2, and 3), we sought unbiased, global understanding of astrocytes in the striatum and hippocampus. To this end, we generated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of adult (postnatal day 63 [P63]) astrocytes from striata and hippocampi using Aldh1l1-CreERT2 x RiboTag mice (Sanz et al., 2009Sanz E. Yang L.

In these mice, the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ribosomal subunit Rpl22HA was expressed in astrocytes (Srinivasan et al., 2016Srinivasan R. Lu T.-Y. Chai H. Xu J. Huang B.S. Golshani P. Coppola G.

To assist drug development through the identification of essential genes and pathways, we have measured competitive growth rates in mice of 2,578 barcoded Plasmodium berghei knockout mutants, representing >50% of the genome, and created a phenotype database. At a single stage of its complex life cycle, P. berghei requires two-thirds of genes for optimal growth, the highest proportion reported from any organism and a probable consequence of functional optimization necessitated by genomic reductions during the evolution of parasitism. In contrast, extreme functional redundancy has evolved among expanded gene families operating at the parasite-host interface. The level of genetic redundancy in a single-celled organism may thus reflect the degree of environmental variation it experiences. In the case of Plasmodium parasites, this helps rationalize both the relative successes of drugs and the greater difficulty of making an effective vaccine.

Throughout the tree of life, the evolution of parasitism has been accompanied by drastic reductions in genome size and gene numbers (Jackson et al., 2016Jackson A.P. Otto T.D. Aslett M.

Prominent examples are found in the phylum Apicomplexa, one of the most successful taxa of parasitic protozoa. The Apicomplexa include important parasites of livestock and human pathogens, such as Toxoplasma gondii, which infects approximately one-third of the human population and causes pathology in immunodeficient individuals and malaria parasites (genus Plasmodium), among which P. falciparum remains the biggest killer of all parasites, leading to an estimated 214 million clinical cases and 438,000 deaths annually (WHO, 2015WHOWorld Malaria Report. World Health Organization, 2015Google Scholar). The evolution of Apicomplexa from a free-living, photosynthetic ancestor with a red algal plastid and a broad repertoire of genes was accompanied by drastic gene losses (Woo et al., 2015Woo Y.H. Ansari H. Otto T.D. Klinger C.M. Kolisko M. Michálek J. Saxena A. Shanmugam D. Tayyrov A. Veluchamy A. et al.Chromerid genomes reveal the evolutionary path from photosynthetic algae to obligate intracellular parasites.eLife. 2015; 4: e06974Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, genomic reduction is not limited to parasites and may be the predominant mode of genome evolution overall (Wolf and Koonin, 2013Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Genome reduction as the dominant mode of evolution.BioEssays. 2013; 35: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The consequences of shrinking genomes on the importance of the individual genes that are retained has never been explored systematically. In free-living organisms such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, or Caenorhabditis elegans, the majority of genes have no loss-of-function phenotypes when tested under laboratory conditions (Dietzl et al., 2007Dietzl G.

In S. cerevisiae, many loss-of-function phenotypes were only revealed through pairwise gene disruptions, leading to the notion of genetic buffering, i.e., that networks of functionally overlapping genes provide protection against mutation (Boone et al., 2007Boone C.

Mostafavi S. et al.The genetic landscape of a cell.Science. 2010; 327: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). Functions for almost all genes were found by varying the conditions under which growth assays were conducted, supporting an alternative concept that most genes in single-celled eukaryotes contribute to survival only in specific environments (Hillenmeyer et al., 2008Hillenmeyer M.E. Fung E. Wildenhain J. Pierce S.E. Hoon S. Lee W. Proctor M. St Onge R.P. Tyers M. Koller D. et al.The chemical genomic portrait of yeast: uncovering a phenotype for all genes.Science. 2008; 320: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Whether these same models hold true in the reduced genomes of parasites is unknown, and there are plausible counter arguments. On the one hand, parasites have outsourced important metabolic functions to the host, and the smaller range of challenges faced in an intracellular environment might predict that each gene retained by the parasite should, on average, contribute more to survival. On the other hand, for malaria parasites to gain access to the relatively predictable environment inside a red blood cell, they need a complex life cycle to travel between hosts. This involves transmission through a blood-sucking mosquito vector in which the parasite reproduces sexually and lives extracellularly, including being exposed directly to the immune system of the vector. In the mosquito, and during the obligatory intracellular liver stage that precedes colonization of the blood, malaria parasites experience very different environments, each requiring genes to fulfil stage-specific functions (Aly et al., 2009Aly A.S. Vaughan A.M. Kappe S.H. Malaria parasite development in the mosquito and infection of the mammalian host.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These factors could clearly lead to a gain in genome complexity and a consequent increase in overall redundancy. Understanding the pressures that influence gene function in parasites is of more than theoretical importance. The repeated and rapid evolution of antimalarial drug resistance remains the largest single challenge to malaria control, with resistance to artemisinin-combination therapies, the current front-line treatment, now well established and spreading in Southeast Asia (Saunders and Lon, 2016Saunders D. Lon C. Combination therapies for malaria are failing--what next?.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2016; 16: 274-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The identification of drug targets is therefore a continual and urgent need. Knowing the genes and biochemical pathways that contribute to parasite growth during the asexual blood stages, which cause all the symptoms and pathology of malaria, will be critical to guide the discovery and prioritization of targets for curative drugs. Furthermore, the chance of finding compounds that act on multiple life-cycle stages, a key priority for antimalarial drug development (Burrows et al., 2017Burrows J.N. Duparc S. Gutteridge W.E. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Kaszubska W. Macintyre F. Mazzuri S. Möhrle J.J. Wells T.N.C. New developments in anti-malarial target candidate and product profiles.Malar. J. 2017; 16: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), will be directly related to the number of essential genes with stage-transcending functions. Plasmodium species possess compact genomes of 18–30 Mb, which encode 4,600–4,700 core protein-coding genes, along with a varying number of largely subtelomeric multigene families, distributed across 14 chromosomes (e.g., Otto et al., 2014Otto T.D. Böhme U. Jackson A.P. Hunt M. Franke-Fayard B. Hoeijmakers W.A. Religa A.A. Robertson L. Sanders M. Ogun S.A. et al.A comprehensive evaluation of rodent malaria parasite genomes and gene expression.BMC Biol. 2014; 12: 86Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). No genome scale functional screen has been carried out in any Plasmodium species, which are hard to transfect, have low homologous recombination rates, and whose genomes are so AT-rich and repetitive that manipulating their DNA in E. coli is challenging. Recent innovations in the genetic system of P. berghei, a malaria parasite infecting rodents, have overcome major roadblocks for large-scale reverse genetic screens in this species. Recombinase-mediated engineering of AT-rich DNA (Pfander et al., 2011Pfander C. Anar B. Schwach F. Otto T.D. Brochet M. Volkmann K. Quail M.A. Pain A. Rosen B. Skarnes W. et al.A scalable pipeline for highly effective genetic modification of a malaria parasite.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) has enabled the creation of the Plasmodium genetic modification community resource, PlasmoGEM, which contains knockout vectors that integrate efficiently and carry gene-specific molecular barcodes (Schwach et al., 2015Schwach F. Bushell E. Gomes A.R. Anar B. Girling G. Herd C. Rayner J.C. Billker O. PlasmoGEM, a database supporting a community resource for large-scale experimental genetics in malaria parasites.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D1176-D1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we use this resource to measure growth rate phenotypes in mice for 2,578 P. berghei genes, representing more than half of its protein-coding genome. We estimate that almost two-thirds of parasite genes contribute to normal asexual growth of the blood stage in vivo, an unexpectedly large number for a single phase of a complex life cycle, which we propose is a consequence of genomic reduction during the evolution of parasitism. In the absence of a continuous culture system for asexual blood stages, creating arrayed libraries of knockout clones would be impractical in P. berghei. To increase scale, we therefore generated pools of mutants by simultaneously co-transfecting multiple barcoded vectors. The optimal pool size was determined by the overall transfection efficiency and by the variance in integration rates between individual vectors. The library was screened in 58 pools of ∼100 barcoded vectors in inbred mice, as illustrated in Figure 1A. Following elimination of wild-type parasites by drug selection, the relative growth rate (RGR) for each mutant was determined by counting barcodes in daily blood samples on a next-generation sequencer (Gomes et al., 2015Gomes A.R. Bushell E. Schwach F. Girling G. Anar B. Quail M.A. Herd C. Pfander C. Modrzynska K. Rayner J.C. Billker O. A genome-scale vector resource enables high-throughput reverse genetic screening in a malaria parasite.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17: 404-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Changes in barcode abundance were normalized against seven control vectors each pool. Some mutants increased over time, while others dropped out on different days depending on their competitive fitness and their initial abundance. We therefore aggregated data from at least three replicate transfections into a single best estimate of RGR and calculated a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each mutant. To validate the initial screen the majority of vectors (69.6%) were retransfected in at least one additional pool. These validation pools were configured with different compositions to assess the impact of pool composition on phenotype, with the most abundant mutants from the first rounds excluded from rescreening to make rarer mutants more readily detectable. RGR measurements were generated for 2,578 genes (Table S1), increasing more than 5-fold the number of P. berghei genes for which phenotype data had previously been recorded (RMgmDB) (Khan et al., 2013Khan S.M. Kroeze H. Franke-Fayard B. Janse C.J. Standardization in generating and reporting genetically modified rodent malaria parasites: the RMgmDB database.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 923: 139-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The screen covered all 14 chromosomes evenly (Figure 1B), with the exception of the subtelomeric regions, as discussed below. In Figure 1C, growth measurements for all mutants are plotted against a measure of confidence, which we derive from a model of the variance underlying the barcode counts. The observed variance between independent measurements of the control genes was low (Figure 1D), showing RGR values to be robust. Four growth phenotypes could be distinguished: essential genes, slow growing mutants, dispensable genes, and fast growers. These are color-coded in Figure 1C and defined and illustrated with examples in Figure 1E. A phenotype database was built to browse, search, download, and analyze RGR measurements, which also offers access to the raw daily barcode ratios from individual transfections (http://plasmogem.sanger.ac.uk). The computed confidence score for RGR in one pool of vectors was a strong predictor of reproducibility for the same gene tested in a second validation pool, showing phenotypes could be measured reliably in a way that was largely independent of pool composition and validating both the re-screening and analysis strategy (Figure 1F). We found 44.9% of genes were essential, and a further 18.0% of mutants showed reduced growth (Figure 2A). Thus, 62.9% of genes were required for normal asexual growth of P. berghei in mice, an unexpectedly large proportion considering that genome-wide knockout screens in other organisms showed much lower levels of essentiality (Figure 2A; Table 1) (Alsford et al., 2011Alsford S.

Open table in a new tab Genes in the screen were representative of the genome with respect to all parameters tested, including gene length, AT content, expression profiles, and functional annotation. The only exception were members of a large multigene family of Plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) genes with roles in immune evasion, which were underrepresented in the vector resource, probably due to their repetitive DNA sequence (Figures S1A–S1D; Table S2). The pir family accounts for only 2.0% of P. berghei genes (Otto et al., 2014Otto T.D. Böhme U. Jackson A.P. Hunt M. Franke-Fayard B. Hoeijmakers W.A. Religa A.A. Robertson L. Sanders M. Ogun S.A. et al.A comprehensive evaluation of rodent malaria parasite genomes and gene expression.BMC Biol. 2014; 12: 86Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The impact of the underrepresentation of pir genes on the unexpected phenotype distribution is therefore minimal, although we find most pirs unsurprisingly dispensable. Comparing RGR data with previously published data showed the rate of technical failure was low, as the screen correctly classified 190 of 207 known viable P. berghei mutants recorded in RMgmDB (Figure 2B). It additionally identified 48 viable mutants for genes that had previously been targeted without success. Most of these new viable mutants had attenuated growth phenotypes, which provides a rationale for previous failed attempts to create and clone these mutants. Ten of these unexpectedly dispensable genes were selected for individual experimental validation and all were confirmed as dispensable in single transfections (Figure S2A), suggesting the longer homology arms of PlasmoGEM vectors increase targeting efficiency and reveal phenotypes previously masked by technical failure. In such past experiments, locus inaccessibility may have been mistaken for gene essentiality. We tested this by transfecting matched C-terminal tagging vectors for one pool of mutants (Figure S2B). These were able to target the majority of essential genes, indicating that essential loci were generally accessible. In summary, experimental validation and benchmarking against published data lead us to conclude that only 2%–3% of all genes in the screen are misidentified as essential. Estimates for how many essential genes were falsely identified as dispensable are more difficult to generate, because very few Plasmodium genes have been confirmed as essential by strong experimental evidence due to the relatively recent development of tightly regulatable conditional genetic systems. However, we believe the number of false dispensable genes to be low, as the list of essential genes concurred with previous findings. The screen correctly recognized ribosomal genes and known drug targets as important for parasite growth (Figure 2C; Table S3), and the ratio of sexual versus asexual expression of a gene (Figure 2D; Table S4) was a strong predictor of phenotype in the asexual blood stage, as would be expected. Genes with high expression in asexual blood forms were characterized by very low dispensability of ∼25%, rising to 88% in a cluster of 209 genes with highest expression in gametocytes (Figure 2E). In summary, we conclude that RGR phenotypes are reproducible and reflect biological function for a large majority of genes. Of 2,578 mutants, just two grew significantly faster than wild-type parasites. The top hit (RGR CI: 1.15–1.34) is the knockout of ap2-g, the master regulator of gametocytogenesis, a transcription factor that functions as master regulator of gametocytogenesis by diverting a proportion of replicating asexual parasites into non-proliferative gametocytes (Sinha et al., 2014Sinha A. Hughes K.R. Modrzynska K.K. Otto T.D. Pfander C. Dickens N.J. Religa A.A. Bushell E. Graham A.L. Cameron R. et al.A cascade of DNA-binding proteins for sexual commitment and development in Plasmodium.Nature. 2014; 507: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Spontaneous mutations in ap2-g, which increase their rate of asexual growth, occur if parasites are not regularly transmitted through mosquitoes to select against loss of gametocyte production (Sinha et al., 2014Sinha A. Hughes K.R. Modrzynska K.K. Otto T.D. Pfander C. Dickens N.J. Religa A.A. Bushell E. Graham A.L. Cameron R. et al.A cascade of DNA-binding proteins for sexual commitment and development in Plasmodium.Nature. 2014; 507: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A second gene, PBANKA_145120 (RGR CI: 1.01–1.25) is barely significant and may represent a false positive. Other genes required for gametocyte formation (Boisson et al., 2011Boisson B. Lacroix C.

This scarcity of fast growing mutants was expected, because kin selection would create a strong evolutionary pressure to minimize mutational targets that allow parasites to grow faster at the expense of ending transmission from a host. A total of 915 mutants lacked a significant growth phenotype, but their relative abundance nevertheless varied reproducibly over two orders of magnitude (Figure S3A), mainly because vector-specific rates of homologous recombination were determined by the length of their homology arms (Figures S3B and S3C). Integration efficiency was poor for a small number of vectors with geometric mean arm length below 1.25 kb, the minimum arm length for robust BarSeq screening (Figure S3D), but continued to increase with increasing arm length up to at least 10 kb (Figure S3C). The phenotype distribution shown in Figure 2A was calculated with 200 suboptimal vectors omitted to avoid biasing the result toward essential genes. A recent CRISPR screen in T. gondii grown in cultured human cells identified a much lower proportion of genes contributing to normal growth (Sidik et al., 2016Sidik S.M. Huet D. Ganesan S.M. Huynh M.H. Wang T. Nasamu A.S. Thiru P. Saeij J.P. Carruthers V.B. Niles J.C. et al.A genome-wide CRISPR screen in Toxoplasma identifies essential apicomplexan genes.Cell. 2016; 166: 1423-1435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The higher rate of essential and slow growing mutants in our screen, which was carried out in vivo, raised the possibility that in vitro systems may fail to reveal phenotypes for many loss-of-function mutations. If true, this would limit the utility of the important and widely used in vitro culture system for P. falciparum, so we systematically compared the P. berghei and T. gondii data. Of 2,034 genes with 1:1 orthologs in P. berghei and T. gondii, 1,140 have phenotypic data in both screens (Table S5). The proportion of genes important for normal growth is increased in this conserved set (Figure 3A), but gene functions are only moderately correlated between species overall (Figure 3B). GO terms enriched in genes with discordant phenotypes (Figures 3C and 3D) either recapitulate known biological differences between species, such as an increased importance of mitochondrial energy metabolism in T. gondii (essential tricarboxylic acid cycle) (MacRae et al., 2012MacRae J.I.

Knowledge of the dynamics of 3D chromatin structures during mammalian embryo development remains limited. We report the 3D chromatin architecture of mouse gametes and early embryos using an optimized Hi-C method with low-cell samples. We find that mature oocytes at the metaphase II stage do not have topologically associated domains (TADs). In sperm, extra-long-range interactions (>4 Mb) and interchromosomal interactions occur frequently. The high-order structures of both the paternal and maternal genomes in zygotes and two-cell embryos are obscure but are gradually re-established through development. The establishment of the TAD structure requires DNA replication but not zygotic genome activation. Furthermore, unmethylated CpGs are enriched in A compartment, and methylation levels are decreased to a greater extent in A compartment than in B compartment in embryos. In summary, the global reprogramming of chromatin architecture occurs during early mammalian development."

Corroborated by evidence from patient tumors and blood, these results demonstrate that regulation of RNA unshielding couples stromal activation with deployment of RNA DAMPs that promote aggressive features of cancer. The dynamic interaction between cancer cells and stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment critically regulates important features of cancer (Kalluri, 2016Kalluri R. The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Reciprocal signaling between these heterotypic cell types can be paracrine or juxtracrine in nature and includes multiple oncogenic and developmental pathways. However, how the interaction between cancer and stromal cells generates and then integrates signals that result in tumor growth, metastasis, therapy resistance, and sterile inflammation are not well understood. Across many common human cancers, a large proportion of tumors unexpectedly express high levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are typically associated with anti-viral signaling (Weichselbaum et al., 2008Weichselbaum R.R. Ishwaran H. Yoon T. Nuyten D.S. Baker S.W. Khodarev N. Su A.W. Shaikh A.Y. Roach P. Kreike B. et al.An interferon-related gene signature for DNA damage resistance is a predictive marker for chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 18490-18495Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We reported that these ISGs can be induced in a subset of breast cancer cells upon cell-cell contact with stromal fibroblasts (Boelens et al., 2014Boelens M.C. Wu T.J. Nabet B.Y. Xu B. Qiu Y. Yoon T. Azzam D.J. Twyman-Saint Victor C. Wiemann B.Z. Ishwaran H. et al.Exosome transfer from stromal to breast cancer cells regulates therapy resistance pathways.Cell. 2014; 159: 499-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This subset of breast cancer cells is denoted as ISG responders (ISG-R) and are predominantly basal/triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). In contrast, ISG non-responders (ISG-NR) fail to upregulate ISGs and primarily belong to the luminal/ER-positive subtypes. ISG induction results from the transfer of stromal-derived exosomes, which are small extracellular vesicles implicated in a myriad of processes related to cancer progression (Becker et al., 2016Becker A. Thakur B.K. Weiss J.M. Kim H.S. Peinado H. Lyden D. Extracellular vesicles in cancer: cell-to-cell mediators of metastasis.Cancer Cell. 2016; 30: 836-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). These exosomes contain RNA (exoRNA) that is enriched in non-coding transcripts. Upon transfer to ISG-R breast cancer cells, the exoRNA stimulates the viral RNA pattern recognition receptor (PRR) RIG-I, resulting in STAT1 activation and ISG induction. STAT1 amplifies the NOTCH3 transcriptional response, resulting in expansion of tumor-initiating cells and therapy resistance (Figure 1A). Consistent with these experimental findings, patients with tumors expressing high levels of ISGs are more likely to relapse after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Similar examples of PRRs recognizing exoRNA in the tumor microenvironment have been reported to influence cancer progression (Liu et al., 2016Liu Y. Gu Y. Han Y. Zhang Q. Jiang Z. Zhang X. Huang B. Xu X. Zheng J. Cao X. Tumor exosomal RNAs promote lung pre-metastatic niche formation by activating alveolar epithelial TLR3 to recruit neutrophils.Cancer Cell. 2016; 30: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, given that cancer-associated anti-viral signaling is occurring in a sterile microenvironment, this raises questions on the nature of the endogenous RNA that is activating RIG-I and the extent to which it influences the multitude of effects that stromal cells exert on cancer progression and therapy response. There are many properties that RIG-I utilizes to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Typically, RIG-I recognizes cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA that is 5′-triphosphorylated, short (<300 bp) and has a blunt 5′ end (Schlee and Hartmann, 2016Schlee M. Hartmann G. Discriminating self from non-self in nucleic acid sensing.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 566-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For viral RNAs, polyuridine motifs can favor recognition (Saito et al., 2008Saito T. Owen D.M. Jiang F. Marcotrigiano J. Gale Jr., M. Innate immunity induced by composition-dependent RIG-I recognition of hepatitis C virus RNA.Nature. 2008; 454: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), while RNA modifications such as 2′-O-methylation can critically prevent RIG-I binding to 5′ capped cellular RNAs (Devarkar et al., 2016Devarkar S.C. Wang C. Miller M.T. Ramanathan A. Jiang F. Khan A.G. Patel S.S. Marcotrigiano J.

However, much of the RNA features and requirements for optimal RIG-I activation are based on synthetic and/or artificial RNAs in vitro. Emerging evidence indicates that endogenous RNA can function as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) to activate PRRs under a variety of stress and pathological conditions, such as after chemotherapy (Chiappinelli et al., 2015Chiappinelli K.B.

The Ro60 autoantigen binds endogenous retroelements and regulates inflammatory gene expression.Science. 2015; 350: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). How endogenous RNAs can function as DAMPs to activate PRRs while avoiding recognition under non-pathological conditions is not well understood. Increased exosome production and transfer to breast cancer cells only occurs when stromal cells are co-cultured with ISG-R breast cancer cells (ISG-R co-culture) but not when co-cultured with ISG-NR breast cancer cells (ISG-NR co-culture) (Figure 1A). To examine whether the transfer of stromal exosomes also results in transfer of stromal RNA, we first labeled MRC5 stromal fibroblasts with a stably expressed CD81-RFP exosome reporter (Figure 1B). This confirmed a high level of exosome transfer from stromal cells to 1833 ISG-R breast cancer cells, which is a metastatic derivative of MDA-MB-231 (Kang et al., 2003Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Shu W. Drobnjak M. Kakonen S.M. Cordón-Cardo C. Guise T.A. Massague J. A multigenic program mediating breast cancer metastasis to bone.Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). In contrast, ISG-NR co-cultures show minimal stromal exosome transfer. To examine if RNA from stromal cells accompanies exosome transfer, we metabolically labeled stromal RNA with 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) prior to co-culture with ISG-R 1833 breast cancer cells that were fluorescently marked with lipid dye (Figure 1C). After 24 hours, over 40% of breast cancer cells acquired stromal cell RNA as measured by EU-modification by azide-linked fluorescein (Figure 1D). Moreover, when stromal cell RNA was similarly labeled with 4-thiouridine (4sU) prior to ISG-R co-culture (Figures 1C and S1), application of the exosome-containing conditioned media (CM) to mono-cultured breast cancer cells also resulted in stromal RNA transfer, as determined by streptavidin pull-down of biotinylated 4sU-labeled stromal RNA (Figure 1E). In contrast, stromal RNA was not transferred when exosomes were depleted from the CM, consistent with our previous findings that the ability of CM to induce ISGs is strictly exosome-dependent (Boelens et al., 2014Boelens M.C. Wu T.J. Nabet B.Y. Xu B. Qiu Y. Yoon T. Azzam D.J. Twyman-Saint Victor C. Wiemann B.Z. Ishwaran H. et al.Exosome transfer from stromal to breast cancer cells regulates therapy resistance pathways.Cell. 2014; 159: 499-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Exosome-mediated transfer of stromal RNA was also observed using another ISG-R breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-436, and using BJ fibroblast cells in co-culture (Figure 1F). Markedly less stromal RNA was transferred by exosomes using CM from co-cultures with the ISG-NR breast cancer cell line MCF7. To corroborate the transfer of stromal RNA by exosomes, we also performed exoRNA SNP analysis using exosomes from mono-cultures of either ISG-R 1833 breast cancer cells or MRC5 stromal cells and compared SNP allelic frequencies to the exoRNA from co-culture (Figure 1G). Multiple SNPs, primarily from mitochondrial RNA, were discovered to have an allelic frequency of near one in the exoRNA from breast cancer cells but near zero in stromal exoRNA. Examination of exoRNA from co-culture revealed that most of these SNPs maintained a frequency closer to zero, consistent with the exoRNA primarily originating from stromal cells. In total, these results suggest that cellular RNAs are transferred from stromal to breast cancer cells in an exosome-dependent manner. Classification of non-ribosomal exoRNA transcripts from ISG-R co-cultures reveals an enrichment in non-coding RNAs compared to cellular RNA (Figure 2A). These non-coding RNAs include repeat and transposable elements, small nuclear RNA (snRNA), signal recognition particle RNA (srpRNA), and others, but no viral RNAs were detected. Previously, we demonstrated that upon transfection this exoRNA activates RIG-I to induce ISGs in recipient breast cancer cells, and this activity requires a 5′-triphosphate (5′ppp) RNA end. To confirm this notion, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out RIG-I in breast cancer cells and re-expressed either wild-type (WT) RIG-I or RIG-I with alanine substitution mutations in key lysine residues (K858 and K861) that make contacts with the 5′ppp motif (RIG-IK858/861A) (Wang et al., 2010Wang Y. Ludwig J. Schuberth C. Goldeck M. Schlee M. Li H. Juranek S. Sheng G. Micura R. Tuschl T. et al.Structural and functional insights into 5′-ppp RNA pattern recognition by the innate immune receptor RIG-I.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Figures S2A and S2B). Co-culture-derived exosomes were purified (Figures S2C and S2D) and transfection of the exoRNA failed to induce ISGs in RIG-I KO breast cancer cells (Figure 2B). Re-expression of WT RIG-I rescued this defect whereas RIG-IK858/861A was markedly less effective at restoring activity. In contrast, cellular RNA failed to induce ISGs regardless of RIG-I status. Thus, these results provide evidence that 5′ppp exoRNA from stromal cells activates RIG-I.Figure S2Breast Cancer RIG-I Signaling Is Regulated by 5′-Triphosphate ExoRNA and Stromal POL3, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Immunoblot for RIG-I or epitope tag from Cas9 control (WT), RIG-I knockout (KO), and RIG-I KO 1833 cells restored with either wild-type (KO + WT) or RIG-IK858/861A 5′ppp binding mutant (KO + MUT).

Error bars are SEM of biological replicates and ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. In the absence of viral infection, the main source of endogenous 5′ppp RNA is from RNA polymerase III (POL3) transcription (White, 2011White R.J. Transcription by RNA polymerase III: more complex than we thought.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine if stromal POL3 generates the exoRNA that is transferred to breast cancer cells to activate anti-viral signaling. Indeed, the POL3 subunit POLR3G was upregulated in stromal cells after ISG-R co-culture (Figures 2C and S2E). Knockdown of POL3 using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the POLR3F subunit (Figure S2F) revealed that inhibiting POL3 in stromal cells, but not in breast cancer cells alone, significantly blunted breast cancer ISG induction (Figure 2D). Interrogation of functional consequences revealed that the ability of stromal cells to protect breast cancer cells after radiation was impaired with stromal POL3 knockdown, but unchanged after breast cancer POL3 knockdown (Figures 2E and S2G). Consistent with these findings, treatment with a POL3 small-molecule inhibitor (Wu et al., 2003Wu L. Pan J. Thoroddsen V. Wysong D.R. Blackman R.K. Bulawa C.E. Gould A.E. Ocain T.D. Dick L.R. Errada P. et al.Novel small-molecule inhibitors of RNA polymerase III.Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also blunted stroma-mediated resistance and ISG induction in breast cancer cells after co-culture (Figures S2H and S2I). To confirm that exosomes are responsible for the effects resulting from inhibiting stromal POL3, we isolated exosome-containing CM from ISG-R co-culture treated with or without the POL3 inhibitor. CM isolated from co-culture both induced ISGs when added to mono-cultured breast cancer cells (Figure 2F) and re-established stroma-mediated radiation resistance that was abrogated by POL3 inhibition (Figures 2G and S2J). In contrast, CM from ISG-R co-culture treated with POL3 inhibitor failed to induce ISGs, but expression of unrelated genes such as IFI16 was not affected (Figure 2F). To test if exoRNA can directly activate RIG-I in a POL3-dependent manner, we examined the ability of exoRNA to stimulate ATP hydrolysis of recombinant RIG-I. Indeed, addition of exoRNA from ISG-R co-culture, but not exoRNA from POL3 inhibitor-treated co-culture or equimolar amounts of cellular RNA, stimulates RIG-I ATP helicase activity (Figure 2H). Thus, these results suggest that stromal POL3 generates exoRNA that directly activates breast cancer RIG-I and promotes stroma-mediated protection against DNA damage. To characterize the exoRNA generated by stromal POL3, we developed an approach to identify 5′ppp RNA by sequencing. For this, we utilized a set of enzymatic reactions to sequentially modify the 5′ end of RNA prior to library construction to deplete RNA lacking a 5′ppp modification (5′ppp-seq). Many coding and non-coding RNAs were depleted by ∼10-fold or greater, consistent with the absence of a 5′ppp (Figure 2I, left). Examination of RNA classes that maintained or increased abundance revealed many exoRNA transcripts known to be under POL3 regulation, including tRNAs, srpRNA, Y RNA/snRNAs, and ALU/SINE RNAs (Figure 2I, right). As expected, inhibiting POL3 resulted in a decrease in the abundance of several of these 5′ppp RNA in exosomes (Figure 2J). Thus, multiple 5′ppp exoRNAs regulated by stromal POL3 are present in exosomes and represent candidate RIG-I ligands transferred to breast cancer cells. As part of a strategy to identify a specific 5′ppp exoRNA from stromal cells that activates breast cancer RIG-I, we examined differences in 5′ppp exoRNA abundance that correlate with the ability of exosomes to induce anti-viral signaling. Specifically, we took advantage of the observation that exosomes and exoRNA from ISG-R co-culture is more effective than exosomes and exoRNA from stromal cell mono-culture at inducing breast cancer ISGs (Figures 3A and S3A). Because 5′ppp-seq may not be quantitative, we first performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from exosomes (exoRNA-seq) isolated from ISG-R co-culture versus stromal mono-culture. Using these data, we specifically examined transcripts that were also identified by 5′ppp-seq. This revealed that most 5′ppp exoRNA does not or only modestly varies in abundance in exosomes from co-culture compared to stromal mono-culture (Figure 3B). In contrast, RN7SL1, an srpRNA, and RN7SL1 pseudo-genes stood out as abundant transcripts that markedly increase in exosomes from co-culture compared to stromal mono-culture (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3B; Table S1). Therefore, to further investigate a potential role for RN7SL1 exoRNA, we metabolically labeled stromal cell RNA with 4sU and assayed for transfer to breast cancer cells. This demonstrated that transfer of RN7SL1 is enhanced after ISG-R co-culture with multiple different stromal cells but not after ISG-NR co-culture (Figure 3D). Tandem pull-down by first immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged breast cancer RIG-I and then isolating biotinylated 4sU-labeled stromal RNA with streptavidin beads (Figures 3E, top, and 3F) revealed that stromal RN7SL1 specifically bound to WT RIG-I compared to RIG-IK858/861A (Figure 3G). In contrast, other 5′ppp stromal RNA found in exosomes such as RMRP and RNA without 5′ppp (i.e., capped mRNAs) showed markedly less transfer and binding. Selective stromal RN7SL1 transfer and RIG-I binding was also observed using CM from co-culture of 4sU-labeled stromal cells with ISG-R breast cancer cells (Figures 3E, bottom, and 3G), consistent with exosome-mediated transfer. Thus, stromal RN7SL1 is transferred to ISG-R breast cancer cells by exosomes and binds to RIG-I.Figure S3RN7SL1 ExoRNA Is Transferred to Breast Cancer Cells to Activate RIG-I through Distinct Structural Features, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) ISG expression in 1833 cells after transfection of exoRNA or cellular RNA from MRC5 mono-culture (Strm) or co-culture of 1833 and MRC5 cells (Co-cx) (n = 3).

To confirm that RN7SL1 directly stimulates RIG-I and binds using expected structural features, we produced ribozyme-cleaved in vitro transcribed RN7SL1. Transfection of this synthetic RN7SL1 induced ISGs in breast cancer cells in a RIG-I-dependent manner, similar to ISG-R co-culture exoRNA (Figure 3H). This induction requires a 5′ppp as demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase treatment prior to RN7SL1 transfection (Figure S3C) and by the ability of WT but not RIG-IK858/861A to reconstitute RIG-I KO breast cancer cells (Figure 3H). RN7SL1 binding to RIG-I also requires secondary structure at the 5′ end. In contrast to WT RN7SL1, which exhibits extensive RNA secondary structure and binds recombinant RIG-I comparably to a Sendai virus-derived RNA (DVG396) (Mercado-López et al., 2013Mercado-López X. Cotter C.R. Kim W.K. Sun Y. Muñoz L. Tapia K. López C.B. Highly immunostimulatory RNA derived from a Sendai virus defective viral genome.Vaccine. 2013; 31: 5713-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), disrupting RN7SL1 secondary structure on the 5′ end but not the middle significantly inhibited RIG-I ATP hydrolysis (Figures 3I and S3D). Scrambling the sequence throughout the length of RN7SL1 diminished RIG-I binding to levels similar to a 300-bp glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) negative control RNA with a 5′ppp (GAPDH300). In total, these results indicate that RN7SL1 activates RIG-I using structural features expected of RIG-I ligands. Although RN7SL1 in ISG-R co-culture exosomes is transferred from stromal to breast cancer cells and activates RIG-I, it was unclear why this highly abundant cellular 5′ppp RNA does not persistently activate RIG-I in the cytoplasm. We reasoned that binding by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) might influence the ability of RN7SL1 to activate anti-viral signaling. To examine this, we treated cells or exosomes with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) with or without membrane permeabilization prior to sequencing (MNase-seq). This revealed variable MNase-dependent RNA degradation in cells and exosomes, which is indicative of differing degrees of RNA “shielding” by RBPs (Fi"

Experience-dependent plasticity endows neural circuits in the cerebral cortex with the flexibility required for adapting to a continuously changing environment, thereby contributing to sensory perception, cognition, and behavior. The maintenance of precise neuronal coding during fluctuations in activity requires the balanced interaction between excitation and inhibition (Froemke, 2015Froemke R.C.

Although several lines of evidence emphasize pivotal roles for PV+ cells in controlling the gain of sensory-related responses and learning (Wilson et al., 2012Wilson N.R. Runyan C.A. Wang F.L. Sur M.

PV+ cells can adapt their intrinsic properties (cellular plasticity) and outputs (synaptic plasticity) in response to sensory experience. These cells display a remarkable dynamism that allows them to exist in different “cell states” or configurations, depending on the behavioral context (Dehorter et al., 2015Dehorter N. Ciceri G.

While the functional relevance of this novel form of experience-dependent plasticity during behavior is clear (Donato et al., 2013Donato F. Rompani S.B. Caroni P. Parvalbumin-expressing basket-cell network plasticity induced by experience regulates adult learning.Nature. 2013; 504: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms regulating the adaptability of PV+ interneurons to changing levels of neuronal activity are largely unknown. The lack of information about these processes is particularly striking because PV+ cell dysfunction has been linked to impaired cognition in psychiatric disorders (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.-H. Moore C.I.

Zhang F. Yizhar O. Deisseroth K. Parvalbumin neurons and gamma rhythms enhance cortical circuit performance.Nature. 2009; 459: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Hence, the identification of the relevant molecular mediators of this form of plasticity may offer novel therapeutic strategies to recover from deficits in perception, learning, and memory associated with a repertoire of diseases. The induction and expression of neural plasticity—cellular and synaptic—relies on complex interactions between neurons and their extracellular environment. The extracellular matrix contains potential candidates for modulating neuronal responses to activity changes. For instance, most cortical PV+ interneurons are wrapped by a specialization of the extracellular matrix known as perineuronal nets (PNNs), which includes chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (Deepa et al., 2006Deepa S.S. Carulli D. Galtrey C. Rhodes K. Fukuda J. Mikami T. Sugahara K. Fawcett J.W. Composition of perineuronal net extracellular matrix in rat brain: a different disaccharide composition for the net-associated proteoglycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17789-17800Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The maturation of PNNs around PV+ cells coincides with the closure of the critical period, a window of enhanced plasticity across different brain regions during early postnatal life (Takesian and Hensch, 2013Takesian A.E. Hensch T.K. Balancing plasticity/stability across brain development.Prog. Brain Res. 2013; 207: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PNNs contribute to this process by promoting synapse stabilization and limiting synaptic rearrangements beyond the critical period for plasticity (Pizzorusso et al., 2002Pizzorusso T. Medini P. Berardi N. Chierzi S. Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Reactivation of ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex.Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Consistently, pharmacological degradation of CSPGs in the adult reactivates cortical plasticity and enhances learning (Gogolla et al., 2009Gogolla N. Caroni P. Lüthi A. Herry C. Perineuronal nets protect fear memories from erasure.Science. 2009; 325: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). However, in spite of the unequivocal role of PNNs in the regulation of cortical plasticity, the precise mechanism through which PNNs mediate this process remains a mystery. Brevican (BCAN) is one of the most abundant CSPGs in the brain and a fundamental component of the PNNs (Frischknecht et al., 2014Frischknecht R. Chang K.-J. Rasband M.N. Seidenbecher C.I. Neural ECM molecules in axonal and synaptic homeostatic plasticity.Prog. Brain Res. 2014; 214: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is expressed in several brain regions from early postnatal development, mostly inside glial cells and around neurons (Seidenbecher et al., 2002Seidenbecher C.I. Smalla K.H. Fischer N. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. Brevican isoforms associate with neural membranes.J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Though its function is currently unclear, three lines of evidence suggest that BCAN may play a key role regulating experience-dependent plasticity in cortical circuits: (1) BCAN is a component of PNNs surrounding PV+ cells (Valenzuela et al., 2014Valenzuela J.C. Heise C. Franken G. Singh J. Schweitzer B. Seidenbecher C.I. Frischknecht R. Hyaluronan-based extracellular matrix under conditions of homeostatic plasticity.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20130606Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); (2) BCAN is present in cell membranes and synaptosomal fractions (Seidenbecher et al., 2002Seidenbecher C.I. Smalla K.H. Fischer N. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. Brevican isoforms associate with neural membranes.J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); and (3) BCAN is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus (Brakebusch et al., 2002Brakebusch C. Seidenbecher C.I. Asztely F. Rauch U. Matthies H. Meyer H. Krug M. Böckers T.M. Zhou X. Kreutz M.R. et al.Brevican-deficient mice display impaired hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation but show no obvious deficits in learning and memory.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7417-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Here we identify the molecular mechanism through which the PNN protein BCAN influences cellular and synaptic plasticity in response to changes in the environment. We demonstrate that BCAN shapes the intrinsic properties of PV+ interneurons and sculpts their synaptic inputs by controlling the localization of potassium channels and the levels of synaptic AMPA receptors, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to the long-standing view that PNN proteins are static and function just as a break for synaptic plasticity (Nabel and Morishita, 2013Nabel E.M. Morishita H. Regulating critical period plasticity: insight from the visual system to fear circuitry for therapeutic interventions.Front. Psychiatry. 2013; 4: 146Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Takesian and Hensch, 2013Takesian A.E. Hensch T.K. Balancing plasticity/stability across brain development.Prog. Brain Res. 2013; 207: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we show that BCAN is dynamically regulated by activity and that its function is fundamentally required for spatial working and short-term memories. These results therefore reveal that BCAN plays a key role in gating the function of PV+ interneurons, thereby enabling coordinated circuit responses to experience. Our findings clarify the molecular and cellular events underlying the function of PNN proteins in neuronal plasticity. Brevican protein (BCAN) has been found in several brain regions and its expression is described as a diffuse, dense net-like structure around mostly PV+ cells (Valenzuela et al., 2014Valenzuela J.C. Heise C. Franken G. Singh J. Schweitzer B. Seidenbecher C.I. Frischknecht R. Hyaluronan-based extracellular matrix under conditions of homeostatic plasticity.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20130606Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the precise source of BCAN remains unclear. We found that in the hippocampus, Brevican transcripts (Bcan) are restricted to glial and PV+ cells (Figures 1A–1D and S1A–S1D). BCAN has different splicing isoforms encoding secreted (BCAN1) and GPI-anchored (BCAN2) proteins (Seidenbecher et al., 1995Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Rauch U. Fässler R. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Brevican, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of rat brain, occurs as secreted and cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27206-27212Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We observed that whereas both isoforms were co-expressed in glia and PV+ interneurons, the latter population of cells showed a bias toward Bcan2 expression (Figures 1D–1G). The percentage of PV+ cells that expressed BCAN increased substantially in the second postnatal week, when the maximum fraction of BCAN+/PV+ cells was found (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1E). BCAN kept accumulating around PV+ cells after the third postnatal week (Figure S1F). Interestingly, we observed that BCAN+/PV+ cells exhibit higher PV levels than BCAN−/PV+ cells (Figures 1J, 1K, and S2A). Of note, although Brevican is also expressed throughout the neocortex (Figures S1G and S1H), no trace of BCAN was detected in chandelier cells (0 out of 9 cells, Figure S1B). It has been shown that PNNs ensheath synaptic contacts, suggesting a possible role during synapse formation (Hockfield and McKay, 1983Hockfield S. McKay R.D. A surface antigen expressed by a subset of neurons in the vertebrate central nervous system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1983; 80: 5758-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We observed that the frequency and intensity of BCAN staining in PV+ cells increased concurrently with the development of synaptic inputs onto these cells (Figures S1E, S1F, and S1I). In the hippocampus, the soma of PV+ basket cells receives both excitatory inputs from pyramidal cells and inhibitory inputs from interneurons. Among these synapses, we found that BCAN was particularly enriched in excitatory terminals (VGlut1+) (Figures 1L–1N). In contrast, only a small percentage of inhibitory puncta (Syt2+ PV+ or GAD65+ PV−) contacting PV+ cells were BCAN+ (Figures S1J–S1O). To analyze the subcellular location of BCAN with nanoscale resolution in hippocampal sections, we developed a novel method for multi-color single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy (Betzig et al., 2006Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S. Davidson M.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hess H.F. Imaging intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution.Science. 2006; 313: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (6331) Google Scholar), termed SD-dSTORM (spectral-demixing stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) (Winterflood et al., 2015Winterflood C.M. Platonova E. Albrecht D. Ewers H. Dual-color 3D superresolution microscopy by combined spectral-demixing and biplane imaging.Biophys. J. 2015; 109: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Figures 1O–1R and S1P–S1S). We first identified somatic synapses apposed to PV+ cells by immunolabeling the synaptic proteins Bassoon (pre-synapse) and Homer1 (post-synapse). As described before (Dani et al., 2010Dani A. Huang B. Bergan J. Dulac C. Zhuang X. Superresolution imaging of chemical synapses in the brain.Neuron. 2010; 68: 843-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), we observed typical focal planes with Bassoon and Homer1 flanking the synaptic cleft (Figure 1P). Using Bassoon as a reference, we focused on the axial distribution of BCAN and found that it was located both pre- and postsynaptically (Figures 1O–1R). Next, we observed that the average radial position of BCAN relative to the center of the synaptic complex is predominantly peripheral (Figures 1P and 1R). Altogether, our findings reveal that BCAN—mostly BCAN2—is expressed in a large fraction of PV+ cells and that it flanks the excitatory synapses received by these cells. PV+ basket cells comprise a highly diverse population of interneurons that integrate in multiple microcircuits and exhibit diverse firing patterns and molecular programs (Dehorter et al., 2015Dehorter N. Ciceri G. Bartolini G. Lim L. del Pino I. Marín O. Tuning of fast-spiking interneuron properties by an activity-dependent transcriptional switch.Science. 2015; 349: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to the different PV levels exhibited by BCAN+ and BCAN− PV+ cells (Figures 1J, 1K, and S2A), using pre- (VGlut1) and postsynaptic (PSD95) markers we found that BCAN+/PV+ cells receive a higher number of excitatory inputs than BCAN−/PV+ cells (Figures 2A–2C, S2B, and S2C). We then enquired whether BCAN+ and BCAN− PV cells could be distinguished on the basis of their electrophysiological properties (Figures 2D–2M). BCAN+/PV+ cells are less excitable, showing lower input resistance than BCAN−/PV+ cells (Figures 2I and Table S1). However, BCAN+/PV+ cells also seem better tuned to operate at higher spiking frequencies than their counterparts, as they display higher maximum firing frequency, less spike frequency adaptation, narrower action potential half-width, and an earlier fast after-hyperpolarization (fAHP) time than BCAN−/PV+ cells (Figures 2D–2M). Our findings reveal that PV+ cells expressing BCAN have a distinct profile: they receive more glutamatergic synapses, are less excitable, and have faster responses than PV+ cells lacking BCAN. BCAN locates at the flanks of excitatory synapses and its peak of expression coincides with the maturation of these inputs to PV+ cells (Figure S1I). To test a potential function of BCAN in the wiring of PV+ cells, we analyzed the impact of BCAN deletion on the synaptic inputs these interneurons receive. Whereas the density of excitatory synapses impinging on the soma of PV+ cells and the levels of PV expression were comparable in control and Bcan mutant mice at early stages of synaptic development (postnatal day 15 [P15]), PV+ cells received less excitatory inputs in Bcan knockout mice at P30 (Figures 3A–3D, S3A, and S3B). Consistently, Bcan mutants exhibited a lower frequency—but not amplitude—of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which also had a slower decay (Figures 3E–3I). These findings indicated that, although BCAN is dispensable for the initial contact of excitatory boutons with PV+ cells, it is critical for their maturation. Of note, we detected a reduction in PV protein levels at P30 but not at P15, while the total density of PV+ cells remained unaltered (Figures 3J–3M and S3C). We observed a similar reduction in the density of excitatory puncta in adult mice (P60; Figures S3D–S3F), which rules out a potential delay in synapse formation. To test whether BCAN function is also required for the formation of perisomatic inhibitory synapses in PV+ cells, we examined inputs from other PV+ and Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK+) basket cells (Karson et al., 2009Karson M.A. Tang A.-H. Milner T.A. Alger B.E. Synaptic cross talk between perisomatic-targeting interneuron classes expressing cholecystokinin and parvalbumin in hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4140-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We observed that the density and size of Syt2+ (a presynaptic marker of PV+ cells) terminals contacting the soma of PV+ cells as well as the density of Syt2+/Gephyrin+ synapses were similar between both genotypes (Figures S3G–S3K). To analyze the contribution of CCK+ interneurons, we combined the GAD65 synaptic protein with the presynaptic receptor CB1, highly enriched in CCK+ axon terminals (Katona et al., 1999Katona I. Sperlágh B. Sík A. Käfalvi A. Vizi E.S. Mackie K. Freund T.F. Presynaptically located CB1 cannabinoid receptors regulate GABA release from axon terminals of specific hippocampal interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4544-4558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures S3G and S3L–S3N). We found no significant differences in the density of GAD65+/CB1+ synapses between control and Bcan mutant mice (Figures S3L–S3N). Consistent with these results, we found no differences in miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (Figures S3O–S3S). In agreement with its highly specific location at excitatory synapses, these results revealed that BCAN regulates the maturation of excitatory—but not inhibitory—inputs onto PV+ cells. Since BCAN+/PV+ cells exhibit different electrophysiological properties than BCAN−/PV+ interneurons, we examined whether loss of BCAN would alter the intrinsic properties of BCAN+/PV+ cells. We found that PV+ interneurons in Bcan mutant mice exhibited broader action potentials with smaller fAHP phase (Figures 3N–3V and Table S2). Consistently, the input-output curve was below that of Bcan+/+ cells (Figures 3V). Moreover, we found that deletion of BCAN enhanced the intrinsic excitability of PV+ cells by decreasing the action potential threshold and latency to first action potential (Figures 3O–3Q and Table S2). To examine how the changes in the excitatory drive and excitability of Bcan mutant PV+ interneurons ultimately influenced the flow of information from pyramidal to PV+ cells, we recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in PV+ cells (Figures S3T–S3X). We observed a decreased frequency of sEPSCs and slower decay kinetics in Bcan mutant mice (Figures S3U and S3X). Our findings therefore demonstrate that BCAN is necessary for the maturation of excitatory inputs onto PV+ interneurons, as well as for the expression of their normative intrinsic properties. BCAN is found around the soma of PV+ cells, but its source is unclear, as is its precise cellular contribution to the Bcan mutant phenotype. To investigate this, we first explored whether cell-type-specific knockdown of BCAN in PV+ interneurons was sufficient to mimic the synaptic and cellular phenotype found in Bcan mutant mice. We engineered Cre-dependent conditional constructs expressing a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting a common region for both Bcan1 and Bcan2 (shBcan, Figure S4A). We packed this construct in adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) in which recombination was reported by mCherry (Figures 4A–4C), and the functionality of these constructs was assayed in vitro (Figures S4A–S4F). We co-injected low titer Cre-dependent shBcan and YFP-expressing viruses into the hippocampal CA1 region of PV-Cre mice at P12 and analyzed the density of synapses in sparsely labeled PV+ cells at P30 (Figures 4A–4G). Expression of shBcan led to a loss of BCAN in PV+ cells, causing a decrease in the number of excitatory—but not inhibitory—afferents onto knockdown (mCherry+) compared to control (YFP+) PV+ cells (Figures 4C–4G, S4G, and S4H) and a shift toward lower PV levels (Figure 4H). We next used a similar approach to explore how PV-specific loss of BCAN affects the intrinsic properties of PV+ cells. We found that PV+ cells that expressed shBcan mimicked Bcan mutants for some variables but with a stronger trend when compared to Bcan+/+ mice (Figures 4I–4U and Table S3). Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that cell-autonomous expression of BCAN in PV+ interneurons controls their excitatory inputs and some of their intrinsic properties. To explore which BCAN isoform is required for the maturation of excitatory synapses, we attempted to rescue cell-autonomously the synaptic deficit observed in Bcan mutant interneurons by overexpressing Cre-dependent HA-tagged Bcan1 or Bcan2 in hippocampal PV+ cells (Figures 5A–5C and S4B). HA reported BCAN1 and BCAN2 expression accurately (Figure S5A). Remarkably, whereas BCAN1 resembled other classical PNN markers, BCAN2 expression was dotted, similar to that commonly observed for synaptic markers (Figures 5D, 5I, and S5A). We observed that while Bcan1 expression does not rescue the synaptic phenotype found in Bcan mutant PV+ cells, Bcan2 does (Figures 5E–5H, 5J–5M, and S5B–S5G). The synaptic function of BCAN2 required the GPI-anchor, since overexpression of a Bcan2 that lacks the GPI-domain led to an even more pronounced synaptic phenotype compared to Bcan−/− mice (Figures S5D–S5F). Interestingly, both Bcan1 and Bcan2 were able to rescue PV levels (Figures 5H and 5M), suggesting that it could change both as a result of modifications in the excitatory drive of PV+ cells as well as by independent cellular mechanisms. Altogether, these results reveal an isoform-specific function for Bcan2 in the maturation of the excitatory synapses on PV+ interneurons. Interestingly, we observed a milder reduction of excitatory inputs contacting Bcan knockdown compared to Bcan knockout PV+ cells (Figures S4G and S5H). Consistently, expression of Bcan2 in PV+ cells only partially rescued the density of VGlut1+ puncta (Figure S5C). As BCAN is also expressed in glial cells (Figure 1) and astrocytes contribute to synapse development (Clarke and Barres, 2013Clarke L.E. Barres B.A. Emerging roles of astrocytes in neural circuit development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), we attempted to rescue the Bcan mutant PV+ cells' wiring phenotype by driving Bcan1 or Bcan2 expression in astrocytes (Figures 5N–5W). BCAN1 was secreted from astrocytes and concentrated around both a small number of PV+ cells (Figures 5Q, 5R, and S5I) and few pyramidal cells (Figure S5J), as described before for PNNs (Carstens et al., 2016Carstens K.E. Phillips M.L. Pozzo-Miller L. Weinberg R.J. Dudek S.M. Perineuronal Nets Suppress Plasticity of Excitatory Synapses on CA2 Pyramidal Neurons.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). BCAN2 was instead cleaved and released from astrocytes in the tissue without displaying any cell-type bias (Figures 5S and 5T). When expressed in astrocytes, Bcan2—but not Bcan1—rescued the synaptic phenotype found in Bcan mutant PV+ cells (Figures 5U–5X and S5M). However, neither Bcan1 nor Bcan2 expression in astrocytes led to a rescue of PV levels (Figure S5L). Altogether, our results suggest that Bcan2 expression in PV+ cells regulates the maturation of their excitatory inputs, along with a potential contribution from astrocytes. The marked alteration in the intrinsic properties of PV+ cells upon Bcan knockdown suggested a cell-autonomous role for BCAN in the regulation of the firing properties of PV+ cells. To determine whether this was due to the lack of a specific Bcan isoform, we asked whether expression of either Bcan1 or Bcan2 alone was sufficient to rescue the phenotype found in Bcan mutant mice (Figures 5A–5C). Our results revealed that none of the two isoforms was by itself sufficient to restore normative intrinsic properties in Bcan mutant mice (Figures S5M–S5W and Table S4), suggesting that either both isoforms may cooperatively regulate the firing behavior of PV+ interneurons or a more complex scenario may be taking place. Our results demonstrate that BCAN—more specifically, BCAN2—is necessary for the maturation (Figure 3D) but not initial assembly (Figure S3B) of excitatory synapses onto PV+ cells. These findings prompted us to investigate how BCAN may regulate the differentiation of excitatory synapses. During postnatal development, neurons edit the composition of their glutamate receptors (Hu et al., 2014Hu H. Gan J. Jonas P. Interneurons. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons: from cellular design to microcircuit function.Science. 2014; 345: 1255263Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). This process is particularly important in PV+ interneurons, where transmission is primarily mediated by GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (AMPARs) with GluA1 and GluA4 subunits (Fuchs et al., 2007Fuchs E.C. Zivkovic A.R. Cunningham M.O. Middleton S. Lebeau F.E.N. Bannerman D.M. Rozov A. Whittington M.A. Traub R.D. Rawlins J.N.P. Monyer H.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The slower decay of mEPSCs and sEPSCs found in Bcan mutant mice suggested an altered subunit composition of AMPARs (Figures 3I and S3X). To investigate whether BCAN may contribute to the regulation of AMPARs in PV+ cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments in hippocampal lysates. We found that BCAN protein co-immunoprecipitated with different AMPAR subunits but not with NMDA or metabotropic glutamate receptors (Figures 6A and S6A). We next examined whether BCAN is required for the expression of GluA1 and GluA4-containing AMPARs at synapses. Analysis of hippocampal synaptosome fractions obtained from Bcan mutant mice revealed a reduction of synaptic GluA1 compared to controls (Figures 6B, 6C, S6D, and S6E). This reduction was accompanied by an increase"

Although efficacy with multiple viral vaccine platforms has been established in animals, no study has addressed protection during pregnancy. We tested in mice two vaccine platforms, a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding ZIKV prM and E genes and a live-attenuated ZIKV strain encoding an NS1 protein without glycosylation, for their ability to protect against transmission to the fetus. Vaccinated dams challenged with a heterologous ZIKV strain at embryo day 6 (E6) and evaluated at E13 showed markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues, which resulted in protection against placental damage and fetal demise. As modified mRNA and live-attenuated vaccine platforms can restrict in utero transmission of ZIKV in mice, their further development in humans to prevent congenital ZIKV syndrome is warranted."

We systematically analyzed postzygotic mutations (PZMs) in whole-exome sequences from the largest collection of trios (5,947) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) available, including 282 unpublished trios, and performed resequencing using multiple independent technologies. We identified 7.5% of de novo mutations as PZMs, 83.3% of which were not described in previous studies. Damaging, nonsynonymous PZMs within critical exons of prenatally expressed genes were more common in ASD probands than controls (P < 1 × 10−6), and genes carrying these PZMs were enriched for expression in the amygdala (P = 5.4 × 10−3). Two genes (KLF16 and MSANTD2) were significantly enriched for PZMs genome-wide, and other PZMs involved genes (SCN2A, HNRNPU and SMARCA4) whose mutation is known to cause ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders. PZMs constitute a significant proportion of de novo mutations and contribute importantly to ASD risk."

Here, we map the neural substrates of locomotion and social behaviors for Drosophila melanogaster using automated machine-vision and machine-learning techniques. From videos of 400,000 flies, we quantified the behavioral effects of activating 2,204 genetically targeted populations of neurons. We combined a novel quantification of anatomy with our behavioral analysis to create brain-behavior correlation maps, which are shared as browsable web pages and interactive software. Based on these maps, we generated hypotheses of regions of the brain causally related to sensory processing, locomotor control, courtship, aggression, and sleep. Our maps directly specify genetic tools to target these regions, which we used to identify a small population of neurons with a role in the control of walking."
https://openalex.org/W2734713643,"Recent evidence supports a functional connection between gut microbiota and the nervous system. Here the authors show that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the development of chemotherapy-induced pain. This role of the microbiota is likely mediated, in part, by Tlr4 expressed on hematopoietic cells, including macrophages. Chemotherapy-induced pain is a dose-limiting condition that affects 30% of patients undergoing chemotherapy. We found that gut microbiota promotes the development of chemotherapy-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Oxaliplatin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was reduced in germ-free mice and in mice pretreated with antibiotics. Restoring the microbiota of germ-free mice abrogated this protection. These effects appear to be mediated, in part, by TLR4 expressed on hematopoietic cells, including macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2735513135,"Injured skeletal muscle regenerates, but with age or in muscular dystrophies, muscle is replaced by fat. Upon injury, muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) proliferated and gave rise to adipocytes. These FAPs dynamically produced primary cilia, structures that transduce intercellular cues such as Hedgehog (Hh) signals. Genetically removing cilia from FAPs inhibited intramuscular adipogenesis, both after injury and in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Blocking FAP ciliation also enhanced myofiber regeneration after injury and reduced myofiber size decline in the muscular dystrophy model. Hh signaling through FAP cilia regulated the expression of TIMP3, a secreted metalloproteinase inhibitor, that inhibited MMP14 to block adipogenesis. A pharmacological mimetic of TIMP3 blocked the conversion of FAPs into adipocytes, pointing to a strategy to combat fatty degeneration of skeletal muscle. We conclude that ciliary Hh signaling by FAPs orchestrates the regenerative response to skeletal muscle injury."
https://openalex.org/W2736142726,"The yeast Hsp70 chaperone Ssb interacts with ribosomes and nascent polypeptides to assist protein folding. To reveal its working principle, we determined the nascent chain-binding pattern of Ssb at near-residue resolution by in vivo selective ribosome profiling. Ssb associates broadly with cytosolic, nuclear, and hitherto unknown substrate classes of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) nascent proteins, supporting its general chaperone function. Ssb engages most substrates by multiple binding-release cycles to a degenerate sequence enriched in positively charged and aromatic amino acids. Timely association with this motif upon emergence at the ribosomal tunnel exit requires ribosome-associated complex (RAC) but not nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC). Ribosome footprint densities along orfs reveal faster translation at times of Ssb binding, mainly imposed by biases in mRNA secondary structure, codon usage, and Ssb action. Ssb thus employs substrate-tailored dynamic nascent chain associations to coordinate co-translational protein folding, facilitate accelerated translation, and support membrane targeting of organellar proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2734373506,"Hexanucleotide repeat expansions represent the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, though the mechanisms by which such expansions cause neurodegeneration are poorly understood. We report elevated levels of DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loops) and double strand breaks in rat neurons, human cells and C9orf72 ALS patient spinal cord tissues. Accumulation of endogenous DNA damage is concomitant with defective ATM-mediated DNA repair signaling and accumulation of protein-linked DNA breaks. We reveal that defective ATM-mediated DNA repair is a consequence of P62 accumulation, which impairs H2A ubiquitylation and perturbs ATM signaling. Virus-mediated expression of C9orf72-related RNA and dipeptide repeats in the mouse central nervous system increases double strand breaks and ATM defects and triggers neurodegeneration. These findings identify R-loops, double strand breaks and defective ATM-mediated repair as pathological consequences of C9orf72 expansions and suggest that C9orf72-linked neurodegeneration is driven at least partly by genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2735814320,"Alternative splicing (AS) patterns have diverged rapidly during vertebrate evolution, yet the functions of most species- and lineage-specific splicing events are not known. We observe that mammalian-specific AS events are enriched in transcript sequences encoding intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins, in particular those containing glycine/tyrosine repeats that mediate formation of higher-order protein assemblies implicated in gene regulation and human disease. These evolutionary changes impact nearly all members of the hnRNP A and D families of RNA binding proteins. Regulation of these events requires formation of unusual, long-range mammalian-specific RNA duplexes. Differential inclusion of the alternative exons controls the formation of tyrosine-dependent multivalent hnRNP assemblies that, in turn, function to globally regulate splicing. Together, our results demonstrate that AS control of IDR-mediated interactions between hnRNPs represents an important and recurring mechanism underlying splicing regulation. Furthermore, this mechanism has expanded the regulatory capacity of mammalian cells."

The clothes make the mRNA: Past and present trends in mRNP fashion.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These proteins contain various classes of RNA-binding domains (RBDs) that recognize a wide range of short RNA elements, as well as auxiliary non-RNA binding domains that often contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and sequences of low amino acid complexity (LC) (Calabretta and Richard, 2015Calabretta S.

The nuclear RBPs involved in splicing also have extensive LC sequences, but roles for these sequences and their aggregation are not yet defined. The regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing involves a very large number of RBPs that bind nascent transcripts to alter spliceosome assembly and splice site choice (Fu and Ares, 2014Fu X.D.

One family of splicing regulators is the Rbfox proteins that control networks of spliced isoform expression in brain, heart, and muscle and during embryonic development (Conboy, 2017Conboy J.G.

RNA. 2017; (Published online March 8, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There are three mammalian Rbfox genes (RBFOX1, RBFOX2, and RBFOX3) each with a single RNA recognition motif (RRM) that binds the short element (U)GCAUG (Auweter et al., 2006Auweter S.D. Fasan R.

Similarly, homozygous null Rbfox1 mutations in the mouse brain lead to a seizure phenotype (Gehman et al., 2011Gehman L.T. Stoilov P. Maguire J. Damianov A. Lin C.H. Shiue L. Ares Jr., M. Mody I.

Recently, we showed that Rbfox proteins regulate splicing while bound with the Large Assembly of Splicing Regulators (LASR), a multiprotein complex of eight RBPs (Damianov et al., 2016Damianov A. Ying Y. Lin C.H. Lee J.A. Tran D. Vashisht A.A. Bahrami-Samani E. Xing Y. Martin K.C. Wohlschlegel J.A. Black D.L. Rbfox proteins regulate splicing as part of a large multiprotein complex LASR.Cell. 2016; 165: 606-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rbfox/LASR complexes sedimented at ∼55S on density gradients, indicating assemblies larger than a single Rbfox bound to a single LASR, but the nature and significance of the interactions leading to this higher-order assembly were unresolved. Here, we report that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rbfox interacts with LASR and is required for splicing regulation. An LC sequence within the CTD mediates higher-order assembly of Rbfox/LASR and nuclear speckle localization in vivo, as well as formation of fibrous aggregates and hydrogels in vitro. Mutations that block the higher-order assembly of Rbfox but not its LASR interaction prevent proper splicing regulation and establish a link between the biophysical properties of Rbfox aggregation and its function in splicing. To identify regions of Rbfox1 responsible for interacting with LASR, we generated Flp-In T-REx 293 cell lines stably expressing deletion mutants of Rbfox1 tagged with the HA-FLAG epitopes and the SV40 NLS (Figure 1A). We isolated Rbfox/LASR complexes from these cells by FLAG immunoprecipitation and peptide elution, as previously described (Damianov et al., 2016Damianov A. Ying Y. Lin C.H. Lee J.A. Tran D. Vashisht A.A. Bahrami-Samani E. Xing Y. Martin K.C. Wohlschlegel J.A. Black D.L. Rbfox proteins regulate splicing as part of a large multiprotein complex LASR.Cell. 2016; 165: 606-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The complete set of LASR proteins was co-immunoprecipitated with Rbfox missing either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or the RBD, indicating that these two regions are not essential for interaction with LASR (Figure 1B). Although all LASR components were present in these samples, some subunits, such as hnRNP UL2, were isolated in lower amounts, suggesting that the NTD and RBD may provide additional contacts for particular proteins. In contrast, deletion of the CTD (ΔCTD) abolished the interaction with LASR, and the CTD fragment alone co-immunoprecipitated the LASR subunits with similar efficiency to full-length Rbfox1 (Figure 1B). Thus, the CTD provides the primary contact with LASR. We previously found that Rbfox1 sediments in glycerol gradients as a larger assembly than predicted for a single Rbfox/LASR complex (Damianov et al., 2016Damianov A. Ying Y. Lin C.H. Lee J.A. Tran D. Vashisht A.A. Bahrami-Samani E. Xing Y. Martin K.C. Wohlschlegel J.A. Black D.L. Rbfox proteins regulate splicing as part of a large multiprotein complex LASR.Cell. 2016; 165: 606-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Examining the mutant proteins, we found that the CTD fragment sedimented as a higher-order complex of approximately 55S similar to the full-length protein, while ΔCTD remained at the top of the glycerol gradient (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate that the Rbfox CTD is necessary and sufficient both to interact with LASR and to form higher-order complexes. Rbfox1, Rbfox2, and Rbfox3 paralogs all form the higher-order complexes seen in gradients. These were observed both with the endogenous proteins in mouse brain and with ectopically expressed proteins in HEK293 cells (Damianov et al., 2016Damianov A. Ying Y. Lin C.H. Lee J.A. Tran D. Vashisht A.A. Bahrami-Samani E. Xing Y. Martin K.C. Wohlschlegel J.A. Black D.L. Rbfox proteins regulate splicing as part of a large multiprotein complex LASR.Cell. 2016; 165: 606-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 also have muscle-specific variants derived from the inclusion of exon M43 instead of exon B40 (Damianov and Black, 2010Damianov A. Black D.L. Autoregulation of Fox protein expression to produce dominant negative splicing factors.RNA. 2010; 16: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Exons M43 and B40 encode related but not identical amino acid sequences within the CTD (Figure 1D). Examining the M43 variants on glycerol gradients, we found that Rbfox1_M43 peaked in the 55S region similar to Rbfox1_B40 and Rbfox2_B40. Strikingly, Rbfox2_M43 did not form higher-order complexes but instead sedimented as a much smaller species near the top of the gradient (Figure 1D). The difference in sedimentation is attributed to the M43 segment, as a hybrid Rbfox1 protein containing the M43 exon of Rbfox2 (Rbfox1_2M43) also largely sedimented as small complexes (Figure 1D). These data suggest that Rbfox2_M43 might lack residues needed for the higher-order assembly. Aligning the exon sequences, it was notable that of three tyrosine residues in the B40 exons, two were conserved in Rbfox1_M43 but all were missing from Rbfox2_M43 (Figure 1D). Looking at the CTD region, we found additional tyrosine residues upstream and particularly downstream of exon B40, with the downstream residues more closely spaced (Figure 1E). To examine the role of these tyrosines, we created a series of mutant Rbfox1 proteins with increasing numbers of tyrosines changed to serines or alanines. An Rbfox1 mutant with the three tyrosine residues of exon B40 replaced by serine or alanine sedimented only partially at 55S, with a substantial fraction of the protein shifted to near the top of the gradient (Figure 1F, changing tyrosines 1–3 in Figure 1E). Mutation of additional tyrosines nearly eliminated higher-order assembly (Figure 1F, changing tyrosines 1–6, 1–7, or 1–10 in Figure 1E). Serine substitutions showed a slightly stronger effect than alanine. In contrast, changing three tyrosines to phenylalanines did not impair the higher-order assembly of Rbfox1, suggesting that aromatic interactions contribute to the assembly (Figure 1F). Given that the CTD was required for the Rbfox interaction with LASR, it was possible that the higher-order assembly involved interactions of LASR proteins and that the effect of the tyrosine mutations reflected a loss of LASR binding to Rbfox. This proved not to be the case. All the tyrosine-to-serine mutants as well as Rbfox2_M43 retain their interaction with LASR, immunoprecipitating LASR with equal efficiency to wild-type protein (Figure 1G; data not shown). The property of higher-order assembly by Rbfox is apparently separate from the LASR interaction. To further define the interactions between Rbfox and LASR, we divided the CTD region into three fragments, C1, C2, and C3 (Figure 1E). C1 included the sequence upstream of the ten mutated tyrosines. C2 contained exon B40 and all ten of the mutated tyrosines. C3 contained the extreme C terminus including some additional tyrosines and the NLS. Each of these C-terminal regions was fused to the Rbfox1 ΔCTD protein, which did not interact with LASR on its own (Figure 1B). Adding C1 to Rbfox1 ΔCTD had little effect, with the protein pulling down only small amounts of LASR (Figure 2A, bottom), and not forming higher-order complexes (Figure 2B). In contrast, Rbfox1 ΔCTD fused to either C2 or C3 pulled down LASR relatively efficiently (Figure 2A, bottom). C2 was more prone to aggregation into higher-order complexes than C3 (Figure 2B). The medium-size complexes in fractions 7–9 formed by C3 may result from tyrosines not tested by mutation. Mutation of the tyrosines in C2 to serines eliminated the higher-order assembly and unlike the full-length protein also reduced the interaction with LASR (Figure 2). These data indicate that subregions of the CTD can independently bind LASR and that in some segments the tyrosines contribute to this interaction. A variety of aggregation properties have been reported for the LC sequences of RBPs, including the formation of hydrogels, amyloid-like fibrils, and phase-separated liquid droplets (Aguzzi and Altmeyer, 2016Aguzzi A.

Cell. 2015; 60: 208-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The LC sequence of the FUS protein contains the repeated tripeptide [G/S]Y[G/S] that mediates its assembly into an amyloid-like cross-beta structure (Kato et al., 2012Kato M. Han T.W. Xie S. Shi K. Du X. Wu L.C. Mirzaei H. Goldsmith E.J. Longgood J. Pei J. et al.Cell-free formation of RNA granules: Low complexity sequence domains form dynamic fibers within hydrogels.Cell. 2012; 149: 753-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Although not exact matches to the FUS tripeptide motif, many of the tyrosines in the Rbfox1 C2 region are preceded or followed by glycine or serine. We found that polypeptides of the CTD were predicted as potential hotspots of amyloidal aggregation by AGGRESCAN (Conchillo-Solé et al., 2007Conchillo-Solé O. de Groot N.S. Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Daura X. Ventura S. AGGRESCAN: A server for the prediction and evaluation of “hot spots” of aggregation in polypeptides.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). To examine the aggregation properties of the Rbfox CTD, we purified His-tagged recombinant proteins containing the wild-type CTD or its mutant with ten tyrosines changed to serines (CTD-YS), each fused to a SNAP tag (Figure S1D). The SNAP-CTD fusion eluted largely in the void volume from a size exclusion column, with some unaggregated monomer. In contrast, nearly all of the CTD-YS mutant eluted as monomeric protein, indicating that it is less prone to aggregation (Figure S1B). We also made equivalent fusions with only the C2 fragment and its YS mutant. The SNAP-C2 fusion presented elution peaks in the void, as a multimer of about 150 kDa, and as monomer (Figure S1B). For the SNAP-C2-YS mutant, the void volume peak was reduced and the multimer eliminated, again indicating reduced aggregation. The recombinant CTD protein from the void volume peak was also analyzed on glycerol gradients. This E. coli purified protein sedimented as high molecular weight material starting at ∼55S and extending to larger aggregates. In contrast, its YS mutant protein sedimented as an apparent monomer at the top of the glycerol gradient (Figure S1C). The aggregation of the wild-type and mutant fusion proteins was examined in a fluorescent phase separation assay previously applied to FUS and other proteins (Lin et al., 2015Lin Y. Protter D.S.

The SNAP-tagged wild-type CTD and CTD-YS were fluorescently labeled with SNAP-surface 649, spiked into solutions of unlabeled protein, and monitored by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3A). The labeled solutions remained monophasic and clear at room temperature in 150 mM NaCl. However, when the NaCl concentration was reduced to 37.5 mM, the CTD protein formed fluorescent fibrous structures after 21 hr. With longer incubation (48 hr), less concentrated solutions of the CTD protein (6 μM instead of 12 μM) also formed aggregates. In contrast, the CTD-YS mutant remained in solution for days under the same conditions. The aggregates formed by the Rbfox CTD have a more irregular, fibrous appearance than the round liquid droplets reported with the FUS protein (Lin et al., 2015Lin Y. Protter D.S. Rosen M.K. Parker R. Formation and maturation of phase-separated liquid droplets by RNA-binding proteins.Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 208-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Fluorescent aggregates were only observed at salt concentrations lower than the 150 mM used in purification. It is possible that the soluble aggregates eluting in the void from the size exclusion column may seed the larger visible structures forming in low salt. To compare the aggregation seen by gel filtration with that seen by fluorescence microscopy, we also examined the monomeric fractions of the C2 fragment and its YS mutant (C2-YS; Figure S1B). We found that C2 but not C2-YS formed aggregates visible by microscopy in low salt (Figure 3B). Thus, even the apparent monomers isolated by gel filtration could form the larger aggregates observed by microscopy. These structures formed by the C2 protein were stained with Thioflavin T, a dye with high affinity for amyloid (Khurana et al., 2005Khurana R. Coleman C. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Krishna V. Grover R.K. Roy R. Singh S. Mechanism of thioflavin T binding to amyloid fibrils.J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), possibly indicating an amyloid-like assembly (Figure S1F). We also tested whether the crowding reagent polyethylene glycol (PEG) promoted the aggregation of SNAP-C2 proteins at low concentration. Adding 10% PEG8000 to solutions containing 0.5–1 μM protein caused SNAP-C2 to form round fluorescent concentrations even in 150 mM NaCl. An equivalent solution of SNAP-C2-YS remained clear (Figure S1E). SNAP-surface 549-labeled C2 or C2-YS were also incubated with C2 or C2-YS fused to monomeric EGFP (mEGFP). mEGFP-C2 was found to label the SNAP-surface 549-labeled C2 aggregates as well as form aggregates on its own (Figure 3C). The mEGFP-C2-YS protein did not label C2 aggregates indicating that the tyrosines are required for homotypic interactions of the C2 regions. Although they exhibit a rounder morphology than the aggregates seen in low salt, the C2 assemblies observed in PEG were not as spherical as the droplets observed for FUS and other proteins (Lin et al., 2015Lin Y. Protter D.S. Rosen M.K. Parker R. Formation and maturation of phase-separated liquid droplets by RNA-binding proteins.Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 208-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether these C2 assemblies are true liquid droplets. In other assays, we compared the C2 and C2-YS polypeptides for their ability to form hydrogels and fibers. After incubation at room temperature for several days, concentrated mEGFP-C2 (∼80 mg/mL) formed a hydrogel material, whereas the mEGFP-C2-YS did not (Figure S1G). The hydrogel formed by mEGFP-C2 and the ungelled mEGFP-C2-YS were resuspended in buffer, applied to electron microscopy (EM) grids, and stained. The C2 protein but not C2-YS formed prominent fibers observable by transmission electron microscopy (Figure S1H). Together, these data demonstrate that the repetitive tyrosine residues mediate the self-assembly of the Rbfox proteins into higher-order structures. These structures have similarities to the amyloid-like aggregates observed for FUS but appear to form less efficiently from soluble protein, perhaps due to the less regular repeat structure of the tyrosine sequences. Rbfox proteins exhibit a speckled pattern of nuclear staining with an uneven concentration distribution typical for splicing factors (Dent et al., 2010Dent M.A. Segura-Anaya E. Alva-Medina J.

https://openalex.org/W2734463959,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common and malignant carcinoma worldwide, and the incidence and mortality are increasing rapidly. Immunotherapy targeting programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) signaling has shown prominent clinical effects in treating NSCLC; however, a poor understanding of the associated regulating molecular mechanisms of PD-L1 has become one of the biggest obstacles for further improving efficacy. Bridging integrator-1 (BIN1) can regulate numerous cancer-related molecules to exert multiple tumor-suppressing effects by either interacting or not interacting with c-MYC. In the present study, we observed that there exists a negative correlation between the expression of PD-L1 and BIN1 in NSCLC tissues. The expression levels of BIN1 and PD-L1 were significantly related to the tumor, lymph node and metastasis grade (TNM) stage, invasion range and lymph node metastasis. Simultaneously, for NSCLC patients, the expression statuses of BIN1 and PD-L1 might be independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, the expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was positively associated with BIN1 expression and negatively related to PD-L1 expression in NSCLC tissues. Importantly, we showed that PD-L1 was under the control of BIN1. In addition, the overexpression of BIN1 could inhibit the c-MYC and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent PD-L1 expression and reverse the suppressive immuno-microenvironment in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicated that BIN1 restoration in NSCLC could reverse PD-L1-mediated immune escape by inactivating the c-MYC and EGFR/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2734432177,"The Janus kinases (Jaks) are hubs in the signaling process of more than 50 cytokine or hormone receptors. However, the function of Jak in bone metabolism remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that the inhibition of Jak1 and/or Jak2 in osteoblast-lineage cells led to impaired osteoclastogenesis due to the reduced expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). Murine calvaria-derived osteoblasts induced differentiation of bone marrow cells into osteoclasts in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in vitro. However, treatment with the Jak1/2 inhibitor, baricitinib, markedly inhibited osteoclastogenesis in the co-culture. On the other hand, baricitinib did not inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages. These results indicated that baricitinib acted on osteoblasts, but not on bone marrow macrophages. Baricitinib suppressed 1,25D3 and PGE2-induced up-regulation of RANKL in osteoblasts, but not macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression. Moreover, the addition of recombinant RANKL to co-cultures completely rescued baricitinib-induced impairment of osteoclastogenesis. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Jak1 or Jak2 also suppressed RANKL expression in osteoblasts and inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Finally, cytokine array revealed that 1,25D3 and PGE2 stimulated secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor in the co-culture. Hence, Jak1 and Jak2 represent novel therapeutic targets for osteoporosis as well as inflammatory bone diseases including rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2734403743,"Our limited understanding of the climate controls on tropical forest seasonality is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in modeling climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Combining leaf production, litterfall and climate observations from satellite and ground data in the Amazon forest, we show that seasonal variation in leaf production is largely triggered by climate signals, specifically, insolation increase (70.4% of the total area) and precipitation increase (29.6%). Increase of insolation drives leaf growth in the absence of water limitation. For these non-water-limited forests, the simultaneous leaf flush occurs in a sufficient proportion of the trees to be observed from space. While tropical cycles are generally defined in terms of dry or wet season, we show that for a large part of Amazonia the increase in insolation triggers the visible progress of leaf growth, just like during spring in temperate forests. The dependence of leaf growth initiation on climate seasonality may result in a higher sensitivity of these ecosystems to changes in climate than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2735071218,"Endogenous circadian clocks regulate 24-h rhythms of physiology and behavior. Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is suggested as a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Intestinal biopsies from Per1/2 mutant and wild-type (WT) mice were investigated by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments. TNF-α was injected intraperitoneally, with or without necrostatin-1, into Per1/2 mice or rhythmic and externally desynchronized WT mice to study intestinal epithelial cell death. Experimental chronic colitis was induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate. In vitro, caspase activity was assayed in Per1/2-specific small interfering RNA-transfected cells. Wee1 was overexpressed to study antiapoptosis and the cell cycle. Genetic ablation of circadian clock function or environmental CRD in mice increased susceptibility to severe intestinal inflammation and epithelial dysregulation, accompanied by excessive necroptotic cell death and a reduced number of secretory epithelial cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP)-3-mediated intestinal necroptosis was linked to increased mitotic cell cycle arrest via Per1/2-controlled Wee1, resulting in increased antiapoptosis via cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-2. Together, our data suggest that circadian rhythm stability is pivotal for the maintenance of mucosal barrier function. CRD increases intestinal necroptosis, thus rendering the gut epithelium more susceptible to inflammatory processes.-Pagel, R., Bär, F., Schröder, T., Sünderhauf, A., Künstner, A., Ibrahim, S.

https://openalex.org/W2734580914,"Novelty preference (NP) is an evolutionarily conserved, essential survival mechanism often dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders. NP is mediated by a motivational dopamine signal that increases in response to novel stimuli, thereby driving exploration. However, the mechanism by which once-novel stimuli transition to familiar stimuli is unknown. Here we describe a neuroanatomical substrate for familiarity signaling, the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) of the midbrain, which is activated as novel stimuli become familiar with multiple exposures. In mice, optogenetic silencing of IPN neurons increases salience of and interaction with familiar stimuli without affecting novelty responses, whereas photoactivation of the same neurons reduces exploration of novel stimuli mimicking familiarity. Bidirectional control of NP by the IPN depends on familiarity signals and novelty signals arising from excitatory habenula and dopaminergic ventral tegmentum inputs, which activate and reduce IPN activity, respectively. These results demonstrate that familiarity signals through unique IPN circuitry that opposes novelty seeking to control NP."
https://openalex.org/W2735663923,"The interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment is an important determinant of the pathological nature of cancers, particularly their tumorigenic abilities. The KEAP1-NRF2 system, originally identified as a critical defense mechanism against oxidative stress, is often dysregulated in various human cancers forming solid tumors, resulting in the aberrant activation of NRF2. Increased accumulation of NRF2 in cancers is strongly associated with the poor prognoses of cancer patients, including those with lung and breast cancers. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that aberrantly activated NRF2 in cancer cells drives their malignant progression and that the cancer cells consequently develop ‘NRF2 addiction.’ Although the downstream effectors of NRF2 that are responsible for cancer malignancy have been extensively studied, mechanisms of how NRF2 activation contributes to the aggressive tumorigenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found a significant correlation between NRF2 and IL-11 status in breast cancer patients. Based on a recent report demonstrating that IL-11 is induced downstream of NRF2, we examined the significance of IL-11 in NRF2-driven tumorigenesis with a newly established NRF2 addiction cancer model. Expression of Il11 was elevated during the tumorigenesis of the NRF2 addiction cancer model, but intriguingly, it was hardly detected when the cancer model cells were cultured in vitro. These results imply that a signal originating from the microenvironment cooperates with NRF2 to activate Il11. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the influence of the microenvironment on the NRF2 pathway in cancer cells and the contribution of NRF2 to the secretory phenotypes of cancers. Disruption of Il11 in the NRF2 addiction cancer model remarkably inhibited the tumorigenesis, suggesting an essential role of IL-11 in NRF2-driven tumorigenesis. Thus, this study suggests that IL-11 is a potential therapeutic target for NRF2-addicted breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2735061302,"A retrospective, longitudinal study of 1,616 patients with primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) at a single center in Norway during 1983–2010 was undertaken to investigate overall survival, disease specific survival, disease-free survival, prognostic factors for overall survival, and impact of recurrence among all-stage laryngeal cancer patients over 15 years' follow-up. The prognostic impact of gender, age, smoking/alcohol, subsite, tumour, node and metastasis staging, period and modality of treatment were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses. The importance of recurrence on survival was assessed based on case fatality rates. Five-year overall survival was 56.8%, 64.0% and 38.8%, and disease-specific survival was 80.2%, 87% and 61.6%, respectively, for the entire cohort and for glottic and supraglottic LSCC. Old age, advanced-stage LSCC and supraglottic cancer were associated with lower overall survival. The risk of disease-specific death plateaued after five years and varied significantly by subsite. Multivariate analysis of glottic LSCC revealed that surgical treatment improved overall survival, whereas old age, alcohol, T3-T4 status, positive N-status and no treatment were associated with worse survival. In supraglottic LSCC, age, alcohol, and positive N-status had a significant impact on overall survival by multivariate analysis. Five-year overall survival and disease-specific survival among patients with recurrent disease were 34% and 52%, respectively. In conclusion, marked difference in overall survival between glottic and supraglottic LSCC underline the importance of subsite-specific survival analysis. T-status and primary surgical management is essential only for glottic LSCC, emphasizing the importance of correct disease classification. Inferior outcomes in supraglottic LSCC are associated with old age, positive N-status, and improved follow-up routines are necessary. Primary tumor control is essential since recurrence impairs survival considerably in all subsites. The potential benefit of a primary surgical approach towards T3 LSCC awaits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2734667545,"Increasing heat stress caused by anthropogenic climate change may pose a substantial challenge to biodiversity due to associated detrimental effects on survival and reproduction. Therefore, heat tolerance has recently received substantial attention, but its variation throughout ontogeny and effects carried over from one developmental stage to another remained largely neglected. To explore to what extent stress experienced early in life affects later life stages, we here investigate effects of heat stress experienced in the egg stage throughout ontogeny in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana. We found that detrimental effects of heat stress in the egg stage were detectable in hatchlings, larvae and even resulting adults, as evidenced by decreased survival, growth, and body mass. This study shows that even in holometabalous insects with discrete life stages effects of stress experienced early in life are carried over to later stages, substantially reducing subsequent fitness. We argue that such effects need to be considered when trying to forecast species responses to climate change."

Here we use co-immunoprecipitation show that in C4-2 cell line, Bmi-1 directly interacted with OGT which is the only known enzyme catalyzed the O-GlcNAcylation in human. Furthermore, we identified that Ser255 is the site for Bmi-1 O-GlcNAcylation, and O-GlcNAcylation promoted Bmi-1 protein stability and its oncogenic activity. Finally, microarray analysis has characterized potential oncogenes associated pathway subject to repression via the OGT-Bmi-1 axis. Taken together, these results indicate that OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation at Ser255 stabilizes Bmi-1 and hence inhibits the TP53, PTEN and CDKN1A/CDKN2A pathway. The study not only uncovers a novel functional PTMs of Bmi-1 but also reveals a unique oncogenic role of O-GlcNAcylation in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2735500379,"Objective The NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Pioglitazone (PIO) has been found to exert an anti-inflammatory effect in patients with diabetes mellitus, but it is still unclear whether PIO exhibits a similar effect in DN. We aimed to explore the effect and underlying mechanism of PIO on DN, as well as investigate if NLRP3 is a pharmacologic target of PIO. Methods We divided 48 apolipoprotein E (apoE) (-/-) mice into 4 groups: apoE (-/-), apoE (-/-) with PIO, diabetic apoE (-/-), and diabetic apoE (-/-) with PIO. Wild type male C57BL/6 mice were used as controls (n = 8 per group). After 8 weeks of PIO treatment, we examined the baseline characteristics and metabolic parameters of each group, and we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot, and immunohistochemical staining to evaluate the expression levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), NLRP3, nuclear factor—kappa B (NF-κB), caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β in each group. Results Compared to the diabetic apoE (-/-) group, PIO treatment decreased blood glucose, cholesterol, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels. It also depressed the glomerular mesangial expansion. PIO down-regulated expression of AGEs, RAGE, and NF-κB, all of which further depressed NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18, and IL-1β levels. Conclusion Pioglitazone can ameliorate diabetic renal damage, and this effect is related to the inhibition of renal AGE/RAGE axis activation and the down-regulation of NF-κB expression. These effects lead to a decline in NLRP3 levels and downstream secretion of inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2734714627,"Protected areas are key to preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem services. However, their ability to ensure long-term survival of threatened andendangered species varies across countries, regions and landscapes. Distribution surveys can beparticularly important for assessing the value of protected areas, and gauging their efficacy incatering to species-specific requirements. We assessed the conservation value of one such reserve for a charismatic yet globally endangered species, the red panda Ailurus fulgens,in the light of on-going land-use transformation in Nepal. We conducted field surveys forindirect signs of red pandas along forest trails in 25-km2 sampling grid cells (n = 54) of Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and confronted a set of ecological hypotheses to the data using hierarchical occupancy models. We estimated overall occupancy at Ψ(SE) = 0.41 (0.007), with relatively high site-level detectability [p = 0.93 (SE = 0.001)]. Our results show that despitebeing a subsistence form of small-scale resource use, extraction of bamboo and livestock grazing negatively affected panda occurrence, albeit at different intensities. The amount of bamboo cover,rather than the overall proportion of forest cover, had greater influence on the panda occurrence. Despite availability of bamboo cover, areas with bamboo extraction and anthropogenic disturbances were less likely to be occupied by pandas. Together, these results suggest that long-term persistence of red pandas in this reserve and elsewhere across the species' range will require preventing commercial extractionof bamboo, coupled with case-specific regulation of anthropogenic exploitation of red panda habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2734823758,"Urease is a ubiquitous nickel metalloenzyme. In plants, its activation requires three urease accessory proteins (UAPs), UreD, UreF, and UreG. In bacteria, the UAPs interact with urease and facilitate activation, which involves the channeling of two nickel ions into the active site. So far this process has not been investigated in eukaryotes. Using affinity pulldowns of Strep-tagged UAPs from Arabidopsis and rice transiently expressed in planta, we demonstrate that a urease–UreD–UreF–UreG complex exists in plants and show its stepwise assembly. UreG is crucial for nickel delivery because UreG-dependent urease activation in vitro was observed only with UreG obtained from nickel-sufficient plants. This activation competence could not be generated in vitro by incubation of UreG with nickel, bicarbonate, and GTP. Compared with their bacterial orthologs, plant UreGs possess an N-terminal extension containing a His- and Asp/Glu-rich hypervariable region followed by a highly conserved sequence comprising two potential HXH metal-binding sites. Complementing the ureG-1 mutant of Arabidopsis with N-terminal deletion variants of UreG demonstrated that the hypervariable region has a minor impact on activation efficiency, whereas the conserved region up to the first HXH motif is highly beneficial and up to the second HXH motif strictly required for activation. We also show that urease reaches its full activity several days after nickel becomes available in the leaves, indicating that urease activation is limited by nickel accessibility in vivo. Our data uncover the crucial role of UreG for nickel delivery during eukaryotic urease activation, inciting further investigations of the details of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2734953507,"TMPRSS13 is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family. Although various TTSPs have been characterized in detail biochemically and functionally, the basic properties of TMPRSS13 remain unclear. Here, we investigate the activation, inhibition, post-translational modification, and localization of TMPRSS13. We show that TMPRSS13 is a glycosylated, active protease and that its own proteolytic activity mediates zymogen cleavage. Full-length, active TMPRSS13 exhibits impaired cell-surface expression in the absence of the cognate Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1 or HAI-2. Concomitant presence of TMPRSS13 with either HAI-1 or -2 mediates phosphorylation of residues in the intracellular domain of the protease, and it coincides with efficient transport of the protease to the cell surface and its subsequent shedding. Cell-surface labeling experiments indicate that the dominant form of TMPRSS13 on the cell surface is phosphorylated, whereas intracellular TMPRSS13 is predominantly non-phosphorylated. These data provide novel insight into the cellular properties of TMPRSS13 and highlight phosphorylation of TMPRSS13 as a novel post-translational modification of this TTSP family member and potentially other members of this family of proteases.

TMPRSS13 contains an N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a C-terminal serine protease domain (5.Kim D.R. Sharmin S. Inoue M. Kido H.

The protease was originally cloned from a human lung cDNA library, and transcripts were detected in lung, placenta, pancreas, and prostate (5.Kim D.R. Sharmin S. Inoue M. Kido H. Cloning and expression of novel mosaic serine proteases with and without a transmembrane domain from human lung.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed a broad TMPRSS13 protein expression profile in epithelial tissue, including epidermis, oral cavity, esophagus, bladder, stomach, small intestine, thymus, kidney, and cornea (7.Madsen D.H. Szabo R. Molinolo A.A. Bugge T.H. TMPRSS13 deficiency impairs stratum corneum formation and epidermal barrier acquisition.Biochem. J. 2014; 461: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A physiological role for TMPRSS13 in epidermal barrier development has been demonstrated in TMPRSS13-deficient mice, which display improper formation of the cornified layer of the epidermis (7.Madsen D.H.

Furthermore, TMPRSS13 has been implicated in viral infection, because it proteolytically cleaves the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein, thereby enabling membrane fusion of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and coronaviruses (8.Kido H.

A defining characteristic of TTSPs is that they are synthesized as single-chain zymogens that require proteolytic cleavage to generate the two-chain active proteases. Upon activation, catalytic activity of several TTSPs, including matriptase, matriptase-2, hepsin, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), and HAT-like 5, are inhibited by the endogenous, transmembrane, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI-1) -1 and -2 (11.Kirchhofer D.

A distinctive feature of TMPRSS13 is that it possesses the largest intracellular domain of all the TTSP family members, consisting of 160 amino acids. Upon analysis of the intracellular domain sequence, we identified regions rich in proline, serine, and threonine residues that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are natively unfolded and do not adopt typical tertiary structures (15.van der Lee R. Buljan M. Lang B. Weatheritt R.J. Daughdrill G.W. Dunker A.K. Fuxreiter M. Gough J. Gsponer J. Jones D.T. Kim P.M. Kriwacki R.W. Oldfield C.J. Pappu R.V. Tompa P. et al.Classification of intrinsically disordered regions and proteins.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114: 6589-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). IDRs are frequently subjected to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, that increase the functional state in which a protein can exist in the cell (16.van der Lee R. Lang B. Kruse K. Gsponer J. Sánchez de Groot N. Huynen M.A. Matouschek A. Fuxreiter M. Babu M.M. Intrinsically disordered segments affect protein half-life in the cell and during evolution.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 1832-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a comprehensive study on the biochemical and cell biological properties of TMPRSS13 and report for the first time that TMPRSS13 is a phosphorylated TTSP. Importantly, our results show that HAI-1 and HAI-2 enhance TMPRSS13 phosphorylation and facilitate cell-surface localization. Like other TTSPs, TMPRSS13 contains a C-terminal catalytic serine protease (SP) domain, an N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane signal anchor, and a stem region. The stem region in TMPRSS13 is composed of a group A scavenger cysteine-rich receptor domain, preceded by a single low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain (LDLA) (Fig. 1A, panel I). The catalytic domain of human TMPRSS13 contains the essential serine protease catalytic triad residues, His361, Asp409, and Ser506, and the substrate-binding pocket residues, Asp500, Ser525, and Gly527 (8.Kido H. Okumura Y. Takahashi E. Pan H.Y. Wang S. Chida J. Le T.Q. Yano M. Host envelope glycoprotein processing proteases are indispensable for entry into human cells by seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.J. Mol. Genet. Med. 2008; 3: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). TTSP's are universally synthesized as inactive zymogens that are activated by cleavage at a conserved activation site motif, predicted to be 320RIVGG in TMPRSS13 (indicated with an arrow in Fig. 1A, panel I) (5.Kim D.R. Sharmin S. Inoue M. Kido H. Cloning and expression of novel mosaic serine proteases with and without a transmembrane domain from human lung.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Kido H. Okumura Y. Takahashi E. Pan H.Y. Wang S. Chida J. Le T.Q. Yano M. Host envelope glycoprotein processing proteases are indispensable for entry into human cells by seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.J. Mol. Genet. Med. 2008; 3: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, the catalytic domain remains tethered via a disulfide bond to the stem region of the protease. Therefore, the active SP-domain can be visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under reducing conditions. In a previous study, using recombinant TMPRSS13 in which the putative activation cleavage sequence was replaced with the enterokinase recognition sequence (DDDDK), activation with enterokinase under cell-free conditions was achieved, and TMPRSS13 displayed proteolytic activity toward synthetic peptide substrates (17.Hashimoto T. Kato M. Shimomura T. Kitamura N. TMPRSS13, a type II transmembrane serine protease, is inhibited by hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 and activates pro-hepatocyte growth factor.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 4888-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, this earlier work did not examine whether this phenomenon applies in a cellular environment. To determine whether TMPRSS13, containing its native activation sequence, is expressed as an active protease in mammalian cells, we expressed full-length human TMPRSS13 in HEK293T cells and analyzed whole-cell lysates by Western blotting (Fig. 1B) using an anti-TMPRSS13 polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular part of TMPRSS13 (α-extra-TMPRSS13, indicated in Fig. 1A, panel I). The predicted molecular masses of the 586 amino acid full-length protease and the 266 amino acid SP-domain are 61 and 27 kDa, respectively. Two major proteins of ∼70 and 32 kDa were detected in lysates (Fig. 1B). These species migrated at higher molecular masses than predicted for the full-length and the SP-domain, suggesting that TMPRSS13 could be post-translationally modified. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of human TMPRSS13 using the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server revealed four potential N-glycosylation sites, two of which are located in the serine protease domain (Fig. 1A). In addition to the 70- and 32-kDa species, two forms of ∼60 and 50 kDa were recognized by the α-extra-TMPRSS13 antibody in whole-cell lysates (Fig. 1B). To minimize the risk of cleavage events occurring as a result of cell lysate preparation, or due to high levels of recombinant TMPRSS13 expression, we analyzed cell lysates with low expression levels and lysates prepared using highly stringent conditions (boiling in 1.5% SDS with 100 mm DTT; supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). We did not observe any discernible differences in protein band pattering by Western blotting between TMPRSS13 low- and high-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). Furthermore, no noticeable differences were observed when cell lysis was performed in RIPA buffer versus stringent SDS buffer (supplemental Fig. S1B). To examine whether TMPRSS13 is post-translationally modified by glycosylation in mammalian cells, protein extracts from transfected HEK293T cells were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation by PNGaseF prior to Western blot analysis and probed with α-extra-TMPRSS13 (Fig. 1C). Upon deglycosylation and probing with α-extra-TMPRSS13, we observed a reduction in the molecular mass of the proposed full-length 70-kDa form, to a form closer to the predicted lower molecular mass (∼60 kDa); this band coincides with the 60-kDa species seen before deglycosylation. These results indicate that the full-length form of TMPRSS13 exists as two different glycosylation variants (Fig. 1C). The presumed SP-domain shifted to the predicted molecular mass upon deglycosylation, indicating that one or both of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the SP-domain are utilized (Fig. 1C). The 50-kDa band migrated at ∼40 kDa and may represent an ectodomain cleavage product generated upon cleavage in the LDLA domain of the stem region. Several TTSPs have been shown to be cleaved in the stem region, including corin, where two fragments result from corin autocleavage in the frizzled 1 domain and LDLA 5 domain, respectively (18.Jiang J. Wu S. Wang W. Chen S. Peng J. Zhang X. Wu Q. Ectodomain shedding and autocleavage of the cardiac membrane protease corin.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10066-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cleavage event generating the 50-kDa TMPRSS13 species appears to be dependent on TMPRSS13 proteolytic activity because the fragment is not detected in cells transfected with a catalytically inactive from of TMPRSS13 and may result from autocleavage (Fig. 3A). Deglycosylated lysates were also analyzed using an antibody raised against a peptide localized within the first 60 (N-terminal) amino acids (α-intra-TMPRSS13) as indicated in the schematic representation of TMPRSS13 in Fig. 1A. Similarly to α-extra-TMPRSS13, we observed the 70-kDa form drop to 60 kDa upon deglycosylation (Fig. 1D). In addition, other N-terminal processed forms of ∼43 and 22 kDa were observed. The latter may result from cleavage within the LDLA domain, i.e. represent the N-terminal half of the C-terminal 50-kDa half detected with α-extra-TMPRSS13 in Fig. 1C. In addition to whole-cell lysates, conditioned media (CM) samples collected from the same cells were analyzed. One band corresponding to the predicted SP-domain was detected in cells transfected with full-length TMPRSS13 (Fig. 1E) suggesting that TMPRSS13 is shed mainly in its active form. To validate that the SP-domain is in fact a catalytically active serine protease, we performed an α2-macroglobulin (α2M) capture assay (Fig. 1F). Incubation of α2M with CM from cells expressing full-length TMPRSS13 resulted in the formation of a TMPRSS13 high molecular weight complex, consisting of the TMPRSS13 SP-domain covalently linked to α2M subunits, indicating that expression of TMPRSS13 in mammalian cells produces a catalytically active serine protease (Fig. 1F). Additionally, lysates from cells expressing a C-terminal V5-tagged version of full-length TMPRSS13 (Fig. 1A, panel II) were analyzed under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). Under non-reducing conditions, the SP-domain was not detected, indicating that the C-terminal SP-domain remains tethered to the N-terminal part of TMPRSS13 via a disulfide bond after activation cleavage as predicted. To further confirm the enzymatic activity of the TMPRSS13 SP-domain, the Pichia pastoris expression system, which utilizes the intracellular yeast protease KEX2, was employed. The KEX2 transmembrane serine protease belongs to the subtilisin-like pro-protein convertase family with specificity for cleavage after paired basic amino acids and is localized in the late Golgi compartment. By cloning the TMPRSS13 SP-domain into the PIC9 vector with the TMPRSS13 active serine protease domain sequence (321IVG) immediately following the LGKR KEX2 cleavage site encoded by the vector, a novel fusion cleavage site was generated (Fig. 1A, panel III, see arrow indicating cleavage site). The new LGKR↓IVG sequence is cleaved between Arg and Ile by KEX2, generating a secreted active TMPRSS13 SP-domain with the same IVG N terminus as the mammalian active SP-domain (Fig. 1A, panels I and III). The presence of TMPRSS13 serine protease in conditioned media from P. pastoris clones transfected with the PIC9-TMPRSS13 vector was confirmed by Western blotting using the polyclonal α-extra-TMPRSS13 antibody (Fig. 1G, left panel). Deglycosylation of the untagged, cleaved, and active form of the TMPRSS13 SP-domain, secreted by transfected P. pastoris, results in a form with an apparent molecular mass of ∼29 kDa (Fig. 1G, left panel). This indicates that both the human- and yeast-expressed active serine protease domains migrate at the same approximate molecular mass upon deglycosylation. The catalytic activity of the TMPRSS13 SP-domain was confirmed using the serine protease chromogenic peptidolytic substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-pNA (Fig. 1G, right panel). Conditioned media from cells transfected with empty PIC9 vector were included as a negative control to ensure the absence of interfering secreted yeast proteases, and the well-characterized TTSP, matriptase, which was produced in parallel in P. pastoris, was included as a positive control. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TMPRSS13 is a glycosylated protease with peptidolytic activity. Analysis of the TMPRSS13 protein sequence using the TMHMM Server version. 2.0 reveals the presence of a single transmembrane domain, predicting that the TMPRSS13 protein, similar to previously characterized members of the TTSP family, will localize on the cell surface (1.Antalis T.M.

Host envelope glycoprotein processing proteases are indispensable for entry into human cells by seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.J. Mol. Genet. Med. 2008; 3: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular localization of TMPRSS13, HEK293T cells transiently expressing the wild type (WT) full-length protease with a C-terminal V5-tag (WT-TMPRSS13-V5) (Fig. 1A, panel II) were analyzed by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. To detect the localization of WT-TMPRSS13-V5, an anti-V5 antibody was used on non-permeabilized cells in combination with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody to visualize cell-surface TMPRSS13. Interestingly, little to no WT-TMPRSS13-V5 was detected under non-permeabilized conditions (Fig. 2A, top left panel). In contrast, an intense green fluorescent signal confined to the cytoplasm in permeabilized cells was observed, indicating that the majority of WT-TMPRSS13-V5 is retained within the cells (Fig. 2A, bottom left panel). When primary antibodies were substituted with non-immune IgG, no detectable staining was observed (Fig. 2A, right panels). Because the untagged WT-TMPRSS13 appeared to be present in its active form in lysates and CM as demonstrated by Western blotting above (Fig. 1, B and E), we speculated that the active protease fails to properly localize to the cell surface due to the deleterious effects of unopposed proteolytic activity. To test this possibility, we utilized a catalytically inactive form of TMPRSS13 (S506A-TMPRSS13-V5) where the serine in the catalytic triad is mutated to an alanine (Fig. 2B). In addition, we also generated a “zymogen-locked” form (R320Q-TMPRSS13-V5) in which the conserved activation site is mutated to prohibit activation cleavage. Upon transfection, both S506A- and R320Q- TMPRSS13-V5 clearly localized to the cell surface in both permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells (Fig. 2, B and C). This observation is in agreement with the expected distribution of the predicted membrane-anchored topology of TMPRSS13, indicating that catalytically incompetent TMPRSS13 primarily localizes to the cell surface. Lysates of transfected cells were then examined by Western blotting to analyze the state of WT-TMPRSS13-V5 compared with the two mutant versions. To ensure that WT-TMPRSS13-V5 exists in its intact full-length form with both the N and C terminus present, we probed with α-intra-TMPRSS13 and α-V5 (Fig. 2D). The two full-length glycosylation variant forms (∼65 and ∼75 kDa, which include the ∼5 kDa V5-tag) were detected in WT-TMPRSS13, as well as in S506A- and R320Q-TMPRSS13-V5 with both antibodies. Thus, the C-terminal V5 tag appears intact, and the N terminus is most likely intact because the α-intra-TMPRSS13 antibody was raised against an N-terminal peptide. Surprisingly, in lysates from cells expressing S506A- or R320Q-TMPRSS13-V5 (Fig. 2D), an additional prominent and higher molecular mass (HMW) TMPRSS13 form of ∼95 kDa was observed. This HMW species was resistant to extraction in RIPA buffer followed by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2D) and to extraction under stringent conditions (1.5% SDS with 100 mm DTT) (supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting the possibility of covalent post-translational modifications, in addition to glycosylation, in two different catalytically incompetent forms of TMPRSS13. To further validate these findings, we analyzed lysates from cells expressing TMPRSS13 with an N-terminal HA-tag (depicted in Fig. 1A, panel IV, HA-WT-TMPRSS13) in combination with cell-surface biotinylation analysis using a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent (Fig. 2E). Cell-surface biotinylated proteins were pulled down using streptavidin-agarose. In accordance with the observations above, the full-length HA-WT-TMPRSS13 species (∼65 and∼75 kDa) were detected with an α-HA antibody in whole lysates confirming that the ∼65 and ∼75-kDa species both contain an intact N terminus. The HMW form of TMPRSS13 was also detected with the α-HA antibody in lysates expressing the HA-tagged S506A mutant (Fig. 2E, right panel) thereby confirming that the ∼65, ∼75, and ∼95 kDa are all full-length proteins that contain both the N and C termini. The biotinylation assay confirmed that WT-TMPRSS13 is not present in detectable amounts in the cell-surface fraction (Fig. 2E, left panel), whereas S506A-TMPRSS13 is readily detected on the cell surface (Fig. 2E, right panel), mainly it its HMW form. Detailed characterization of the HMW form is described below under “TMPRSS13 is phosphorylated.” We consistently observed decreased detection of the cleaved active SP-domain in S506A-TMPRSS13-expressing cells in comparison with the levels of the active species seen in cells transfected with WT-TMPRSS13 (Fig. 3A). Quantitative ratio comparisons of the active (SP-domain) versus inactive full-length forms of TMPRSS13 confirmed that the majority of TMPRSS13 in S506A-TMPRSS13-expressing cells is in its inactive full-length forms (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that TMPRSS13 proteolytic activity is important for its own activation and that TMPRSS13, like several other TTSPs, is likely capable of auto-activation. To further explore the possibility of auto-activation, intact cells transfected with S506A-TMPRSS13-V5 were treated with the soluble recombinant SP-domain of TMPRSS13, prostasin, or matriptase (Fig. 3C). After protease treatment, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected to detect TMPRSS13 released by shedding. Treatment of cells with exogenous, active TMPRSS13 SP-domain led to robust activation as evidenced by detection of the SP-domain in lysates and supernatant. The TMPRSS13 SP-domain is the result of cleavage and activation of full-length S506A-TMPRSS13-V5 and not detection of the exogenous P. pastoris active SP-domain because the recombinant P. pastoris active SP-domain lacks the V5 epitope. The active, recombinant SP-domain from prostasin, a non-TTSP glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface serine protease, had no effect, whereas a low level of TMPRSS13 SP-domain was detected upon treatment with the TTSP, matriptase, in lysates with abundant SP-domain in the supernatant. Interestingly, the HMW form of TMPRSS13 appears to be preferentially cleaved by both TMPRSS13 and matriptase, which indicates that this form is likely accessible on the cell surface to exogenously added proteases. This is in agreement with the biotinylation assay using HA-S506A-TMPRSS13, which demonstrates that the HMW species is the primary species observed at the cell surface (Fig. 2E). Using a different approach, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with V5-tagged S506A-TMPRSS13 and either empty vector or HA-tagged WT-TMPRSS13 (supplemental Fig. S3). Upon co-transfection with HA-WT-TMPRSS13, cleavage of V5-S506A-TMPRSS13 was observed. Lower signal of the HMW species was observed upon co-expression when compared with the ∼75-kDa species, suggesting that the HMW species is preferentially cleaved and activated upon co-expression. Together, the data from these different assays support the notion that TMPRSS13 is capable of auto-activation and that the HMW species is preferentially converted into the two-chain species. To characterize the HMW form of TMPRSS13, we first performed deglycosylation of lysates from cells expressing untagged S506A- or R320Q-TMPRSS13, which resulted in the HMW species to migrate at ∼73 kDa, which is ∼13 kDa greater than the full-length deglycosylated TMPRSS13 (Fig. 4A). This confirms that the HMW form is subject to additional post-translational modification(s)"

https://openalex.org/W2735456022,"It has been hypothesized that brain development during adolescence perturbs reward processing in a way that may ultimately contribute to the risky decision making associated with this stage of life, particularly in young males. To investigate potential reward dysfunction during adolescence, Experiment 1 examined palatable fluid intake in rats as a function of age and sex. During a series of twice-weekly test sessions, non-food-deprived rats were given the opportunity to voluntarily consume a highly palatable sweetened condensed milk (SCM) solution. We found that adolescent male, but not female, rats exhibited a pronounced, transient increase in SCM intake (normalized by body weight) that was centered around puberty. Additionally, adult females consumed more SCM than adult males and adolescent females. Using a well-established analytical framework to parse the influences of reward palatability and satiety on the temporal structure of feeding behavior, we found that palatability-driven intake at the outset of the meal was significantly elevated in adolescent males, relative to the other groups. Furthermore, although we found that there were some group differences in the onset of satiety, they were unlikely to contribute to differences in intake. Experiment 2 confirmed that adolescent male rats exhibit elevated palatable fluid consumption, relative to adult males, even when a non-caloric saccharin solution was used as the taste stimulus, demonstrating that these results were unlikely to be related to age-related differences in metabolic need. These findings suggest that elevated palatable food intake during adolescence is sex specific and driven by a fundamental change in reward processing. As adolescent risk taking has been hypothesized as a potential result of hypersensitivity to and overvaluation of appetitive stimuli, individual differences in reward palatability may factor into individual differences in adolescent risky decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2735492962,"Ring-between-ring (RBR) E3 ligases have been implicated in autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The functions of many RBR E3s are poorly defined, and their regulation is complex, involving post-translational modifications and allosteric regulation with other protein partners. The functional complexity of RBRs, coupled with the complexity of the native ubiquitination reaction that requires ATP and E1 and E2 enzymes, makes it difficult to study these ligases for basic research and therapeutic purposes. To address this challenge, we developed novel chemical probes, ubiquitin C-terminal fluorescein thioesters UbMES and UbFluor, to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the activity of the RBR E3 ligase PARKIN in a simple experimental setup and in real time using fluorescence polarization. First, we confirmed that PARKIN does not require an E2 enzyme for substrate ubiquitination, lysine selection, and polyubiquitin chain formation. Second, we confirmed that UbFluor quantitatively detects naturally occurring activation states of PARKIN caused by Ser65 phosphorylation (pPARKIN) and phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb). Third, we showed that both pUb and the ubiquitin-accepting substrate contribute to maximal pPARKIN ubiquitin conjugation turnover. pUb enhances the transthiolation step, whereas the substrate clears the pPARKIN∼Ub thioester intermediate. Finally, we established that UbFluor can quantify activation or inhibition of PARKIN by structural mutations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using UbFluor for quantitative studies of the biochemistry of RBR E3s and for high-throughput screening of small-molecule activators or inhibitors of PARKIN and other RBR E3 ligases.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common type of neurodegenerative disease, and it is characterized by defects in mitochondrial function. Ubiquitin ligase PARKIN and phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative Ser/Thr kinase 1 (PINK1) reconstitute a major pathway to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria and are thought to protect dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress (1Pickrell A.M. Youle R.J. The roles of PINK1, Parkin, and mitochondrial fidelity in Parkinson's disease.Neuron. 2015; 85: 257-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). PINK1 acts upstream of PARKIN and is continuously imported to the mitochondria, where it is cleaved by PARL protease, exported back to the cytosol, and degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system according to the N-end rule. Upon mitochondrial damage, PINK1 processing by PARL is inhibited, and PINK1 accumulates at the mitochondrial outer membrane (2Jin S.M. Lazarou M. Wang C. Kane L.A. Narendra D.P. Youle R.J.

In autoinhibited PARKIN, the E2∼Ub-binding site on RING1 is blocked by the REP domain, whereas the catalytic cysteine on RING2 is blocked by the UPD domain (supplemental Fig. S1E) (16Zheng X.

Phosphorylation of PARKIN (pPARKIN) and pUb binding to PARKIN/pPARKIN disrupt these autoinhibitory conformations and activate PARKIN. Interestingly, although the activation roles of PINK1 and pUb have been investigated, the role of protein substrates in PARKIN catalytic turnover have escaped attention. PARKIN substrates can provide acceptor lysines that clear PARKIN∼Ub thioester, thus facilitating PARKIN catalytic turnover (52Bender M.L. Kezdy F.J. Wedler F.C. α-Chymotrypsin–enzyme concentration and kinetics.J. Chem. Educ. 1967; 44: 84Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Most importantly, there is a lack of methods to a robust and simple quantifying of PARKIN and other RBR E3s activities, which is needed for both biochemical studies and small molecule screens. Typical in vitro ubiquitination assays use a reconstituted native cascade composed of at least five components and a substrate, if used: E1, E2, E3, ubiquitin, and ATP. In this setting, the assay is operationally complex and expensive, and there are many enzyme intermediates that make it difficult to conduct biochemical studies. Coupled with the complex autoregulatory mechanisms that govern the function of PARKIN and other RBR E3s, the complexity of native ubiquitination assays is a major bottleneck in assessing the activity of RBR E3 enzymes. Recently developed electrophilic activity-based probes, such as UbVME and electrophilic E2∼Ub thioester mimics (53Pao K.C. Stanley M. Han C. Lai Y.C. Murphy P. Balk K. Wood N.T. Corti O. Corvol J.C.

However, these probes are stoichiometric suicide inhibitors and therefore do not report on catalytic turnover, lack high throughput capabilities, and rely on Western blotting for quantitation. Absolute equantification-mass spectrometry (AQUA-MS) enables quantification of polyubiquitin chain formation by PARKIN over multiple rounds of Ub conjugation in vitro (8Ordureau A. Sarraf S.A.

Cell. 2014; 56: 360-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Although this method offers exquisite sensitivity, it is not amenable to high-throughput screening, and it requires considerable expertise and instrumentation beyond typical laboratory operations. To begin addressing these challenges, we previously demonstrated that a ubiquitin C-terminal thioester probe (ubiquitin mercaptoethanesulfonate, UbMES) and its fluorescent analogue UbFluor could bypass the need for E1, ATP, and E2 enzymes, thereby simplifying assessment of HECT E3 ligase activity in vitro (Fig. 1) (54Park S.

UbFluor: a fluorescent thioester to monitor HECT E3 ligase catalysis.Curr. Protoc. Chem. Biol. 2017; 9: 11-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because the resulting system bypasses the need for ATP and E1 and E2 enzymes, we called it bypassing system or ByS. We reasoned that the same system could be useful for RBRs, as RBR ligases also form an obligate E3∼Ub thioester prior to ligation. However, two unique features of RBR E3 ligases require consideration. First, unlike HECT ligases, RBRs are cysteine-rich. For example, human PARKIN has 20 surface-exposed cysteines that could potentially undergo non-specific transthiolation with Ub-MES (44Trempe J.F. Sauvé V. Grenier K. Seirafi M. Tang M.Y. Ménade M. Al-Abdul-Wahid S. Krett J. Wong K. Kozlov G. Nagar B. Fon E.A. Gehring K. Structure of Parkin reveals mechanisms for ubiquitin ligase activation.Science. 2013; 340: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Second, PARKIN and other RBR ligases have complex, multistep activation mechanisms (69Dove K.K. Klevit R.E. RING-Between-RING E3 ligases: emerging themes amid the variations.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 10.1016/j.jmb.2017.08.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and it was not clear at the outset of this work whether Ub-MES and its analogues could recapitulate these mechanisms. For example, it was not clear whether UbMES that lacks the E2 enzyme could sense activating mutations that disrupt REP/RING1 interface and open the E2 enzyme-binding site (44Trempe J.F. Sauvé V. Grenier K. Seirafi M. Tang M.Y. Ménade M. Al-Abdul-Wahid S. Krett J. Wong K. Kozlov G. Nagar B. Fon E.A. Gehring K.

In this work, we report that E2-independent ByS probes can be directly and specifically charged to the catalytic cysteine of PARKIN or pPARKIN, resulting in native-like autoubiquitination, substrate ubiquitination, and polyUb chain formation.

The aim of this study was to investigate lobar liver volume changes after unilateral radioembolization and to search for factors associated with hypertrophy of the untreated lobe.Seventy-five patients were retrospectively evaluated. Inclusion criteria were: (1) right-lobar radioembolization for unresectable unilateral HCC, (2) available liver computed tomography scans before, 1, 3, and at least 6 months after radioembolization. Baseline patient characteristics included clinical features, laboratory results, spleen volume, and liver computed tomography. Absolute and relative (referred to the whole liver volume) liver lobe volumes (LLV) as well as relative LLV (rLLV) change per month were evaluated and compared.Absolute and relative contralateral LLV continuously increased after radioembolization (p<0.001). Mean relative contralateral LLV increased from 36±11.6% before radioembolization to 50±15.3% 6 months after radioembolization. Median contralateral rLLV increase/month (within first 6 months) was 2.5%. Contralateral rLLV increase/month was significantly lower in patients with ascites (p = 0.017) or platelet count <100/nl (p = 0.009). An inverse correlation of contralateral rLVV increase/month with spleen volume (p = 0.017), patient age (p = 0.024), Child Pugh score (p = 0.001), and tumor burden (p = 0.001) was found.Significant contralateral hypertrophy and ipsilateral atrophy were common after unilateral radioembolization. Small spleen volume, low patient age, low Child Pugh score, absence of ascites, platelet count ≥100/nl, and low tumor burden were associated with increased contralateral hypertrophy, indicating that younger patients with compensated cirrhosis might benefit most from radioembolization in a ""bridge-to-resection"" setting."

In this study, we observed the effects of TRAP1 in renal tubular epithelial cell mitochondria in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction and its function in cell apoptosis and TIF. Results show that TRAP1 could protect the mitochondrial structure in renal tubular epithelial cells; maintain the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP, and mitochondrial DNA copy number; inhibit reactive oxygen species production; stabilize the expression of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein mitofilin; reduce renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis; and inhibit TIF.

https://openalex.org/W2734786119,"The majority of proteins form oligomers which have rotational symmetry. Literature has suggested many functional advantages that the symmetric packing offers. Yet, despite these advantages, the vast majority of protein oligomers are only nearly symmetric. A key question in the field of proteins structure is therefore, if symmetry is so advantageous, why do oligomers settle for aggregates that do not maximize that structural property? The answer to that question is apparently multi-parametric, and involves distortions at the interaction zones of the monomer units of the oligomer in order to minimize the free energy, the dynamics of the protein, the effects of surroundings parameters, and the mechanism of oligomerization. The study of this problem is in its infancy: Only the first parameter has been explored so far. Here we focus on the last parameter–the mechanism of formation. To test this effect we have selected to focus on the domain swapping mechanism of oligomerization, by which oligomers form in a mechanism that swaps identical portions of monomeric units, resulting in an interwoven oligomer. We are using continuous symmetry measures to analyze in detail the oligomer formed by this mechanism, and found, that without exception, in all analyzed cases, perfect symmetry is given away, and we are able to identify that the main burden of distortion lies in the hinge regions that connect the swapped portions. We show that the continuous symmetry analysis method clearly identifies the hinge region of swapped domain proteins–considered to be a non-trivial task. We corroborate our conclusion about the central role of the hinge region in affecting the symmetry of the oligomers, by a special probability analysis developed particularly for that purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2735878616,"Rationale From June of 2009 to August of 2010 the influenza subtype H1N1pdm09 caused a worldwide pandemic. The impact on populations and health care systems around the globe evolved differently. Substantial data come from the German national surveillance network in an outpatient and private practice setting, while information on hospitalized patients in Germany is rather limited. Methods Data from the Federal Statistics Office comprising health insurance claims of the entire nationwide inpatient sample from 2005 to 2012 were used to identify patients who were hospitalized for laboratory-confirmed influenza and to analyse demographical aspects, comorbidities, hospitalization duration, outcomes and ventilator use during the pandemic and seasonal waves of influenza. Measurements and main results A number of 34,493 admissions for laboratory-confirmed influenza occurred during waves between 2005 and 2012. During the pandemic seasonal waves, the number of hospitalizations vastly surpassed the level that was seen in any of the seasonal waves. A major demographic shift was seen with respect to patient age, as younger patients (< 60 years old) were more frequently hospitalized. Mean length of stay was shorter (149 vs. 193 hours), mean time on ventilation tended to be shorter (261 vs. 305 hours) in young children (< 4 years old) and longer (393 vs. 339 hours) in the elderly (> 60 years old). Time to ventilation was shorter in non-fatal cases (328 vs. 349 hours) and longer in fatal cases (419 vs. 358 hours). Logistic regression was used to show the impact of comorbidities and co-diagnoses on mortality and the need for ventilation, as well as differences between pandemic and seasonal influenza. Conclusions Inpatient data suggest differences in patient populations during pandemic and seasonal influenza. Younger patients were more frequently hospitalized. Differences with respect to the presence of certain comorbidities and co-diagnoses, length of stay, time to ventilation and ventilation time could be identified."

However, the association between sleep apnea and subsequent depressive disorders in the pediatric population remains undetermined. Thus, this study investigated the risk of depressive disorders among pediatric patients with sleep apnea. Methods In this study, the population-based National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan was used to identify patients who had first been diagnosed with sleep apnea between 1999 and 2013. Patients with sleep apnea who were younger than 18 years were included in the sleep apnea group. Controls (those without sleep apnea) were matched to patients with sleep apnea at a 1:10 ratio by age, sex, and index year. Patients who had baseline or inherited depressive disorders before the enrollment date were excluded. The two groups were followed up until December 31, 2013. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of one or more depressive disorders. Results At the end of this study, 6,237 children had been enrolled, comprising 567 children with sleep apnea and 5,670 children without sleep apnea. During the mean follow-up period of 5.87 years, a total of 77 children (1.23%) developed one or more depressive disorders; 14 (2.46%) from the sleep apnea group and 63 (1.11%) from the control group. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that children with sleep apnea had a significantly higher risk of depressive disorders (log-rank test, p = 0.002). After adjusting for covariates, the risk of subsequent depressive disorders among children with sleep apnea was still significantly higher (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.25–4.05; p = 0.006). Moreover, boys with sleep apnea had a significantly higher risk than those without sleep apnea (adjusted HR = 3.77; 95% CI, 1.82–7.54; p < 0.001). Furthermore, in sleep apnea group, children older than 12 years of age had more risk to depression (hazard ratio (HR) = 7.1833, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3734 to 21.7411; p = 0.0004). Conclusions This study found a significantly higher subsequent risk of depressive disorders in children with sleep apnea, particularly boys and those older than 12 years of age. The study findings strongly suggest that clinicians should provide psychological evaluation and supportive care for children with sleep apnea, in addition to medical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2735718022,"After the exponential growth phase, variability in the scattering efficiency of phytoplankton cells over their complete life cycle is not well characterised. Bulk measurements are impacted by senescent cells and detritrus. Thus the analysis of the evolution of the optical properties thanks to their morphological and/or intra-cellular variations remains poorly studied. Using the Cytosense flow cytometer (CytoBuoy b.v., NL), the temporal course of the forward and sideward efficiencies of two phytoplankton species (Thalassiosira pseudonana and Chlamydomonas concordia) were analyzed during a complete life-cycle. These two species differ considerably from a morphological point of view. Over the whole experiment, the forward and sideward efficiencies of Thalassiosira pseudonana were, on average, respectively 2.2 and 1.6 times higher than the efficiencies of Chlamydomonas concordia. Large intra-species variability of the efficiencies were observed over the life cycle of the considered species. It highlights the importance of considering the optical properties of phytoplankton cells as a function of the population growth stage of the considered species. Furthermore, flow cytometry measurements were combined with radiative transfer simulations and biogeochemical and optical measurements. Results showed that the real refractive index of the chloroplast is a key parameter driving the sideward signal and that a simplistic two-layered model (cytoplasm-chloroplast) seems particularly appropriate to represent the phytoplankton cells."
https://openalex.org/W2736108724,"The median raphe region (MRR) is believed to control the fear circuitry indirectly, by influencing the encoding and retrieval of fear memories by amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Here we show that in addition to this established role, MRR stimulation may alone elicit the emergence of remote but not recent fear memories. We substituted electric shocks with optic stimulation of MRR in C57BL/6N male mice in an optogenetic conditioning paradigm and found that stimulations produced agitation, but not fear, during the conditioning trial. Contextual fear, reflected by freezing was not present the next day, but appeared after a 7 days incubation. The optogenetic silencing of MRR during electric shocks ameliorated conditioned fear also seven, but not one day after conditioning. The optogenetic stimulation patterns (50Hz theta burst and 20Hz) used in our tests elicited serotonin release in vitro and lead to activation primarily in the periaqueductal gray examined by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Earlier studies demonstrated that fear can be induced acutely by stimulation of several subcortical centers, which, however, do not generate persistent fear memories. Here we show that the MRR also elicits fear, but this develops slowly over time, likely by plastic changes induced by the area and its connections. These findings assign a specific role to the MRR in fear learning. Particularly, we suggest that this area is responsible for the durable sensitization of fear circuits towards aversive contexts, and by this, it contributes to the persistence of fear memories. This suggests the existence a bottom-up control of fear circuits by the MRR, which complements the top-down control exerted by the medial prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2734349639,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (steatosis) is the most prevalent liver disease in the Western world. One of the advanced pathologies is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and disruption of autophagic flux.

The liver plays a central role in metabolizing and processing fatty acids for export as complex lipids to the adipose tissue for storage; however, metabolic diseases such as obesity and insulin resistance trigger adipocytes to release excess levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) into the serum. Elevated levels of saturated FFAs are suggested to cause lipotoxicity in peripheral tissues, including liver, activating cellular stress pathways, which can in turn lead to increased inflammation and hepatocyte death (4.Ricchi M.

Saturated FFAs can induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), allowing for changes in both transcriptional and translational modes of gene expression that can serve to alleviate stresses afflicting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6.Malhi H.

The role of endoplasmic reticulum in hepatic lipid homeostasis and stress signaling.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The UPR is composed of sensor proteins for ER stress, including PERK (EIF2AK3/PEK) that phosphorylates the α subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α-P), which represses global translation initiation and lowers the influx of nascent polypeptides into the stressed ER (8.Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). Additionally, eIF2α-P leads to preferential translation of key UPR genes that function in stress adaptation (9.Baird T.D. Wek R.C. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation and translational control in metabolism.Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that eIF2α-P by PERK results in preferential translation of the transcription factor CHOP (GADD153/DDIT3), which plays a central role in saturated FFA-induced lipotoxicity and hepatic inflammation (10.Willy J.A.

Of interest, although shorter term treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with the saturated FFA palmitate triggered autophagy, prolonged exposure led to a block in autophagic flux and cell death (11.González-Rodríguez A. Mayoral R. Agra N. Valdecantos M.P. Pardo V. Miquilena-Colina M.E. Vargas-Castrillón J. Lo Iacono O. Corazzari M. Fimia G.M. Piacentini M. Muntané J. Boscá L. García-Monzón C. Martín-Sanz P. Valverde Á.M. Impaired autophagic flux is associated with increased endoplasmic reticulum stress during the development of NAFLD.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5: e1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It was reasoned that the block in autophagic flux contributes to the sensitivity of hepatocytes to prolonged exposure to saturated FFA, and it was reported that loss of CHOP function lowered the blockage of autophagic flux triggered by saturated FFA and protected hepatocytes from cell death (11.González-Rodríguez A. Mayoral R. Agra N. Valdecantos M.P. Pardo V. Miquilena-Colina M.E. Vargas-Castrillón J. Lo Iacono O. Corazzari M. Fimia G.M. Piacentini M. Muntané J. Boscá L. García-Monzón C. Martín-Sanz P.

CHOP as well as its upstream effector–transcription factor ATF4 are suggested to contribute to the expression of select genes implicated in the formation and function of autophagosomes (16.Høyer-Hansen M.

A role for the UPR in the initiation of autophagy is also supported by the finding that substitutions in eIF2α that block phosphorylation by PERK result in defective lipidation of LC3b and a consequent block in phagophore initiation (19.Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Tanida I. Ueno T. Isoai A. Kumagai H. Ogawa S. Kaufman R.J. Kominami E. Momoi T. ER stress (PERK/eIF2α phosphorylation) mediates the polyglutamine-induced LC3 conversion, an essential step for autophagy formation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that there may be additional unknown direct translational target(s) of eIF2α-P that are essential for phagophore initiation during stress. The underlying mechanisms by which PERK and the UPR contribute to induction of autophagy will be a central focus of this study. We recently identified the α isoform of inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (IBTKα) as being preferentially translated in response to eIF2α-P and ER stress (20.Baird T.D. Palam L.R. Fusakio M.E. Willy J.A. Davis C.M. McClintick J.N. Anthony T.G. Wek R.C. Selective mRNA translation during eIF2 phosphorylation induces expression of IBTKα.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 1686-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the biological functions of IBTKα are not yet understood, it is noted that IBTKα contains protein–protein interaction domains, including ankyrin repeats and the BTB/POZ domain, which is suggested to enable IBTKα to serve as a substrate adapter for the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL3 (21.Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M.

In this study, we show that IBTKα expression is rapidly induced by PERK upon exposure to saturated FFA and that the ensuing activation of IBTKα plays an essential role in phagophore initiation by IBTKα assembly into a multisubunit complex with LC3b, SEC16A, and SEC31A at the endoplasmic reticulum exit site (ERES). We also show that depletion of IBTKα results in impaired autophagy, along with reduced protein secretion, resulting in suppression of FFA-induced hepatocyte cell death. Finally, we use human liver biopsy samples to demonstrate that the UPR-inflammation signaling axis and increased IBTKα expression are associated with progression from steatosis to NASH, thereby linking the UPR, inflammation, and inhibition of autophagic flux to disease pathogenesis in humans. To determine whether IBTKα is preferentially translated in human hepatocytes following metabolic stress, we treated human hepatoma HepG2 cells with palmitate or thapsigargin, a pharmacological agent that potently induces ER stress. Following 6 h of treatment, we performed polysome profiling (Fig. 1A). Both thapsigargin and palmitate resulted in a reduction of heavy polysomes coincident with accumulation of monosomes, indicative of lowered global translation initiation compared with vehicle treatment. IBTKα mRNA, as well as those encoding preferentially translated controls ATF4 and CHOP, was then measured by comparing the percent of each gene transcript in the gradient fractions (Fig. 1, B and C). After either stress treatment, there was a significant shift of IBTKα mRNA toward large polysomes compared with vehicle, similar to the expected increase in the ATF4 and CHOP transcripts. Interestingly, IBTKα was present in the heaviest polysome fractions 6 and 7 after either thapsigargin or palmitate treatment, whereas ATF4 and CHOP were predominantly in polysome fractions 4–6. This shift of the IBTKα mRNA to the heaviest polysome fractions is consistent with the fact that IBTKα has a longer coding sequence that can accommodate more translating ribosomes compared with ATF4 and CHOP. HepG2 cells deleted for PERK (PERK-KO) by using CRISPR/Cas9 retained high levels of translation as viewed by heavy polysomes independent of stress (Fig. 1, D and E) and showed only modest changes in fraction distributions of IBTKα, ATF4, or CHOP mRNAs (Fig. 1, F and G). We conclude that PERK is required for repression of global protein synthesis, coincident with preferential translation of IBTKα and UPR members in human hepatocytes in response to ER stress triggered by lipotoxicity. PERK and its downstream effector CHOP also trigger transcriptional expression of UPR target genes to alleviate stress or activate inflammation (8.Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar, 23.Han J. Back S.H. Hur J. Lin Y.H.

ER-stress-induced transcriptional regulation increases protein synthesis leading to cell death.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). To determine whether IBTKα expression was also regulated at the transcriptional level during treatment with palmitate, we generated CHOP knock-out (CHOP-KO) HepG2 cells and exposed these cells along with their wild-type (WT) counterparts to saturated FFAs or vehicle (Fig. 1, H and I). IBTKα mRNA and protein were induced only in WT HepG2 cells treated with palmitate, whereas basal levels remained unchanged between WT and CHOP-KO cells. These results indicate that PERK activation and its downstream effector CHOP are also required for induced IBTKα mRNA expression in the UPR. Although it was suggested that both apoptosis and autophagy are associated with lipotoxicity during NASH (5.Berlanga A. Guiu-Jurado E. Porras J.A. Auguet T.

Apoptosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: diagnostic and therapeutic implications.Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2011; 5: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether either of these pathways play a direct role in hepatocyte death. To determine whether apoptotic pathways are involved, we investigated the role of caspases in hepatocyte death during lipotoxicity by treating HepG2 cells with saturated and unsaturated FFAs, either alone or in the presence of pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD/FMK (Fig. 2, A and B). In parallel, we also used controls, including staurosporine, that induce apoptosis and the potent ER stress agent tunicamycin. Treatment with saturated FFAs palmitate and stearate produced a modest increase in caspase activity, but the addition of ZVAD/FMK did not rescue cell death. By contrast, ZVAD/FMK blocked both staurosporine-induced cell death and caspase 3/7 activation. Neither the unsaturated FFA oleate nor the canonical UPR activator tunicamycin resulted in appreciable cell death after 24 h. During apoptosis, nuclear localization of cleaved caspase 3 is essential for breakdown of the nuclear lamina and DNA fragmentation (25.Luo M. Lu Z. Sun H. Yuan K. Zhang Q. Meng S. Wang F. Guo H. Ju X. Liu Y. Ye T. Lu Z. Zhai Z. Nuclear entry of active caspase-3 is facilitated by its p3-recognition-based specific cleavage activity.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although cleaved caspase 3 was localized predominantly to the nucleus after staurosporine treatment as judged by immunocytochemistry, total cleaved caspase 3 was reduced and retained in the cytoplasm with the addition of ZVAD/FMK (Fig. 2C). By contrast, the low levels of caspase 3 activation determined during treatment with saturated FFAs were coincident with caspase 3 being retained in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that apoptosis is not the predominant mode of hepatocyte death following exposure to saturated FFAs. Inhibition of autophagic flux is linked with NASH in human patients (11.González-Rodríguez A. Mayoral R. Agra N. Valdecantos M.P. Pardo V. Miquilena-Colina M.E. Vargas-Castrillón J. Lo Iacono O.

Czaja M.J. Autophagy in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2011; 5: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine whether autophagy was associated with activation of the UPR, induction of IBTKα, and cell death, we treated HepG2 cells with saturated or unsaturated FFAs for up to 24 h and measured key markers of UPR activation as well as LC3b and P62/SQSTM1 to assess changes in autophagy (Fig. 2, D and E). Increased levels of ATF4 and IBTKα proteins were observed by 3 h after treatment with palmitate and 6 h of tunicamycin, prior to induction of CHOP. Furthermore, palmitate and stearate triggered accumulation of lipidated LC3b-II and P62, suggesting that saturated FFAs either induced autophagy or, alternatively, blocked autophagic flux. Oleate had only a modest effect on the UPR and did not alter the autophagic markers, whereas treatment with tunicamycin led to potent induction of the UPR and increased LC3b-II but produced only a transient increase in P62. To confirm whether prolonged exposure to saturated FFAs interferes with autophagic flux as reported (11.González-Rodríguez A. Mayoral R. Agra N. Valdecantos M.P. Pardo V. Miquilena-Colina M.E. Vargas-Castrillón J. Lo Iacono O. Corazzari M. Fimia G.M. Piacentini M. Muntané J. Boscá L. García-Monzón C. Martín-Sanz P. Valverde Á.M. Impaired autophagic flux is associated with increased endoplasmic reticulum stress during the development of NAFLD.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5: e1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), we expressed N-terminal GFP-LC3b in HepG2 cells and assessed its co-localization with lysosomes by staining with LAMP2 (Fig. 2F). First, we treated the HepG2 cells with chloroquine, which inhibits proteolysis in the lysosome and hence stabilizes LC3b; 75% of GFP-LC3b was co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP2, indicating that autophagosomes were properly trafficked to the lysosomes. By contrast, treatment with palmitate disrupted autophagosome trafficking to the lysosome, with only 10% of GFP-LC3b being co-localized with LAMP2 despite a robust induction of autophagy. These results are consistent with prior reports that prolonged treatment with palmitate leads to a block in autophagic flux, which would impair proper trafficking of damaged macromolecules and organelles to the lysosome for degradation. Does disruption in the autophagic process play an active role in hepatocyte death upon exposure to saturated FFAs? We treated HepG2 cells with palmitate alone or in combination with agents that disrupt either autophagy initiation (3-methyladenine) or lysosomal function (chloroquine or bafilomycin A1) for 24 h and measured cell death (Fig. 2, G and H). To determine whether this mechanism was relevant to human hepatocytes, we also repeated the experiment with primary human hepatocytes. Addition of 3-methyladenine, which prevents induction of autophagy by inhibiting PI3K, increased the survival of both HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes, whereas the lysosome inhibitors resulted in increased death of HepG2 cells. Human primary hepatocytes were more sensitive to palmitate-induced cell death (>80% compared with 30% in HepG2 cells); therefore, adding chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 did not increase cell death further. These results suggest that inhibition of autophagic flux, rather than inhibition of phagophore formation per se, plays an important role in palmitate-induced hepatotoxicity. To explore the hypothesis that IBTKα regulates cell survival by induction of autophagy, we generated IBTKα knockdown (shIBTKα) HepG2 cells using shRNA and measured key protein markers of stress and autophagy, in addition to cell death following palmitate treatment (Fig. 3A). As controls, we also knocked down ATG5, which is important for formation of the autophagosome (27.Noda N.N. Inagaki F. Mechanisms of autophagy.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), as well as CHOP that is suggested to contribute to expression of select autophagy genes. Following palmitate exposure, each of the three gene knockdowns resulted in decreased conversion of LC3b-I to LC3b-II and levels of P62 coincident with lowered cell death (Fig. 3, A and B). Of interest, either knockdown of IBTKα or overexpression of IBTKα similarly reduced LC3b lipidation and P62 levels, suggesting that the appropriate amount of IBTKα expressed in cells is critical for its function (Fig. 3C). Equivalent to depletion of IBTKα, overexpression of IBTKα also suppressed the toxicity of palmitate (Fig. 3D). Earlier, we reported that knockdown of IBTKα in mouse embryo fibroblasts in the absence of environmental stress and to a lesser extent in HepG2 cells can lead to increased apoptosis (9.Baird T.D. Wek R.C. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation and translational control in metabolism.Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, we determined that the small amounts of caspase 3/7 activity measured in HepG2 cells void of stress were modestly elevated by knockdown of IBTKα (supplemental Fig. 1). A similar result was determined for HepG2 cells treated with bafilomycin A1. By contrast, the modest amounts of caspase 3/7 activity measured in HepG2 cells exposed to palmitate (Fig. 2A) were significantly lowered by depletion of IBTKα (supplemental Fig. 1). These results combined with our lipotoxicity results indicate that IBTKα can have differential effects on cell viability depending on the nature and extent of the environmental stress and the affected cell types. IBTKα mRNA levels and translation were increased by the PERK/CHOP pathway in response to palmitate (Fig. 1). Corresponding expression measurements of the IBTKα-depleted cells indicated that although the levels of IBTKα mRNA and protein were lowered as expected, CHOP and its known transcriptional target genes MAP1LC3B and SQSTM1 were fully induced after palmitate treatment, indicating that IBTKα functions as a unique downstream effector in the UPR (Fig. 3, A and E). Of note, mTORC1 remained repressed in all knockdowns following palmitate treatment, as measured by phosphorylation of S6 kinase, yet autophagy was not induced (Fig. 3A). These findings indicate that IBTKα is required for the induction of autophagy during activation of the UPR by lipotoxicity, and depletion of IBTKα or its upstream regulator CHOP rescues hepatocytes from exposure to saturated FFAs. Both shIBTKα and control (shCTRL) cells were next assayed for accumulation of LC3b in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine (Fig. 3B). Depletion of IBTKα decreased conversion of LC3b-I to LC3b-II, as well as lowered accumulation of P62 upon treatment with chloroquine. Similar results were also observed upon overexpression of IBTKα (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that IBTKα is not only a downstream UPR target but is also an essential effector in a pathway leading to the induction of autophagy prior to LC3b lipidation. To further test the proposed role of IBTKα in phagophore initiation, we expressed GFP-LC3b in HepG2 cells treated with chloroquine or vehicle and measured the accumulation of LC3b as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3F). In the control HepG2 (shCTRL) cells, there was a distinct punctate pattern upon chloroquine treatment. However, knockdown of either ATG5 or IBTKα sharply lowered the detected punctate GFP-LCb3. These results support the idea that IBTKα is critical for phagophore initiation. We next investigated the ultrastructural changes by electron microscopy that occurred in WT, CHOP-KO, and IBTKα-KO HepG2 cells treated with bafilomycin A1, palmitate, or vehicle (supplemental Figs. S2–S4). Deletion of IBTKα in cells in the absence of stress resulted in loss of ER organization and an accumulation of damaged mitochondria (supplemental Figs. S2C and S3). Bafilomycin A1 or palmitate treatment of IBTKα-KO cells, but not control cells, led to dilation of the ER, suggesting that IBTKα is important for ER organization and general trafficking in the adaptive response to ER stress. WT HepG2 cells treated with bafilomycin A1 showed accumulation of large autophagolysosomes (supplemental Fig. 2A); however, no autophagosomes were present in either CHOP-KO or IBTKα-KO HepG2 cells treated with bafilomycin A1 (supplemental Figs. 2, B and C, S3 and S4). Exposure of WT HepG2 cells to palmitate also resulted in the appearance of lipid vacuoles throughout the cytoplasm, but a lack of autophagolysosomes, consistent with the observation that there was aberrant LC3b trafficking to the lysosome"

Our objective was to determine if there were subgroups within a group of scholars with not otherwise specified learning disorders and if they had specific electroencephalographic patterns. Eighty-five subjects (31 female, 8-11 years) who scored low in at least two subscales -reading, writing and arithmetic- of the Infant Neuropsychological Evaluation were included. Electroencephalograms were recorded in 19 leads during rest with eyes closed; absolute power was obtained every 0.39 Hz. Three subgroups were formed according to children's performance: Group 1 (G1, higher scores than Group 2 in reading speed and reading and writing accuracy), Group 2 (G2, better performance than G1 in composition) and Group 3 (G3, lower scores than Groups 1 and 2 in the three subscales). G3 had higher absolute power in frequencies in the delta and theta range at left frontotemporal sites than G1 and G2. G2 had higher absolute power within alpha frequencies than G3 and G1 at the left occipital site. G3 had higher absolute power in frequencies in the beta range than G1 in parietotemporal areas and than G2 in left frontopolar and temporal sites. G1 had higher absolute power within beta frequencies than G2 in the left frontopolar site. G3 had lower gamma absolute power values than the other groups in the left hemisphere, and gamma activity was higher in G1 than in G2 in frontopolar and temporal areas. This group of children with learning disorders is very heterogeneous. Three subgroups were found with different cognitive profiles, as well as a different electroencephalographic pattern. It is important to consider these differences when planning interventions for children with learning disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2735106789,"With any refractive correction, including Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE), there may be a residual refractive error that requires a retreatment. Here, we investigated the tissue responses following various retreatment procedures in a rabbit model of SMILE. All rabbits underwent a -6.00D correction with SMILE. Two weeks later, they underwent -1.00D enhancement by: (i) VisuMax Circle, followed by excimer ablation (S+C); (ii) secondary SMILE anterior to the primary procedure (S+SE); or (iii) surface ablation (S+P), and were examined for 28 days. S+P induced corneal edema and haze, and more CD11b- (23±6 cells) and TUNEL-positive (36±4 cells) cells in the central stromal superficial layers early post-operatively (p<0.001 compared to other procedures). The corneas appeared normal on day 28 after S+P, but had a lower number of keratocytes near the laser ablated plane compared to other procedures. S+SE and S+C did not induce corneal haze and resulted similar level of fibronectin. However, S+C resulted in more inflammatory (10±2 cells; p = 0.001) and apoptotic cells (25±2 cells; p<0.001) compared to S+SE (7±1 inflammatory cells and 21±3 apoptotic cells) early post-operatively. In conclusion, each SMILE retreatment method resulted in unique tissue responses. S+SE offers advantages, such as minimal inflammation and cell death, as well as maintaining a ‘flap-less’ surgery, over other procedures. However, depending on the degree of enhancement, the lenticule may become too thin to be extracted and the procedure becomes more difficult to perform than S+C and S+P. S+P can maintain corneal integrity by avoiding flap creation and is technically more simple to perform than the others, but the surgery needs to be supplemented with mitomycin-C in order to reduce inflammation and modulate better wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2735021789,"Impact of changes in land cover and land use on hydrological service of tropical watersheds is one of the focal research tropics in both hydrology and Land Cover Land Use Changes (LCLUC). Land fragmentation is an important feature of LCLUC, however, its impact on hydrological service of tropical watershed is unclear despite a few theoretical frameworks. In this paper, we described a simulation study of eight tropical watersheds in Puerto Rico using the Soil Water Assessment Tool. Annual average stream discharge was derived according to the simulations with the land cover maps in 1977, 1991, and 2000. Annual big stream discharge with risks of flooding and severe soil erosion was computed as the sum of daily discharge greater than 95th percentile. The impacts of changes in land cover and fragmentation represented by perimeter-to-area ratio of land patches on annual average and big discharges were further analyzed by means of the linear mixed-effects model. Most mountainous watersheds were characterized by reforestation in 1977–1991 but slight deforestation in 1991–2000. Forest perimeter-to-area ratio was significantly correlated with covers of forest (correlation coefficient of -0.97), pasture (0.94), and urban (0.95). Thus forest fragmentation was reduced by reforestation but increased by deforestation. The annual average and big discharges were significantly reduced by forest cover and forest perimeter-to-area ratio. The enhanced edge effect by forest fragmentation may have incurred more effective interception of the subsurface flow by forest root system, and promoted forest transpiration, thus reduced stream flows. Land cover change plays more important roles in regulating the big discharges than altering the annual average discharges. Due to the negative correlation between forest cover and fragmentation, the decreased forest fragmentation accompanied with reforestation offsets the impact of reforestation on lessening freshwater supply and flooding risk."
https://openalex.org/W2735498250,"Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a quality improvement intervention aimed at reducing maternal and fetal mortality in Accra, Ghana. Design Quasi-experimental, time-sequence intervention, retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods Data were collected on the cost and outcomes of a 5-year Kybele-Ghana Health Service Quality Improvement (QI) intervention conducted at Ridge Regional Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Accra, Ghana, focused on systems, personnel, and communication. Maternal deaths prevented were estimated comparing observed rates with counterfactual projections of maternal mortality and case-fatality rates for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and obstetric hemorrhage. Stillbirths prevented were estimated based on counterfactual estimates of stillbirth rates. Cost-effectiveness was then calculated using estimated disability-adjusted life years averted and subjected to Monte Carlo and one-way sensitivity analyses to test the importance of assumptions inherent in the calculations. Main outcome measure Incremental Cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represents the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted by the intervention compared to a model counterfactual. Results From 2007–2011, 39,234 deliveries were affected by the QI intervention implemented at Ridge Regional Hospital. The total budget for the program was $2,363,100. Based on program estimates, 236 (±5) maternal deaths and 129 (±13) intrapartum stillbirths were averted (14,876 DALYs), implying an ICER of $158 ($129-$195) USD. This value is well below the highly cost-effective threshold of $1268 USD. Sensitivity analysis considered DALY calculation methods, and yearly prevalence of risk factors and case fatality rates. In each of these analyses, the program remained highly cost-effective with an ICER ranging from $97-$218 Conclusion QI interventions to reduce maternal and fetal mortality in low resource settings can be highly cost effective. Cost-effectiveness analysis is feasible and should regularly be conducted to encourage fiscal responsibility in the pursuit of improved maternal and child health."
https://openalex.org/W2735025542,"The postsynaptic adhesion proteins Neuroligins (NLs) are essential for proper synapse function, and their alterations are associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is increasingly clear that each NL isoform occupies specific subsets of synapses and is able to regulate the function of discrete networks. Studies of NL2 and NL4 in the retina in particular have contributed towards uncovering their role in inhibitory synapse function. In this study we show that NL3 is also predominantly expressed at inhibitory postsynapses in the retinal inner plexiform layer (IPL), where it colocalizes with both GABAA- and glycinergic receptor clusters in a 3:2 ratio. In the NL3 deletion-mutant (knockout or KO) mouse, we uncovered a dramatic reduction of the number of GABAAα2-subunit containing GABAA receptor clusters at the IPL. Retinal activity was thereafter assessed in KO and wild-type (WT) littermates by multi-electrode-array recordings of the output cells of retina, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs in the NL3 KO showed reduced spontaneous activity and an altered response to white noise stimulation. Moreover, upon application of light flashes, the proportion of cells firing at light offset (OFF RGCs) was significantly lower in the NL3 KO compared to WT littermates, whereas the relative number of cells firing at light onset (ON RGCs) increased. Interestingly, although GABAAα2-bearing receptors have been related to direction-selective circuits of the retina, features of direction selective-retinal ganglion cells recorded remained unperturbed in the NL3 KO. Together our data underscore the importance of NL3 for the integrity of specific GABAAergic retinal circuits and identifies NL3 as an important regulator of retinal activity."

All subjects had unexplained recurrent miscarriages in more than two previous IVF cycles. The progesterone level at the β-hCG check day (i.e. 14 days after oocyte retrieval) was assessed. The area under the curve (AUC) of the progesterone level was evaluated to predict the ongoing pregnancy or miscarriage outcomes.The overall ongoing pregnancy rate was 60.8% (90/148). The cut-off value with β-hCG levels higher than 126.5 mIU/mL and with progesterone levels higher than 25.2 ng/mL could be the predictive factors for ongoing pregnancy maintenance (AUC = 0.788 and 0.826; sensitivity = 0.788 and 0.723; specificity = 0.689 and 0.833; P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The miscarriage rates were 19.5% (15/77) in the women with β-hCG > 126.5 mIU/mL and 13.0% (10/77) in those with > 25.2 ng/mL. In the comparison of the ROC curves between both values, a similar significance was found. The subjects with β-hCG > 126.5 mIU/mL and progesterone > 25.2 ng/mL showed higher ongoing pregnancy rates [98.0% (49/50) vs. 41.8% (41/98)] than those with β-hCG ≤ 126.5 mIU/mL or progesterone ≤ 25.2 ng/mL.The progesterone level at 14 days after oocyte retrieval can be a good predictive marker for ongoing pregnancy maintenance in women with repeated IVF failure with miscarriage, together with the β-hCG level. The combined cut-off value of progesterone > 25.2 ng/mL and β-hCG > 126.5 mIU/mL may suggest a good prognosis."

With the potential to dramatically expand known protein sequence space, give insights into unprecedented biological processes, and provide means to wipe out antibiotic-resistant superbugs, bacteriophages may be tiny, but they are mighty.Image from iStock/Chima_Borealis.View Large Image | View Hi-Res Image | Download PowerPoint SlideBacteriophages, the ubiquitous and extremely diverse viruses that infect bacteria, are estimated to outnumber their bacterial hosts by a factor of ten. Anywhere bacteria thrive—from deep-ocean hydrothermal vents, to Arctic permafrost, to our own intestines—phages are abundant. With 1023 phage infections happening every second on Earth, it is clear that the extreme evolutionary pressures imposed by phages have shaped bacterial evolution. By transferring genetic material between bacteria, phages profoundly influence the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence traits.Decades ago, phages helped scientists make many of the seminal discoveries in molecular biology and genetics. From the revelation that DNA is the hereditary material of cellular life, to the existence of a triplet code in translation, to foundational principles in DNA replication and recombination, phages were an integral part of the molecular biologist’s toolkit. Although they are often underappreciated, we can largely thank phages for the field of molecular biology itself.The phage legacy carries on even today, a century after their discovery. Notably, the study of interactions between bacteria used in the dairy industry and the phages that infect them led to the first evidence of the true function of CRISPR-Cas systems (Barrangou et al., 2007xBarrangou, R., Fremaux, C., Deveau, H., Richards, M., Boyaval, P., Moineau, S., Romero, D.A., and Horvath, P. Science. 2007; 315: 1709–1712Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (1663)See all ReferencesBarrangou et al., 2007). Through ten years of intense research, these fascinating bacterial defense systems have been developed for genome engineering applications in countless eukaryotic organisms—even human embryos—and their potential impact on biomedical research, agriculture, and therapeutics is astounding.But phages aren’t just tools we can use to study fundamental biological processes. Apart from being the most abundant biological entities on the planet, phages are also the most diverse. Although many of us may conjure images of phage lambda or T7 from undergraduate textbooks, these well-studied examples are nowhere close to being representative. With more genome sequences becoming available at an unprecedented pace, scientists have a wealth of genetic “dark matter” to explore. Phages remain one of the largest untapped resources of completely novel genetic material, which is sure to contain many surprises.By exploring this incredible diversity, we are still learning unexpected things about what makes phages such effective bacterial killing machines. Early in 2017, a study in Nature reported the first evidence that phages communicate with each other. By producing and sensing small peptides as chemical messengers, phages make decisions about whether to proceed with the lytic or lysogenic infection cycle based on the abundance of phages present, in a mechanism analogous to bacterial quorum sensing. Although many different phages have this system, the sequence-specific production and recognition of the communication peptide ensures that each type of phage speaks and understands its own “language.” By controlling the dimerization of a phage-encoded transcriptional regulator, the peptide concentration can elicit different transcriptional responses, tuning the infection dynamics depending on the phage population density (Erez et al., 2017xErez, Z., Steinberger-Levy, I., Shamir, M., Doron, S., Stokar-Avihail, A., Peleg, Y., Melamed, S., Leavitt, A., Savidor, A., Albeck, S. et al. Nature. 2017; 541: 488–493Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (26)See all ReferencesErez et al., 2017).A study published in Science demonstrated that some phages assemble a specialized compartment within their host’s cytoplasm to facilitate spatial and temporal control over the phage replication cycle. This nucleus-like structure, composed of a phage-encoded protein shell, sequesters the phage genome and machinery involved in DNA replication and transcription. Remarkably, the authors observed phage capsids (heads) docking on the surface of the compartment to be packaged with phage DNA, then retreating back to the cytoplasm to assemble with tails into mature phage particles (Chaikeeratisak et al., 2017xChaikeeratisak, V., Nguyen, K., Khanna, K., Brilot, A.F., Erb, M.L., Coker, J.K.C., Vavilina, A., Newton, G.L., Buschauer, R., Pogliano, K. et al. Science. 2017; 355: 194–197Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (10)See all ReferencesChaikeeratisak et al., 2017). It remains to be determined how common this process is, how different components are trafficked in and out of the compartment, and whether it may play a role in protecting phages from bacterial defenses like CRISPR during the infection process.Apart from investigating these intriguing, natural biological processes, research into phage infection mechanisms has laid the groundwork for novel therapeutics. For many years, phage-based therapies for bacterial infections only gained traction in former Soviet nations, where a lack of western antibiotics necessitated the use of alternative treatments. No phage-based therapies have yet been approved in the United States for infectious disease treatment, but with the rise of antibiotic-resistant infections, many scientists are turning their attention back to nature to harness the incredible power of phages to kill bacteria. Just this spring, news articles emerged about a patient in San Diego, California, with a severe systemic bacterial infection that was resistant to all antibiotics. Doctors had run out of options to fight the infection, and as a last resort, the patient was treated intravenously with an experimental cocktail of phages. Remarkably, the patient awoke from his septic-shock-induced coma within three days of treatment and was later released from hospital with no apparent adverse effects of the phage injections (University of California, San Diego, 2017xSee all ReferencesUniversity of California, San Diego, 2017). Despite being only a single patient, this success will undoubtedly fuel future efforts into phage therapy.Phages really have it all: an impressive track record in molecular biology, a wealth of completely novel and unexpected biology, and a new renaissance of therapeutic potential. It has never been clearer that groundbreaking phage research is sure to carry on for the next hundred years and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2735121932,"Background As Medicare expands the use of computed tomography (CT) for diagnosing lung cancer, there is increased opportunity to diagnose lung cancer in asymptomatic patients. This descriptive study characterizes the disease-specific diagnostic and treatment services that patients with a positive diagnosis following CT received, stratified by presentation at CT. Methods Patients who were diagnosed with lung cancer following CT in 2013, had no history of lung cancer, survived at least 1 year, were aged 55–80 years, and had Medicare Advantage insurance were included. Patients were grouped based upon presentation at CT: morbidities unrelated to lung cancer, classic lung cancer symptoms, and cancer syndromes. Patients with none of these factors were categorized into a no diagnoses/symptoms group. The type and intensity of services used in the year following the CT was reported for each group. Results 1,261 patients were included. Early treatment services were most common in the group with morbidities unrelated to lung cancer (13.7%) and least common in the cancer syndromes group (6.6%). Advanced treatment services were used by 47.3% of the cancer syndromes group versus 23.5% of the no diagnoses/symptoms group. Conclusions The intensity of disease-specific diagnostic and treatment services varied by presentation at CT. Patients with no symptoms or morbidities at the time of CT less frequently received advanced interventions. Learning about the utilization patterns of others with a similar presentation at CT may help patients with positive lung cancer diagnoses engage in shared decision making and in norming their experiences against those of other similarly-situated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2735035037,"Current research refers to videogames as a constant variable. However, games today are designed to be highly interactive and versatile: two players may be using the same videogame, but as a result of different using patterns, the game will not necessarily encompass the same content and gameplay. The current study examined the possible relationship between psychopathology and in-game playing patterns. We hypothesized that adolescents would play videogames differently, in a manner that would reflect their particular psychopathologies. We examined 47 male adolescents from three diagnostic groups: those suffering from externalizing psychopathologies, internalizing psychopathologies and controls. We performed a high-resolution examination of their gameplay, using in-game quantitative statistics mechanisms of two fundamentally different games, a structured racing game and an unstructured adventure game. While there was no difference in the groups' using patterns of the structured game, there was a high variability between the groups' using patterns when they were using a non-structured game. These findings suggest that virtual behavior in unstructured games is reflective of adolescent-players psychopathology, and might shed light on an unexplored facet of videogames research. Possible implications are discussed."
