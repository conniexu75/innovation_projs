https://openalex.org/W1583595895,"It was suggested more than thirty years ago that Watson-Crick base pairing might be used for the rational design of nanometre-scale structures from nucleic acids. Since then, and especially since the introduction of the origami technique, DNA nanotechnology has enabled increasingly more complex structures. But although general approaches for creating DNA origami polygonal meshes and design software are available, there are still important constraints arising from DNA geometry and sense/antisense pairing, necessitating some manual adjustment during the design process. Here we present a general method of folding arbitrary polygonal digital meshes in DNA that readily produces structures that would be very difficult to realize using previous approaches. The design process is highly automated, using a routeing algorithm based on graph theory and a relaxation simulation that traces scaffold strands through the target structures. Moreover, unlike conventional origami designs built from close-packed helices, our structures have a more open conformation with one helix per edge and are therefore stable under the ionic conditions usually used in biological assays."

https://openalex.org/W957926533,"The carbon-nitrogen double bonds in imines are fundamentally important functional groups in organic chemistry. This is largely due to the fact that imines act as electrophiles towards carbon nucleophiles in reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds, thereby serving as one of the most widely used precursors for the formation of amines in both synthetic and biosynthetic settings. If the carbon atom of the imine could be rendered electron-rich, the imine could react as a nucleophile instead of as an electrophile. Such a reversal in the electronic characteristics of the imine functionality would facilitate the development of new chemical transformations that convert imines into amines via carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions with carbon electrophiles, thereby creating new opportunities for the efficient synthesis of amines. The development of asymmetric umpolung reactions of imines (in which the imines act as nucleophiles) remains uncharted territory, in spite of the far-reaching impact such reactions would have in organic synthesis. Here we report the discovery and development of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts that promote the highly efficient asymmetric umpolung reactions of imines with the carbon electrophile enals. These catalysts mediate the deprotonation of imines and direct the 2-azaallyl anions thus formed to react with enals in a highly chemoselective, regioselective, diastereoselective and enantioselective fashion. The reaction tolerates a broad range of imines and enals, and can be carried out in high yield with as little as 0.01 mole per cent catalyst with a moisture- and air-tolerant operational protocol. These umpolung reactions provide a conceptually new and practical approach to chiral amino compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1940766865,"Access to health care for asylum-seekers and refugees (AS&R) in Germany is initially restricted before regular access is granted, allegedly leading to delayed care and increasing costs of care. We analyse the effects of (a) restricted access; and (b) two major policy reforms (1997, 2007) on incident health expenditures for AS&R in 1994-2013.We used annual, nation-wide, aggregate data of the German Federal Statistics Office (1994-2013) to compare incident health expenditures among AS&R with restricted access (exposed) to AS&R with regular access (unexposed). We calculated incidence rate differences (∆IRt) and rate ratios (IRRt), as well as attributable fractions among the exposed (AFe) and the total population (AFp). The effects of between-group differences in need, and of policy reforms, on differences in per capita expenditures were assessed in (segmented) linear regression models. The exposed and unexposed groups comprised 4.16 and 1.53 million person-years. Per capita expenditures (1994-2013) were higher in the group with restricted access in absolute (∆IRt = 375.80 Euros [375.77; 375.89]) and relative terms (IRR = 1.39). The AFe was 28.07% and the AFp 22.21%. Between-group differences in mean age and in the type of accommodation were the main independent predictors of between-group expenditure differences. Need variables explained 50-75% of the variation in between-group differences over time. The 1997 policy reform significantly increased ∆IRt adjusted for secular trends and between-group differences in age (by 600.0 Euros [212.6; 986.2]) and sex (by 867.0 Euros [390.9; 1342.5]). The 2007 policy reform had no such effect.The cost of excluding AS&R from health care appears ultimately higher than granting regular access to care. Excess expenditures attributable to the restriction were substantial and could not be completely explained by differences in need. An evidence-informed discourse on access to health care for AS&R in Germany is needed; it urgently requires high-quality, individual-level data."
https://openalex.org/W2140513367,"Understanding the origin and diversification of organisms requires a good phylogenetic estimate of their age and diversification rates. This estimate can be difficult to obtain when samples are limited and fossil records are disputed, as in Dictyoptera. To choose among competing hypotheses of origin for dictyopteran suborders, we root a phylogenetic analysis (~800 taxa, 10 kbp) within a large selection of outgroups and calibrate datings with fossils attributed to lineages with clear synapomorphies. We find the following topology: (mantises, (other cockroaches, (Cryptocercidae, termites)). Our datings suggest that crown-Dictyoptera-and stem-mantises-would date back to the Late Carboniferous (~ 300 Mya), a result compatible with the oldest putative fossil of stem-dictyoptera. Crown-mantises, however, would be much more recent (~ 200 Mya; Triassic/Jurassic boundary). This pattern (i.e., old origin and more recent diversification) suggests a scenario of replacement in carnivory among polyneopterous insects. The most recent common ancestor of (cockroaches + termites) would date back to the Permian (~275 Mya), which contradicts the hypothesis of a Devonian origin of cockroaches. Stem-termites would date back to the Triassic/Jurassic boundary, which refutes a Triassic origin. We suggest directions in extant and extinct species sampling to sharpen this chronological framework and dictyopteran evolutionary studies."
https://openalex.org/W1533055121,"The ecosystem services framework has enabled the broader public to acknowledge the benefits nature provides to different stakeholders. However, not all stakeholders benefit equally from these services. Rather, power relationships are a key factor influencing the access of individuals or groups to ecosystem services. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the “cascade” framework for ecosystem services to integrate the analysis of ecological interactions among ecosystem services and stakeholders’ interactions, reflecting power relationships that mediate ecosystem services flows. We illustrate its application using the floodplain of the River Piedra (Spain) as a case study. First, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) to model the dependence relationships among ecosystem services. Second, we performed semi-structured interviews to identify formal power relationships among stakeholders. Third, we depicted ecosystem services according to stakeholders’ ability to use, manage or impair ecosystem services in order to expose how power relationships mediate access to ecosystem services. Our results revealed that the strongest power was held by those stakeholders who managed (although did not use) those keystone ecosystem properties and services that determine the provision of other services (i.e., intermediate regulating and final services). In contrast, non-empowered stakeholders were only able to access the remaining non-excludable and non-rival ecosystem services (i.e., some of the cultural services, freshwater supply, water quality, and biological control). In addition, land stewardship, access rights, and governance appeared as critical factors determining the status of ecosystem services. Finally, we stress the need to analyse the role of stakeholders and their relationships to foster equal access to ecosystem services."

Hyperaldosteronism leads todeleterious effects on the kidney, blood vessels, and heart. Although steroidal antagonists such as spironolactone and eplerenone are clinically useful for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, they are associated with several side effects. Finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal MR antagonist, is presently being evaluated in two clinical phase IIb trials. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of action of finerenone and spironolactone at several key steps of the MR signaling pathway. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis approaches allowed identification of Ser-810 and Ala-773 as key residues for the high MR selectivity of finerenone. Moreover, we showed that, in contrast to spironolactone, which activates the S810L mutant MR responsible for a severe form of early onset hypertension, finerenone displays strict antagonistic properties. Aldosterone-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of MR are inhibited by both finerenone and spironolactone. However, automated quantification of MR subcellular distribution demonstrated that finerenone delays aldosterone-induced nuclear accumulation of MR more efficiently than spironolactone. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that, as opposed to spironolactone, finerenone inhibits MR, steroid receptor coactivator-1, and RNA polymerase II binding at the regulatory sequence of the SCNN1A gene and also remarkably reduces basal MR and steroid receptor coactivator-1 recruitment, unraveling a specific and unrecognized inactivating mechanism on MR signaling. Overall, our data demonstrate that the highly potent and selective MR antagonist finerenone specifically impairs several critical steps of the MR signaling pathway and therefore represents a promising new generation MR antagonist.

MR, a ligand-induced transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor family, plays a critical physiological role in water-electrolyte homeostasis and regulation of blood pressure. However, the past two decades have brought compelling evidence that pathophysiological overactivation of MR signaling may also induce disorders like heart failure and chronic kidney disease (3Tomaschitz A.

PAPY Study Participants Renal damage in primary aldosteronism: results of the PAPY Study.Hypertension. 2006; 48: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). All of these new insights have spurred intense investigative interest in the use of MR antagonists as a new therapeutic strategy in controlling blood pressure, chronic renal disease progression, and cardiovascular remodeling and morbidity (5Epstein M. Aldosterone blockade: an emerging strategy for abrogating progressive renal disease.Am. J. Med. 2006; 119: 912-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Spironolactone is known as the first generation of potent MR antagonists (6Corvol P. Claire M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Michaud A. Roth-Meyer C. Menard J. Spirolactones: clinical and pharmacologic studies.Adv. Nephrol. Necker Hosp. 1977; 7: 199-215PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown to enhance survival in patients with heart failure and to prevent the development of cardiac fibrosis (7Pitt B. Zannad F. Remme W.J. Cody R. Castaigne A. Perez A. Palensky J. Wittes J. The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (7553) Google Scholar). Although highly efficient, this molecule lacks selectivity because it is able to antagonize androgen receptor (8Corvol P. Michaud A. Menard J. Freifeld M. Mahoudeau J. Antiandrogenic effect of spirolactones: mechanism of action.Endocrinology. 1975; 97: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and to act as a progesterone receptor agonist (9Schane H.P. Potts G.O. Oral progestational activity of spironolactone.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1978; 47: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consequently, prolonged use of spironolactone is associated with gynecological side effects such as gynecomastia and menstrual irregularities (10Brass E.P. Effects of antihypertensive drugs on endocrine function.Drugs. 1984; 27: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More importantly, another known side effect of spironolactone administration is the induction of potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in patients with diminished kidney function (11Juurlink D.N. Mamdani M.M. Lee D.S. Kopp A. Austin P.C. Laupacis A. Redelmeier D.A. Rates of hyperkalemia after publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Therefore, considerable efforts were made to develop a next generation of nonsteroidal antagonists that would overcome the inherent limitation of steroidal antagonists by combining the high potency of spironolactone with better selectivity and less adverse secondary effects (12Kolkhof P. Borden S.A. Molecular pharmacology of the mineralocorticoid receptor: prospects for novel therapeutics.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2012; 350: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel nonsteroidal MR antagonist, finerenone, has been developed that combines potency and high selectivity and demonstrated a more efficient protection from cardiorenal injuries in comparison with steroidal antagonists at equinatriuretic doses in preclinical models (13Bärfacker L. Kuhl A. Hillisch A. Grosser R. Figueroa-Pérez S. Heckroth H. Nitsche A. Ergüden J.-K. Gielen-Haertwig H. Schlemmer K.-H. Mittendorf J. Paulsen H. Platzek J. Kolkhof P.

Pharmacol. 2014; 64: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These remarkable properties, together with the nonsteroidal nature of finerenone, raise the question of the mechanisms by which this molecule interferes with aldosterone in the MR signaling. mineralocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain steroid receptor coactivator-1 nuclear average intensity cytoplasmic average intensity polymerase. Aldosterone binding to MR, a ligand-induced transcription factor, promotes a receptor conformational change that allows dissociation from chaperone heterocomplexes and a critical hyperphosphorylation that are associated with a rapid translocation into the nuclear compartment. Once in the nucleus, MR binds as a dimer to hormone response elements and recruits transcriptional coregulators, allowing the transcription or repression of its target genes (15Pascual-Le Tallec L. Lombès M. The mineralocorticoid receptor: a journey exploring its diversity and specificity of action.Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2211-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Modulation of MR activity upon antagonist binding may thus occur at different steps of the receptor signaling pathway such as at nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (16Lombès M. Binart N. Delahaye F.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of action of finerenone by using structural, biochemical, and cellular approaches and highlighted that finerenone impairs MR signaling at the levels of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, post-translational modification, turnover, and coregulator recruitment. Finerenone was synthesized as previously described (13Bärfacker L. Kuhl A. Hillisch A. Grosser R. Figueroa-Pérez S. Heckroth H. Nitsche A. Ergüden J.-K. Gielen-Haertwig H. Schlemmer K.-H.

A mixture of 3.83 mg (10.1 μmol) finerenone and 9.39 mg of (1,5-cyclooctadien)-(pyridine)-(tricyclohexylphosphine)-iridium(I)-hexafluorophosphate dissolved in 1.0 ml of dichloromethane was stirred with tritium gas at a partial pressure of ∼80.6 kPa (806 mbar) for 60 min in a reaction vessel that was connected to a tritium labeling apparatus. After freezing of the reaction mixture with liquid nitrogen, the nonreacted tritium and the solvent were adsorbed in a trap filled with platinum oxide and charcoal at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. To remove the labile tritium, the dry residue was dissolved in 1.0 ml of acetonitrile and 0.5 ml of ethanol, and the solvent was evaporated in the vacuum. This process of removing labile tritium was repeated four times. The labeling position is in the methylene group of the ethoxy moiety, which was determined by [3H]NMR spectroscopy. No other signals were detected. The labeling degree was determined by LC MS, and the specific activity was calculated as 312 MBq/mg (3.2 Ci/mmol) for [3H]finerenone.

HEK 293T cells (12,000 cells/well) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized for 30 min with a 0.5% solution of PBS-Triton X-100. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS-Tween buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk (PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) before incubation with primary antibody. Cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody overnight at 4 °C (Millipore SAS, Guyancourt, France), followed by an Alexa Fluor 555 anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature (Life Technologies). After antibody labeling, cells were postfixed 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclear counterstaining was performed with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI. HK-GFP-MR cells were seeded (6000 cells/well) on a 24-well tissue culture plate in DMEM containing 2.5% dextran charcoal-stripped FBS. Forty-eight hours later, a subsequent hormone withdrawal was achieved by rinsing the cells three times with DMEM containing 2.5% dextran charcoal-stripped FBS prior to further incubation of the cells for 48 h within this medium. Ligand treatment was then performed at the indicated concentrations with ligands alone (aldosterone, finerenone, or spironolactone) or with aldosterone plus a 100-fold excess of finerenone or spironolactone. Control vehicle condition was run in parallel with DMEM containing 0.01% DMSO and 0.1% ethanol. Sequential images were acquired (20×/0.4 NA), analyzed and quantified by the ArrayScan VTI imaging platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DAPI and GFP-hMR fluorescence were captured using sequential acquisition to give separate image files for each. The Molecular Translocation V4 Bioapplication algorithm (vHCS Scan, version 6.3.1, Build 6586) was used to quantify the relative distribution of GFP-hMR. Briefly, the DAPI staining identifying the nuclear region was used for focusing during acquisition and to define a binary nuclear mask. This mask (CIRC mask) was used to quantify the amount of target channel fluorescence within the nucleus (CircAvgIntensity or nuclear average intensity, NI). The nuclear mask was then dilated to cover the maximum cytoplasmic region as possible without exceeding cell boundaries (RINGWidth = 5 pixels). Subtraction of the nuclear mask from this dilated mask creates a binary cytoplasmic mask covering the cytoplasmic region. An automatic cut-off threshold was applied to exclude pixels of the outside cell boundary background signal (fixed threshold = 55). The cytoplasmic mask (RING mask) was used to quantify the amount of target channel fluorescence within the cytoplasm (RingAvgIntensity or cytoplasmic average intensity, CI). The translocation index measurement (CircAvgInten/RingAvgIntensity or NI/CI) represents the average value ratio of the nuclear intensity to the cytoplasmic intensity calculated for each selected cell per well (n = 3,000–12,000 cells) (28Williams R.G.

Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with either 10−7 m aldosterone, 10−6 m finerenone or spironolactone, vehicle, or a combination of 10−7 m aldosterone plus 10−6 m spironolactone or finerenone, all in DMEM supplemented by 2.5% dextran charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were then fixed for 10 min at room temperature by adding 1% paraformaldehyde to the medium. After 8 min of neutralization of the medium by adding 0.125 m glycine, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysis and chromatin shearing were carried out using the #HighCellChIP kit buffers (Diagenode, Seraing, Belgium), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with the following modifications. Chromatin shearing was performed in 500 μl of shearing buffer S1 + protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), applying 2 runs of 10 cycles at high intensity (Bioruptor®; Diagenode). Each cycle was composed of 30 s with effective application of ultrasounds (ON) and 30 s without (OFF). Between each run, heated water had to be removed and replaced by ice-cold water and ice. The total quantity of sheared chromatin protein was measured, using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Interchim, Montluçon, France) and the spectrophotometer Victor3® (Perkin Elmer). Protein A-coated magnetic beads (25 μl of the stock suspension) were washed three times in buffer C1 and resuspended in C1 buffer (100 μl of final volume). Sheared chromatin (1.3 mg of proteins) and 7 μg of one of the tested antibodies were then added to the beads, and the final volume was adjusted to 500 μl with C1 buffer supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor mixture and 0.1% BSA (final concentrations). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C using a rotary incubator. Magnetic beads were then isolated and washed three times with C1 buffer and once with W1 buffer. DNA fragments from the immunoprecipitated chromatin were eluted with the DNA isolating buffer supplemented with 1% Proteinase K, for 15 min at 55 °C and finally for 15 min at 100 °C and quantified by real time quantitative PCR. ChIP-resulting DNA samples were amplified by real time quantitative PCR, using the QuantStudio 6Flex System (Life Technologies) and 96-well plates. In each well were mixed 5 μl of a DNA sample, 6 μl of Fast SYBR Green master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Saint-Aubin, France), and 0.5 μl of forward (5′-TTCCTGCAACTCTGTGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCCCTAGGACATTCTGTT-3′) primers (300 nm final concentration) (SCNN1A promoter). After a 10-min preincubation at 95 °C, 40 cycles were performed. Each cycle was composed of 15-s denaturation phase at 95 °C, followed by 1-min hybridization and amplification phase at 60 °C. Each DNA sample was analyzed in triplicate. The results are expressed as percentages of input and are the mean ± S.E. of three independent measurements. KC3AC1 cells were cultured for 48 h in minimal medium that has the same composition than the epithelial medium but that lacks dexamethasone, EGF and dextran charcoal-treated serum. Cells were then treated for 4 h with vehicle, 10−8 m aldosterone, or 10−6 m finerenone alone or in combination with 10−8 m aldosterone. After twice washing of cells with ice-cold PBS, total RNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform method, using the TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France) following the manufacturer's recommendations, then recovered in 20 μl of water, and quantified with Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Villebon, France). Total RNA (1 μg) was first digested for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μl of DNase I (Biolabs, Evry, France) in a total volume of 10 μl to remove potential genomic DNA and then incubated for 10 min at 75 °C with 1 μl of 25 mm EDTA (Life Technologies). For each sample, 9 μl of the reverse transcription mix was incubated in the presence of Superscript reverse transcriptase (1 μl), random primers (2 μl), 10 mm dNTP (0.8 μl), 10× reverse transcriptase buffer (2 μl) and water (3.2 μl). After 10 min of annealing at 25 °C, the reverse transcription was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by rapid denaturation of the enzyme at 85 °C. The real time quantitative PCR was performed on the complementary DNA (cDNA), as described above. Specific primer sequences are 5′-CTGCACCTTTGGCATGATGTA and 5′-TTCCGGGTACCTGTAGGGATT. A 1:10 dilution standard range was run in parallel to quantify cDNA (attomol amount = f(Ct value)). All samples were quantified in duplicate. Relative expression in a given sample was normalized to the internal reference 18S rRNA values where the control condition value was arbitrarily set at 1. The results are expressed as means ± S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1581754100,"Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplant is a widely used treatment for life-threatening conditions such as leukaemia; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating HSPC engraftment of the recipient niche remain incompletely understood. Here we develop a competitive HSPC transplant method in adult zebrafish, using in vivo imaging as a non-invasive readout. We use this system to conduct a chemical screen, and identify epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) as a family of lipids that enhance HSPC engraftment. The pro-haematopoietic effects of EETs were conserved in the developing zebrafish embryo, where 11,12-EET promoted HSPC specification by activating a unique activator protein 1 (AP-1) and runx1 transcription program autonomous to the haemogenic endothelium. This effect required the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway, specifically PI(3)Kγ. In adult HSPCs, 11,12-EET induced transcriptional programs, including AP-1 activation, which modulate several cellular processes, such as migration, to promote engraftment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the EET effects on enhancing HSPC homing and engraftment are conserved in mammals. Our study establishes a new method to explore the molecular mechanisms of HSPC engraftment, and discovers a previously unrecognized, evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating multiple haematopoietic generation and regeneration processes. EETs may have clinical application in marrow or cord blood transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W1544092968,"Brain arginine vasopressin (AVP) critically regulates normative social behavior in mammals, and experimental disruption of the AVP signaling pathway produces social impairments in rodent models. We therefore hypothesized that AVP signaling deficits may contribute to social impairments in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since blood measures (which are far easier to obtain than brain measures) of AVP are most meaningful if they are related to brain AVP activity, Study 1 tested the relationship between AVP concentrations in concomitantly collected blood and CSF samples from children and adults (N = 28) undergoing clinical procedures. Study 2 tested whether blood AVP concentrations: 1) differed between children with ASD (N = 57), their ASD discordant siblings (N = 47), and neurotypical controls (N = 55); and 2) predicted social functioning (using the NEPSY-II Theory of Mind and Affect Recognition tasks and the Social Responsiveness Scale) in this large, well-characterized child cohort. Blood AVP concentrations significantly and positively predicted CSF AVP concentrations (F1,26 = 7.17, r = 0.46, p = 0.0127) in Study 1. In Study 2, blood AVP concentrations did not differ between groups or by sex, but significantly and positively predicted Theory of Mind performance, specifically in children with ASD, but not in non-ASD children (F1,144 = 5.83, p = 0.017). Blood AVP concentrations can be used: 1) as a surrogate for brain AVP activity in humans; and 2) as a robust biomarker of theory of mind ability in children with ASD. These findings also suggest that AVP biology may be a promising therapeutic target by which to improve social cognition in individuals with ASD."

A total of 93 Malaysian multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae isolated from patients attending to University of Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 2010-2012 were investigated for antibiotic resistance determinants including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), aminoglycoside and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance genes and plasmid replicons. CTX-M-15 (91.3%) was the predominant ESBL gene detected in this study. aacC2 gene (67.7%) was the most common gene detected in aminoglycoside-resistant isolates. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance (90.3%) was attributed to the presence of sul1 (53.8%) and dfrA (59.1%) genes in the isolates. Multiple plasmid replicons (1-4) were detected in 95.7% of the isolates. FIIK was the dominant replicon detected together with 13 other types of plasmid replicons. Conjugative plasmids (1-3 plasmids of ~3-100 kb) were obtained from 27 of 43 K. pneumoniae isolates. An ESBL gene (either CTX-M-15, CTX-M-3 or SHV-12) was detected from each transconjugant. Co-detection with at least one of other antibiotic resistance determinants [sul1, dfrA, aacC2, aac(6ˊ)-Ib, aac(6ˊ)-Ib-cr and qnrB] was noted in most conjugative plasmids. The transconjugants were resistant to multiple antibiotics including β-lactams, gentamicin and cotrimoxazole, but not ciprofloxacin. This is the first study describing the characterization of plasmids circulating in Malaysian multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae isolates. The results of this study suggest the diffusion of highly diverse plasmids with multiple antibiotic resistance determinants among the Malaysian isolates. Effective infection control measures and antibiotic stewardship programs should be adopted to limit the spread of the multidrug resistant bacteria in healthcare settings."

This study attempts to investigate the clinical subtypes and outcome of GBS in southwest China. Patients with GBS admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2006 to March 2013 were included in our study. Patients were classified into acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) group, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) group, Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) group, cranial nerve variants(CNV), Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis overlaps with GBS (BBE-GBS) group and unclassifiable group based on clinical features and electrophysiological findings. Hughes function grade score (HFGS) was used to assess the prognosis at 3 and 6 months. The prognosis of different subtypes and outcome predictors were analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2166637833,"Background 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) represents one of the greatest known genetic risk factors for the development of psychotic illness, and is also associated with high rates of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) in childhood. We performed integrated genomic analyses of 22q11DS to identify genes and pathways related to specific phenotypes. Methods We used a high-resolution aCGH array to precisely characterize deletion breakpoints. Using peripheral blood, we examined differential expression (DE) and networks of co-expressed genes related to phenotypic variation within 22q11DS patients. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling was performed using Illumina Human HT-12 microarrays. Data mining techniques were used to validate our results against independent samples of both peripheral blood and brain tissue from idiopathic psychosis and ASD cases. Results Eighty-five percent of 22q11DS individuals (N = 39) carried the typical 3 Mb deletion, with significant variability in deletion characteristics in the remainder of the sample (N = 7). DE analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified expression changes related to psychotic symptoms in patients, including a module of co-expressed genes which was associated with psychosis in 22q11DS and involved in pathways associated with transcriptional regulation. This module was enriched for brain-expressed genes, was not related to antipsychotic medication use, and significantly overlapped with transcriptional changes in idiopathic schizophrenia. In 22q11DS-ASD, both DE and WGCNA analyses implicated dysregulation of immune response pathways. The ASD-associated module showed significant overlap with genes previously associated with idiopathic ASD. Conclusion These findings further support the use of peripheral tissue in the study of major mutational models of diseases affecting the brain, and point towards specific pathways dysregulated in 22q11DS carriers with psychosis and ASD."

Socio-demographic characteristics and diet habits were collected from 886 school-aged children. Additionally, 516 children from rural sites were followed up in the post-harvest season, in December of the same year. Bivariate and multivariable statistical methods were employed to assess low DDS and ASF intake and their association with different factors.Up to 80% and 60% of school-aged children living in rural and urban sites, respectively, ate ≤ 3 food groups the day before the survey. The percentage of children consuming ASF was significantly higher in urban settings (64% vs 18%). In the rural areas, if the head of the household was male (OR: 1.91; 95%CI: 1.00-3.65) and older than 40 years (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.02-2.38) the child had a lower DDS in the lean season, while differences by socioeconomic indexes were observed in the post-harvest season. Males took more ASF than females in rural settings (OR: 1.73; 95%CI: 1.14-2.62) and differences by socioeconomic indexes were observed in both settings in the lean season, though not in post-harvest survey.The findings of this study revealed that the diet among school-aged children in Libo Kemkem and Fogera districts lacked diversity, and that the intake of foods from animal sources was low, especially among rural girls. To effectively tackle malnutrition, dietary diversification strategies oriented to the local needs are recommended."

To identify and characterize differentially regulated miRNAs in mid-gestation HFL explants during type II pneumocyte differentiation in culture, we performed miRNA microarray of RNA from epithelial cells isolated from mid-gestation HFL explants before and after culture with or without Bt2cAMP. Interestingly, the miR-200 family was significantly up-regulated during type II cell differentiation; miR-200 induction was inversely correlated with expression of known targets, transcription factors ZEB1/2 and TGF-β2. miR-200 antagonists inhibited TTF-1 and surfactant proteins and up-regulated TGF-β2 and ZEB1 expression in type II cells.

This results in inhibition of mRNA translation and/or increased mRNA degradation (23Ruvkun G. The perfect storm of tiny RNAs.Nat.

MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15907) Google Scholar). Approximately 1,000 miRNAs are encoded by the human genome; these regulate ∼30% of expressed genes (25van Rooij E. Liu N. Olson E.N. MicroRNAs flex their muscles.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A single miRNA can downregulate a sizable number of functionally related mRNAs; thus, miRNAs may target gene networks. Little is known of the roles of miRNAs in type II cell differentiation and surfactant production. To identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed during type II cell differentiation and the induction of SP-A expression, we conducted miRNA microarray analysis of RNA from epithelial cells isolated from mid-gestation HFL explants before and after culture with Bt2cAMP. Previously, we observed that upon culture of HFL explants in serum-free medium, type II cells differentiate spontaneously within the prealveolar ducts and develop the capacity to produce surfactant (26Snyder J.M. Johnston J.M. Mendelson C.R. Differentiation of type II cells of human fetal lung in vitro.Cell Tissue Res. 1981; 220: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, cAMP enhances type II cell differentiation and induction of SP-A gene expression (27Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R.

Notably, we observed that several members of the miR-200 family were significantly up-regulated in concert with type II cell differentiation. The miR-200 family consists of five members, which exist in two conserved clusters in the human genome on chromosome 1 (which contains miR-429/200a/200b) and 12 (which contains miR-200c/141) (28Renthal N.E.

In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that miR-200s and ZEB1 serve an important in vivo role in regulating differentiation of the surfactant-producing type II cell in the fetal lung. Importantly, our novel findings suggest that cAMP increases HFL type II cell differentiation and surfactant protein gene expression, in part, by suppression of the ZEB1/2-TGF-β signaling axis. By contrast, TGF-β inhibition of type II cell differentiation and SP-A gene expression is mediated by increased expression of ZEB1, which suppresses TTF-1 binding to the SP-A promoter. We propose that a developmental decline in ZEBs and TGF-β family expression in HFL allows up-regulation of miR-200 family members, which further suppress ZEB1/2 and TGF-β to promote and maintain the type II epithelial cell phenotype through enhanced TTF-1 binding activity. Mid-gestation HFL tissues were obtained from Advanced Biosciences Resources (Alameda, CA). Because we had no access to identifiers for human subjects, our research was classified as “exempt” by the Internal Review Board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Human fetal lung explants and type II pneumocytes were isolated and cultured as described in detail previously (26Snyder J.M. Johnston J.M. Mendelson C.R. Differentiation of type II cells of human fetal lung in vitro.Cell Tissue Res. 1981; 220: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J.F. Margraf L.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal lung tissues were minced and rinsed in serum-free Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Gibco). Lung explants were placed in 35-mm sterile culture dishes on lens paper supported by stainless steel grids. The explants were cultured in serum-free Waymouth's medium containing Bt2cAMP (1 mm; Sigma) for 5 days to enrich the population of differentiated type II cells. Cells were dispersed from the explants by digestion with collagenases type I (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) and type IA (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma). The resulting cell suspension was depleted of fibroblasts by incubation with diethylaminoethyl-dextran (250 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and loaded onto a 90–60% Percoll gradient. The type II cells were collected and plated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes coated with extracellular matrix prepared from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (40Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J.F.

Cells were then washed three times with medium to eliminate dead and nonadherent cells and cultured in Waymouth's medium without FBS. The plating density of the cells after overnight incubation was ∼50–60%. The method used for isolation and culture of undifferentiated epithelial cells (41Benlhabib H. Mendelson C.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells were directly isolated from freshly obtained HFL by collagenase digestion, followed by diethylaminoethyl-dextran treatment and Percoll gradient centrifugation without prior explant culture. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549 (ATCC CCL 185) was maintained in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium containing FBS (10% v/v). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached ∼80% confluence. After isolation, 3 × 106 HFL epithelial or type II cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes and cultured overnight in Waymouth's medium containing 10% FBS. The next day, cells were washed three times in serum-free Waymouth's medium and cultured in serum-free medium with or without Bt2cAMP (1 mm) and with or without recombinant human TGF-β1 (10 or 100 ng/ml; Biolegend, 580706), alone or in combination for up to 72 h. Cells were harvested at different time points for extraction of RNA and protein and for morphological analysis. Epithelial cells were isolated from mid-gestation HFL explants before and after 48 and 96 h of culture in the presence of Bt2cAMP, as described above. RNA was extracted from the isolated epithelial cells using an miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). After passing a quality control test, the RNA was sent to LC Sciences (Houston, TX) for miRNA microarray analysis of the 894 mature human miRNAs known at that time, using quadruple replicates of the “before culture” and the 48- and 96-h incubation time points. Total RNA was isolated from HFL type II cells, isolated epithelial cells, and HFL explants cultured with or without Bt2cAMP by the one-step method (TRIzol, Invitrogen). RNA was treated with deoxyribonuclease to remove any contaminating DNA; 1 μg was reverse-transcribed using random primers and oligo(dT) blend in the iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (170-8891, Bio-Rad). Validated primer sets directed against mRNA for the target genes (Table 1) (28Renthal N.E. Chen C.C. Williams K.C. Gerard R.D. Prange-Kiel J.

Glycine (0.125 m) was added to stop cross-linking. Cells were washed in 1× PBS and lysed with lysis buffer containing 1 mm PMSF and 1× protease inhibitor. The chromatin was sheared by sonication into fragments ranging from 500 bp to 1 kb. The lysate was diluted and subjected to immunoprecipitation with preimmune IgG, as negative control, and with specific antibody against TTF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., SC-13040). The immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, 17-295) and subjected to heating at 65 °C to reverse cross-linking. The isolated DNA was quantified by qPCR using primers that flanked the TTF-1-binding element (Table 1) and the ΔΔCt method. Whole cell, nuclear, and cytoplasmic extracts (Thermo Scientific, 78835) were prepared from HFL epithelial cells, type II cells, and explants before and after culture. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed using antibodies specific for SP-A (27Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R.

https://openalex.org/W944717703,"Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica are the causative agents of whooping cough in humans and a variety of respiratory diseases in animals, respectively. Bordetella species produce an exopolysaccharide, known as the Bordetella polysaccharide (Bps), which is encoded by the bpsABCD operon. Bps is required for Bordetella biofilm formation, colonization of the respiratory tract, and confers protection from complement-mediated killing. In this report, we have investigated the role of BpsB in the biosynthesis of Bps and biofilm formation by B. bronchiseptica. BpsB is a two-domain protein that localizes to the periplasm and outer membrane. BpsB displays metal- and length-dependent deacetylation on poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) oligomers, supporting previous immunogenic data that suggests Bps is a PNAG polymer. BpsB can use a variety of divalent metal cations for deacetylase activity and showed highest activity in the presence of Ni(2+) and Co(2+). The structure of the BpsB deacetylase domain is similar to the PNAG deacetylases PgaB and IcaB and contains the same circularly permuted family four carbohydrate esterase motifs. Unlike PgaB from Escherichia coli, BpsB is not required for polymer export and has unique structural differences that allow the N-terminal deacetylase domain to be active when purified in isolation from the C-terminal domain. Our enzymatic characterizations highlight the importance of conserved active site residues in PNAG deacetylation and demonstrate that the C-terminal domain is required for maximal deacetylation of longer PNAG oligomers. Furthermore, we show that BpsB is critical for the formation and complex architecture of B. bronchiseptica biofilms."

This referral rule is positive when at least two variables are present. Validation of the CaFaSpA rule was accomplished in 579 primary care CLBP patients from 38 practices from other areas. Performance of the referral rule was assessed by c-statistic and calibration plot. To fit the final referral rule the development and validation datasets were pooled leading to a total study population of 943 primary care participants.The referral rule was validated in 579 patients (41% male, mean age 36 (sd7.0). The percentage of identified axSpA patients was 16% (n=95). External validation resulted in satisfactory calibration and reasonable discriminative ability (c-statistics 0.70 [95% CI, 0.64-0.75]). In the pooled dataset sensitivity and specificity of the referral rule were 75% and 58%.The CaFaSpA referral rule for axSpA consists of four easy to use predictors for primary care physicians and has a good predictive value in this validation study. The referral rule has the potential to be a screening tool for primary care by identifying CLBP patients suspected for axSpA."
https://openalex.org/W1544396097,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmias among old people. It causes serious long-term health problems affecting the quality of life. It has been suggested that the autonomic nervous system is involved in the onset and maintenance of AF in human. However, investigation of its pathogenesis and potential treatment has been hampered by the lack of suitable AF models in experimental animals.Our aim was to establish a long-lasting AF model in mice. We also investigated the role of adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes, which may be involved in the onset and duration of AF.Trans-esophageal atrial burst pacing in mice could induce AF, as previously shown, but with only a short duration (29.0 ± 8.1 sec). We found that adrenergic activation by intraperitoneal norepinephrine (NE) injection strikingly increased the AF duration. It increased the duration to more than 10 minutes, i.e., by more than 20-fold (656.2 ± 104.8 sec; P<0.001). In this model, a prior injection of a specific β1-AR blocker metoprolol and an α1-AR blocker prazosin both significantly attenuated NE-induced elongation of AF. To further explore the mechanisms underlying these receptors' effects on AF, we assessed the SR Ca(2+) leak, a major trigger of AF, and consequent spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release (SCR) in atrial myocytes. Consistent with the results of our in-vivo experiments, both metoprolol and prazosin significantly inhibited the NE-induced SR Ca(2+) leak and SCR. These findings suggest that both β1-AR and α1-AR may play important roles in the development of AF.We have established a long-lasting AF model in mice induced by adrenergic activation, which will be valuable in future AF study using experimental animals, such as transgenic mice. We also revealed the important role of β1- and α1-AR-mediated signaling in the development of AF through in-vivo and in-vitro experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1019794706,"Military personnel are often required to wear ballistic protection in order to defend against enemies. However, this added protection increases mass carried and imposes additional thermal burden on the individual. Body armor (BA) is known to reduce combat casualties, but the effects of BA mass and insulation on the physical performance of soldiers are less well documented. Until recently, the emphasis has been increasing personal protection, with little consideration of the adverse impacts on human performance.The purpose of this work was to use sweating thermal manikin and mathematical modeling techniques to quantify the tradeoff between increased BA protection, the accompanying mass, and thermal effects on human performance.Using a sweating thermal manikin, total insulation (IT, clo) and vapor permeability indexes (im) were measured for a baseline clothing ensemble with and without one of seven increasingly protective U.S. Army BA configurations. Using mathematical modeling, predictions were made of thermal impact on humans wearing each configuration while working in hot/dry (desert), hot/humid (jungle), and temperate environmental conditions.In nearly still air (0.4 m/s), IT ranged from 1.57 to 1.63 clo and im from 0.35 to 0.42 for the seven BA conditions, compared to IT and im values of 1.37 clo and 0.45 respectively, for the baseline condition (no BA).Biophysical assessments and predictive modeling show a quantifiable relationship exists among increased protection and increased thermal burden and decreased work capacity. This approach enables quantitative analysis of the tradeoffs between ballistic protection, thermal-work strain, and physical work performance."
https://openalex.org/W1029534951,"Several studies report increased reward sensitivity towards food in overweight individuals. By contrast, data is inconclusive with respect to response inhibition in overweight individuals without binge eating disorder (BED). Hence, the latter was addressed in the present study in a group of overweight/obese females with and without BED and a normal-weight control group without eating disorders.A group of women with BED (n = 29), a group of overweight women without BED (n = 33) and normal-weight females (n = 30) participated in a pictorial priming paradigm, with food items (relevant primes) and office utensils (neutral primes) and color blobs (neutral primes) as stimuli. Increased response priming effects (i.e. priming with switches between stimulus categories) were taken as indicators of deficient behavioral inhibition.Priming effects for neutral primes were moderate and comparable across all groups. However, primes associated with the food task set lead to increased priming effects in both overweight groups. But, effects were comparable for overweight/obese participants with and without BED.Results suggest that early response inhibition in the context of food is impaired in overweight individuals compared to normal-weight individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1923468002,"Populations of the same species can experience different responses to the environment throughout their distributional range as a result of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in habitat conditions. This highlights the importance of understanding the processes governing species distribution at local scales. However, research on species distribution often averages environmental covariates across large geographic areas, missing variability in population-environment interactions within geographically distinct regions. We used spatially explicit models to identify interactions between species and environmental, including chlorophyll a (Chla) and sea surface temperature (SST), and trophic (prey density) conditions, along with processes governing the distribution of two cephalopods with contrasting life-histories (octopus and squid) across the western Mediterranean Sea. This approach is relevant for cephalopods, since their population dynamics are especially sensitive to variations in habitat conditions and rarely stable in abundance and location. The regional distributions of the two cephalopod species matched two different trophic pathways present in the western Mediterranean Sea, associated with the Gulf of Lion upwelling and the Ebro river discharges respectively. The effects of the studied environmental and trophic conditions were spatially variant in both species, with usually stronger effects along their distributional boundaries. We identify areas where prey availability limited the abundance of cephalopod populations as well as contrasting effects of temperature in the warmest regions. Despite distributional patterns matching productive areas, a general negative effect of Chla on cephalopod densities suggests that competition pressure is common in the study area. Additionally, results highlight the importance of trophic interactions, beyond other common environmental factors, in shaping the distribution of cephalopod populations. Our study presents a valuable approach for understanding the spatially variant ecology of cephalopod populations, which is important for fisheries and ecosystem management."
https://openalex.org/W2131422895,"RUVBL1 (RuvB-like1) and RUVBL2 (RuvB-like 2) are integral components of multisubunit protein complexes involved in processes ranging from cellular metabolism, transcription and chromatin remodeling to DNA repair. Here, we show that although RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are known to form heterodimeric complexes in which they stabilize each other, the subunits separate during cytokinesis. In anaphase-to-telophase transition, RUVBL1 localizes to structures of the mitotic spindle apparatus, where it partially co-localizes with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). The ability of PLK1 to phosphorylate RUVBL1-but not RUVBL2-in vitro and their physical association in vivo suggest that this kinase differentially regulates the function of the RuvB-like proteins during mitosis. We further show that siRNA-mediated knock-down of RuvB-like proteins causes severe defects in chromosome alignment and segregation. In addition, we show that the ATPase activity of RUVBL1 is indispensable for cell proliferation. Our data thus demonstrate that RUVBL1 is essential for efficient mitosis and proliferation."

VX2 tumors were implanted in two different segments of the liver in 13 rabbits. After 2 weeks, two phase contrast enhanced CT scans including the arterial phase (AP) and portal-venous phase (PVP) were performed three times with 24-hour intervals with three different concentrations of iodine, 300 (I(300)), 150 (I(150)) and 75 mg I/mL (I(75)). The mean HU and standard deviation (SD) were measured in the liver, the hypervascular portion of the VX2 tumor which represented hypervascular tumors, and the central necrotic area of the VX2 tumor which represented hypovascular tumors in 140 kVp images with I(300) as a reference standard and in monoenergetic images (between 40 keV and 140 keV) with I(150) and I(75). The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for FLLs and the ratio of the CNRs (CNR(ratio)) between monoenergetic image sets with I(150) and I(75), and the reference standard were calculated.For hypervascular lesions, the CNR(ratio) was not statistically different from 1.0 between 40 keV and 70 keV images with I(150), whereas the CNR(ratio) was significantly lower than 1.0 in all keV images with I(75). For hypovascular lesions, the CNR(ratio) was similar to or higher than 1.0 between 40 keV and 80 keV with I(150) and between 40 keV and 70 keV with I(75)..With dual-energy CT, the total amount of CM might be halved in the diagnosis of hypervascular FLLs and reduced to one-fourth in the diagnosis of hypovascular FLLs, while still preserving CNRs."

Glypicans (Gpcs) are a family of glypiated extracellular proteoglycans that mainly work as co-regulators of several signaling pathways, and they are thereby involved in the control of many biological processes such as cellular division, differentiation, and morphogenesis. To date, six different Gpcs have been identified in vertebrates, Gpc1 to Gpc6, with ∼25% amino acid identity within the family, two in Caenorhabditis elegans (Gpc1 and Lon-2), two in Drosophila melanogaster (Dally and Dally-like protein), and one in zebrafish (knypek). The mature forms of human Gpcs have a core protein of ∼60–70 kDa in size and share a pattern of 14 conserved cysteine residues. In the C-terminal region, Gpcs share attachment sites for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains and a hydrophobic sequence for the addition of the GPI anchor (2Fico A. Maina F. Dono R. Fine-tuning of cell signaling by glypicans.Cell. Mol.

GAGs are O-linked linear anionic hetero-polysaccharides found in all mammalian tissues in extracellular and/or intracellular environments. Their sequences are composed of repeating disaccharide units and are divided into classes depending on the disaccharide building blocks. The most widespread categories are as follows: 1) heparan sulfate (HS), which consists of repeating units of glucuronic acid (GlcUA) or iduronic acid (IdoUA) followed by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), i.e. (GlcUA/IdoUA-GlcNAc)n; 2) chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate, which consist of GlcUA or IdoUA followed by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), i.e. (GlcUA/IdoUA-GalNAc)n. The biosynthesis of GAG chains is performed by membrane-bound glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus and starts with addition of xylose (Xyl) to the GAG attachment serine residue by a xylosyltransferase. Then two consecutive galactose units and a GlcUA unit are transferred, forming the linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser). Addition of the next residue is the critical factor in determining which type of GAG will be formed as follows: incorporation of GalNAc promotes CS/dermatan sulfate assembly, and addition of GlcNAc initiates HS synthesis. The GAG chain then becomes elongated by addition of the corresponding repeating disaccharides and undergoes serial modifications, including N-deacetylation, N- and O-sulfation, and epimerization, generating GAG chains with heterogeneous structures (3Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. Heparan sulfate: a complex polymer charged with biological activity.Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2745-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Human Gpc1 is mainly expressed in the neural and skeletal systems during development, as well as many other tissues in the adult. Gpc1 is involved in the uptake of different macromolecules such as growth factors (FGF2), viral proteins, cytokines, and polyamines (4Awad W. Logan D.T. Mani K. GPC1 (glypican 1).Atlas Genet. Cytogenet. Oncol. Haematol. 2014; 18: 461-464Google Scholar). Gpc1 knock-out mice have significant reduction in brain size at birth (about 30%), indicating a role for Gpc1 in brain development (5Jen Y.H. Musacchio M. Lander A.D. Glypican-1 controls brain size through regulation of fibroblast growth factor signaling in early neurogenesis.Neural Dev. 2009; 4: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Many studies have revealed involvement of Gpc1 in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (6Hooper N.M.

Moreover, it has been shown that Gpc1 is up-regulated in many human cancer types such as glioma, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer (8Matsuda K. Maruyama H. Guo F. Kleeff J. Itakura J. Matsumoto Y. Lander A.D. Korc M.

Pathol. 2006; 168: 2014-2026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Gpc1 protein is composed of an N-terminal core (residues 24–474) and a C-terminal GAG attachment region (residues 475–530), ending with a sequence of hydrophobic residues that link it to the GPI anchor (Fig. 1A). The Gpc1 protein is decorated with two N-linked glycans at positions Asn-79 and Asn-116 and is also substituted with three chains of HS at Ser-486, Ser-488, and Ser-490 (Fig. 1A). Previously, we determined the crystal structure of the N-glycosylated, C-terminally truncated Gpc1 core protein at 2.6 Å (PDB entry 4ACR) and showed that it has an elongated cylindrical form with dimensions 120 × 30 × 30 Å and an all α-helical fold (α1–α14) with three major loops (L1, L2, and L3) (Fig. 1B) (10Svensson G. Awad W. Håkansson M. Mani K. Logan D.T. Crystal structure of N-glycosylated human glypican-1 core protein: structure of two loops evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate glypican-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14040-14051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The complete disulfide pattern of the 14 conserved Cys residues across the Gpc family was also revealed in the structure. Six disulfide bonds are located near the protein N terminus in a region termed the Cys-rich lobe. This region is followed by the central lobe, stabilized by two evolutionarily conserved hydrophobic cores. Finally, the protease site lobe contains a furin protease site found in many Gpc family members. Recently, we achieved improvements of Gpc1 crystal diffraction properties by controlled crystal dehydration using a humidity control device (HC1b) (11Bowler M.W. Mueller U. Weiss M.S. Sanchez-Weatherby J. Sorensen T.L.M. Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Ursby T. Gobbo A. Russi S. Bowler M.G. Brockhauser S. Svensson O. Cipriani F. Automation and experience of controlled crystal dehydration: results from the European synchrotron HC1 collaboration.Crystal Growth Design. 2015; 15: 1043-1054Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and generated better electron density for crystals of C-terminally truncated Gpc1 (12Awad W. Svensson Birkedal G. Thunnissen M.M. Mani K. Logan D.T. Improvements in the order, isotropy and electron density of glypican-1 crystals by controlled dehydration.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2013; 69: 2524-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the 3-Å crystal structure of full-length Gpc1 (PDB entry 4AD7) contains no electron density for the C-terminal region (∼53 residues) that attaches the core protein to the cell membrane. Therefore, it was not possible to predict the location and orientation of the Gpc1 core protein and its HS chains with respect to the cell surface. Previous work from our laboratory shows that Gpc1 is invariably decorated with two N-glycans, which affect the Gpc1 expression level and HS substitution (13Svensson G. Hyrenius Wittsten A. Linse S. Mani K. The structural role of N-linked glycans on human glypican-1.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 9377-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Gpc1 protein was correctly folded in the absence of N-glycans. The crystal structure of Gpc1 displayed only the first residue of the N-linked glycans, and therefore it is still of great interest to characterize the structure and function of Gpc1 N-glycans using other techniques. In this work, we couple the existing knowledge from protein crystallography with small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and other biophysical techniques to provide new insights into the structural-functional characteristics of the Gpc1 core protein in solution. Briefly, we report the highest resolution and complete full-length Gpc1 crystal structure to date by further application of crystal dehydration to this system. Moreover, the composition and structure of the N-linked glycans have been characterized. Finally, molecular modeling based on SAXS data from various Gpc1 constructs was pursued to elucidate the spatial relationship between the cell membrane, Gpc1 core protein, and the N- and O-linked glycans. Taken together, our study provides a clearer topological picture of Gpc1 with respect to the cell membrane. The design of different Gpc1 variants is summarized in Table 1. All Gpc1 constructs were cloned and expressed in stable HEK293 cells as described previously (13Svensson G. Hyrenius Wittsten A. Linse S. Mani K. The structural role of N-linked glycans on human glypican-1.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 9377-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was collected, and the proteins were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The proteins were then dialyzed into 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, for the C-terminally truncated protein (Gpc1-dC) and the same buffer with additional 2 mm DTT for the others before any further experiments.TABLE 1Description of all forms of Gpc1 proteins used in this studyGpc1 proteins as cited in textCharacteristicsGpc1-dCC-terminally truncated Gpc1 carrying two N-glycansGpc1-dC-dNEndoH-deglycosylated C-terminally truncated Gpc1Gpc1-dHSFull-length Gpc1 carrying two N-glycans but no HS substitution (by mutagenesis of S486A, S488A, and S490A)Gpc1-dHS-dNEndoH-deglycosylated full-length Gpc1Gpc1-WTWild-type Gpc1 substituted with three HS chains and two N-glycansGpc1-WT-dHSGpc1-WT treated with HS lyase enzymeGpc1-N79QGpc1 substituted with three HS chains and only one glycan at Asn-116 (by mutagenesis of N79Q)Gpc1-N79Q-dHSGpc1-N79Q treated with HS lyase enzymeGpc1-N116QGpc1 substituted with three HS chains and only one glycan at Asn-79 (by mutagenesis of N116Q)Gpc1-N116Q-dHSGpc1-N116Q treated with HS lyase enzyme Open table in a new tab Deglycosylation of Gpc1-dC and the full-length protein without the HS chains (Gpc1-dHS) was carried out by growing the Gpc1-producing cells in protein-free medium containing 10 μm plant alkaloid kifunensine, which forces the cells to express proteins with N-glycans of the high mannose type that are sensitive to endoglycosidase H (EndoH) (14Chang V.T.

Glycoprotein structural genomics: solving the glycosylation problem.Structure. 2007; 15: 267-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Afterward, EndoH treatment (New England Biolabs) of 1 mg of native high mannose Gpc1 was carried out in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by overnight incubation at 37 °C with 30 milliunits of the enzyme. The deglycosylation efficiency was tested by SDS-PAGE, which showed a reduction in the size of the Gpc1-dC and Gpc1-dHS core protein bands by 5 kDa after deglycosylation, producing deglycosylated forms of the Gpc1 core proteins (Gpc1-dC-dN and Gpc1-dHS-dN), respectively. EndoH was removed from the sample by repeating the Ni-NTA purification. Digestion of the HS chains was carried out as follows: the purified proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES and 3 mm Ca(OAc)2 buffer, pH 7.0, overnight, and then 150 milliunits of HS lyase (Seikagaku, Japan) were added to 1 mg of protein and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The protein buffer was exchanged to 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, by ultrafiltration, and then incubated with DE-53 DEAE-cellulose (for anion exchange) on a rocker at 8 °C for 1 h. The unbound proteins (without heparan sulfate) were released by washing the cellulose twice with 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, and finally the HS lyase was removed by repeating the Ni-NTA purification. HS lyase digests the HS polysaccharide chains, leaving only the tetrasaccharide linkers (GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1) on the consensus serine residues of the HS attachment sites. Removal of HS chains from the wild type (GPC1-WT) and the proteins with disrupted N-glycosites, Gpc1-N79Q and Gpc1-N116Q, produced the Gpc1-WT-dHS, Gpc1-N79Q-dHS, and Gpc1-N116Q-dHS proteins, respectively. Crystallization of Gpc1-dHS protein was performed using sitting drop vapor diffusion by mixing 2 μl of protein at 25 mg/ml with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 14–16% PEG 6000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.2 m CaCl2, equilibrated over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution. Thin plate-like crystals of dimensions around 0.9 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm grew in 2 weeks within a lot of precipitated protein. Gpc1-dHS crystals were soaked in 16% PEG 6000, 0.2 m CaCl2, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 15% ethylene glycol and then mounted on a mesh LithoLoop (Molecular Dimensions, UK) in the HC1b machine at beamline I911-3 of the MAX IV Laboratory, Lund, Sweden. The Gpc1-dHS crystals were dehydrated for a total incubation time of 50–60 min to a final relative humidity of 86–88%. The dehydrated crystals were then flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen using the CATS sample changer (IRELEC, Saint-Martin-d-Hères, France), and subsequently complete diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K. Diffraction images were indexed and scaled using XDS (15Kabsch W. Integration, scaling, space-group assignment and post-refinement.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar) and were further processed using programs from CCP4 package (16Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P.

Finally, model validation was performed using Molprobity (20Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

PyMOL Version 1.6 (Schrödinger, LLC) was used for molecular rendering. The Gpc1 proteins (150 μg) were immobilized on a 10-kDa spin filter (Pall, Port Washington, NY), treated with denaturation buffer (50 μl of 50 mm DTT, 20 mm NaHCO3), and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min to denature the proteins to allow for efficient cleavage of the N-glycans. After cooling to room temperature for 10 min, an iodoacetamide solution (50 mm, 50 μl per well) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were spun at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and the flow-through was discarded, followed by two washings with MilliQ water (50 μl) to remove residual amounts of denaturation reagents. N-Glycans were enzymatically released by digestion with recombinant N-glycosidase F (50 μl, 0.5 milliunits in 20 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.0) (ProZyme, Hayward, CA) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. After extraction, glycans were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB), sodium cyanoborohydride, 30% v/v acetic acid in DMSO at 65 °C for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature for 10 min, 100 μl of acetonitrile were added to the 2-AB-labeled sample and loaded into a pre-conditioned Glycoworks HILIC cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) for excess fluorophore removal. The cartridge was washed with 400 μl of 85% acetonitrile, and glycans were eluted with 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium acetate in 5% acetonitrile. The elution was repeated two more times, and the samples were concentrated to dryness in a vacuum evaporator. The samples were dissolved in acetonitrile/H2O (70:30) and analyzed by HILIC-FLD-UPLC using a 1.7-μm BEH glycan column (2.1 × 15 mm, Waters) and Waters ACQUITY UPLC I-class with fluorescence detection. The column temperature was kept at 40 °C, and the flow rate set to 0.561 ml/min using a linear gradient of 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4, against acetonitrile with ammonium formate from 30 to 47% over a 25-min period. An injection volume of 25 μl of sample prepared in 70% v/v acetonitrile was used throughout. Fluorescence detection was achieved using excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. A representative HILIC-FLD-UPLC profile of Gpc1 was annotated with glucose unit (GU) values by comparison with a dextran hydrosylate ladder (21Royle L. Radcliffe C.M. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M.

The Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) glycan notation is used throughout (23Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Marth J.D. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E.

The sequence and linkage specificities of the glycans were analyzed by exoglycosidase enzymes purchased from ProZyme (Hayward, CA). 2-AB-labeled glycans were digested in 10 μl of supplied buffers at 37 °C overnight, using arrays of the following enzymes: ABS, Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18, releases α2–3,6,8-linked nonreducing terminal sialic acid); NAN1, recombinant sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18, releases α2–3-linked nonreducing terminal sialic acids); bovine kidney α-fucosidase (EC3.2.1.51, releases α1–2,6-linked nonreducing terminal fucose residues more efficiently than α1–3,4-linked fucose, digests core α1–6 fucose); bovine testes β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23, hydrolyzes nonreducing terminal β1–4- and β1–3-linked galactose); hexosaminidase cloned from Streptococcus pneumoniae expressed in Escherichia coli (EC 3.2.1.30, releases GlcNAc residues but not a bisecting GlcNAc-linked to Man); and jack bean α-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24, hydrolyzes α(1–2,3,6)-linked mannose from oligosaccharides). After incubation, enzymes were removed by filtration using Pall spin filters of 10 kDa. N-Glycans were then analyzed by HILIC-FLD-UPLC as described above. SEC analysis was performed at room temperature using a pre-equilibrated Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in the standard buffers. Sample homogeneity was assessed by DLS using a Zetasizer APS DLS system (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) under the same conditions as the SAXS measurements were done, and the data were analyzed using Zetasizer software version 7.03.

Water measurements (empty capillary and water) were employed as a reference for further measurements and to give preliminary estimates for the sample molecular weight using the known absolute scattering of water (I0, abs (water) = 1.632.10−2 cm−1, at 25 °C). Size exclusion directly in-line with SAXS (SEC-SAXS) was used to obtain scattering data from highly pure monomers of Gpc1-dHS and Gpc1-dC using the HPLC system (Viscotek GPCmax, Malvern Instruments) attached directly to the sample inlet valve of the sample changer at BM29. 100 μl of ∼6 mg/ml clarified sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 2 column volumes of the protein standard buffer. The protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and passed through the capillary cell, and a scattering frame was collected every 2 s with a total of 1200 frames. The EDNA pipeline (25Incardona M.F. Bourenkov G.P. Levik K. Pieritz R.A. Popov A.N. Svensson O. EDNA: a framework for plugin-based applications applied to x-ray experiment online data analysis.J. Synchrotron. Radiat. 2009; 16: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) provided a one-dimensional profile for each frame. The individual frame was subtracted and processed using tools from the ATSAS suite (26Petoukhov M.V. Franke D. Shkumatov A.V. Tria G. Kikhney A.G. Gajda M. Gorba C. Mertens H.D. Konarev P.V.

Crystallogr. 2012; 45: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar) calculating the forward scattering I(0) and radius of gyration Rg. Frames with stable Rg values from the monomer peak scattering intensity (the second half of the peak) were merged to provide a single averaged frame corresponding to the scattering of an individual SEC-purified monomer. For concentration series measurements, the samples were dialyzed overnight against the standard buffers, and concentration series were prepared. A sample changer robot was used to load 35 μl of the clarified sample into the measurement capillary, and SAXS data were collected in flow mode. Scattering profiles of the filtered dialysis buffers were subtracted from the corresponding sample scattering profiles. Real space Rg, excluded particle (Porod) volume, and the maximum particle dimension (Dmax) were estimated from the pair distance distribution function P(r) using the program GNOM. Molecular mass was determined using the program SAXSMoW. Porod-Debye plots were employed to analyze the protein flexibility according to Rambo and Tainer (27Rambo R.P. Tainer J.A. Characterizing flexible and intrinsically unstructured biological macromolecules by SAS using the Porod-Debye law.Biopolymers. 2011; 95: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Ab initio shape reconstruction was performed using the simulated annealing method as implemented in the DAMMIN program (28Svergun D.I. Restoring low resolution structure of biological macromolecules from solution scattering using simulated annealing.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). 20 different models were aligned and averaged, and the most typical model was generated using DAMAVER program suite (29Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). To test the dependence of the SAXS shape reconstruction on methods, the program GASBOR (30Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Determination of domain structure of proteins from x-ray solution scattering.Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) was also used to compute a set of 20 different ab initio shape envelopes using GNOM output up to 4.5 nm−1 and the same Dmax and Rg values used with DAMMIN. All-atom models (AllosMod) of Gpc1-dC and Gpc1-dHS were generated using tools on the SaliLab web server (54Guttman M. Weinkam P. Sali A. Lee K.K. All-atom ensemble modeling to analyze small-angle x-ray scattering of glycosylated proteins.Structure. 2013; 21: 321-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ModLoop was used for modeling of loops missing in the Gpc1 crystal structure (PDB code 4YWT) (31Fiser A. Sali A. ModLoop: automated modeling of loops in protein structures.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2500-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). No building was performed for the missing residues at the N and C termini of the core proteins. Next, static models of Gpc1-dC and Gpc1-dHS with flexible glycans were generated in MODELLER utilizing the ModLoop output. Monosialylated digalactosylated biantennary glycans (at position Asn-79) and core-fucosylated monogalactosylated biantennary complex glycans with bisecting GlcNAc (at position Asn-116), corresponding to the predominant glycoforms identified in the MS studies, were added with ideal geometries, followed by a 1 Å randomization of the all-atom coordinates, where the motions were restricted to loops and surface side chains. The generated core models were then used for further modeling jobs. Finally, a 330 K AllosMod simulation was used to generate 2000 protein conformations with rigid sugars consistent with the input structure. The ensembles of glycosylated models were fitted to the raw SAXS data using FoXS (32Schneidman-Duhovny D. Hammel M. Sali A.

https://openalex.org/W1869134662,"Biocides are used without restriction for several purposes. As a consequence, large amounts of biocides are released without any control in the environment, a situation that can challenge the microbial population dynamics, including selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Previous work has shown that triclosan selects Stenotrophomonas maltophilia antibiotic resistant mutants overexpressing the efflux pump SmeDEF and induces expression of this pump triggering transient low-level resistance. In the present work we analyze if two other common biocides, benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophene, trigger antibiotic resistance in S. maltophilia. Bioinformatic and biochemical methods showed that benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophene bind the repressor of smeDEF, SmeT. Only benzalkonium chloride triggers expression of smeD and its effect in transient antibiotic resistance is minor. None of the hexachlorophene-selected mutants was antibiotic resistant. Two benzalkonium chloride resistant mutants presented reduced susceptibility to antibiotics and were impaired in growth. Metabolic profiling showed they were more proficient than their parental strain in the use of some dipeptides. We can then conclude that although bioinformatic predictions and biochemical studies suggest that both hexachlorophene and benzalkonium chloride should induce smeDEF expression leading to transient S. maltophilia resistance to antibiotics, phenotypic assays showed this not to be true. The facts that hexachlorophene resistant mutants are not antibiotic resistant and that the benzalkonium chloride resistant mutants presenting altered susceptibility to antibiotics were impaired in growth suggests that the risk for the selection (and fixation) of S. maltophilia antibiotic resistant mutants by these biocides is likely low, at least in the absence of constant selection pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1948341008,"Nucleolar GTP-binding protein (NGP-1) is overexpressed in various cancers and proliferating cells, but the functional significance remains unknown. In this study, we show that NGP-1 promotes G1 to S phase transition of cells by enhancing CDK inhibitor p21Cip-1/Waf1 expression through p53. In addition, our results suggest that activation of the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex by NGP-1 via maintaining the stoichiometry between cyclin D1-CDK4 complex and p21 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein at serine 780 (p-RBSer-780) followed by the up-regulation of E2F1 target genes required to promote G1 to S phase transition. Furthermore, our data suggest that ribosomal protein RPL23A interacts with NGP-1 and abolishes NGP-1-induced p53 activity by enhancing Mdm2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination. Finally, reduction of p-RBSer-780 levels and E2F1 target gene expression upon ectopic expression of RPL23a resulted in arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Collectively, this investigation provides evidence that NGP-1 promotes cell cycle progression through the activation of the p53/p21Cip-1/Waf1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2141356256,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is thought to regulate the replication of viral RNA and the assembly of virus particles in a serine/threonine phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, the host kinases that phosphorylate NS5A have not been fully identified. Here, we show that HCV particle assembly involves the phosphorylation of NS5A by the c-Abl tyrosine kinase. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of c-Abl reduces the production of infectious HCV (J6/JFH1) particles in Huh-7.5 cells without markedly affecting viral RNA translation and replication. NS5A is tyrosine-phosphorylated in HCV-infected cells, and this phosphorylation is also reduced by the knockdown of c-Abl. Mutational analysis reveals that NS5A tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent, at least in part, on Tyr(330) (Tyr(2306) in polyprotein numbering). Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine reduces the production of infectious HCV particles but does not affect the replication of the JFH1 subgenomic replicon. These findings suggest that c-Abl promotes HCV particle assembly by phosphorylating NS5A at Tyr(330)."
https://openalex.org/W993846287,"Introduction Through funding agency and publisher policies, an increasing proportion of the health sciences literature is being made open access. Such an increase in access raises questions about the awareness and potential utilization of this literature by those working in health fields. Methods A sample of physicians (N=336) and public health non-governmental organization (NGO) staff (N=92) were provided with relatively complete access to the research literature indexed in PubMed, as well as access to the point-of-care service UpToDate, for up to one year, with their usage monitored through the tracking of web-log data. The physicians also participated in a one-month trial of relatively complete or limited access. Results The study found that participants' research interests were not satisfied by article abstracts alone nor, in the case of the physicians, by a clinical summary service such as UpToDate. On average, a third of the physicians viewed research a little more frequently than once a week, while two-thirds of the public health NGO staff viewed more than three articles a week. Those articles were published since the 2008 adoption of the NIH Public Access Policy, as well as prior to 2008 and during the maximum 12-month embargo period. A portion of the articles in each period was already open access, but complete access encouraged a viewing of more research articles. Conclusion Those working in health fields will utilize more research in the course of their work as a result of (a) increasing open access to research, (b) improving awareness of and preparation for this access, and (c) adjusting public and open access policies to maximize the extent of potential access, through reduction in embargo periods and access to pre-policy literature."
https://openalex.org/W1014065910,"In current molecular biology, it becomes more and more important to identify differentially expressed genes closely correlated with a key biological process from gene expression data. In this paper, based on the Schatten p-norm and Lp-norm, a novel p-norm robust feature extraction method is proposed to identify the differentially expressed genes. In our method, the Schatten p-norm is used as the regularization function to obtain a low-rank matrix and the Lp-norm is taken as the error function to improve the robustness to outliers in the gene expression data. The results on simulation data show that our method can obtain higher identification accuracies than the competitive methods. Numerous experiments on real gene expression data sets demonstrate that our method can identify more differentially expressed genes than the others. Moreover, we confirmed that the identified genes are closely correlated with the corresponding gene expression data."
https://openalex.org/W1022329560,"Bitter taste receptors (TAS2R proteins) allow mammals to detect and avoid ingestion of toxins in food. Thus, TAS2Rs play an important role in food choice and are subject to complex natural selection pressures. In our previous study, we examined nucleotide variation in TAS2R38, a gene expressing bitter taste receptor for phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), in 333 Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) from 9 local populations in Japan. We identified a PTC ""non-taster"" TAS2R38 allele in Japanese macaques that was caused by a loss of the start codon. This PTC non-taster allele was only found in a limited local population (the Kii area), at a frequency of 29%. In this study, we confirmed that this allele was present in only the Kii population by analyzing an additional 264 individuals from eight new populations. Using cellular and behavioral experiments, we found that this allele lost its receptor function for perceiving PTC. The nucleotide sequences of the allele including flanking regions (of about 10 kb) from 23 chromosomes were identical, suggesting that a non-taster allele arose and expanded in the Kii population during the last 13,000 years. Genetic analyses of non-coding regions in Kii individuals and neighboring populations indicated that the high allele frequency in the Kii population could not be explained by demographic history, suggesting that positive selection resulted in a rapid increase in PTC non-tasters in the Kii population. The loss-of-function that occurred at the TAS2R38 locus presumably provided a fitness advantage to Japanese macaques in the Kii population. Because TAS2R38 ligands are often found in plants, this functional change in fitness is perhaps related to feeding habit specificity. These findings should provide valuable insights for elucidating adaptive evolutionary changes with respect to various environments in wild mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2207946058,"In the mammalian central nervous system, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are responsible for the clearance of glutamate after synaptic release. This energetically demanding activity is crucial for precise neuronal communication and for maintaining extracellular glutamate concentrations below neurotoxic levels. In addition to their ability to recapture glutamate from the extracellular space, EAATs exhibit a sodium- and glutamate-gated anion conductance. Here we show that substitution of a conserved positively charged residue (Arg-388, hEAAT1) in transmembrane domain 7 with a negatively charged amino acid eliminates the ability of glutamate to further activate the anion conductance. When expressed in oocytes, R388D or R388E mutants show large anion currents that display no further increase in amplitude after application of saturating concentrations of Na+ and glutamate. They also show a substantially reduced transport activity. The mutant transporters appear to exist preferentially in a sodium- and glutamate-independent constitutive open channel state that rarely transitions to complete the transport cycle. In addition, the accessibility of cytoplasmic residues to membrane-permeant modifying reagents supports the idea that this substrate-independent open state correlates with an intermediate outward facing conformation of the transporter. Our data provide additional insights into the mechanism by which substrates gate the anion conductance in EAATs and suggest that in EAAT1, Arg-388 is a critical element for the structural coupling between the substrate translocation and the gating mechanisms of the EAAT-associated anion channel.

https://openalex.org/W1927397692,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) expresses 3 structurally distinct pilus types (1, 2a, and 2b) identified as important virulence factors and vaccine targets. These pili are heterotrimeric polymers, covalently assembled on the cell wall by sortase (Srt) enzymes. We investigated the pilus-2b biogenesis mechanism by using a multidisciplinary approach integrating genetic, biochemical, and structural studies to dissect the role of the 2 pilus-2b-associated Srts. We show that only 1 sortase (SrtC1-2b) is responsible for pilus protein polymerization, whereas the second one (Srt2-2b) does not act as a pilin polymerase, but similarly to the housekeeping class A Srt (SrtA), it is involved in cell-wall pilus anchoring by targeting the minor ancillary subunit. Based on its function and sequence features, Srt2-2b does not belong to class C Srts (SrtCs), nor is it a canonical member of any other known family of Srts. We also report the crystal structure of SrtC1-2b at 1.9 Å resolution. The overall fold resembles the typical structure of SrtCs except for the N-terminal lid region that appears in an open conformation displaced from the active site. Our findings reveal that GBS pilus type 2b biogenesis differs significantly from the current model of pilus assembly in gram-positive pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1502862198,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP), acting via protein kinase A (PKA), regulates many cellular responses, but the role of mitochondria in such responses is poorly understood. To define such roles, we used quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondria-enriched fractions and performed functional and morphologic studies of wild-type (WT) and kin− (PKA-null) murine S49 lymphoma cells. Basally, 75 proteins significantly differed in abundance between WT and kin− S49 cells. WT, but not kin−, S49 cells incubated with the cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine cAMP (CPT-cAMP) for 16 h have (a) increased expression of mitochondria-related genes and proteins, including ones in pathways of branched-chain amino acid and fatty acid metabolism and (b) increased maximal capacity of respiration on branched-chain keto acids and fatty acids. CPT-cAMP also regulates the cellular rate of ATP-utilization, as the rates of both ATP-linked respiration and proton efflux are decreased in WT but not kin− cells. CPT-cAMP protected WT S49 cells from glucose or glutamine deprivation, In contrast, CPT-cAMP did not protect kin− cells or WT cells treated with the PKA inhibitor H89 from glutamine deprivation. Under basal conditions, the mitochondrial structure of WT and kin− S49 cells is similar. Treatment with CPT-cAMP produced apoptotic changes (i.e. decreased mitochondrial density and size and loss of cristae) in WT, but not kin− cells. Together, these findings show that cAMP acts via PKA to regulate multiple aspects of mitochondrial function and structure. Mitochondrial perturbation thus likely contributes to cAMP/PKA-mediated cellular responses."

https://openalex.org/W2163405305,"Separate phases of metal partitioning behaviour in freshwater lakes that receive varying degrees of atmospheric contamination and have low concentrations of suspended solids were investigated to determine the applicability of the distribution coefficient, KD. Concentrations of Pb, Ni, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr, Hg and Mn were determined using a combination of filtration methods, bulk sample collection and digestion and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Phytoplankton biomass, suspended solids concentrations and the organic content of the sediment were also analysed. By distinguishing between the phytoplankton and (inorganic) lake sediment, transient variations in KD were observed. Suspended solids concentrations over the 6-month sampling campaign showed no correlation with the KD (n = 15 for each metal, p > 0.05) for Mn (r2 = 0.0063), Cu (r2 = 0.0002, Cr (r2 = 0.021), Ni (r2 = 0.0023), Cd (r2 = 0.00001), Co (r2 = 0.096), Hg (r2 = 0.116) or Pb (r2 = 0.164). The results implied that colloidal matter had less opportunity to increase the dissolved (filter passing) fraction, which inhibited the spurious lowering of KD. The findings conform to the increasingly documented theory that the use of KD in modelling may mask true information on metal partitioning behaviour. The root mean square error of prediction between the directly measured total metal concentrations and those modelled based on the separate phase fractions were ± 3.40, 0.06, 0.02, 0.03, 0.44, 484.31, 80.97 and 0.1 μg/L for Pb, Cd, Mn, Cu, Hg, Ni, Cr and Co respectively. The magnitude of error suggests that the separate phase models for Mn and Cu can be used in distribution or partitioning models for these metals in lake water."

We evaluated the significance of RRM1 and ERCC1 expression to predict tumor response to gemcitabine plus platinum chemotherapy (GP) and survival in advanced UC. We retrospectively collected tumor samples and reviewed clinical data of 53 patients with unresectable or metastatic UC, who were treated with first-line GP. RRM1 and ERCC1 expression were measured by immunohistochemistry. Among 53 patients, 12 (22.6%) and 26 (49.1%) patients had tumors that demonstrated a high expression for RRM1 and ERCC1, respectively. Twenty-nine (70.7%) of 41 patients with low RRM1 expression achieved a clinical response (complete + partial responses), but only 3 (25.0%) of 12 patients with high RRM1 expression achieved a clinical response after GP (P=0.007). Nineteen (70.4%) of 27 patients with low ERCC1 expression achieved a clinical response, while 13 (50.0%) of 26 patients with high ERCC1 expression achieved a clinical response (P=0.130). High RRM1 expression was associated with shorter progression free survival and overall survival (PFS P=0.006, OS P=0.006). Multivariate analysis confirmed that patients with high RRM1 expression had a significantly greater risk of progression and death than those with low RRM1 expression. ERCC1 status was not a significant predictor for PFS and OS. RRM1 expression was predictive and prognostic of clinical outcome in advanced UC treated with gemcitabine plus platinum combination chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1030932967,"There has been increasing awareness in the wider biological community of the role of clonal phenotypic heterogeneity in playing key roles in phenomena such as cellular bet-hedging and decision making, as in the case of the phage-λ lysis/lysogeny and B. Subtilis competence/vegetative pathways. Here, we report on the effect of stochasticity in growth rate, cellular memory/intermittency, and its relation to phenotypic heterogeneity. We first present a linear stochastic differential model with finite auto-correlation time, where a randomly fluctuating growth rate with a negative average is shown to result in exponential growth for sufficiently large fluctuations in growth rate. We then present a non-linear stochastic self-regulation model where the loss of coherent self-regulation and an increase in noise can induce a shift from bounded to unbounded growth. An important consequence of these models is that while the average change in phenotype may not differ for various parameter sets, the variance of the resulting distributions may considerably change. This demonstrates the necessity of understanding the influence of variance and heterogeneity within seemingly identical clonal populations, while providing a mechanism for varying functional consequences of such heterogeneity. Our results highlight the importance of a paradigm shift from a deterministic to a probabilistic view of clonality in understanding selection as an optimization problem on noise-driven processes, resulting in a wide range of biological implications, from robustness to environmental stress to the development of drug resistance."

We investigate several identifications of the interaction between the guider and the follower such as computational models that map states of the follower to actions of the guider and the computational basis of the guider to modulate the force on the rein in response to the trust level of the follower. Based on experimental identification systems on human demonstrations show that the guider and the follower experience learning for an optimal stable state-dependent novel 3rd and 2nd order auto-regressive predictive and reactive control policies respectively. By modeling the follower’s dynamics using a time varying virtual damped inertial system, we found that the coefficient of virtual damping is most appropriate to explain the trust level of the follower at any given time. Moreover, we present the stability of the extracted guiding policy when it was implemented on a planar 1-DoF robotic arm. Our findings provide a theoretical basis to design advanced human-robot interaction algorithms applicable to a variety of situations where a human requires the assistance of a robot to perceive the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1035273638,"Two-component signal transduction systems (TCS) are vital for adaptive responses to various environmental stresses in bacteria, fungi and even plants. A TCS typically comprises of a sensor histidine kinase (SK) with its cognate response regulator (RR), which often has two domains-N terminal receiver domain (RD) and C terminal effector domain (ED). The histidine kinase phosphorylates the RD to activate the ED by promoting dimerization. However, despite significant progress on structural studies, how RR transmits activation signal from RD to ED remains elusive. Here we analyzed active to inactive transition process of OmpR/PhoB family using an active conformation of RegX3 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a model system by computational approaches. An inactive state of RegX3 generated from 150 ns molecular dynamic simulation has rotameric conformations of Thr79 and Tyr98 that are generally conserved in inactive RRs. Arg81 in loop β4α4 acts synergistically with loop β1α1 to change its interaction partners during active to inactive transition, potentially leading to the N-terminal movement of RegX3 helix α1. Global conformational dynamics of RegX3 is mainly dependent on α4β5 region, in particular seven 'hot-spot' residues (Tyr98 to Ser104), adjacent to which several coevolved residues at dimeric interface, including Ile76-Asp96, Asp97-Arg111 and Glu24-Arg113 pairs, are critical for signal transduction. Taken together, our computational analyses suggest a molecular linkage between Asp phosphorylation, proximal loops and α4β5α5 dimeric interface during RR active to inactive state transition, which is not often evidently defined from static crystal structures."

The OSWC process improves production efficiency, decreases costs, and enhances the mechanical properties of ERW steel pipe, especially the impact properties of the weld joint. In this paper, an annular OSWC process is investigated based on an experimental simulation platform that can obtain precise real-time measurements of the temperature of the pipe, the water pressure and flux, etc. The effects of the modes of annular spray water cooling and related cooling parameters on the mechanical properties of the pipe are investigated. The temperature evolutions of the inner and outer walls of the pipe are measured during the spray water cooling process, and the uniformity of mechanical properties along the circumferential and longitudinal directions is investigated. A heat transfer coefficient model of spray water cooling is developed based on measured temperature data in conjunction with simulation using the finite element method. Industrial tests prove the validity of the heat transfer model of a steel pipe undergoing spray water cooling. The research results can provide a basis for the industrial application of the OSWC process in the production of ERW steel pipes."

Therefore, one would expect that upon ligand-receptor interaction, the receptor-associated GEMs can act as a platform or carrier to support a transmembrane signal, as well as the interplay of different signals elicited by various GEM-associated receptor-ligand interactions, helping them bind in an efficient, controlled, and synergistic manner. Furthermore, a number of investigations have shown that the single bond between the GP Ib-IX complex and vWf cannot be maintained under high shear force imposed on either platelets or the GP Ib-IX-expressing CHOs. In addition, vWf is a large multimeric molecule possessing multiple sites that can interact with GP Ibα; therefore, GP Ib-IX complexes could be clustering on vWf, which allows for resistance to the shear force through the anchorage of the GP Ib-IX complex to the platelet cytoskeleton (3Lou J. Zhu C. Flow induces loop-to-β-hairpin transition on the β-switch of platelet glycoprotein Ibα.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Along this line, a GEM-based localization to concentrate larger numbers of GP Ibα molecules should facilitate such multivalent binding. glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane cytoplasmic tail transmembrane domain von Willebrand factor human transferrin receptor. It is known that all of the GP Ib-IX subunits (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX) are type I transmembrane proteins that reside in the GEMs. Lack of or dysfunction in this association caused by a disruption of the GEMs structure (e.g. MβCD treatment (19Shrimpton C.N.

Xu, D. Shang, Z. Zhang, T. S. Shaw, Y. Ran, J. A. López, and Y. Peng, manuscript in preparation. At this point, we only know that GP Ibβ and GP IX possess unidentified structural elements required for the association of the GP Ib-IX complex with GEMs that is independent of the palmitoylation state of GP Ibβ and GP IX. Although the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of these two molecules seem like good candidates because of their location near the membrane lipids (25Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Hyman R.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there is no experimental evidence to support this notion. In addition, previous reports have shown that the association of a transmembrane receptor with GEMs is not predisposed by its TMD, but rather, it is mediated by the specific targeting signals residing in the individual protein itself (29Brown D.A. Lipid rafts, detergent-resistant membranes, and raft targeting signals.Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). For instance, conformational changes in the extracellular domain can affect the GEMs targeting of the T-cell adhesion protein CD2 (98); a 60-residue membrane-proximal sequence is reported to mediate the EGF receptor to the GEMs (99); and a membrane-proximal signal in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the T-cell co-receptor CD4 is required for association with the GEMs (85). In this study, because even minor changes in the extracellular portions of GP Ibβ and GP IX may cause nonexpression of the entire GP Ib-IX complex (6Li R. Emsley J. The organizing principle of the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30López J.A. Andrews R.K. Afshar-Kharghan V. Berndt M.C. Bernard-Soulier syndrome.Blood. 1998; 91: 4397-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we chose to start our investigation with the roles of the CTs and TMDs of GP Ibβ and GP IX. We sequentially mutated them by either truncation or swapping with the TMD of Trf, a known non-GEMs associating transmembrane protein (28Gosse J.A. Wagenknecht-Wiesner A. Holowka D. Baird B. Transmembrane sequences are determinants of immunoreceptor signaling.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to examine whether any of them play a role in mediating the localization of the GP Ib-IX complex to the GEMs. All constructs containing Ibβ and IX have been previously described (24Geng H. Xu G. Ran Y. López J.A. Peng Y. Platelet glycoprotein Ib β/IX mediates glycoprotein Ib α localization to membrane lipid domain critical for von Willebrand factor interaction at high shear.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21315-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The TMDs and the palmitoylation sites of both GP Ibβ (123WGALAAQLALLGLGLLHALLLVLLLC148-palm, 26 amino acids, βTC) and GP IX (136VALVAVAALGLALLAGLLC154-palm, 19 amino acids, IXTC) were replaced with the inverted and depalmitoylated human Trf receptor 1 TMD (88YGLYGIMFGILFFVIVAITGYA67IS65, 24 amino acids (accession no.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on the Trf TMD DNA sequence, the following four overlapping PCR primers were designed to replace the TMDs of GP Ibβ and GP IX. The underlined sequences are the Trf TMD coding or complementary sequences: sequence 1, ATAGCCCAAGTAGCCAATCATAAATCCAATCAAGAAAAAGACGATCACAGCAATAGTCCCATAGGCGATACTGCAGAGCGGGCCGGGAG (GP Ibβ overlapping forward primer); sequence 2, AGTATCGCCTATGGGACTATTGCTGTGATCGTCTTTTTCTTGATTGGATTTATGATTGGCTACTTGGGCTATCGCCTGCGGAGG (GP Ibβ overlapping reverse primer); sequence 3, ATAGCCCAAGTAGCCAATCATAAATCCAATCAAGAAAAAGACGATCACAGCAATAGTCCCATAGGCGATACTGTCCCACAAGACCC (IX overlapping forward primer); and sequence 4, AGTATCGCCTATGGGACTATTGCTGTGATCGTCTTTTTCTTGATTGGATTTATGATTGGCTACTTGGGCTATGCCACCACAGAGGC (IX overlapping reverse primer). Whenever overlapping PCR was performed, there were always two rounds of amplification involved. The first reaction was comprised of two PCRs with 1) a GP Ibβ or GP IX cDNA forward primer (5′ prime with start codon and restriction site) and the overlapping reverse primer, or 2) the overlapping forward primer and a GP Ibβ or GP IX cDNA reverse primer (3′ prime with stop codon and restriction site). The resulting two products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, mixed in an equal molar ratio, annealed, and extended with a high fidelity polymerase (Turbo Pfu; Stratagene) and then used as templates for the second round of reactions where the cDNA forward and reverse primers of the GP Ibβ or GP IX flanked with restriction sites were used to amplify and clone the Trf-TMD-swapped Ibβ and IX cDNAs into the PDX vector (31Peng Y.

To delete both of the CTs and the intramembrane proximal palmitoylation sites of GP Ibβ (βdel+C) and GP IX (IXdel+c), Turbo Pfu-driven PCRs were performed with specific primers complementary to the transmembrane sequences where two stop codons were introduced to the original palmitoylation cysteine sites to ensure translational stop. All of the TMD replacements and CT deletions mentioned were verified through sequencing. CHO cells expressing wild type and mutant GP Ib-IX complexes were generated and maintained as previously described (5Peng Y. Shrimpton C.N. Dong J.F. López J.A.

GP Ibα-positive cells were first incubated with GP Ibα-specific mouse monoclonal antibody SZ2 (Beckman Coulter) and then sorted by anti-mouse IgG conjugated magnetic beads (Invitrogen) (Table 1). The expression levels of GP Ibα in these cells were determined by flow cytometry with a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-GP Ibα antibody (Beckman Coulter), and their mean fluorescence intensities were normalized then normalized to the wild type cells. Standard errors were calculated from three independent experiments.TABLE 1Chinese hamster ovary cell lines used in this studyCell lineCharacteristicsαWTβWTIXWTWild typeαWTβWTIXdel+cCT truncated and depalmitoylatedαWTβdel+cIXWTαWTβdel+cIXdel+cαWTβWTIXTCSwapping with Trf TMDαWTβTCIXWTαWTβTCIXTC Open table in a new tab A detailed procedure has been described previously (24Geng H.

In brief, cells expressing the GP Ib-IX complex were lysed with 1% Brij 35 and then loaded to the top of a sucrose density gradient. After centrifugation at 34,000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge for 18 h at 4 °C, 12 equal fractions were taken from the top of the gradient and analyzed using an SDS-PAGE gel. GP Ibs were then detected by Western blotting with each respective antibody (24Geng H. Xu G. Ran Y. López J.A. Peng Y.

CHO cells expressing wild type and mutant GP Ib-IX complexes (2 × 106) were spun down at 3,000 rpm for 1 min and lysed with 1% Brij 35 for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were precleared with 50 μl of protein A/G beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. After removing the protein A/G beads by centrifugation, the samples were incubated overnight with 1 μg of anti-GP IX monoclonal SZ1 antibody (Beckman Coulter) (32López J.A. Li C.Q. Weisman S. Chambers M. The GP Ib-IX “complex-specific” monoclonal antibody SZ1 binds to a conformation-sensitive epitope on GP IX: implications for the target antigen of quinine/quinidine-dependent autoantibodies.Blood. 1995; 85: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then immunoprecipitated with protein A/G beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times, and the bound protein was eluted by boiling in 2× sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 4∼12% Novex® Tris-glycine gels (Life Technologies) under reducing conditions and transferred to PVDF for Western blotting and detection of GP Ibα and GP Ibβ. A detailed procedure has been described previously (31Peng Y. Berndt M.C. Cruz M.A. López J.A. The α1 helix-β13 strand spanning Leu214–Val229 of platelet glycoprotein Ibα facilitates the interaction with von Willebrand factor: evidence from characterization of the epitope of monoclonal antibody AP1.Blood. 2004; 104: 3971-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells were incubated on immobilized vWf (20 μg/ml) for 1 min in a parallel plate flow chamber and then perfused with TBS, 0.5% BSA (Sigma) at flow rates that generated wall shear stresses of 2.5, 10, or 20 dyn/cm2. The experiments were recorded in real time for 1 min, by a high speed digital camera (model Quantix; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) connected to an inverted stage microscope (Eclipse TE300; Nikon, Garden City, NY). The rolling velocity was defined as the distance a cell traveled during a defined period (μm/s). Each rolling experiment was performed three times, and the error bars were calculated from the mean rolling velocities of 100 cells in five different view fields. To investigate whether the CTs of GP Ibβ and GP IX play any roles in the localization of GP Ibα to the membrane GEMs, we generated stable CHO cell lines where wild type GP Ibα was co-transfected with either CT-truncated and depalmitoylated GP Ibβ (βdel+c), GP IX (IXdel+c), or both (βdel+cIXdel+c). To rule out the possibility that the transfection reagents change the nature of the membrane in the cells, we made stable cell lines instead of using a transient expression approach. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), when compared with the wild type GP Ibβ and GP IX co-transfected stable cell lines (αβWTIXWT), the CT truncation and depalmitoylation of either GP Ibβ (αβdel+cIXWT) or GP IX (αβWTIXdel+c) reduced GP Ibα expression by ∼20%. In contrast, dual truncation and depalmitoylation of GP Ibβ and GP IX (αβdel+cIXdel+c) resulted in a higher level of GP Ibα expression (∼25%; Fig. 1B). Upon extraction with 1% Brij 35, nearly identical distribution patterns of the GP Ib subunits from the sucrose gradient fractionation were seen in both the mutant and wild type cells (24Geng H. Xu G. Ran Y. López J.A. Peng Y. Platelet glycoprotein Ib β/IX mediates glycoprotein Ib α localization to membrane lipid domain critical for von Willebrand factor interaction at high shear.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21315-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All the GP Ib molecules are present in the low density GEM fractions (fractions No. 1–3), as identified by blotting the known GEM-associating caveolin (Fig. 1C) (24Geng H. Xu G. Ran Y. López J.A. Peng Y. Platelet glycoprotein Ib β/IX mediates glycoprotein Ib α localization to membrane lipid domain critical for von Willebrand factor interaction at high shear.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21315-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To test whether the mutations affect the formation of the GP Ib-IX complex, we lysed the cells with 1% Brij 35 and incubated the lysates with SZ1, an anti-GP IX specific antibody (32López J.A. Li C.Q. Weisman S. Chambers M. The GP Ib-IX “complex-specific” monoclonal antibody SZ1 binds to a conformation-sensitive epitope on GP IX: implications for the target antigen of quinine/quinidine-dependent autoantibodies.Blood. 1995; 85: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Du X.

Upon immunoprecipitation, we observed that all the GP Ib subunits can be detected in the precipitates of our αβIX-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). In contrast, only GP Ibβ can be detected in the βIX-expressing cells, validating previous findings that GP Ibβ and GP IX are tightly associated (10Mo X. Nguyen N.X. McEwan P.A. Zheng X. López J.A. Emsley J. Li R. Binding of platelet glycoprotein Ibβ through the convex surface of leucine-rich repeats domain of glycoprotein IX.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 1533-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Kabral A. Zola H. Fournier D. Castaldi P.A. Purification and preliminary characterization of the glycoprotein Ib complex in the human platelet membrane.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data not only clearly demonstrate that the structural segment possessing the GEM-targeting signal does not reside in the CTs of GP Ibβ and GP IX but also further supports our previous finding that the association of the GP Ib-IX complexes with the GEMs is not predisposed by the palmitoylation state of either GP Ibβ or GP IX. To investigate whether the TMDs and/or which TMD of GP Ibβ and GP IX plays a role in partitioning the GP Ib-IX complex into the GEMs, we replaced the TMDs of GP Ibβ and GP IX with that of Trf, a known non-GEMs associating transmembrane protein. Previous studies have shown that upon replacement of the TMD with Trf TMD, IgE receptor function was abolished because of a segregation of the host molecule from the GEMs (28Gosse J.A. Wagenknecht-Wiesner A. Holowka D. Baird B. Transmembrane sequences are determinants of immunoreceptor signaling.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because the Trf is a type II transmembrane protein, whereas GP Ibβ and GP IX are type I transmembrane proteins, we inserted an inverted Trf TMD sequence into both, such that the orientation of the Trf TMD across the plasma membrane is the same as its normal orientation in the Trf receptor. Moreover, it was shown that Cys68 can be palmitoylated, another piece of evidence demonstrating that palmitoylation itself does not predispose the host protein to associate with the GEMs. To prevent obscuring the interpretation, we also mutate this cysteine to an alanine (Cys68 to Ala68). After sorting, we found that the individual swapping of the TMD of either GP Ibβ (αβTCIXWT) or GP IX (αβWTIXTC) greatly reduced the expression of GP Ibα to a level ∼60% of that in the wild type cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that the TMDs of both GP Ibβ and GP IX contribute to the expression of GP Ibα. When both of the TMDs were replaced (αβTCIXTC), the GP Ibα expression level was ∼16% of that in the wild type cells (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W994055860,"During S-phase replication forks can stall at specific genetic loci. At some loci, the stalling events depend on the replisome components Schizosaccharomyces pombe Swi1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tof1) and Swi3 (S. cerevisiae Csm3) as well as factors that bind DNA in a site-specific manner. Using a new genetic screen we identified Mrc1 (S. cerevisiae Mrc1/metazoan Claspin) as a replisome component involved in replication stalling. Mrc1 is known to form a sub-complex with Swi1 and Swi3 within the replisome and is required for the intra-S phase checkpoint activation. This discovery is surprising as several studies show that S. cerevisiae Mrc1 is not required for replication barrier activity. In contrast, we show that deletion of S. pombe mrc1 leads to an approximately three-fold reduction in barrier activity at several barriers and that Mrc1's role in replication fork stalling is independent of its role in checkpoint activation. Instead, S. pombe Mrc1 mediated fork stalling requires the presence of a functional copy of its phylogenetically conserved DNA binding domain. Interestingly, this domain is on the sequence level absent from S. cerevisiae Mrc1. Our study indicates that direct interactions between the eukaryotic replisome and the DNA are important for site-specific replication stalling."
https://openalex.org/W943978127,"Thraustochytrids are cosmopolitan osmotrophic or heterotrophic microorganisms that are considered as important decomposers in coastal ecosystems. However, because of a lack of estimation method for each genus or systematic group of them, relatively little is known about their ecology in situ. Previously, we reported two distinct types of virus infecting thraustochytrids (AuRNAV: reported as SssRNAV, and SmDNAV) suggesting they have wide distributions in the host-virus systems of coastal environments. Here we conducted a field survey from 2004 through 2005 to show the fluctuation pattern of thraustochytrids and their viruses in Hiroshima Bay, Japan. During the field survey, we monitored the dynamics of the two types of thraustochytrid-infecting virus: small viruses causing lysis of Aurantiochytrium sp. NIBH N1-27 (identified as AuRNAV) and the large viruses of Sicyoidochytrium minutum NBRC 102975 (similar to SmDNAV in physiology and morphology). Fluctuation patterns of the two distinct types of virus were different from each other. This may reflect the difference in the preference of organic substrates; i.e., it may be likely the host of AuRNAV (Aurantiochytrium sp.) increases utilizing algal dead bodies or feeble cells as the virus shows a large increase in abundance following raphidophyte blooms; whereas, the trophic nutrient supply for S. minutum may primarily depend on other constantly-supplied organic compounds because it did not show any significant change in abundance throughout the survey. Further study concerning the population composition of thraustochytrids and their viruses may demonstrate the microbial ecology (especially concerning the detrital food web) of marine environments."
https://openalex.org/W1567107593,"Oscillations between high and low values of the membrane potential (UP and DOWN states respectively) are an ubiquitous feature of cortical neurons during slow wave sleep and anesthesia. Nevertheless, a surprisingly small number of quantitative studies have been conducted only that deal with this phenomenon’s implications for computation. Here we present a novel theory that explains on a detailed mathematical level the computational benefits of UP states. The theory is based on random sampling by means of interspike intervals (ISIs) of the exponential integrate and fire (EIF) model neuron, such that each spike is considered a sample, whose analog value corresponds to the spike’s preceding ISI. As we show, the EIF’s exponential sodium current, that kicks in when balancing a noisy membrane potential around values close to the firing threshold, leads to a particularly simple, approximative relationship between the neuron’s ISI distribution and input current. Approximation quality depends on the frequency spectrum of the current and is improved upon increasing the voltage baseline towards threshold. Thus, the conceptually simpler leaky integrate and fire neuron that is missing such an additional current boost performs consistently worse than the EIF and does not improve when voltage baseline is increased. For the EIF in contrast, the presented mechanism is particularly effective in the high-conductance regime, which is a hallmark feature of UP-states. Our theoretical results are confirmed by accompanying simulations, which were conducted for input currents of varying spectral composition. Moreover, we provide analytical estimations of the range of ISI distributions the EIF neuron can sample from at a given approximation level. Such samples may be considered by any algorithmic procedure that is based on random sampling, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or message-passing methods. Finally, we explain how spike-based random sampling relates to existing computational theories about UP states during slow wave sleep and present possible extensions of the model in the context of spike-frequency adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1656767172,"In recent years it has become apparent that a Gaussian center bias can serve as an important prior for visual saliency detection, which has been demonstrated for predicting human eye fixations and salient object detection. Tseng et al. have shown that the photographer’s tendency to place interesting objects in the center is a likely cause for the center bias of eye fixations. We investigate the influence of the photographer’s center bias on salient object detection, extending our previous work. We show that the centroid locations of salient objects in photographs of Achanta and Liu’s data set in fact correlate strongly with a Gaussian model. This is an important insight, because it provides an empirical motivation and justification for the integration of such a center bias in salient object detection algorithms and helps to understand why Gaussian models are so effective. To assess the influence of the center bias on salient object detection, we integrate an explicit Gaussian center bias model into two state-of-the-art salient object detection algorithms. This way, first, we quantify the influence of the Gaussian center bias on pixel- and segment-based salient object detection. Second, we improve the performance in terms of F1 score, Fβ score, area under the recall-precision curve, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and hit-rate on the well-known data set by Achanta and Liu. Third, by debiasing Cheng et al.’s region contrast model, we exemplarily demonstrate that implicit center biases are partially responsible for the outstanding performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. Last but not least, we introduce a non-biased salient object detection method, which is of interest for applications in which the image data is not likely to have a photographer’s center bias (e.g., image data of surveillance cameras or autonomous robots)."
https://openalex.org/W1638204855,"Palaeobiogeographical and palaeodiversity patterns of scleractinian reef corals are generally biased due to uncertain taxonomy and a loss of taxonomic characters through dissolution and recrystallization of the skeletal aragonite in shallow marine limestones. Herein, we describe a fossil lobophylliid coral in mouldic preservation from the early middle Miocene Leitha Limestone of the Central Paratethys Sea (Vienna Basin, Austria). By using grey-scale image inversion and silicone rubber casts for the visualization of the original skeletal anatomy and the detection of distinct micromorphological characters (i.e. shape of septal teeth, granulation of septocostae) Parascolymia bracherti has been identified as a new species in spite of the dissolved skeleton. In the recent era, Parascolymia like all Lobophylliidae is restricted to the Indo-Pacific region, where it is represented by a single species. The new species proves the genus also in the Miocene Mediterranean reef coral province. A review of the spatio-temporal relationships of fossil corals related to Parascolymia indicates that the genus was probably rooted in the Eastern Atlantic‒Western Tethys region during the Paleocene to Eocene and reached the Indo-Pacific region not before the Oligocene. The revealed palaeobiogeographical pattern shows an obvious congruence with that of Acropora and tridacnine bivalves reflecting a gradual equatorwards retreat of the marine biodiversity center parallel to the Cenozoic climate deterioration."
