Dementia severity correlates with decreased synapse density in hippocampus and cortex. Although numerous studies show that soluble Aβ oligomers inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation, their role in long-term synaptic depression (LTD) remains unclear. Here, we report that soluble Aβ oligomers from several sources (synthetic, cell culture, human brain extracts) facilitated electrically evoked LTD in the CA1 region. Aβ-enhanced LTD was mediated by mGluR or NMDAR activity. Both forms of LTD were prevented by an extracellular glutamate scavenger system. Aβ-facilitated LTD was mimicked by the glutamate reuptake inhibitor TBOA, including a shared dependence on extracellular calcium levels and activation of PP2B and GSK-3 signaling. In accord, synaptic glutamate uptake was significantly decreased by soluble Aβ. We conclude that soluble Aβ oligomers perturb synaptic plasticity by altering glutamate recycling at the synapse and promoting synapse depression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by progressive memory and cognitive impairment and cerebral accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. Although the specific molecular initiators of AD remain unknown in most patients, extensive research suggests that the amyloid β protein (Aβ) plays an early and essential pathogenic role. Of note, dementia severity in AD correlates more strongly with cortical levels of soluble Aβ species than with insoluble amyloid plaque burden (Lue et al., 1999Lue L.F. Kuo Y.M. Roher A.E.

Experimentally, soluble Aβ oligomers have been specifically shown to block hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), an electrophysiological correlate of learning and memory (e.g., Lambert et al., 1998Lambert M.P.

In accord, impairment of synaptic plasticity can be detected in vivo before the formation of insoluble Aβ deposits in APP transgenic mouse models (e.g., Hsia et al., 1999Hsia A.Y. Masliah E.

A principal neuropathological finding in AD subjects is cortical atrophy associated with degeneration of neurites, decreased dendritic spine density, and frank neuronal loss (Terry et al., 1991Terry R.D.

Anatomical studies in normal rodents suggest that the induction of LTP is associated with spine formation and increased spine volume, whereas the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) results in decreased spine volume and spine elimination (Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M.

USA. 2008; 105: 3123-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similar to LTP, the induction of LTD in the CA1 region of hippocampus requires activation of NMDAR and/or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), depending on the stimulation protocol and recording conditions (Kemp and Bashir, 2001Kemp N.

Synaptic plasticity: multiple forms, functions, and mechanisms.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2008; 33: 18-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, synapse potentiation versus depression may ultimately depend on alterations in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the differential activation of certain kinases and phosphatases, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B [PP2B]) (reviewed in Kemp and Bashir, 2001Kemp N.

Although numerous reports describe the effects of soluble Aβ species on LTP, only a few studies have examined LTD induction, and they have yielded inconsistent results. For example, synthetic Aβ peptides were reported to facilitate LTD induction in an NMDAR-dependent manner in vivo (Kim et al., 2001Kim J.H. Anwyl R. Suh Y.H. Djamgoz M.B. Rowan M.J. Use-dependent effects of amyloidogenic fragments of (beta)-amyloid precursor protein on synaptic plasticity in rat hippocampus in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other studies found no effect on LTD in slices (Raymond et al., 2003Raymond C.R. Ireland D.R. Abraham W.C. NMDA receptor regulation by amyloid-beta does not account for its inhibition of LTP in rat hippocampus.Brain Res. 2003; 968: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2002Wang H.W.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6049-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We recently extracted buffer-soluble Aβ directly from the brains of typical AD patients and showed that this extract, which contains soluble Aβ dimers and trimers, facilitated LTD induction in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampus by an mGluR-dependent mechanism (Shankar et al., 2008Shankar G.M. Li S. Mehta T.H. Garcia-Munoz A. Shepardson N. Smith I. Brett F.M. Farrell M.A. Rowan M.J.

Med. 2008; 14: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2668) Google Scholar). Given that both NMDAR and mGluR activation have been implicated in the effects of Aβ on LTD, we asked whether glutamate clearance mechanisms are perturbed by Aβ. In addition to affecting synaptic plasticity, excitotoxic effects of glutamate are believed to contribute to progressive neuronal loss in AD (Pomara et al., 1992Pomara N. Singh R. Deptula D.

Timmerman W. Laskay G. Tóth B. Sasvári M. Kónya C. Sebens J.B. Korf J. Nyakas C. et al.beta-amyloid neurotoxicity is mediated by a glutamate-triggered excitotoxic cascade in rat nucleus basalis.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2735-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene expression and protein levels of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT1 and EAAT2) are altered in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of AD subjects (Jacob et al., 2007Jacob C.P. Koutsilieri E. Bartl J. Neuen-Jacob E. Arzberger T. Zander N. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P. Grünblatt E. Alterations in expression of glutamatergic transporters and receptors in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2007; 11: 97-116PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that small, soluble Aβ assemblies from several sources enhance synaptic depression through a mechanism involving altered glutamate uptake at hippocampal synapses. Our results have both mechanistic and therapeutic implications for the initiation of hippocampal synaptic failure in AD and in more subtle forms of age-related Aβ accumulation. Small, soluble Aβ assemblies have been obtained from a variety of sources, including synthetic peptides, cell culture medium, and human brain extracts (Lambert et al., 1998Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K.

Med. 2008; 14: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2668) Google Scholar). A common feature among the soluble Aβ preparations used in the current study is the presence of low-n assembly forms, i.e., Aβ oligomers that are slightly larger than the monomer but much smaller than amyloid fibrils. When examined on denaturing gels, these oligomers run principally as SDS-stable dimers and trimers (Figure 1A). We recently reported that soluble oligomers extracted directly from human (AD) cortex facilitate LTD induction through activation of mGluR when a subthreshold (300 pulses, 1 Hz) stimulation is applied to hippocampal slices (Shankar et al., 2008Shankar G.M. Li S. Mehta T.H. Garcia-Munoz A. Shepardson N. Smith I. Brett F.M. Farrell M.A. Rowan M.J.

Med. 2008; 14: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2668) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of LTD by soluble human Aβ, we first used cell-secreted Aβ species obtained from a CHO cell line that stably expresses hAPP with the V717F amyloidogenic AD mutation (7PA2 cells). These cells release readily detectable levels of monomeric and oligomeric Aβ species into the medium in the absence of insoluble aggregates (Podlisny et al., 1995Podlisny M.B. Ostaszewski B.L. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. Rydell R.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Aggregation of secreted amyloid beta-protein into sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable oligomers in cell culture.J. Biol.

Naturally secreted oligomers of amyloid beta protein potently inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation in vivo.Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). In accord with our recent work using soluble Aβ extracted from human cortex, we found that 7PA2 CM (but not the CM of untransfected [CHO-] cells) facilitated the induction of hippocampal LTD following a subthreshold, low-frequency stimulus (LFS) (300 pulses at 1 Hz) that otherwise does not induce LTD (79.7% ± 2.4%, n = 6, versus 93.4% ± 4.2%, n = 7, of baseline fEPSP slope; p < 0.05) (Figure 1B). We next sought to establish the effects of soluble Aβ on the expression of LTD using a standard LTD-inducing protocol known to be NMDAR dependent (Kemp and Bashir, 2001Kemp N. Bashir Z.I. Long-term depression: a cascade of induction and expression mechanisms.Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 339-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), namely, 900 pulses at 1 Hz. This form of LTD was equally inducible in slices perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) supplemented with 7PA2 CM or CHO- CM (73.6% ± 2.6%, n = 9, versus 77.1% ± 2.1%, n = 9; p > 0.05) (Figure 1C). Similar results were observed using synthetic Aβ1-42 (Figure 1D), soluble extracts of human AD cortex containing Aβ oligomers (Figure 1E), or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) fractions of 7PA2 CM enriched in either oligomers or monomers (Figures 1A, right panel, and Figure 1F). These data are consistent with previous reports that synthetic Aβ does not significantly change the magnitude of NMDAR-dependent (i.e., 900-pulse) LTD achieved in vitro (Raymond et al., 2003Raymond C.R. Ireland D.R. Abraham W.C. NMDA receptor regulation by amyloid-beta does not account for its inhibition of LTP in rat hippocampus.Brain Res. 2003; 968: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2002Wang H.W.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6049-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To probe the mechanism of Aβ-facilitated LTD, we used the nonselective group I/II mGluR antagonist MCPG (500 μM) and the NMDAR antagonist AP5 (50 μM). In agreement with our previous finding using soluble Aβ from AD cortex (Shankar et al., 2008Shankar G.M. Li S. Mehta T.H. Garcia-Munoz A. Shepardson N. Smith I. Brett F.M. Farrell M.A. Rowan M.J. Lemere C.A. et al.Soluble amyloid β-protein dimers isolated directly from Alzheimer disease patients potently impair synaptic plasticity and memory.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2668) Google Scholar), the facilitation of 300-pulse LTD by 7PA2 CM was dependent on activation of mGluR but not NMDAR, as the LTD was MCPG sensitive and AP5 resistant (93.2% ± 6.1%, n = 6, versus 80.4% ± 4.8%, n = 5; p < 0.05) (Figure 2A). Unlike the 300-pulse LTD, 900-pulse LTD induced in the presence of 7PA2 CM was not prevented by MCPG (78.5% ± 4.1%, n = 6, versus 73.6% ± 2.6%, n = 9; p > 0.05) (Figure 2B). Interestingly, 50 μM AP5 fully blocked 900-pulse LTD in slices exposed to CHO- CM but had no significant effect on the 900-pulse LTD in slices exposed to the Aβ-rich 7PA2 CM (100.6% ± 1.4%, n = 8, versus 75.4% ± 3.4%, n = 6; p < 0.01) (Figure 2C). This AP5 resistance noted with 7PA2 CM was also observed with soluble synthetic Aβ1-42 (see Figure S1A available online) and soluble extracts of AD cortex containing Aβ oligomers (Supp. Figure 1B; data quantified in Supp. Figure 1C). Furthermore, application of SEC fractions of 7PA2 CM revealed that the induction of AP5-resistant 900-pulse LTD was specific to Aβ oligomers, not monomers (Figures 2D and S1C). These results using three distinct sources of soluble low-n oligomers suggest that the LTD facilitated by Aβ oligomers is mechanistically different from conventional NMDAR-dependent LTD that is sensitive to 50 μM AP5. Because the 900-LFS protocol for inducing LTD in the CA1 region is well known to be NMDAR dependent (see Kemp and Bashir, 2001Kemp N. Bashir Z.I. Long-term depression: a cascade of induction and expression mechanisms.Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 339-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, and all control data in Figures 2C, 2D, and S1C), the resistance to AP5 of the LTD induced in the presence of the various soluble Aβ preparations was unexpected. It has been reported that synthetic Aβ can increase NMDAR activity by acting as an agonist or coagonist of NMDARs (Cowburn et al., 1997Cowburn R.F. Wiehager B. Trief E. Li-Li M. Sundström E. Effects of beta-amyloid-(25-35) peptides on radioligand binding to excitatory amino acid receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels: evidence for a selective affinity for the glutamate and glycine recognition sites of the NMDA receptor.Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 1437-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and increasing NMDA conductance (Wu et al., 1995Wu J. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. beta-Amyloid selectively augments NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in rat hippocampus.Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2409-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consequently, 50 μM AP5 may not have been sufficient to completely block an enhanced NMDAR activation mediated by Aβ oligomers. When we used a more potent isoform of AP5, D-AP5, and increased the concentration to 100 μM, the soluble Aβ-facilitated LTD was now significantly prevented (96.5% ± 3.4%, n = 5) (Figure 2E). Indeed, the block of Aβ-facilitated LTD was dependent on AP5 dose (Figure 2F). Rescuing LTD expression in the presence of 7PA2 CM required much higher AP5 concentrations than those needed to rescue LTD in the presence of CHO- CM (IC50: 17.4 versus 72.5 μM; p < 0.001), supporting the conclusion that active NMDARs are involved in LTD facilitation by soluble Aβ. Because Aβ oligomers enhanced LTD through activation of glutamate receptors, we asked whether this activity of soluble Aβ was dependent on extracellular glutamate concentration. To this end, we used an enzymatic glutamate scavenger system (glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [GPT] + pyruvate) to reduce extracellular glutamate levels (Overstreet et al., 1997Overstreet L.S.

Exposure of hippocampal slices to GPT alone (5 units/ml) had no effect on baseline synaptic activity (data not shown). GPT + pyruvate (2 mM) treatment 15 min prior to the application of CHO- CM or 7PA2 CM affected neither baseline activity nor the magnitude of LTD induced by 900-LFS (CHO-: 82.6% ± 2.1%, n = 5; 7PA2: 81.8% ± 4.5%, n = 5) (Figure 3A); however, the LTD induced in the presence of Aβ and GPT could now be blocked by 50 μM AP5 (95.1% ± 3.6%, n = 5) (Figure 3B). This result suggests that elevated extracellular glutamate concentrations contribute to the enhancement of LTD by soluble Aβ. Similarly, treatment with the GPT + pyruvate also prevented the 300-LFS Aβ-induced LTD (94.4% ± 2.8%, n = 5) (Figure 3C). We conclude that the enhancement of LTD by soluble Aβ in both mGluR-dependent and NMDAR-dependent conditions involves elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) reveals whether alterations of synaptic transmission are presynaptic. To assess whether soluble Aβ oligomers increase extracellular glutamate levels by affecting presynaptic release probability, we measured PPF in slices exposed to CHO- CM, 7PA2 CM, or 7PA2 CM + AP5 (50 μM) at baseline, 30 min after these exposures, and then 50 min after a 900-pulse LTD induction. PPF was not significantly different between these three conditions (Figure 3D). To establish further that soluble Aβ does not alter presynaptic release, we performed whole-cell recordings of pyramidal cells and found that PPF ratios before and 30 min after 7PA2 CM exposure were not significantly different (Figure 3E). The experiments described so far suggest that the facilitation of LTD by soluble oligomeric Aβ involves elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, but not by altering presynaptic release probability. We next sought to determine more precisely the basis of soluble Aβ-mediated alterations in glutamatergic transmission through whole-cell recordings. AMPAR-mediated currents (AMPA-EPSC) and NMDAR-mediated currents (NMDA-EPSC) were recorded from pyramidal neurons in slices treated with CHO- CM or 7PA2 CM (Figure 4A1). Both currents were significantly reduced by the soluble Aβ-rich 7PA2 CM compared to the CHO- CM (AMPA 67% ± 4%, n = 18, p < 0.001; NMDA 79% ± 3%, n = 13, p < 0.01) (Figure 4A2). This result was unexpected, as the increased extracellular glutamate concentrations observed above should increase AMPA and/or NMDA currents. However, the result could be explained if the Aβ-mediated rise in glutamate levels leads to receptor desensitization. To address this possibility, we applied a well-characterized inhibitor of AMPAR desensitization, cyclothiazide (CTZ, 100 μM), to the slices before exposure to 7PA2 CM; the AMPA EPSC was no longer significantly decreased (CHO- CM: 115 ± 14 pA versus 7PA2 CM + CTZ: 96 ± 3 pA, n = 10; p > 0.05) (Figure 4A2). Interestingly, we observed spiking activity escaping voltage clamp in 6/10 cells recorded in the 7PA2 CM + CTZ condition (Figures S2A and S2B) but not in the CTZ-only condition (three cells; data not shown), further suggesting alterations in excitatory transmission due to supraphysiologic levels of extracellular glutamate in the presence of soluble Aβ. To assess whether AMPAR desensitization is involved in the induction of LTD by soluble Aβ, CTZ was applied to brain slices, and 900-pulse LTD was induced; the LTDs were not significantly different in CHO- versus 7PA2 CM (Figure S2C), suggesting that AMPAR desensitization is not required for the LTD induction. To preserve the neuronal glutamate uptake expected under normal physiological function, we repeated the single-cell recordings at −70 mV rather than at positive potentials (Grewer and Rauen, 2005Grewer C.

Pax7 is required only up to the juvenile period when progenitor cells transition into quiescence.

The myogenic determinant Pax7 is thought to have a critical role in adult muscle stem cells (satellite cells), but a formal demonstration has been lacking in vivo. Here it is shown that, unexpectedly, when Pax7 is inactivated in adult mice, mutant satellite cells are not compromised in muscle regeneration. Multiple time points of gene inactivation reveal that Pax7 is only required up to the juvenile period, indicating an age-dependent change in the genetic requirement for muscle stem cells. Myogenic potential, survival and expansion of mammalian muscle progenitors depend on the myogenic determinants Pax3 and Pax7 embryonically1, and Pax7 alone perinatally2,3,4,5. Several in vitro studies support the critical role of Pax7 in these functions of adult muscle stem cells5,6,7,8 (satellite cells), but a formal demonstration has been lacking in vivo. Here we show, through the application of inducible Cre/loxP lineage tracing9 and conditional gene inactivation to the tibialis anterior muscle regeneration paradigm, that, unexpectedly, when Pax7 is inactivated in adult mice, mutant satellite cells are not compromised in muscle regeneration, they can proliferate and reoccupy the sublaminal satellite niche, and they are able to support further regenerative processes. Dual adult inactivation of Pax3 and Pax7 also results in normal muscle regeneration. Multiple time points of gene inactivation reveal that Pax7 is only required up to the juvenile period when progenitor cells make the transition into quiescence. Furthermore, we demonstrate a cell-intrinsic difference between neonatal progenitor and adult satellite cells in their Pax7-dependency.

The functional properties of cortical circuits play a critical role in the central representations of sensory stimuli. However, the synaptic mechanisms governing stimulus-selective spike output in sensory cortices are still debated. Broadly tuned (lateral) inhibition is a fundamental physiological mechanism often proposed to sharpen responses to preferred stimuli, primarily by counteracting weak, nonpreferred excitatory input (Hartline et al., 1956Hartline H.K.

Surprisingly, intracellular studies in visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortex find that synaptic excitation and inhibition are cotuned to the same stimuli and inhibition elicited by nonpreferred stimuli is often weak (Anderson et al., 2000Anderson J.S.

Although the initial steps underlying the processing of olfactory information are beginning to be revealed, how olfactory information is represented in the cortex is not well established. In rodents, olfactory information is initially processed in the olfactory bulb, where olfactory sensory neurons expressing one of ∼1000 different types of odorant receptors map onto ∼1800 glomeruli (Mombaerts et al., 1996Mombaerts P.

Visualizing an olfactory sensory map.Cell. 1996; 87: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Within each glomerulus, 50–100 mitral and tufted (M/T) cells receive input from sensory neurons expressing a unique type of odorant receptor, and M/T cells are thought to represent particular odorant molecular features (Rubin and Katz, 1999Rubin B.D.

However, odor perception ultimately requires the integration of M/T cell activity in higher cortical brain regions, and the synaptic mechanisms underlying cortical odor representations are unknown. In this study, we explore the mechanisms governing odor representations in the anterior piriform cortex, a three-layered cortical region that plays a critical role in odor discrimination, recognition, and memory (Neville and Haberly, 2004Neville K.R. Haberly L.B. Olfactory Cortex.Fifth Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2004Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 2006Wilson D.A. Kadohisa M. Fletcher M.L. Cortical contributions to olfaction: plasticity and perception.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal cells in anterior piriform cortex receive direct sensory input from M/T cell axons via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), excitatory inputs from other cortical neurons, and inhibition via local GABAergic circuits (Figure 1A; Neville and Haberly, 2004Neville K.R. Haberly L.B. Olfactory Cortex.Fifth Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2004Google Scholar). Individual L2/3 pyramidal cells likely receive converging input from M/T cells belonging to different glomeruli (Franks and Isaacson, 2006Franks K.M. Isaacson J.S.

Consistent with this idea, histochemical and extracellular studies suggest that individual odors can activate spatially distributed ensembles of neurons, and individual neurons may respond to multiple odors (Illig and Haberly, 2003Illig K.R.

Here we use in vivo cell-attached and whole-cell recordings to reveal how excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input govern odor representations in L2/3 cells of rat primary olfactory cortex. We show that odor-evoked firing activity is sparse and distributed across the cortical neuron population. We find that unbalanced synaptic excitation and inhibition underlie sparse odor representations. Across the cortical population, odor-evoked inhibition is widespread while excitation is less common. In individual cells, excitation is odor-specific and inhibition is nonselective. We show that this “global” inhibition likely arises from local interneurons that receive broadly tuned excitation. We also find that odors evoke fast beta-frequency (15–30 Hz) oscillations in synaptic activity. Oscillating excitation precedes inhibition, generating a brief (∼10 ms) temporal window that restricts spike timing. Together, these results reveal that global inhibition and oscillatory synaptic inputs govern the tuning and timing of odor-evoked activity in olfactory cortex. We first investigated odor representations in vivo using cell-attached recordings of action potentials (APs) from anterior piriform cortex L2/3 neurons in urethane-anesthetized, freely breathing rats (n = 59). This recording method provides exceptional isolation of single units and is not biased toward the sampling of active or responsive cells (Hromadka et al., 2008Hromadka T. Deweese M.R. Zador A.M.

Cell-attached recordings revealed low spontaneous firing rates of L2/3 cells (Figures 1B and 1C1; median 0.28 Hz, mean 0.73 ± 0.08 Hz, n = 177 cells) and APs were frequently time-locked to the ∼2 Hz respiratory rhythm (Buonviso et al., 2006Buonviso N.

Results from a large set of individually sampled neurons (n = 177) were used to infer the distribution of odor-evoked firing activity across the cortical population. In order to determine how individual stimuli are represented by the cortical population, we sampled responses to a small, fixed odor set rather than searching for the optimal stimulus for a particular neuron. We tested four monomolecular odors (5% saturated vapor [SV]) with unique and distinct structures and perceptual qualities: cineole (ether, eucalyptus), amyl acetate (ester, banana), R-limonene (terpene, citrus), and phenylethyl alcohol (alcohol, floral). For each odor tested in every cell (odor-cell pair), we used both changes in mean firing rate and the reliability of firing across trials to categorize activity as odor-evoked or nonresponsive (see Experimental Procedures). Although we observed clear odor-evoked suppression of APs in some cells (n = 9 cells, data not shown), the low spontaneous firing rate precluded accurate classification of inhibitory responses. We first determined the odor selectivity of individual cells, as well as the population response to each individual odor. In other words, we tested the number of odors each cell responded to, and the number of cells each odor can activate. For cells with odor-evoked responses (55/177), most (42/55) fired selectively to only one of the four odors (Figure 1C2). In terms of the population response, each odor evoked activity in ∼10% of tested cells (Figure 1C3), indicating that the different odors elicited spikes in relatively small fractions of the cortical population. Interestingly, despite their structural diversity, each unique odor activated very similar fractions (range 9%–11%) of the cortical population. To better understand the distribution of odor-evoked activity in olfactory cortex, we explored the intensity of stimulus-evoked responses. For responsive odor-cell pairs, the average increase in firing rate during the odor stimulus (2 s) was 2.01 ± 0.04 Hz (Figure 1C1; range 0.05–24.5 Hz; median: 0.83 Hz, n = 72 odor-cell pairs). Strong responses were rarely observed: only 19% of responses exceeded 5 Hz and very few (6%) exceeded 10 Hz (Figure 1C1). Evoked APs were coupled strongly to the respiratory rhythm (Figures 1B and S1), and on average odors evoked only an additional 1.6 ± 0.04 spikes (median: 0.6 AP) above baseline during each respiratory cycle throughout the odor stimulus (Figure 1C4). Thus, odor responses consisted of weak increases in firing rate in the majority of responsive cells, while a small fraction of neurons fired more strongly. In addition to quantifying odor selectivity and the population response in terms of odor-cell pairs that were categorized as odor-evoked or nonresponsive, we also used statistical measures calculated from raw firing rate distributions (Rolls and Tovee, 1995Rolls E.T. Tovee M.J. Sparseness of the neuronal representation of stimuli in the primate temporal visual cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 713-726PubMed Google Scholar, Willmore and Tolhurst, 2001Willmore B. Tolhurst D.J. Characterizing the sparseness of neural codes.Network. 2001; 12: 255-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This provides a description of odor-evoked activity without relying on binary categorization of responses. Lifetime sparseness (SL, range 0 to1 = highly selective), a measure of how an individual cell responds to multiple stimuli (see Experimental Procedures), indicated that cells responded selectively (SL mean = 0.88 ± 0.002, median = 1, n = 177 cells). Population sparseness (Sp, range 0 to 1 = most sparse), a measure of how an individual stimulus is represented across a population, was also high (mean Sp = 0.93, range 0.90–0.96). Taken together, our results indicate that odor representations are sparse in olfactory cortex. What governs the sparse population response of L2/3 cells? To address this question, we used in vivo whole-cell recording (Margrie et al., 2002Margrie T.W. Brecht M. Sakmann B. In vivo, low-resistance, whole-cell recordings from neurons in the anaesthetized and awake mammalian brain.Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) to examine the synaptic input underlying spike output in an additional set of L2/3 cells (n = 52). Following cell-attached recording of APs (Figure 2A), excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively) were recorded in voltage-clamp mode in each cell (Figure 2B). EPSCs were recorded at −80 mV, the reversal potential for inhibition set by our internal solution (chloride reversal potential [ECl] = −80 mV). Similarly, IPSCs were recorded at the reversal potential for excitation (∼+10 mV). In the absence of applied odors, cells received barrages of spontaneous EPSCs (77 ± 12 Hz) and IPSCs (57 ± 10 Hz, n = 12 representative cells, data not shown), and odors evoked synaptic currents that were coupled to the respiration cycle (Figures 2B and S1). We first examined synaptic responses categorically and determined responsiveness (the presence or absence of odor-evoked activity) for each odor-cell pair from the increase in charge transfer during odor presentation (see Experimental Procedures). We first compared the fractions of cells in this population that responded to the different odors with APs, EPSCs, and IPSCs. Each of the different odors elicited responses in similar fractions of cells (Figure 2C). We estimated population sparseness from the fraction of cells responsive to each odor averaged over all odors. While cells with odor-evoked APs were rarely observed (8.3% ± 0.5% of the population), odor-evoked excitation was more common (22.7% ± 1.5%) and inhibition was remarkably widespread (51.8% ± 2.2%, Figure 2C). Furthermore, Sp calculated from unthresholded synaptic charge measurements during odor presentation indicated that excitatory synaptic responses (Sp = 0.72 ± 0.03) were significantly sparser than inhibition (Sp = 0.56 ± 0.02, p = 0.006). These results suggest that across the cortical population, ubiquitous odor-evoked inhibition contributes to firing activity that is more sparsely distributed than synaptic excitation. We further explored whether inhibition contributes to sparse odor-evoked firing activity by blocking fast synaptic inhibition with the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (SR-95531). However, local cortical superfusion of gabazine (20–100 μM) led to epileptic activity evident as ictal bursts (∼1 Hz) of spikes in cell-attached recordings (n = 10). Once epileptic events began, odor-evoked activity was lost and spikes became decoupled from respiration. Nonetheless, in two experiments we observed a broadening in the odor tuning of firing activity in the presence of gabazine before the cortex became epileptic (under control conditions the two cells fired in response to only one of four odors versus two and three odors in the presence of drug; data not shown). We next considered the odor selectivity of synaptic excitation and inhibition in individual cells. Although cells with odor-evoked EPSCs were more common than APs (Figure 2C), EPSCs were selectively evoked by only one out of four odors in the majority of cells (60%, Figure 2D). Strikingly, inhibition was recruited nonselectively; in 66% of cells that received inhibition, it was evoked by three or all four odors (Figure 2D). Together, these findings suggest that inhibition is global in olfactory cortex, i.e., odors evoke widespread inhibition across the population, and inhibition within an individual cell is broadly tuned to odors. If inhibition were truly global in olfactory cortex, we would predict that the relative strength of inhibition evoked by different odors would be more uniform than excitation in individual cells. To address this, we examined the relative strength of excitation and inhibition in all cells that fired APs in response to odors (n = 13). Excitation (EPSC charge) elicited by each odor was normalized to the largest odor-evoked excitatory response in each cell. Inhibition (IPSC charge) was normalized similarly. Responses in each cell were then ranked from the odor that produced the weakest excitation to the odor that produced the strongest and averaged across cells (Figure 2E1). As we hypothesized for global inhibition, the strength of excitatory responses was graded, while the strength of inhibition was uniform across odors (Figure 2E1). Differing amounts of excitation and uniform inhibition imply that odors trigger APs based on the strength of excitation rather than odor-specific inhibition. Indeed, odors that elicited APs (preferred odors) also evoked greater excitation (average EPSC charge: 46.5 ± 1.5 pC) than those that failed to produce spikes (nonpreferred odors, 16.9 ± 0.7 pC, p = 0.002) in the same cells (Figure 2E2). In contrast, preferred and nonpreferred odors evoked identical amounts of inhibition (Figure 2E2; average IPSC charge: 78.6 ± 3.7 pC and 77.3 ± 1.7 pC, respectively, p = 0.81). Together, these results suggest that odor-evoked excitation must be strong enough to overcome global inhibition to generate APs in olfactory cortex. To verify that our observations were not specific to our panel of test odors, we studied an additional set of cells (n = 34 cells) using double the number of odors. We observed the same relative relationships in the selectivity (Figure 3A1) and population responses (Figure 3A2) of odor-evoked activity, i.e., APs were evoked sparsely and selectively, synaptic excitation was more common but specific, and inhibition was widespread and most broadly tuned. In a subset of these cells, we also examined the relationship between synaptic excitation and inhibition across a range of odor intensities. We varied odor concentration for cells that responded with excitation to multiple odors at our standard concentration of 5% SV. We found that odors were much more likely to evoke inhibition compared to excitation across a range of concentrations (0.25%–10% SV). Reducing odor concentration from 5% to 2% SV led to a loss of excitatory responses to some odors while inhibitory responses to the same odors remained (Figures 3B and 3C; n = 9 cells). Indeed, as odor intensity was reduced further, odor-evoked inhibition could be observed in the absence of excitation (Figure 3C). Furthermore, when normalized to the maximal synaptic responses we recorded at 10% SV, the relative amplitudes (charge) of inhibition at low odor concentrations were greater than those of excitation (Figure 3D). Thus, inhibition is preferentially recruited across a wide range of odor intensities. Together, these results provide strong evidence that global inhibition is a fundamental property of olfactory cortical circuits. What accounts for global inhibition in olfactory cortex? One possibility is that, unlike principal cells, the local interneurons underlying inhibition receive widespread and broadly tuned excitation. To address this question, we filled cells with biocytin during whole-cell recording for post hoc classification. Interneurons were targeted by recording from cells in layer 1 (Neville and Haberly, 2004Neville K.R. Haberly L.B. Olfactory Cortex.Fifth Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2004Google Scholar). Indeed, synaptic excitation was largely nonselective in morphologically identified interneurons (Figures 4A1 and 4A2; n = 18 cells), while identified pyramidal cells received selective excitation (Figures 4B1 and 4B2; n = 27 cells) similar to results from our larger L2/3 population. On average, individual odors evoked excitation in a greater fraction of interneurons compared to pyramidal cells (Figures 4A3 and 4B3; interneurons: 50% ± 3.9%; pyramidal cells: 11% ± 2.3%, p = 0.003) and inhibition was recruited similarly in both cell types (p = 0.2). These findings suggest that nonselective odor-evoked excitation of local interneurons could underlie global inhibition. One mechanism that could lead to broadly tuned excitation onto interneurons is the receipt of a higher convergence of olfactory bulb M/T cell inputs than pyramidal cells. We examined this possibility in vivo by placing a stimulating electrode in the LOT to directly activate M/T cell axons and recording LOT-evoked responses in L2/3 cells (Figure 5A). At high stimulus intensities, LOT stimulation evoked monosynaptic EPSCs (Figure 5B1) at a holding potential of −80 mV. We then lowered stimulus strength to reduce the number of recruited axons such that stimulation failed to evoke EPSCs (Figure 5B2). Changing the membrane potential to +10 mV revealed LOT-evoked IPSCs at the same stimulus intensity that failed to evoke EPSCs (Figure 5B3). Subsequent application of the glutamate receptor antagonist NBQX (500 μM) to the cortical surface abolished the IPSCs, indicating that they were evoked disynaptically (Figure 5B3). The onset times of IPSCs evoked with this “minimal” stimulation lagged behind monosynaptic EPSCs in the same cells (Figure 5C), further confirming their disynaptic nature (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001Pouille F. Scanziani M. Enforcement of temporal fidelity in pyramidal cells by somatic feed-forward inhibition.Science. 2001; 293: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Disynaptic IPSCs could routinely be recruited in the absence of LOT-evoked EPSCs (Figure 5D, n = 5). These experiments suggest that interneurons governing inhibition in olfactory cortex receive a higher convergence of M/T cell input than pyramidal cells. In sensory cortices receiving balanced excitation and inhibition, excitation precedes inhibition in response to brief impulse-like stimuli. This difference in the relative timing of excitation and inhibition is proposed to shape stimulus selectivity and precisely timed spike output (Priebe and Ferster, 2008Priebe N.J. Ferster D.

Spatial and temporal distribution of odorant-evoked activity in the piriform cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the temporal relationship between odor-evoked excitation and inhibition could account for the timing of respiratory-coupled APs (Figure 6A1). However, aligning odor-evoked synaptic currents to the respiratory rhythm revealed that inhibition and excitation were temporally overlapping (Figures 6A and 6B; n = 12 cells), and we could not resolve an obvious relationship between synaptic inputs and spikes times. What then determines spike timing during slow, respiratory-coupled barrages of synaptic activity? Synchronized activity of ensembles of neurons is known to generate odor-evoked oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) and phase-locked APs in higher olfactory centers of vertebrates and invertebrates (Adrian, 1942Adrian E.D.

https://openalex.org/W2048391838,"Genome-wide copy number analyses of human cancers identified a frequent 5p13 amplification in several solid tumour types, including lung (56%), ovarian (38%), breast (32%), prostate (37%) and melanoma (32%). Here, using integrative analysis of a genomic profile of the region, we identify a Golgi protein, GOLPH3, as a candidate targeted for amplification. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo validated GOLPH3 as a potent oncogene. Physically, GOLPH3 localizes to the trans-Golgi network and interacts with components of the retromer complex, which in yeast has been linked to target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling. Mechanistically, GOLPH3 regulates cell size, enhances growth-factor-induced mTOR (also known as FRAP1) signalling in human cancer cells, and alters the response to an mTOR inhibitor in vivo. Thus, genomic and genetic, biological, functional and biochemical data in yeast and humans establishes GOLPH3 as a new oncogene that is commonly targeted for amplification in human cancer, and is capable of modulating the response to rapamycin, a cancer drug in clinical use. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascade is an important cellular signalling pathway that is active in nearly all cancers, and is therefore a prime focus of research into cancer therapeutics. A genome-wide screen has now identified a previously unknown oncogene, GOLPH3, as the target for activation by a region of amplification on chromosome 5p13 that is associated with various solid tumours. GOLPH3 protein localizes to the Golgi network and its overexpression stimulates S6 ribosomal kinase 1, which is activated by mTOR, part of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascade and a target for the antitumour drug rapamycin. GOLPH3 oncoprotein confers increased sensitivity to rapamycin in preclinical settings, raising the possibility that it may act as a biomarker for sensitivity to rapamycin. A genome-wide screen has identified a frequent region of amplification on chromosome 5p13 in a number of cancer types. Functional studies now identify a protein localized to the Golgi apparatus, GOLPH3, as a novel oncogene affected by this amplification which can transform cells in vitro and lead to tumour formation in vivo. GOLPH3 overexpression activates the mTOR signalling pathway and renders cancer cells sensitive to the drug rapamycin."
https://openalex.org/W2002094413,"In addition to its essential role in permitting mitochondrial import and oxidation of long chain fatty acids, carnitine also functions as an acyl group acceptor that facilitates mitochondrial export of excess carbons in the form of acylcarnitines. Recent evidence suggests carnitine requirements increase under conditions of sustained metabolic stress. Accordingly, we hypothesized that carnitine insufficiency might contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-related impairments in glucose tolerance. Consistent with this prediction whole body carnitine dimunition was identified as a common feature of insulin-resistant states such as advanced age, genetic diabetes, and diet-induced obesity. In rodents fed a lifelong (12 month) high fat diet, compromised carnitine status corresponded with increased skeletal muscle accumulation of acylcarnitine esters and diminished hepatic expression of carnitine biosynthetic genes. Diminished carnitine reserves in muscle of obese rats was accompanied by marked perturbations in mitochondrial fuel metabolism, including low rates of complete fatty acid oxidation, elevated incomplete β-oxidation, and impaired substrate switching from fatty acid to pyruvate. These mitochondrial abnormalities were reversed by 8 weeks of oral carnitine supplementation, in concert with increased tissue efflux and urinary excretion of acetylcarnitine and improvement of whole body glucose tolerance. Acetylcarnitine is produced by the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT). A role for this enzyme in combating glucose intolerance was further supported by the finding that CrAT overexpression in primary human skeletal myocytes increased glucose uptake and attenuated lipid-induced suppression of glucose oxidation. These results implicate carnitine insufficiency and reduced CrAT activity as reversible components of the metabolic syndrome.

Disturbances in mitochondrial genesis, morphology, and function are increasingly recognized as components of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (1Kelley D.E. Goodpaster B. Wing R.R.

Still unclear is whether poor mitochondrial performance is a predisposing factor or a consequence of the disease process. The latter view is supported by recent animal studies linking diet-induced insulin resistance to a dysregulated mitochondrial phenotype in skeletal muscle, marked by excessive β-oxidation, impaired substrate switching during the fasted to fed transition, and coincident reduction of organic acid intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (4Koves T.R. Li P. An J. Akimoto T. Slentz D. Ilkayeva O. Dohm G.L. Yan Z. Newgard C.B. Muoio D.M. J. Biol.

In these studies, both diet-induced and genetic forms of insulin resistance were specifically linked to high rates of incomplete fat oxidation and intramuscular accumulation of fatty acylcarnitines, byproducts of lipid catabolism that are produced under conditions of metabolic stress (5Koves T.R.

Most compelling, we showed that genetically engineered inhibition of fat oxidation lowered intramuscular acylcarnitine levels and preserved glucose tolerance in mice fed a high fat diet (5Koves T.R.

In aggregate, the findings established a strong connection between mitochondrial bioenergetics and insulin action while raising new questions regarding the roles of incomplete β-oxidation and acylcarnitines as potential biomarkers and/or mediators of metabolic disease. In another recent investigation we found that oral carnitine supplementation improved insulin sensitivity in diabetic mice, in parallel with a marked rise in plasma acylcarnitines (8Power R.A.

This occurred in three distinct models of glucose intolerance; aging, genetic diabetes, and high fat feeding (8Power R.A. Hulver M.W. Zhang J.Y. Dubois J. Marchand R.M. Ilkayeva O. Muoio D.M. Mynatt R.L. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The antidiabetic actions of carnitine were accompanied by an increase in whole body glucose oxidation, a surprising result given that carnitine is best known for its essential role in permitting mitochondrial translocation and oxidation of long chain acyl-CoAs.

The long chain acylcarnitine (LCAC) product of CPT1 traverses the inner membrane via carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) and is then delivered to CPT2, which regenerates acyl-CoA on the matrix side of the membrane where β-oxidation occurs. Notably, however, in addition to its requisite role in fatty acid oxidation, carnitine also facilitates mitochondrial efflux of excess carbon fuels. Thus, in the event that rates of substrate catabolism exceed energy demand, accumulating acyl-CoA intermediates are converted back to acylcarnitines, which can then exit the organelle and the tissue. This aspect of carnitine function has remained relatively understudied. -2,carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1 and 2 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor long-chain acylcarnitine carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase carnitine acetyltransferase high fat 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin acid-soluble metabolite pyruvate dehydrogenase cytomegalovirus adenovirus Zucker diabetic fatty standard chow -2,organic cation transporters 1 and 2 mass spectrometry tandem MS. -2,carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1 and 2 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor long-chain acylcarnitine carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase carnitine acetyltransferase high fat 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin acid-soluble metabolite pyruvate dehydrogenase cytomegalovirus adenovirus Zucker diabetic fatty standard chow -2,organic cation transporters 1 and 2 mass spectrometry tandem MS. The finding that carnitine supplementation improved glucose tolerance while increasing circulating acylcarnitines favors the interpretation that production and efflux of these metabolites is beneficial rather than detrimental (9Roe C.R. Hoppel C.L. Stacey T.E. Chalmers R.A. Tracey B.M. Millington D.S. Arch. Dis. Child. 1983; 58: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Arrigoni-Martelli E. Caso V. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 2001; 27: 27-49PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at present, we view these metabolites as biomarkers rather than mediators of metabolic dysfunction. Acylcarnitine accumulation in insulin-resistant skeletal muscles might reflect a failed attempt to combat “mitochondrial stress” and/or an impediment in tissue export; either of which could arise should availability of free carnitine become limiting. Fitting with this scenario, we postulated that carnitine insufficiency might contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. To address this possibility carnitine homeostasis was examined in rodent models of obesity, diabetes, and aging. Our results show that chronic metabolic stress does indeed compromise whole body carnitine status. Low carnitine levels in severely obese rats were associated with aberrant mitochondrial fuel metabolism, whereas oral carnitine supplementation reversed these perturbations in concert with improved glucose tolerance and increased acylcarnitine efflux. Complementary studies in primary human myocytes suggest that the therapeutic actions of carnitine are mediated in part through carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT), a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that promotes glucose disposal. These findings underscore the multifaceted roles of the carnitine shuttle system, not only in permitting β-oxidation but also for maintaining mitochondrial performance and glucose homeostasis in the face of energy surplus. Animal studies were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Wistar rats (n = 36) were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. Animals were randomly selected to receive either standard chow (7001, Harlan Teklad) or a 45% high fat (HF) diet (D12451; Research Diets) beginning at 3 months of age. After 10 months on HF diet, a subset of the animals (n = 6) were provided supplemental l-carnitine in their drinking water (300 mg/kg body weight/day), which was maintained until sacrifice at 15 months of age. Water consumption was monitored throughout the supplementation phase. On the day of sacrifice food was pulled 4 h prior to harvesting tissue, blood, and urine. Overnight fasted blood was collected from the tail vein into tubes containing EDTA (1.7 mg/ml). Glucose (2 g/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally, blood was collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post injection, and glucose was immediately analyzed in whole blood using a glucose oxidase method (BD Logic Analyzer, BD Medical, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Plasma was obtained for assessing insulin levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Linco Research, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Skeletal muscle mitochondria were prepared based on the procedure of Kerner et al. (11Kerner J. Turkaly P.J. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281: E1054-E1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Rat gastrocnemius muscles were removed under anesthesia and placed in ice cold KMEM buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4). The tissue was cleaned, blotted, weighed, finely minced, and suspended 10-fold diluted in KMEM plus 1 mm ATP. Twenty milliliters (2 g of tissue) of the homogenate was treated on ice with constant stirring for 10 min with protease (5 mg/g wet weight of tissue, Fluka 82518). The suspension was homogenized on ice using four passes with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The digestion was stopped by adding 20 ml of KMEM/ATP buffer supplemented with 0.2% BSA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of KMEM/ATP/BSA buffer and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through two layers of surgical gauze. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, then washed once in 10 ml of KMEM/ATP/BSA buffer, centrifuged, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube using 2 × 0.75 ml volumes of KME buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 3500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was resuspended in KME buffer and immediately used for oxidation assays. Substrate oxidation was assessed in isolated mitochondria using methods previously described (12Noland R.C. Thyfault J.P. Henes S.T. Whitfield B.R. Woodlief T.L. Evans J.R. Lust J.A. Britton S.L. Koch L.G. Dudek R.W. Dohm G.L. Cortright R.N. Lust R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Fatty acid oxidation was measured as the capture of 14CO2 and 14C-acid-soluble metabolites (ASMs) from [1-14C]oleate (100 μm) in the presence and absence of cold pyruvate (5 mm). Pyruvate oxidation was assessed by measuring 14CO2 production from [2-14C]pyruvate (5 mm) in the presence and absence of cold oleate (100 μm). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity was measured in the presence and absence of l-carnitine (5 mm) by capturing 14CO2 from [1-14C]pyruvate (5 mm). Mitochondrial function was assessed based on the methods of Kerner et al. (11Kerner J. Turkaly P.J. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281: E1054-E1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured in duplicate in a 0.5-ml chamber of an OxyTherm oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments, Scotland) at 30 °C in respiration medium consisting of 80 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, pH 7.0. Mitochondrial integrity of all samples was tested each day in a separate polarographic assay consisting of sequential addition of 2 mm ADP, 2.5 mm NADH, 3 μm reduced cytochrome c, and 0.1% deoxycholate to elicit maximal respiration (13Puchowicz M.A. Varnes M.E. Cohen B.H. Friedman N.R. Kerr D.S. Hoppel C.L. Mitochondrion. 2004; 4: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Respiration of NADH and cytochrome c were 4.0 ± 1.6% and 10.5 ± 3.8%, respectively, of detergent-permeabilized maximal respiration through complex IV indicating good intactness of the prepared mitochondria. Primary human skeletal myocytes were grown and differentiated as previously described (14Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Houmard J.A. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mature myotubes were lipid loaded with 1% BSA complexed with 1 mm 1:1 oleate:palmitate. After 24 h, cells were washed then maintained in medium containing l-carnitine (100–5000 μm) for an additional 24 h prior to collection of both cell lysates and medium for metabolic profiling. For gene overexpression studies, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven recombinant adenovirus containing Myc-tagged rat carnitine acetyltransferase (AdCMV-CrAT) was constructed as previously described (15Becker T.C.

A recombinant adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (AdCMV-β-gal) was used as the control. Adenoviruses were amplified and purified as previously described (15Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J.

On day 3 following differentiation human myotubes were treated with 2 × 109 P/cm2 purified AdCMV-CrAT or AdCMV-β-gal. Three days later cells were harvested for protein and metabolic profiling or used to assess rates of glucose oxidation as previously described (5Koves T.R. Ussher J.R. Noland R.C. Slentz D.

Subcellular localization of rCrAT was evaluated in C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) as this analysis required a large number of cells. Myoblasts were raised in growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 mg/ml gentamycin), treated with AdCMV-CrAT (2 × 109 P/cm2) upon reaching confluence, and harvested 72 h later by trypsinization. The cell suspension was transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube and spun at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and homogenized with a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer until 90% of cell membranes were disrupted. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, the supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice in mitochondrial isolation buffer, resuspended in CelLytic M buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich), and used as the purified mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. Free carnitine and acylcarnitines in tissues, plasma, and urine were quantified using tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling as previously described (7An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M.

Sequence-specific primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for rat/mouse carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT). Sequences were as follows: forward, 5′-GCAGCTGGCATACTACAGGATCT-3′; reverse, 5′- AGGTGAAACATGCGCAGAGA-3′; and probe, 5′-TGGGCAGGCGTGTGCCACGTATGA-3′. All other genes were assessed using predesigned/prevalidated FAM-labeled Assays-on-Demand and normalized using values from a duplexed reaction with VIC-labeled 18 S endogenous control gene (Applied Biosystems). Protein was isolated from rodent tissues and cell culture experiments using either radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), 2× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol, pH 6.8) or CelLytic (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins from tissue (25 μg) and cell culture lysates (10 μg) were separated on 10% Criterion gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose prior to blocking with 5% milk. Blots were probed using antibodies against CrAT (generously provided by Dr. Fausto Hegardt), citrate synthase (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX), γ-tubulin, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin G antibodies and ECL Plus chemiluminescence detection reagent with band intensity being quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). JMP software version 7.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to perform multivariate correlation analyses of metabolites measured in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and lean controls. Unsupervised clustering of the Pearson correlation matrix of all pairwise comparisons among individual metabolites was then used to generate the heat map in Fig. 1a. Other statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat (SysStat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA) or Microsoft Excel statistical package. Main effects of age and diet were detected by one-way or two-way analysis of variance using Tukey's post hoc analysis or Student's t test, as detailed in the figure legends. Within-group responses to experimental manipulations were evaluated using a paired t test, where appropriate. All data are presented as mean ± S.E., and the level of significance was established a priori at p ≤ 0.05. Interactions between skeletal muscle carnitine content and metabolic dysregulation shown in Fig. 1a were initially identified by multivariate correlation analysis using a metabolomics data set acquired from gastrocnemius muscles of genetically obese ZDF rats and lean controls (5Koves T.R. Ussher J.R. Noland R.C. Slentz D. Mosedale M. Ilkayeva O. Bain J. Stevens R. Dyck J.R. Newgard C.B. Lopaschuk G.D. Muoio D.M. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Unsupervised cluster analysis of all pairwise correlations revealed a “hot spot” (cluster 1) reflecting strong positive correlations between free carnitine (C0), several short chain acylcarnitines and amino acids, and a “cold spot” (cluster 3) reflecting negative associations between free carnitine and several LCAC (Fig. 1b). In addition, the LCAC content of muscle correlated positively (r2 = 0.56, p < 0.005) with LCAC levels in plasma (not shown). These data suggested that excessive production and export of LCAC in the obese and/or diabetic state might lead to carnitine decline. Because skeletal muscle sequesters an estimated 95% of whole body carnitine reserves (17Brass E.P. Clin. Ther. 1995; 17 (discussion 175): 176-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we proceeded to survey this tissue as an indicator of systemic carnitine status. Consistent with our prediction, free carnitine levels in mixed gastrocnemius were diminished in multiple rat models of insulin resistance; including ZDF rats (Fig. 1c), diet-induced obesity (Fig. 1d), and aging (Fig. 1e). We also evaluated two contrasting inbred rat strains that were artificially selected based on intrinsic endurance exercise capacity (18Koch L.G. Britton S.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As compared with the low endurance capacity strain, high capacity rats are protected against diet-induced glucose intolerance (12Noland R.C. Thyfault J.P. Henes S.T. Whitfield B.R. Woodlief T.L. Evans J.R. Lust J.A. Britton S.L. Koch L.G. Dudek R.W. Dohm G.L. Cortright R.N. Lust R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E31-E41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fig. 1f shows that high capacity rats maintained skeletal muscle levels of free carnitine when fed an HF diet, whereas levels in the low capacity runners fell below normal. Moreover, linear regression analysis in high versus low capacity rats revealed a significant negative correlation (r2 = 0.5115, p < 0.01) between intramuscular free carnitine levels and insulin resistance, as assessed by the homeostatic assessment model (Fig. 1g). In aggregate, Fig. 1 shows that carnitine homeostasis is compromised in several rodent models of metabolic dysregulation. We next sought to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this phenotype by examining whole body carnitine regulation in aging rats fed either a standard chow (SC) or HF diet for 1 year. Our experimental paradigm focused on the interaction between aging and overnutrition and was designed to recapitulate middle-aged onset of metabolic syndrome in obese humans. During development from adolescence to adulthood (2–5 months of age) free carnitine levels increased in the skeletal muscle, liver, and plasma (Fig. 2, a, b, and d, respectively). Conversely, carnitine content in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2a) tended to decrease between adulthood and advanced age (5–15 months). The HF diet exacerbated age-related carnitine loss, as levels fell in each of the tissues analyzed (skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney; Fig. 2, a, b, and c, respectively), although concentrations in plasma were unchanged (Fig. 2d). Neither aging nor the HF diet affected urinary carnitine excretion (Fig. 2e), arguing against a potential impairment in renal reabsorption. To determine whether carnitine supplementation could restore whole body carnitine reserves and improve metabolic outcomes, a subset of the HF group received supplemental l-carnitine during the final 2 months of the diet. The intervention produced robust increases in whole body carnitine reserves (Fig. 2). Importantly, free carnitine content in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2a) and liver (Fig. 2b) was restored to levels found in the SC control animals, whereas that in kidney (Fig. 2c) and plasma (Fig. 2d) increased ∼2-fold. Excess carnitine was excreted in the urine (Fig. 2e). l-Carnitine is a quaternary amine obtained from dietary sources or synthesized endogenously from trimethylated lysine residues derived from protein degradation (19Vaz F.M. Wanders R.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Because the liver is the principal site of carnitine biosynthesis in rats, we proceeded to examine hepatic expression of genes involved in carnitine homeostasis (Fig. 2f). Trimethyllysine hydroxylase-ϵ, aldehyde dehydrogenase-9 family, member A1, and γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase-1 catalyze the initial, third, and final biosynthetic steps in de novo carnitine biosynthesis, respectively. Between 5 and 15 months of age hepatic expression of these genes tended to decrease, although the trends did not reach statistical significance. The HF diet resulted in a 30–40% reduction in mRNA levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase-9 family (member A1) and γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase-1; a similar but non-significant trend was observed for trimethyllysine hydroxylase-ϵ. We then probed for genes involved in carnitine transport. Both aging and chronic HF feeding decreased expression of the mitochondrial carnitine transporters, CACT, and organic cation transporter 1 (OCTN1), whereas the plasmalemmal carnitine transporter OCTN2 was diminished in aged rats but did not vary in response to the HF diet. Collectively, these findings suggest that aging and overnutrition might compromise the capacity of the liver to synthesize and transport free carnitine. In previous reports we demonstrated that excessive β-oxidation contributes to mitochondrial dysregulation and muscle insulin resistance (5Koves T.R. Ussher J.R. Noland R.C. Slentz D. Mosedale M.

The present study sought to examine the therapeutic utility of carnitine supplementation in a more severe model of lifelong overnutrition. Indeed, animals fed a HF diet for 12 months were grossly obese, because total body weight and fat pad (epididymal plus perirenal) weights were 28 and 160% higher, respecti"
https://openalex.org/W2041917456,"A widely held memory consolidation theory posits that memory of events and space is initially stored in the hippocampus (HPC) in a time-limited manner and is consolidated in the neocortex for permanent storage. Although posttraining HPC lesions result in temporally graded amnesia, the precise HPC circuits and mechanisms involved in remote memory storage remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of the trisynaptic pathway in the consolidation process we employed the CA3-TeTX transgenic mouse, in which CA3 output can be specifically and inducibly controlled. We found that posttraining blockade of CA3 output for up to 4 weeks impairs the consolidation of contextual fear memory. Moreover, in vivo hippocampal recordings revealed a reduced intrinsic frequency of CA1 ripples and a significant decrease in the experience-dependent, ripple-associated coordinated reactivation of CA1 cell pairs. Collectively, these results suggest that the posttraining integrity of the trisynaptic pathway and the ripple-associated reactivation of hippocampal memory engram are crucial for memory consolidation."

We used multiple techniques to demonstrate a disulfide bonding pattern for hepcidin different from that previously published. All techniques confirmed the following disulfide bond connectivity: Cys(1)-Cys(8), Cys(3)-Cys(6), Cys(2)-Cys(4), and Cys(5)-Cys(7). NMR studies reveal a new model for hepcidin that, at ambient temperatures, interconverts between two different conformations, which could be individually resolved by temperature variation. Using these methods, the solution structure of hepcidin was determined at 325 and 253 K in supercooled water. X-ray analysis of a co-crystal with Fab appeared to stabilize a hepcidin conformation similar to the high temperature NMR structure."
https://openalex.org/W2039552979,"Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a transcriptional co-activator that coordinately regulates the expression of distinct sets of metabolism-related genes in different tissues. Here we show that PGC-1alpha expression is reduced in skeletal muscles from mice lacking the sirtuin family deacetylase SIRT1. Conversely, SIRT1 activation or overexpression in differentiated C2C12 myotubes increased PGC-1alpha mRNA expression. The transcription-promoting effects of SIRT1 occurred through stimulation of PGC-1alpha promoter activity and were enhanced by co-transfection of myogenic factors, such as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and, especially, myogenic determining factor (MyoD). SIRT1 bound to the proximal promoter region of the PGC-1alpha gene, an interaction potentiated by MEF2C or MyoD, which also interact with this region. In the presence of MyoD, SIRT1 promoted a positive autoregulatory PGC-1alpha expression loop, such that overexpression of PGC-1alpha increased PGC-1alpha promoter activity in the presence of co-expressed MyoD and SIRT1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that SIRT1 interacts with PGC-1alpha promoter and increases PGC-1alpha recruitment to its own promoter region. Immunoprecipitation assays further showed that SIRT1-PGC-1alpha interactions are enhanced by MyoD. Collectively, these data indicate that SIRT1 controls PGC-1alpha gene expression in skeletal muscle and that MyoD is a key mediator of this action. The involvement of MyoD in SIRT1-dependent PGC-1alpha expression may help to explain the ability of SIRT1 to drive muscle-specific gene expression and metabolism. Autoregulatory control of PGC-1alpha gene transcription seems to be a pivotal mechanism for conferring a transcription-activating response to SIRT1 in skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2157992860,"Brain mechanisms of hypnosis are poorly known. Cognitive accounts proposed that executive attentional systems may cause selective inhibition or disconnection of some mental operations. To assess motor and inhibitory brain circuits during hypnotic paralysis, we designed a go-no-go task while volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in three conditions: normal state, hypnotic left-hand paralysis, and feigned paralysis. Preparatory activation arose in right motor cortex despite left hypnotic paralysis, indicating preserved motor intentions, but with concomitant increases in precuneus regions that normally mediate imagery and self-awareness. Precuneus also showed enhanced functional connectivity with right motor cortex. Right frontal areas subserving inhibition were activated by no-go trials in normal state and by feigned paralysis, but irrespective of motor blockade or execution during hypnosis. These results suggest that hypnosis may enhance self-monitoring processes to allow internal representations generated by the suggestion to guide behavior but does not act through direct motor inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2036638644,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated (HCN) channels, which generate the I(h) current, mediate a number of important brain functions. The HCN1 isoform regulates dendritic integration in cortical pyramidal neurons and provides an inhibitory constraint on both working memory in prefrontal cortex and spatial learning and memory in the hippocampus. Altered expression of HCN1 following seizures may contribute to the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. Yet the regulatory networks and pathways governing HCN channel expression and function in the brain are largely unknown. Here, we report the presence of nine alternative N-terminal splice forms of the brain-specific cytoplasmic protein TRIP8b and demonstrate the differential effects of six isoforms to downregulate or upregulate HCN1 surface expression. Furthermore, we find that all TRIP8b isoforms inhibit channel opening by shifting activation to more negative potentials. TRIP8b thus functions as an auxiliary subunit that provides a mechanism for the dynamic regulation of HCN1 channel expression and function."
https://openalex.org/W2081080799,"The regulation of muscle stem cells in humans in response to muscle injury remains largely undefined. Recently, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in muscle stem cell (satellite cell)-mediated muscle hypertrophy in animals; however, the role of IL-6 in the satellite cell (SC) response following muscle-lengthening contractions in humans has not been studied.Eight subjects (age 22+/-1 y; 79+/-8 kg) performed 300 maximal unilateral lengthening contractions (3.14 rad.s(-1)) of the knee extensors. Blood and muscle samples were collected before and at 4, 24, 72, and 120 hours post intervention. IL-6, IL-6 receptor, IL-6R(alpha), cyclin D1, suppressor of cytokine signling-3 (SOCS3) mRNA were measured using quantitative RT-PCR and serum IL-6 protein was measured using an ELISA kit. JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylated and total protein was measured using western blotting techniques. Immunohistochemical analysis of muscle cross-sections was performed for the quantification of SCs (Pax7(+) cells) as well as the expression of phosphorylated STAT3, IL-6, IL-6R(alpha), and PCNA across all time-points. The SC response, as defined by an amplification of Pax7(+) cells, was rapid, increasing by 24 h and peaking 72 h following the intervention. Muscle IL-6 mRNA increased following the intervention, which correlated strongly (R(2) = 0.89, p<0.002) with an increase in serum IL-6 concentration. SC IL-6R(alpha) protein was expressed on the fiber, but was also localized to the SC, and IL-6(+) SC increased rapidly following muscle-lengthening contractions and returned to basal levels by 72 h post-intervention, demonstrating an acute temporal expression of IL-6 with SC. Phosphorylated STAT3 was evident in SCs 4 h after lengthening contraction, and the downstream genes, cyclin D1 and SOCS3 were significantly elevated 24 hours after the intervention.The increased expression of STAT3 responsive genes and expression of IL-6 within SCs demonstrate that IL-6/STAT3 signaling occurred in SCs, correlating with an increase in SC proliferation, evidenced by increased Pax7(+)/PCNA(+) cell number in the early stages of the time-course. Collectively, these data illustrate that IL-6 is an important signaling molecule associated with the SC response to acute muscle-lengthening contractions in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2077401778,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are key modulators of neuronal activity by providing the depolarizing cation current I(h) involved in rhythmogenesis, dendritic integration, and synaptic transmission. These tasks critically depend on the availability of HCN channels, which is dynamically regulated by intracellular cAMP; the range of this regulation, however, largely differs among neurons in the mammalian brain. Using affinity purification and high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identify the PEX5R/Trip8b protein as the beta subunit of HCN channels in the mammalian brain. Coassembly of PEX5R/Trip8b affects HCN channel gating in a subtype-dependent and mode-specific way: activation of HCN2 and HCN4 by cAMP is largely impaired, while gating by phosphoinositides and basal voltage-dependence remain unaffected. De novo expression of PEX5R/Trip8b in cardiomyocytes abolishes beta-adrenergic stimulation of HCN channels. These results demonstrate that PEX5R/Trip8b is an intrinsic auxiliary subunit of brain HCN channels and establish HCN-PEX5R/Trip8b coassembly as a mechanism to control the channels' responsiveness to cyclic nucleotide signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2078271301,"Dietary restriction extends longevity in diverse species, suggesting that there is a conserved mechanism for nutrient regulation and prosurvival responses. Here we show a role for the HECT (homologous to E6AP carboxy terminus) E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP-1 as a positive regulator of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans in response to dietary restriction. We find that overexpression of wwp-1 in worms extends lifespan by up to 20% under conditions of ad libitum feeding. This extension is dependent on the FOXA transcription factor pha-4, and independent of the FOXO transcription factor daf-16. Reduction of wwp-1 completely suppresses the extended longevity of diet-restricted animals. However, the loss of wwp-1 does not affect the long lifespan of animals with compromised mitochondrial function or reduced insulin/IGF-1 signalling. Overexpression of a mutant form of WWP-1 lacking catalytic activity suppresses the increased lifespan of diet-restricted animals, indicating that WWP-1 ubiquitin ligase activity is essential for longevity. Furthermore, we find that the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBC-18, is essential and specific for diet-restriction-induced longevity. UBC-18 interacts with WWP-1 and is required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of WWP-1 and the extended longevity of worms overexpressing wwp-1. Taken together, our results indicate that WWP-1 and UBC-18 function to ubiquitinate substrates that regulate diet-restriction-induced longevity."

InsP6 is bound in a highly basic pocket that is separated from an unusual active site by a beta-flap structure. Functional studies confirm an intramolecular mechanism of cleavage and highlight specific residues required for InsP6-induced TcdA processing.

https://openalex.org/W2164347685,"The modern Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) Ocean is a large oceanic source of carbon to the atmosphere1. Primary productivity over large areas of the EEP is limited by silicic acid and iron availability, and because of this constraint the organic carbon export to the deep ocean is unable to compensate for the outgassing of carbon dioxide that occurs through upwelling of deep waters. It has been suggested that the delivery of dust-borne iron to the glacial ocean2,3 could have increased primary productivity and enhanced deep-sea carbon export in this region, lowering atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial periods. Such a role for the EEP is supported by higher organic carbon burial rates documented in underlying glacial sediments4,5, but lower opal accumulation rates cast doubts on the importance of the EEP as an oceanic region for significant glacial carbon dioxide drawdown6,7. Here we present a new silicon isotope record that suggests the paradoxical decline in opal accumulation rate in the glacial EEP results from a decrease in the silicon to carbon uptake ratio of diatoms under conditions of increased iron availability from enhanced dust input. Consequently, our study supports the idea of an invigorated biological pump in this region during the last glacial period that could have contributed to glacial carbon dioxide drawdown. Additionally, using evidence from silicon and nitrogen isotope changes, we infer that, in contrast to the modern situation, the biological productivity in this region is not constrained by the availability of iron, silicon and nitrogen during the glacial period. We hypothesize that an invigorated biological carbon dioxide pump constrained perhaps only by phosphorus limitation was a more common occurrence in low-latitude areas of the glacial ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2024721108,"Bursts of spikes triggered by sensory stimuli in midbrain dopamine neurons evoke phasic release of dopamine in target brain areas, driving reward-based reinforcement learning and goal-directed behavior. NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play a critical role in the generation of these bursts. Here we report LTP of NMDAR-mediated excitatory transmission onto dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Induction of LTP requires burst-evoked Ca2+ signals amplified by preceding metabotropic neurotransmitter inputs in addition to the activation of NMDARs themselves. PKA activity gates LTP induction by regulating the magnitude of Ca2+ signal amplification. This form of plasticity is associative, input specific, reversible, and depends on the relative timing of synaptic input and postsynaptic bursting in a manner analogous to the timing rule for cue-reward learning paradigms in behaving animals. NMDAR plasticity might thus represent a potential neural substrate for conditioned dopamine neuron burst responses to environmental stimuli acquired during reward-based learning."

We have previously reported that the HIV-1 membrane is highly enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and other raft lipids, suggesting that the virus may bud from pre-existing or virus-induced lipid rafts. Here, we employed the environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye Laurdan to study the membrane lateral structure of HIV-1 derived from different cell lines. Differences in viral membrane order detected by Laurdan staining were shown by mass spectrometry to be due to differences in lipid composition. Isogenic viruses from two different cell lines were both strongly enriched in raft lipids and displayed a liquid-ordered membrane, but these effects were significantly more pronounced for HIV-1 from the T-cell line MT-4 compared with virus from 293T cells. Host-dependent differences in the lipidomes predominantly affected the ratio of sphingomyelins (including dihydrosphingomyelin) to phosphatidylcholine, whereas cholesterol contents were similar. Accordingly, treatment of infectious HIV-1 with the sphingomyelin-binding toxins Equinatoxin-II or lysenin showed differential inhibition of infectivity. Liposomes consisting of lipids that had been extracted from viral particles exhibited slightly less liquid order than the respective viral membranes, which is likely to be due to absence of membrane proteins and to loss of lipid asymmetry.

For these reasons and because the association and dissociation of membrane microdomains appears to occur on a rapid time-scale and the raft size is too small to be optically resolved, the raft concept remains controversial. However, the determination of the HIV-1 lipidome, a native membrane purified without any detergent, has provided strong evidence for the existence of these microdomains (3Brügger B. Glass B. Haberkant P. Leibrecht I. Wieland F.T. Kräusslich H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2641-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Fluorescent lipid analogs that partition preferentially into a specialized lipid phase could be an attractive tool to study membrane microdomains. However, partitioning of such dyes mainly depends on the local chemical environment and not on the phase state of the membrane (19Bagatolli L.A. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2090-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 20Bagatolli L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Bagatolli L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1541-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonapthalene) is a lipophilic dye that binds to membranes independent of their phase state but reports the phase state by a change in its fluorescence emission (20Bagatolli L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Laurdan exhibits a blue shift in its emission spectrum with increasing membrane condensation. This is caused by an alteration in the dipole moment of the probe as a consequence of exclusion of water molecules from the lipid bilayer. Thus, excitation of membrane bound Laurdan leads to two emission maxima representing differences in membrane lateral structure. Quantification of membrane order is achieved by computing the Generalized Polarization (GP) value, which is defined as normalized intensity ratio of the two emission channels. GP values range from +1 (most condensed) to −1 (most fluid). They are not biased by probe concentration, membrane ruffles, and surface modifications, such as lipoprotein binding. Furthermore, there is no preferential interaction with a specific lipid, fatty acid, or head group (20Bagatolli L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Bagatolli L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1541-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). GP value correspondence to different lipid phases was estimated using liposomes with a composition similar to that of cellular membranes (22Bagatolli L.A. Parasassi T. Gratton E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 105: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E.

Using an equimolar mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, CHOL, and SM as an lo membrane, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) as an ld and solid ordered (so) phase, GP values below +0.25 were shown to correspond to the ld phase, GP values between +0.25 and +0.5 to the lo phase, and GP values above +0.5 to the so phase (22Bagatolli L.A. Parasassi T. Gratton E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 105: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Laurdan has been extensively used to characterize domain formation and lateral lipid segregation in model membranes composed of different phospholipid mixtures or lipids extracted from cellular membranes (19Bagatolli L.A. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2090-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Bagatolli L.A. Parasassi T. Gratton E. Chem. Phys.

J. 2000; 79: 434-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It has also been used to study the membrane structure in living cells. Gaus and coworkers observed lo domains enriched on membrane protrusions (filopodia), adhesion points, and cell-cell contacts (26Gaus K. Gratton E. Kable E.P. Jones A.S. Gelissen I. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15554-15559Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). They also used Laurdan to address the physical properties of the plasma membrane around the T-cell receptor in activated T cells, observing larger and more stably ordered membrane domains at sites of T-cell activation (27Gaus K. Chklovskaia E. Fazekas D. de St. Groth B. Jessup W. Harder T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Quantitative determination of cellular plasma membrane order by fluorescence spectroscopy is complicated due to the rapid internalization and redistribution of the probes to other cellular membranes, making it difficult to interpret the fluorescence measurements over the whole cell. This problem is not encountered in purified virus particles, because they contain only a single membrane. We therefore developed an assay to study viral membrane lateral structure by fluorescence spectroscopy. For this purpose, isogenic HIV-1 particles were produced in two different cell lines, and their GP profiles were determined. In parallel, the lipid constituents were quantified by mass spectrometry. The viral membrane displayed a lo structure in both cases, but this was more prominent for the virus derived from the T-cell line MT-4 compared with virus derived from 293T cells. The validity of this result was supported by comparing the lipidome of the two viruses, which revealed a significantly higher SMs/phosphatidylcholine (PC) ratio for the MT-4-derived virus. Accordingly, treatment with SM-binding toxins inactivated MT-4-derived virus more efficiently than 293T-derived virus, whereas both viruses exhibited similar infectivities before treatment. The reported approach allows rapid determination of differences in viral membrane order, permitting screening for compounds that perturb lo domains, which may act as antivirals of a novel type. 293T cells and TZM reporter cells (JC53BL cells expressing β-galactosidase and luciferase under the control of the HIV-1 LTR) (28Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z. Arani R.B. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. Wu X. Shaw G.M. Kappes J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) were kept in Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium, MT-4 cells (29Harada S. Koyanagi Y. Yamamoto N. Science. 1985; 229: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), and C8166 cells (30Agy M.B. Wambach M. Foy K. Katze M.G. Virology. 1990; 177: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were kept in RPMI 1640 medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine, and 10 mm Hepes. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For virus production, MT-4 cells were infected with HIV-1 strain NL4-3 (31Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and virus was harvested from cocultures of infected, and uninfected cells before cytopathic effects were observed (32Welker R. Hohenberg H. Tessmer U. Huckhagel C. Kräusslich H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with the isogenic proviral plasmid pNL4-3 by calcium phosphate precipitation. For generation of pseudotyped particles, cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G (33Emi N. Friedmann T. Yee J.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) together with pNL4-3 or ΔEnvpNL4-3, kindly provided by V. Bosch (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg) at a molar ratio 1:2. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer reporter particles were generated by cotransfection of plasmid pCHIV (34Lampe M. Briggs J.A. Endress T. Glass B. Riegelsberger S. Kräusslich H.G. Lamb D.C. Bräuchle C. Müller B. Virology. 2007; 360: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and its derivatives carrying a fluorescent moiety between the MA and CA domains of Gag, pCHIVeYFP and pCHIVeCFP, at a molar ratio of 2:1:1. HIV-1 purification was performed essentially as described (32Welker R. Hohenberg H. Tessmer U. Huckhagel C. Kräusslich H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 35Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, medium was harvested and cleared by filtration, and particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 20% (w/w) sucrose. Concentrated HIV-1 was further purified by velocity gradient centrifugation on an OptiPrep gradient (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway). The visible virus fraction was collected and concentrated by centrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The particle concentration was determined by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inactivation of infectious HIV-1 was performed by incubating the virus with 5 mm AT-2 (2,2′-dithiodipyridine, aldrithiol-2, Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle stirring as described (36Rossio J.L. Esser M.T. Suryanarayana K. Schneider D.K. Bess Jr., J.W. Vasquez G.M. Wiltrout T.A. Chertova E. Grimes M.K. Sattentau Q. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E. Lifson J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7992-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Successful inactivation was controlled by culturing inactivated samples for 10 days with highly susceptible C8166 cells. To determine differences in infectivity, isogenic HIV-1NL43 was produced in parallel from MT-4 or 293T cells. Because 293T cells do not carry the viral receptor, both cell lines were infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped virus and progeny virus (lacking VSV-G) was analyzed. In a second experiment virus was produced from 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. The respective viruses were titered in parallel on MT-4 or C8166 cells. C8166 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and infected with different virus dilutions. Infection was monitored by syncytia formation, and the tissue culture infectious dose 50% was determined after 7 or 8 days. MT-4 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with different amounts of virus. 35 h post infection cells were harvested, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized. HIV-1 infected cells were identified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis following staining with a phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody against the viral p24 capsid protein (KC57-RD1, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The percentage of phycoerythrin-positive cells was analyzed by FACSCalibur using BD CellQuest Pro 4.0.2. Software (BD Pharmingen). Laurdan was dissolved in DMSO, and staining was performed on OptiPrep-purified HIV-1 particles, using between 3 and 7.5 μg of p24 per reaction. Viral particles were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 5 μm Laurdan (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) under gentle stirring. Labeled particles were subsequently purified by ultracentrifugation for 45 min through a 20% sucrose cushion in a SW60 rotor at 44,000 rpm. Particles were carefully resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. In the case of Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Mβ-CD, Sigma) treatment, Laurdan-labeled HIV-1 particles were incubated with 5 mm Mβ-CD at 37 °C for 30 min under gentle stirring. Subsequently, viral particles were collected by ultracentrifugation for 60 min in an SW-60 rotor at 22,000 rpm centrifuging through a 20% and onto a 70% sucrose cushion. All fluorescence measurements were made using an SLM Aminco series 2 (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) spectrofluorometer. Temperature was controlled during all measurements, and samples were allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before measurement at each temperature. Laurdan excitation was set at 355 nm, and emission spectra were recorded. The fluorescence intensity of solvent-treated unstained HIV-1 purified in parallel was subtracted to remove the signal due to particle scattering. Furthermore, the spectrofluorometer provides an internal instrument correction, which was applied in all measurements. The program corrects any wavelength-dependent instrument response. To quantify changes in the Laurdan emission spectrum, GP values were calculated. In analogy with fluorescence polarization they are defined as: GP = (IB − IR)/(IB + IR), where IB (at 440 nm) and IR (at 490 nm) correspond to the intensities at the blue and red edges of the emission maxima, respectively (37Parasassi T. De Stasio G. D舗Ubaldo A. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 38Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). To investigate the inhibitory effect of Equinatoxin-II (Eqt-II) or lysenin on viral infectivity, purified HIV-1 particles were treated with toxins, and their infectivities were determined by titration on TZM cells. Eqt-II was purified as described previously (39Anderluh G. Barlic A. Podlesek Z. Macek P. Pungercar J. Gubensek F. Zecchini M.L. Serra M.D. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and lysenin was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). OptiPrep-purified HIV-1 particles corresponding to 500 ng of p24 per reaction were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl in phosphate-buffered saline with varying amounts of Eqt-II or lysenin. Incubation was done for 20 min at room temperature for Eqt-II and for 30 min at 37 °C for lysenin. Subsequently, 180 μl of Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to inactivate unbound toxin molecules. Toxin treatment of mock particles and subsequent inactivation was performed to rule out direct effects of the toxins on target cells. The infectivity of toxin-treated HIV-1 was determined on TZM reporter cells as described (40Müller B. Daecke J. Fackler O.T. Dittmar M.T. Zentgraf H. Kräusslich H.G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10803-10813Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with some modifications. TZM cells (8 × 103 cells/well) were seeded 1 day before infection in a 96 well plate and were infected with serial 5-fold dilutions of toxin-treated virus. At 48-h post-infection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured in the lysates as described by the manufacturer using the Promega Steady Glo kit and a microplate luminometer (Luminoskan Ascent, Thermo Labsystems). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared following the extrusion method described by Mayer et al. (41Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). All lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Lipids were mixed in chloroform and dried under nitrogen. Traces of organic solvent were removed by vacuum pumping for 1–2 h. Subsequently, the dried lipid film was dispersed in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles prior to extruding 10 times through two stacked polycarbonate membranes with a 100 nm pore size (Nucleopore, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) using the Thermo-barrel extruder (Lipex extruder, Northern Lipids, Inc., Burnaby, Canada). Distribution of vesicle sizes was estimated by quasielastic light scattering using a Malvern Zeta-Sizer instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Lipid analysis was performed as described in Brügger et al. (3Brügger B. Glass B. Haberkant P. Leibrecht I. Wieland F.T. Kräusslich H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2641-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Cholesterol quantification was performed employing a derivatization protocol described by Liebisch et al. (42Liebisch G. Binder M. Schifferer R. Langmann T. Schulz B. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Cholesterol acetate was analyzed by nano-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry monitoring a neutral loss of m/z 77. Quantitation was done using d6-cholesterol as internal standard, which was likewise derivatized to d6-cholesterol acetate. Based on previous reports showing that the HIV-1 envelope is highly enriched in raft lipids (1Aloia R.C. Jensen F.C. Curtain C.C. Mobley P.W. Gordon L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2008; 82: 11228-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we used the polarity-sensitive dye Laurdan (38Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) to measure the lateral structure of HIV-1 membranes. Laurdan is homogeneously distributed within the membrane and has an emission maximum around 490 nm for fluid membranes and around 440 nm for condensed membranes (20Bagatolli L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The phase state of a membrane can be quantified by the GP value, which is defined as the normalized intensity ratio of the two emission channels and provides a relative measure of lipid order. HIV-1 particles lacking viral Env proteins and pseudotyped with VSV-G glycoprotein were used to establish the assay, because they result in high particle yields, permit titration of infectivity, and are of lower biohazard than infectious HIV-1. Purified particles were produced following transfection of 293T cells, and labeled with Laurdan as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using single-round infectivity assays on TZM reporter cells, viral infectivity was found to be largely retained after Laurdan labeling (data not shown). Particles were incubated at increasing temperatures, excited at 355 nm, and emission spectra were recorded. Fig. 1A, left panel, shows emission spectra for Laurdan-labeled particles. At room temperature (∼20 °C) a strong signal was observed around 440 nm, which was gradually lost when the temperature was increased, concomitant with a red shift in emission. This indicates a progressive decrease in membrane order with rising temperature due to water dipolar relaxation (20Bagatolli L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Bagatolli L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1541-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To validate that Laurdan emission spectra report membrane lateral structure, Mβ-CD was used to extract CHOL from the viral membrane, one of the main components of lo domains (11Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar, 12Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Laurdan-labeled particles were treated with 5 mm Mβ-CD, and emission spectra were determined as above (Fig. 1A, right panel). A prominent red shift was observed at all temperatures indicating increased membrane fluidity after CHOL extraction. To ensure comparability of results, Mβ-CD-treated and untreated particles were purified, stained, collected, and measured in parallel using an identical protocol (except for omission of Mβ-CD in the untreated sample). As previously described (7Campbell S.M. Crowe S.M. Mak J. AIDS. 2002; 16: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), Mβ-CD treatment was found to increase the buoyant density of viral particles. Viral integrity after Mβ-CD treatment was confirmed by comparing the protein pattern of Mβ-CD-treated and untreated particles on silver-stained gels (data not shown). Particle integrity was further analyz"

We have engineered an influenza virus-like particle (VLP) as a new generation vaccine candidate purified from the supernatants of Sf9 insect cells following infection by recombinant baculoviruses to express three influenza virus proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix 1 (M1). In this study, a seasonal trivalent VLP vaccine (TVV) formulation, composed of influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 and influenza B VLPs, was evaluated in mice and ferrets for the ability to elicit antigen-specific immune responses. Animals vaccinated with the TVV formulation had hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers against all three homologous influenza virus strains, as well as HAI antibodies against a panel of heterologous influenza viruses. HAI titers elicited by the TVV were statistically similar to HAI titers elicited in animals vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent VLP. Mice vaccinated with the TVV had higher level of influenza specific CD8+ T cell responses than a commercial trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). Ferrets vaccinated with the highest dose of the VLP vaccine and then challenged with the homologous H3N2 virus had the lowest titers of replicating virus in nasal washes and showed no signs of disease. Overall, a trivalent VLP vaccine elicits a broad array of immunity and can protect against influenza virus challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2027142212,"c-Myc interacts with components of the pre-replication complex and directly regulates DNA replication [1]. However the consequences of this novel c-Myc function on cell cycle dynamics and replication-associated damage are unknown. Here, we show that c-Myc overexpression in primary human fibroblasts markedly accelerates S-phase while c-Myc deficient fibroblasts exhibit a prolonged S-phase. We also show that the Werner DNA helicase protein (WRN) plays a critical role in supporting c-Myc-driven S-phase, as depletion of WRN in c-Myc overexpressing cells increases DNA damage specifically at sites of DNA synthesis. This excess DNA damage activates a “replication stress” pathway involving ATR, CHK1, CHK2, and p53, leading to rapid senescence of WRN deficient c-Myc overexpressing cells. Indeed, depletion of p53 rescues this senescence response. We propose that WRN functions to repair abnormal replication structures caused by the acceleration of DNA replication by c-Myc. This work provides an additional mechanistic explanation for c-Myc-induced DNA damage and senescence, and reveals a vulnerability of c-Myc overexpressing cells that could potentially be exploited in cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2066140350,"Lipin 1 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Its physiological role involves two cellular functions: regulation of phosphatidate phosphatase activity and regulation of fatty acid oxidation. In this study, we have demonstrated that lipin 1 gene (LPIN1) expression is regulated by cellular sterols, which are key regulators of lipid metabolism. We have also characterized the sterol-response element and nuclear factor Y-binding sites in the human LPIN1 promoter. Using a luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that these elements are responsible for the transcription of LPIN1 gene, mediated by SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1) and nuclear factor Y. Furthermore, we investigated whether lipin 1 is involved in lipogenesis by transfection of LPIN1 small interfering RNA. We infer that sterol-mediated regulation of lipin 1 gene transcription modulates triglyceride accumulation. This modulation involves changes in the activity of phosphatidate phosphatase."

However, exactly how this activity is regulated in vivo remains unexplored. Here we provide evidence to show that MRG15 is a novel PALB2-associated protein that ensures regulated recombination events. We found that the direct interaction between MRG15 and PALB2 is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved region on PALB2. Intriguingly, although damage-induced RAD51 foci formation and mitomycin C sensitivity appeared normal in MRG15-binding defective PALB2 mutants, these cells exhibited a significant increase in gene conversion rates. Consistently, we found that abrogation of the PALB2-MRG15 interaction resulted in elevated sister chromatid exchange frequencies. Our results suggest that loss of the PALB2-MRG15 interaction relieved the cells with the suppression of sister chromatid exchange and therefore led to a hyper-recombination phenotype in the gene conversion assay. Together, our study indicated that although PALB2 is required for proficient homologous recombination, it could also govern the choice of templates used in homologous recombination repair.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7155-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of PALB2 homologues revealed several conserved regions (see Fig. 1A). Although the BRCA2-interacting domain was mapped to the conserved C terminus, which contains the WD40 repeats (see Fig. 1A, region C) (2Sy S.M. Huen M.S. Zhu Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18302-18310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the BRCA1-binding motif was mapped to the N-terminal conserved coiled-coil domain (see Fig. 1A, region A). Interestingly, the same region was found to be responsible for PALB2 oligomerization and foci formation (2Sy S.M. Huen M.S. Zhu Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18302-18310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Accordingly, disruption of either the N-terminal or the C-terminal leads to impaired DNA repair in vivo, suggesting that these highly conserved regions are important for PALB2 function in homologous recombination. Apart from the N and C termini of PALB2, bioinformatic analysis revealed another highly conserved region in the middle of the PALB2 coding sequence (see Fig. 1A, region B). Although no function has been ascribed to this region of the PALB2 protein, we found that this conserved region (i.e. region B), missing from the PALB2-deficient Fanconi anemia (FA) patient cells (EUFA1341F) that express a truncated PALB2 mutant (residues 1–500), was restored during spontaneous reversion (5Xia B.

Sequencing analysis indicated that this revertant, containing an internal deletion (residues 71–561), harbors all of the three conserved regions (i.e. regions A–C). From these observations, we speculated that apart from its ability to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2, the conserved region B might also play an important role in the regulation of PALB2 function in vivo. mitomycin C double strand breaks Fanconi anemia S-tag, FLAG epitope, and streptavidin-binding peptide tag sister chromatid exchange tandem affinity purification glutathione S-transferase small interfering RNA 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole bromodeoxyuridine hyper-recombination green fluorescent protein. MRG15 belongs to a highly conserved protein family that contains the MRG domain responsible for transcriptional regulation via chromatin remodeling by histone acetylation (6Bertram M.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene. 2001; 266: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Its yeast homologue Eaf3 has been demonstrated to be a component of both the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase and the Rpd3 histone deacetylase complexes and affects global acetylation (7Reid J.L.

MRG15 has been demonstrated to bind directly to methylated lysine 36 on histone H3 peptide and was functionally correlated to the acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4 (10Zhang P. Du J. Sun B.

It was demonstrated that Eaf3, via its chromo domain-mediated binding to methylated lysine 36 on histone H3, allows specific recruitment of the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex (13Li B. Gogol M. Carey M. Lee D. Seidel C. Workman J.L. Science. 2007; 316: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have identified MRG15 as a novel interacting partner of PALB2 that binds to a previously uncharacterized conserved region on PALB2 (see Fig. 1A, region B). In keeping with the importance of the conservation of functional protein motifs, we demonstrated that the PALB2-MRG15 interaction is important for the suppression of sister chromatid-mediated homologous recombination. Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope (M2) were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD51 (D51), anti-PALB2, anti-BRCA2 (C25), and anti-pH2AX antibodies were described previously (4Sy S.M. Huen M.S. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7155-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 14Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R.

To facilitate the study of endogenous MRG15 protein, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against recombination GST-MRG15 purified from Escherichia coli. Cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin and kept in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. pOZC-PALB2 (a gift from Dr. David Livingston (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute)) was subcloned into the entry vector pDONR201 (Invitrogen). Mutations or deletions of PALB2 were generated using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). 293T cells expressing SFB-PALB2 F3 or SFB-MRG15 were used for the purification of protein complex(es). TAP procedures were described in Ref. 4Sy S.M. Huen M.S. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7155-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar. A non-targeting siRNA and siRNA specifically targeting human MRG15, MRGX, PALB2, and BRCA2 were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were seeded at 30% confluency for 24 h before double siRNA transfection using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after the second siRNA transfection. Cells were lysed in NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2) buffer containing Benzonase (Novagen). For immunoprecipitation or pulldown experiments, cell extracts were incubated with either S-agarose (EMD Biosciences) or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with NETN buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblottings were subsequently performed with antibodies as indicated. Cells grown on coverslips were pre-extracted with buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde solution. Immunostaining experiments were performed using MRG15, RAD51, and pH2AX antibody. Cells were mounted onto glass slides in DAPI-containing antifade. Immunofluorescent analyses and image capturing were performed on a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 103 cells in triplicate onto 96-well plates. A different concentration of MMC was added 24 h after cell seeding. Cells were incubated for another 5 days. MMC sensitivity was monitored by the Alamar blue assay (Biosource). Absorbances at 570/600 nm were measured using the TECAN SAFIRE plate reader. Results were the averages of data from three independent experiments. 1 × 106 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of pCBASce plasmid at 270 V, 975 microfarads using a Bio-Rad gene pulser II (15Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Cells were plated and incubated in culture media for 48 h prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. Cells were analyzed in a BD Biosciences FACScan on a green (FL1) versus orange (FL2) fluorescence plot. Results were the average of data obtained from two independent experiments. Cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 48 h and then chased for 24 h. Cells were treated with Colcemid for 8 h and harvested for the preparation of metaphase spread. For MMC treatment, 10 μm MMC was added to the media 6 h before harvest. Metaphases were spread onto slides and aged for 5 days. Prior to the incubation with mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody, slides were denatured with 70% formamide/4× SSC and dried with an ethanol series. Rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used to visualize chromatids labeled with BrdUrd. Chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI. To identify proteins that interact with PALB2 through its conserved region B, we used 293T cells stably expressing an SFB-tagged PALB2 fragment (F3) (Fig. 1A) for tandem affinity purification. Mass spectrometry analysis identified MRG15 as a major binding partner of PALB2 F3, along with its close homologue MRGX (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition, MRG15 was also co-purified with full-length PALB2 when we performed TAP using 293T cells expressing SFB-tagged full-length PALB2. To confirm the interaction between PALB2 and MRG15, we performed reverse TAP using 293T cells expressing SFB-tagged MRG15. Consistently, PALB2 was co-purified with MRG15 along with other known MRG15-binding partners including p400 and BRD8 (Fig. 1B). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments also verified a specific interaction between PALB2 and MRG15 (Fig. 1, C and D). MRG15 chromo domain fragment (F1) and MRG domain fragment (F2) were generated, and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment indicated that MRG15 interacts with PALB2 via its MRG domain (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). MRG15 belongs to the MRG domain-containing protein family, which is highly conserved among organisms including yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila (6Bertram M.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene. 2001; 266: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the MRG domain is highly conserved, MRG15 is the only member in the family that harbors a chromo domain on its N-terminal, which has been shown to be capable to bind methylated H3K36 lysine 36 (10Zhang P. Du J. Sun B. Dong X. Xu G. Zhou J. Huang Q. Liu Q. Hao Q. Ding J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Sun B. Hong J. Zhang P. Dong X. Shen X. Lin D. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36504-36512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, MRG15 knock-out mice manifested DNA repair defects in which the recruitment of repair proteins including 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage was delayed (11Garcia S.N. Kirtane B.M. Podlutsky A.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Tominaga K. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5275-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is not clear what is the MRG15 function in DNA repair. The interaction between MRG15 and PALB2 prompted us to investigate whether MRG15 serves as a cofactor in the PALB2-dependent DNA repair. Because PALB2 localizes at sites of DNA breaks upon DNA damage, we next asked whether MRG15 might similarly be recruited to DSBs. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that following ionizing radiation, endogenous MRG15 localized to sites of DNA breaks that are marked by pH2AX (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that PALB2 and MRG15 may function together in response to DNA damage. To further understand exactly how PALB2 interacts with MRG15, we used a series of SFB-tagged PALB2 mutants to map the MRG15-binding region (Fig. 2A). Pulldown experiments using GST-MRG15 fusion protein suggested that the PALB2 and MRG15 interaction requires the conserved region B of PALB2 (residues 611–764; Fig. 2B). Further experiments using a series of PALB2 deletion mutants reassured us that this region B of PALB2 is the only region that mediates its interaction with MRG15 (Fig. 2C). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that although wild-type PALB2 associated readily with an MRG15, PALB2 deletion mutant that lacks residues 611–764 did not (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, disruption of either the oligomerization and BRCA1-interacting motif (ΔN42) or the BRCA2-binding domain (ΔC32) of PALB2 has no obvious impact on the PALB2-MRG15 interaction (Fig. 2, B and D). The fact that the MRG15-binding motif on PALB2 is well separated from its other interaction domains suggests that MRG15 possibly serves as an additional factor to modulate the PALB2-dependent DNA repair process. To assess whether the interaction with MRG15 is critical for the PALB2-dependent DNA repair, we reconstituted the EUF1341F PALB2-deficient cell with constructs encoding wild-type PALB2, PALB2 Δ611–764, or empty vector. Both wild-type PALB2 and the Δ611–764 deletion of PALB2 displayed discrete ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that co-localized with pH2AX (data not shown), which agrees with our earlier study that suggests that only the N terminus of PALB2 is required for its focus localization following DNA damage (2Sy S.M. Huen M.S. Zhu Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18302-18310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because PALB2 is known to be required for RAD51 foci formation, homologous recombination, and MMC resistance in vivo (1Xia B. Sheng Q. Nakanishi K. Ohashi A. Wu J. Christ N. Liu X. Jasin M.

Livingston D.M. Joenje H. de Winter J.P. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), we further examined whether the reconstitution of PALB2-deficient cells with PALB2 Δ611–764 mutant could restore these PALB2-dependent functions. Surprisingly, we found that EUFA1341F cells reconstituted with either wild-type PALB2 or PALB2 Δ611–764 mutant fully restored RAD51 foci formation, whereas cells reconstituted with empty vector alone did not (Fig. 3A). The same is observed in 293T cells reconstituted with wild type or PALB2 Δ611–764 mutant after the depletion of endogenous PALB2 (supplemental Fig. 2A). In addition, the MMC sensitivity assay indicated that similar to wild-type PALB2, Δ611–764 mutant of PALB2 was also able to restore cell survival following MMC treatment (Fig. 3B). We further performed a gene conversion assay to directly measure the efficiency of homologous recombination in cells reconstituted with either wild type or Δ611–764 mutant of PALB2. Intriguingly, cells reconstituted with PALB2 Δ611–764 mutant consistently displayed higher homologous recombination efficiency than cells reconstituted with wild-type PALB2 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that loss of the PALB2-MRG15 interaction results in a hyper-rec phenotype. Likewise, a hyper-rec phenotype was also observed in U2OS cells with depletion of endogenous PALB2 and the reintroduction of PALB2 Δ611–764 mutant when compared with the wild-type PALB2 reconstituted cells (supplemental Fig. 2B). Consistently, siRNA-mediated MRG15 knockdown significantly enhanced gene conversion efficiency (Fig. 3D), suggesting that MRG15 and its interaction with PALB2 may be responsible for the hyper-recombination phenotype we observed here. As a control, we examined the expression levels of PALB2, BRCA2, and MRG15 in these siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3E). Results indicated that although PALB2 or BRCA2 knockdown led to the destabilization of each other (1Xia B. Sheng Q. Nakanishi K. Ohashi A. Wu J. Christ N. Liu X. Jasin M. Couch F.J. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), knockdown of MRG15 did not affect the expression levels of either PALB2 or BRCA2, and thus, this rules out the possibility that the hyper-recombination phenotype observed in MRG15-depleted cells was due to an indirect effect on PALB2 or BRCA2 expression. In mammalian cells, the major repair pathways exploited to repair DSBs are the homologous recombination pathway and the non-homologues end-joining pathway. Homologous recombination allows accurate repair of DSBs with the use of homologous templates (16Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). During the cell cycle, cells employ homologous chromosomes as templates for recombinational repair in S and G2 phases. The use of sister chromatids during homologous recombination may also occur under some circumstance in mitotic cells for repairing DSBs, especially when the recombination between homologues might lead to loss of heterozygosity in mitotic cells, which could result in inactivation of both alleles of tumor suppressors. The hyper-recombination phenotype observed in cells reconstituted with PALB2 Δ611–764 mutant raised the possibility that PALB2 may be normally responsible for the suppression of recombination or the sister chromatid exchange (SCE). We thus performed the SCE assay using EUFA1341F cells reconstituted with either wild-type PALB2 or Δ611–764 mutant of PALB2. Analyses of metaphase chromosomes clearly indicated that cells expressing only PALB2 Δ611–764 mutant have a significantly higher rate of SCE than that observed in cells expressing wild-type PALB2 (Fig. 3, F and G), although both of these cells are fully capable of restoring RAD51 foci formation and MMC resistance (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, we proposed that PALB2 suppresses SCE events during homologous recombination to assure error-free DNA repair. Deletion of the MRG15-binding motif on PALB2 would lead to the loss of such suppression, and thus, result in hyper-recombination and genomic instability. The exact role of MRG15 in chromatin remodeling involved in DNA damage or repair remains unknown. However, MRG15-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated DNA repair deficits, and 53BP1 and pH2AX foci formation was delayed in these cells upon DNA damage (11Garcia S.N. Kirtane B.M. Podlutsky A.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Tominaga K. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5275-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are a number of possibilities. MRG15 and its homologue Eaf3 have been identified as component of the Tip60-NuA4 histone acetylase complex in human and yeast, respectively (9Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Côté J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 17Kusch T. Florens L. Macdonald W.H. Swanson S.K. Glaser R.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. Abmayr S.M. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Science. 2004; 306: 2084-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the Tip60 complex acetylates nucleosomal phospho-H2Av at Lys-5 in a DSB-dependent manner and catalyzes H2AX variant exchange upon DNA damage (18Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is possible that MRG15 is required for such a function given that dMRG15 mutant embryos demonstrated defects in the acetylation of nucleosomal phospho-H2Av similar to the dTip60 mutant embryos (18Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tip60 histone acetyltransferase was shown to bind to chromatin surrounding sites of DSBs in vivo. Tip60-Trrap deficiency impaired damage-induced histone H4 hyperacetylation, impeded chromatin accessibility to repair proteins, and resulted in defective homologous recombination (19Murr R. Loizou J.I. Yang Y.G. Cuenin C. Li H. Wang Z.Q. Herceg Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). As such, there is a possibility that MRG15 functions in regulating chromatin structure and accessibility and therefore affects the frequency of recombination. Interestingly, MRG15 and its homologue MRGX exist in similar protein complexes involving chromatin remodeling. Because MRGX was also identified as a component of the PALB2 complex, we further checked whether MRGX shares a similar function of MRG15 in the PALB2-dependent repair pathway. A gene conversion assay performed in U2OS cells transfected with control siRNA- or MRGX-specific siRNA showed that depletion of MRGX led to a hyper-rec phenotype when compared with control cells (supplemental Fig. 1D). This observation suggests that like MRG15, MRGX may also regulate sister chromatin exchange frequency in the cell. The exact mechanism as to how MRG15 and also MRGX participate in DNA repair and recombination requires further investigations. In conclusion, our findings here highlight that PALB2 not only regulates the efficiency of homologous recombination but also dictates the specific homologous recombination pathway in which it participates. These attributes are likely critical for the maintenance of genomic stability in the cell. Further studies into the underlying mechanism as to how PALB2 dictates the repair mechanisms should warrant a more comprehensive understanding on the role of PALB2 in tumor suppression.

https://openalex.org/W2065546357,"Phocomelia is a devastating, rare congenital limb malformation in which the long bones are shorter than normal, with the upper portion of the limb being most severely affected. In extreme cases, the hands or fingers are attached directly to the shoulder and the most proximal elements (those closest to the shoulder) are entirely missing. This disorder, previously known in both autosomal recessive and sporadic forms, showed a marked increase in incidence in the early 1960s due to the tragic toxicological effects of the drug thalidomide, which had been prescribed as a mild sedative. This human birth defect is mimicked in developing chick limb buds exposed to X-irradiation. Both X-irradiation and thalidomide-induced phocomelia have been interpreted as patterning defects in the context of the progress zone model, which states that a cell's proximodistal identity is determined by the length of time spent in a distal limb region termed the 'progress zone'. Indeed, studies of X-irradiation-induced phocomelia have served as one of the two major experimental lines of evidence supporting the validity of the progress zone model. Here, using a combination of molecular analysis and lineage tracing in chick, we show that X-irradiation-induced phocomelia is fundamentally not a patterning defect, but rather results from a time-dependent loss of skeletal progenitors. Because skeletal condensation proceeds from the shoulder to fingers (in a proximal to distal direction), the proximal elements are differentially affected in limb buds exposed to radiation at early stages. This conclusion changes the framework for considering the effect of thalidomide and other forms of phocomelia, suggesting the possibility that the aetiology lies not in a defect in the patterning process, but rather in progenitor cell survival and differentiation. Moreover, molecular evidence that proximodistal patterning is unaffected after X-irradiation does not support the predictions of the progress zone model."

The importance of these findings for understanding the specific binding and hydroxylation of (X-Pro-Gly)n sequences by collagen P4Hs is also discussed. 4R-Hydroxyproline (4Hyp) 2The abbreviations used are:4Hyp4R-hydroxyprolineHIFhypoxia-inducible transcription factorP4Hprolyl 4-hydroxylase2OG2-oxoglutarateC-P4Hcollagen prolyl 4-hydroxylasePPIIpoly(l-proline) type IIAt-P4HA. thaliana P4HCr-P4H-1C. reinhardtii P4H type 1PDCpyridine 2,4-dicarboxylatePEGpolyethylene glycolMMEmonomethyl etherFIHfactor-inhibiting HIFTauDtaurine dioxygenasesR.m.s.root mean squarePDBProtein Data Bank.2The abbreviations used are:4Hyp4R-hydroxyprolineHIFhypoxia-inducible transcription factorP4Hprolyl 4-hydroxylase2OG2-oxoglutarateC-P4Hcollagen prolyl 4-hydroxylasePPIIpoly(l-proline) type IIAt-P4HA. thaliana P4HCr-P4H-1C. reinhardtii P4H type 1PDCpyridine 2,4-dicarboxylatePEGpolyethylene glycolMMEmonomethyl etherFIHfactor-inhibiting HIFTauDtaurine dioxygenasesR.m.s.root mean squarePDBProtein Data Bank.is an uncommon amino acid produced by the addition of a hydroxyl group to the C4 carbon atom of the proline pyrrolidine ring. 4Hyp residues have an essential role in the extensive collagen family, where they are necessary for the formation of stable triple helical molecules (1Kivirikko K.I.

In addition to these structural roles, 4Hyp has a key role in the regulation of gene expression in an oxygen-dependent manner via the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) (6Bruick R.K.

The vertebrate C-P4Hs are α2β2 tetramers in which the α-subunits are responsible for the hydroxylation and the β-subunits are identical to protein-disulfide isomerase. The tetrameric assembly is required for stability and full activity (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 2Myllyharju J.

Plant P4Hs have a ∼30% sequence identity to the catalytic domain of the C-P4H α-subunits (11Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J.

C-P4Hs hydroxylate the central proline of the -X-Pro-Gly- repeats of collagen polypeptides, typically generating about 100 4Hyp residues in polypeptides with a length of about 1000 amino acids. Plant P4Hs can also hydroxylate peptides with -X-Pro-Gly- repeats in vitro, but generally much less effectively than peptides representing their physiological substrates, the HRGPs, which are rich in serine and proline and can fold into a left-handed fibrous poly(l-proline) type II (PPII) helix conformation (15Adair W.S.

The only known exception is isoenzyme 1 of the large Arabidopsis thaliana P4H (At-P4H) family, which efficiently hydroxylates a collagen-like (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 peptide, for which its Km is only 3-fold higher than that of the human C-P4H-I (17Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Plant P4Hs accept also poly(l-proline) as a substrate, which is not hydroxylated by any of the C-P4Hs, but instead acts as an efficient competitive inhibitor of C-P4H-I (2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Several 2OG dioxygenases have now been crystallized and despite their low overall amino acid sequence identity the structures have revealed that the catalytic sites are always located at the same site of a common framework: a double-stranded β-helix (jelly-roll) fold that consists of 8 antiparallel β-strands (18Clifton I.J.

The catalytic sites of all P4Hs have the conserved -His-X-Asp-…-His- catalytic motif for Fe2+ coordination and a basic residue that binds the C5 carboxylate moiety of 2OG. The crystal structures of two P4Hs have been solved, namely those of human HIF-P4H-2 (10McDonough M.A. Li V. Flashman E. Chowdhury R. Mohr C. Liénard B.M. Zondlo J. Oldham N.J. Clifton I.J. Lewis J.

The structures of these two enzymes share the jelly-roll core fold preceded by an N-terminal part that contains two long α-helices in both structures, and also three β-strands in Cr-P4H-1 and 2 β-strands in HIF-P4H-2 (10McDonough M.A. Li V.

In each of these two structures the extra β-strands extend the major β-sheet of the jelly-roll fold (Fig. 1B), and the helices of the N-terminal part shield this major sheet from bulk solvent. The proximal histidine and the aspartate of the Fe2+ coordination motif are located in the βII-strand of the jelly-roll, the distal histidine of this motif is in the adjacent βVII-strand, whereas the basic 2OG-binding residue (lysine in Cr-P4H-1 and arginine in HIF-P4H-2) is in the βVIII-strand. Both enzymes have been crystallized in the presence of an active site metal ion and a 2OG analogue, but not with a peptide substrate (10McDonough M.A. Li V. Flashman E. Chowdhury R. Mohr C.

Cr-P4H-1 was cocrystallized with a 10-residue long peptide substrate (Ser-Pro)5 that adopts the PPII helix conformation. The structure reported here reveals an entirely novel binding mode for proline-rich peptide substrates that is also expected to be utilized in C-P4Hs but not in HIF-P4Hs. A truncated Cr-P4H-1 (Val29-His253) with an N-terminal His6SUMO fusion partner was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (12Koski M.K. Hieta R. Böllner C.

The tag was cleaved by digestion overnight with SUMO protease (12Koski M.K. Hieta R. Böllner C. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Wierenga R.K. J. Biol.

The wild-type and mutant variants of Cr-P4H-1 were purified for the kinetic analyses as above, with the exception that the His6SUMO fusion partner was not cleaved. The catalytic properties of the wild-type and mutant Cr-P4H-1 were measured using poly(l-proline), Mr 5000, (Ser-Pro)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 as substrates as described previously (11Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The purified and tagless Cr-P4H-1 was concentrated to 3 mg/ml in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 7.8, using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore). The protein sample was supplemented with 5 mm ZnSO4, 2 mm pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC) (Sigma), and 2.5 mm (Ser-Pro)5 (Innovagen). The microbatch under-oil method and 96-well hydrophilic vapor batch plates (Douglas Instruments) were used to co-crystallize Cr-P4H-1 with Zn2+, PDC, and (Ser-Pro)5. The crystallization drops and the covering 6-μl paraffin oil layer (Sigma) were pipetted by the Tecan Freedom Evo crystallization robot (Tecan) operated via the CrysScreen software (Tecan). The crystallization drops contained equal volumes (1.5 μl) of the protein sample and the precipitant solution. The precipitant solution contained a 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) mixture with equal amounts of PEG 400, PEG 1000, PEG 1500, PEG 4000, PEG 6000, PEG 8000, PEG monomethyl ether (MME) 550, PEG MME 750, and PEG MME 5000 (this PEG mixture is referred to as PEG Smear (20Newman J.

The triangle-like plate crystals appeared in 1 week at +22 °C and grew to a final size of 350 × 350 × 100 μm in one month. The crystals were soaked for ∼1 min in a cryosolution of 17.5% (w/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) PEG Smear, 10 mm zinc acetate, 0.1 m acetate, pH 5.5, and 1 mm (Ser-Pro)5, and were subsequently flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A dataset to 1.98-Å resolution was collected from a Cr-P4H-1 crystal using synchrotron radiation at the X12 beamline, EMBL, DESY, Hamburg at 100 K cryoconditions using a 0.932-Å wavelength. The data were collected using a strategy from BEST (21Bourenkov G.P. Popov A.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (24McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr.

The structures of Cr-P4H-1 in molecules A-D and of the (Ser-Pro)5 peptides at the active sites of molecules A and C were built with iterative cycles of manual building using COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). A restrained refinement with translation, libration, and screw-rotation displacement (TLS) (26Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The (Ser-Pro)5 at the active site of molecule A consists of residues Pro4-Ser9, whereas in molecule C the residues Pro2-Ser9 could be built in the electron density. A total of 14 zinc atoms were included in the model, one at each of the four active sites and the rest mostly at the molecule-molecule interfaces. There were strong densities close to the bound Zn2+ in each molecule in the 2OG-binding pocket, but these were not enough to build the PDC molecule. The acetate ions fitted perfectly in these densities and refined with normal B-values. Finally, 468 water molecules were added to the structure using the ARP/wARP (29Evrard G.X. Langer G.G. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) option in Refmac. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not used during the refinement. The TLSANL program (30Howlin B. Butler S.A. Moss D.S. Harris G.W. Driessen H.P.C. J. Appl.

PDC is a homologue of 2OG (Fig. 1A) having two identically placed carboxylate groups, and the (Ser-Pro)5 peptide is a shortened version of a (Ser-Pro)19 motif present in the GP1 protein of the C. reinhardtii cell wall, which is a potent substrate for Cr-P4H-1 (11Keskiaho K.

Four independent molecules A–D are present in the resulting crystal form of Cr-P4H-1, and the final model was refined to 1.98-Å resolution (Table 1). Zn2+ is present at each of the four active sites, while the (Ser-Pro)5 peptide is found only in molecules A and C (Table 2). The Cr-P4H-1 molecules containing both Zn2+ and the peptide are referred to hereafter as the Zn-peptide complex. PDC is not found in any of the Cr-P4H-1 molecules, but instead an acetate molecule is placed at each active site close to the Zn2+ in the 2OG-binding pocket. The acidic crystallization conditions (pH 5.5) together with the presence of acetate ions in the buffer solution have apparently favored binding of the acetate ion in the 2OG-binding pocket instead of PDC. This is the second crystal form of Cr-P4H-1 obtained in the presence of Zn2+. A Cr-P4H-1 ternary complex with Zn2+ and PDC (referred to as the Zn-PDC complex) was crystallized earlier at pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer (PDB entry 2JIG) (12Koski M.K. Hieta R. Böllner C.

This structure will subsequently be compared with the structures of corresponding ternary complexes of the other superfamily members and discussed also in the context of point mutation studies probing the functional importance of residues in the flexible loops.TABLE 2The four known Zn2+ complex structures of Cr-P4H-1Complex structurePDB ID/moleculeMetal ionβ3-β4 loopβ I-βII loopTyr140a“In” refers to the active conformation of Tyr140.

Open table in a new tab The (Ser-Pro)5 peptide adopts a typical PPII helix conformation in the Zn-peptide complex (Fig. 1C). Ser1 is disordered in molecule C, Ser1-Ser3 in molecule A and Pro10 in both molecules. Molecule C is therefore used as the reference molecule. The middle -Ser5-Pro6-Ser7- tripeptide region of the bound peptide has the lowest B-factors, and its geometry is well defined by the electron density map (Fig. 2). The Pro6 is deeply buried and points toward the catalytic site (FIGURE 2., FIGURE 3.A). The peptide is bound to the edge strands of the jelly-roll fold, namely the βII-strand of the minor sheet of the jelly-roll fold and the β5-strand that extends the major sheet (Fig. 1, B and C). The N terminus of the peptide is bound close to the minor sheet, which also provides the three conserved metal ion-binding residues, namely His143, Asp145 and His227 (Fig. 2). The peptide subsequently crosses over to the major sheet, where Ser9 interacts with the Trp99 of the β5 edge strand (Fig. 2). The bound peptide also interacts with the side chains of βVII (Leu226, near Pro2) of the minor sheet and of βI (Glu127 and Gly128, near Ser9) and βVIII (Trp243, near Pro6) of the major sheet (Fig. 3B). The -Ser5-Pro6-Ser7- region of the bound peptide is completely covered by two loops, the β3-β4 loop (Val75-Ser95) and the βII-βIII loop (Tyr146-Gly158), which protrude out of the jelly-roll fold (Figs. 1C, 3A, and 4). The β3-β4 loop in particular interacts tightly with the bound peptide via the residues Ser78-Val79-Val80 at the entrance to the loop and Ser87 and Arg93 at the exit (Fig. 3, A and B). These two loops, which are disordered in molecules B and D of this crystal form, are known to have large conformational flexibility (12Koski M.K. Hieta R. Böllner C. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J.

The β3-β4 loop, which was only seen in an ordered open conformation in the Zn-PDC complex (12Koski M.K. Hieta R. Böllner C. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Wierenga R.K. J. Biol.

The βII-βIII loop conformation of the Zn-peptide complex is referred to as an ordered-extended conformation (Table 2), previously also observed in the Zn-binary complex (12Koski M.K. Hieta R.

In the other structures, this loop is partially disordered or observed in an ordered, compact conformation (Table 2). In the latter conformation the βII-βIII loop binds in the peptide-binding groove (Fig. 5).FIGURE 3.The hydrogen-bonding network between the (Ser-Pro)5 peptide substrate and the Cr-P4H-1.

https://openalex.org/W2100847576,"Background This study sought to determine how esthetic appearance of babies may affect their motivational processing by the adults. Methodology and Principal Findings Healthy men and women were administered two laboratory-based tasks: a) key pressing to change the viewing time of normal-looking babies and of those with abnormal facial features (e.g., cleft palate, strabismus, skin disorders, Down's syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome) and b) attractiveness ratings of these images. Exposure to the babies' images produced two different response patterns: for normal babies, there was a similar effort by the two groups to extend the visual processing with lower attractiveness ratings by men; for abnormal babies, women exerted greater effort to shorten the viewing time despite attractiveness ratings comparable to the men. Conclusions These results indicate that gender differences in the motivational processing of babies include excessive (relative to the esthetic valuation) motivation to extend the viewing time of normal babies by men vs. shortening the exposure to the abnormal babies by women. Such gender-specific incentive sensitization phenomenon may reflect an evolutionary-derived need for diversion of limited resources to the nurturance of healthy offspring."
https://openalex.org/W1979442957,"Background The global disparity in cancer incidence remains a major public health problem. We focused on prostate cancer since microscopic disease in men is common, but the incidence of clinical disease varies more than 100 fold worldwide. Ca2+ signaling is a central regulator of cell proliferation, but has received little attention in cancer prevention. We and others have reported a strong dose-dependent reduction in the incidence of prostate and lung cancer within populations exposed to boron (B) in drinking water and food; and in tumor and cell proliferation in animal and cell culture models. Methods/Principal Findings We examined the impact of B on Ca2+ stores using cancer and non-cancer human prostate cell lines, Ca2+ indicators Rhod-2 AM and Indo-1 AM and confocal microscopy. In DU-145 cells, inhibition of Ca2+ release was apparent following treatment with Ringers containing RyR agonists cADPR, 4CmC or caffeine and respective levels of BA (50 µM), (1, 10 µM) or (10, 20, 50,150 µM). Less aggressive LNCaP cancer cells required 20 µM BA and the non-tumor cell line PWR1E required 150 µM BA to significantly inhibit caffeine stimulated Ca2+ release. BA (10 µM) and the RyR antagonist dantroline (10 µM) were equivalent in their ability to inhibit ER Ca2+ loss. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis showed exposure of DU-145 cells to 50 µM BA for 1 hr decreased stored [Ca2+] by 32%. Conclusion/Significance We show B causes a dose dependent decrease of Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptor sensitive stores. This occurred at BA concentrations present in blood of geographically disparate populations. Our results suggest higher BA blood levels lower the risk of prostate cancer by reducing intracellular Ca2+ signals and storage."

The three known vertebrate NMII isoforms share high sequence homology but play different cellular roles. The main difference in sequence resides in the C-terminal non-helical tailpiece (tailpiece). In this study we demonstrate that the tailpiece is crucial for proper filament size, overcoming the intrinsic properties of the coiled-coil rod. Furthermore, we show that the tailpiece by itself determines the NMII filament structure in an isoform-specific manner, thus providing a possible mechanism by which each NMII isoform carries out its unique cellular functions. We further show that the tailpiece determines the cellular localization of NMII-A and NMII-B and is important for NMII-C role in focal adhesion complexes. We mapped NMII-C sites phosphorylated by protein kinase C and casein kinase II and showed that these phosphorylations affect its solubility properties and cellular localization. Thus phosphorylation fine-tunes the tailpiece effects on the coiled-coil rod, enabling dynamic regulation of NMII-C assembly.

NMII heavy chain is composed of a globular head containing the actin binding and force generating ATPase domains, followed by a large coiled-coil rod that terminates with a short non-helical tailpiece (tailpiece). To carry out its cellular functions, NMII assembles into dimers and higher order filaments by interactions of the coiled-coil rod (4Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd ed.

The assembly process is governed by electrostatic interactions between adjacent coiled-coil rods containing alternating charged regions with specific periodicity (5Atkinson S.J. Stewart M. J. Mol.

NMII-A is important for neural growth cone retraction (17Kubo T. Endo M. Hata K. Taniguchi J. Kitajo K. Tomura S. Yamaguchi A. Mueller B.K. Yamashita T. J.

Furthermore NMII-A and NMII-B have an opposing effect on motility, since depletion of NMII-A leads to increased motility while NMII-B depletion hinders motility (21Even-Ram S. Doyle A.D.

This functional diversity is achieved despite a significant amino acid sequence identity between the isoforms (overall 64–80%), and the origin of these differential distributions and functions is not completely understood. Recent studies suggest that the C-terminal portion of NMII-A and NMII-B, particularly the last ∼170 amino acids, is responsible for the differential distribution of these NMII isoforms (26Sandquist J.C.

It was shown that swapping this region between NMII-A and NMII-B resulted in chimeric proteins, which adopted cellular localization according to the C-terminal part (26Sandquist J.C. Means A.R. Mol.

Because the coiled-coil regions are highly conserved between NMII isoforms, while the tailpiece is the most divergent, it is therefore a good candidate for mediating NMII isoform-specific functions. However, the exact mechanism by which the tailpiece affects NMII function is not fully understood. Here we show that the tailpiece serves as an isoform-specific control mechanism modulating filament order, assembly, and cellular function. NMII isoforms used for this study were NMII-A, accession number NP_002464, NMII-B, accession number A59252, and NMII-C accession number AY363100. GFP-NMII-A–C were kind gifts from Dr. R. S Adelstein, Laboratory of Molecular Cardiology and Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, NIH, Bethesda, MD. To create pET21A-NMII-C-rod fragment (amino acids 1297–2000) NMII-C rod in pBluescript II SK(−) was digested with ClaI followed by fill-in using Klenow fragment, and NotI. The fragment was inserted into pET21A (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) that was digested with NheI filled-in and NotI, using Mighty-mix ligation kit (Takara Bio Shiga, Japan). To create the pET21C-NMII-A rod fragment, a fragment encoding amino acids 1482–1960 was removed from pTRE-GFPC3-MHC-A (34Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using XmaI filled-in and SalI and transferred to pET21C digested with NheI filled-in and SalI. To correct several problems with the original sequence (25Bao J. Jana S.S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19594-19599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) this subcloning was followed by a series of site-directed mutagenesis reactions using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NdeI site was added to pTRE-GFPC3-MHC-A by site-directed mutagenesis using primer 5′-CAC TCA GGA GCT GCT GCA TAT GGA GAA CCG GCA GAA GC-3′ followed by digestion with NdeI and SacII. The fragment was cloned into pET21C-NMII-A Rod fragment digested with the same enzymes to create pET21C-NMIIA Rod fragment (amino acids 1320–1960) used in this study. To create pQE80-l-NMII-C-193 corresponding to amino acids 1808–2000 of NMII-C, NMII-C rod fragment in pBluescript II SK(−) was digested with Bsp120I filled-in and a combination of SacI and XmaI digestion to receive a detectable blunt-SacI fragment. The plasmid pQE80-l (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was digested with BamHI filled-in followed by SacI digestion. The digested plasmid and fragment were ligated. Tailless NMII constructs were created by converting the coiled-coil ending proline codon on the NMII rod fragments in pET21 (described above) to a terminator codon using site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers: NMII-A, 5′-GGC GCG GGG ACC TGT AAT TTG TCG TGC CCC GCC G-3′; NMII-B, 5′-CGG CTG GAA GAG AAG CTG ATT TAG CCA CCC CGC CTC AGC CGG-3′; and NMII-C, 5′-GGC TCC GGC GTG GCT AAT GAG ACA TTCA CCA CAC GGA C-3′. The tail-swapped constructs were created by adding a KpnI site at the coiled-coil ending the proline codon in all isoforms using site-directed mutagenesis and subcloning the different rod fragment coding regions using KpnI and NdeI. After ligation the KpnI site was restored to the proline codon with a second cycle of site-directed mutagenesis. KpnI inserting primers were as follows: NMII-A, 5′-CAA GCT CAG GCG CGG CGA GGT ACC GTT TGT CGT GCC C-3′; NMII-B, 5′-GAA CCG GCT GAG GCG TGC GGT ACC CAT CAG CTT CTC-3′; and NMII-C, 5′-GAG GAA CAG GCT CCG GCG GGT ACC ACT TAC ATT CAC CAC-3′. Primers used to convert KpnI site to the original proline codon sequence: NMII-A-tailB, 5′-GCT CAG GCG CGG CGA CCT GCC CAT CAG CTT CTC-3′; NMII-A-tailC, 5′-CAA GCT CAG GCG CGG CGA CCT GCC ACT TAC ATT CAC CAC-3′; NMII-B-tailA, 5′-GAA CCG GCT GAG GCG CGG TGG CCC GTT TGT CGT GCCC-3′; NMII-B-tailC, 5′-GAA CCG GCT GAG GCG CGG TGG CCC ACT TAC ATT CAC CAC-3′; NMII-C-tailA, 5′-GAA CAG GCT CCG GCG TGG CCC GTT TGT CGT GCC-3′; and NMII-C-tailB, 5′-GGA ACA GGC TCC GGC GTG GCC CCA TCA GCT TCT CTT C-3′. HA fused to NMII-C was created by removing the GFP tag from GFP-NMII-C using NdeI and SalI. Synthetic primers coding the HA tag 5′-TAT GCT CGA GTA CCC ATA CGA CGT CCC AGA TTA TGC TCT CGA GGC TAG CAC GCG TAC CGG TCT TAA CGG GCC CG-3′, were subsequently ligated into the gap. Tailpiece-swapped full-length NMII were created by transferring the C-terminal region from tail-swapped rod fragments in pET21 (described above) into the GFP- or HA-tagged full-length NMII isoform. Specifically, pET21 containing an NMII-A-tailB rod fragment was digested with SalI and AflI, and the blunt-AflI fragment was ligated into GFP-NMII-A using the same enzymes. GFP-NMII-A-tailC was created by removing a fragment from the NMII-A-tailC rod fragment in pET21 using BamHI digest followed by fill-in reaction and AflI. The fragment was inserted to GFP-NMII-A after digestion with SalI filled-in and AflI. A silent SacII site was created in GFP-NMII-B, NMII-B-tailA rod fragment, and NMII-B-tailC rod fragment by site-directed mutagenesis (as described above) using the following primer: 5′-GCC GAG CTA GCC GCG GAG CGC AGC GCC GC-3′. For GFP-NMII-B-tailA, GFP-NMII-B was digested with SacII and HpaI. NMII-B-tailA rod fragment in pET21 was digested with EcoRI followed by fill-in and SacII digest, the resulting fragment was ligated into GFP-NMII-B. For GFP-NMII-B-tailC, HpaI site was created in the NMII-B-tailC rod fragment in pET21 using 5′-CCA CAC CCC AAT GAT CCA GTT AAC CCT AGA TGC CCC AAG GAC-3′ primer. Next the GFP-NMII-B vector and the NMII-B-tailC rod fragment in pET21 were digested with SacII and HpaI, and the fragments were ligated. Both HA-NMII-C-tailA and HA-NMII-C-tailB were created by digesting HA-NMII-C in pEGFP with BamHI followed by fill-in reaction and SbfI digest. Each of the NMII-C rod fragment chimeras in pET21 were digested using EcoRI and filled-in followed by SbfI digest. Fragments were ligated respectively. Asp mutations were performed on pET21C-NMII-A and pET21A-NMII-C rod fragments described above, using site-directed mutagenesis as described above, using the following primers: NMII-A S1917D-PKC site, 5′-GAA CCG CGA AGT CAG CGA CCT AAA GAA CAA GCT-3′; NMII-A S1944D-CKII site, 5′-GGC GCC GGG GAT GGC GAC GAC GAA GAG GTA G-3′; and NMII-A PKC+CKII double mutant was created using the same primers sequentially. NMII-C rod fragment PKC TT1957–60DD, 5′-GGC CCA CTT ACA TTC GAC ACA CGG GAT GTG CGC CAG GTG TTC-3′; NMII-C rod fragment CKII T1932D, 5′-GAG CTG GAG GAC GTC GAT GAG TCT GCA GAA TC- 3′; NMII-C rod fragment CKII S1973D, 5′-CTG GAA GAG GGC GTG GCT GAT GAC GAG GAA GAG-3′; and NMII-C rod fragment CKII S1985D, 5′-GAG CTG AAC CTG GCG ATG CAC CAG GCC AGG-3′. The NMII-C PKC+CKII double mutant was created using the same primers sequentially. pET21C-NMII-B-642 (amino acids 1336–1975) Asp mutations were described previously (32Rosenberg M. Ravid S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1364-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Center for Genomic Analysis, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem). Assays were performed as described previously (8Rosenberg M. Straussman R. Ben-Ya'acov A. Ronen D. Ravid S. PloS ONE. 2008; 3: e1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Straussman R. Ben-Ya'acov A. Woolfson D.N. Ravid S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1232-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the electron microscopy experiments, a wash step was added after protein deposition on the grid. Filaments were measured using Image-Pro plus software (Media Cybernetics) on calibrated electron micrographs at ×88000 magnification and subjected to two tailed, two sampled un-equal variance Student's t test using at least 18 measurements. In the sedimentation assays the 50% solubility and area under the graph were calculated from graphs plotted on KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and Excel software (Microsoft Corp.). Phosphorylation reactions were performed on NMII-C-193 described above using recombinant CKII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) or a PKC mix (Sigma-Aldrich) containing isoforms α, βΙ, βΙΙ, γ, δ, ϵ, θ, η, and ζ. The phosphorylation reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations and allowed to reach maximal phosphorylation. Phosphorylated NMII-C-193 was separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed using mass spectrometry as described previously (36Even-Faitelson L. Ravid S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2869-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to determine the exact phosphorylation sites. For NMII depletion, lentivirus particles containing siRNA-expressing plasmids were created. Cells were infected with lentiviruses and examined for NMII expression using specific antibodies. NMII-A-specific siRNA sequence 5′-CGA TTT CCA AAA GCG GAG GCT TCA GAA GGA CTC TCT TGA AGT CCT TCT GAA GCC TCC GCG GGG A-3′ was synthesized and inserted into pLVHTM (Lentiweb) according to instructions. This plasmid has an independent GFP protein transcribed as an infection marker. Because our NMII construct is fused to GFP, we replaced the GFP on pLVHTM with mCherry received from Dr. Michael Brandeis, The Hebrew University. Control sequence 5′-CGC GTC CCC GCC CTT CCG ACA TAT AGG TTT CAA GAG AAC CTA TAT GTC GGA AGG GCT TTT GGA AAT-3′ was created in a similar manner. For NMII-C knockdown 5′-GAT CCC CGC AGC TTC CCA TCT ACA CAT TCA AGA GAT GTG TAG ATG GGA AGC TGC TTT TTG GAA A-3′ was synthesized and ligated into pSUPER digested with BglII and HindIII. A fragment containing the H1 promoter and the siRNA sequence was digested with XhoI and SmaI and ligated into the lentivirus plasmid pSIN18 digested with EcoRV and XhoI. Control siRNA containing the sequence 5′-AAG TGA GAG CAA AGT GAA AGT TCT CTT CAC TTT GCT CTC ACT T-3′ was created as described above. siRNA plasmids were co-transfected with pCMV-dR8.91 and pMD2G (Lentiweb) into HEK293T cells. Lentirirus containing medium was collected 3 days after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and centrifuged for 2 h at 23,000 rpm to collect the Lentivirus particles. The particles were resuspended in 500 μl of serum-free medium containing Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were infected with the Lentivirus particles for 4 h with constant rocking. The NMII levels were determined with isoform-specific NMII antibodies. C-terminal isoform-specific NMII antibodies for Western blotting were generated in rabbits. N-terminal isoform-specific antibodies were received from Dr. R. S. Adelstein. Rat monoclonal HA antibody was from Roche Diagnostics Corporation (Basel Switzerland), Vinculin mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich, and rabbit phosphorylated Paxillin Y118 antibodies were from Invitrogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, Rhodamine Red-X Donkey anti-rat and Cy5 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (Pike West Grove, PA). Rhodamine-Phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). B−/B− and C−/C− MEFs were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1:100 Biomyc3 anti-mycoplasma antibiotic solution (Biological Industries, Beit HaEmek, Israel). A549 lung carcinoma cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1:100 Biomyc3 anti-mycoplasma antibiotic solution. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For B−/B− and C−/C− MEFs, 16 h before transfection, 2.5 × 105 cells were plated on 30-mm tissue culture dishes containing coverslips coated with 27 μg/ml collagen I (Sigma). Transfections were carried out with 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 30-mm dish, using JetPEI Transfection Reagent (Polyplus-transfection Inc., Strasbourg, France) with a nitrogen/phosphate ratio = 7, according to the manufacturer's instructions or with 2 μg of DNA in transfection reagent FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere for 4–6 h after which the medium was replaced. For A549 cells 5 × 105 cells were plated on 30-mm tissue culture dishes containing coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich). Transfections were carried out with 2 μg of plasmid DNA per 30-mm dish, using JetPEI Transfection Reagent (Polyplus-transfection Inc., Strasbourg, France) with nitrogen/phosphate ratio = 7, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For B−/B− and C−/C− MEFs, 16 h after transfection with NMII constructs, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of starvation medium (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) and serum-starved for 24 h in 2 ml of starvation medium. After starvation, three parallel scratches were performed using a small pipette tip. Cells were washed once with 1 ml of starvation medium to remove cell debris, and 2 ml of starvation medium containing 25 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. After 8 h cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min in 1.5 ml of 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to immunostaining as described previously (37Ben-Ya'acov A. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40032-40040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For A549 cells 24-h post transfection cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min in 1.5 ml of 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to immunostaining. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were visualized using a 60×, numerical aperture 1.4 objective under a TE2000 inverted confocal laser scanning system (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Consecutive Z stakes were taken using a small aperture and converged to create one image using EZ-C1 software (Nikon). Focal adhesion area and number were automatically analyzed using Image-Pro plus software (Media Cybernetics) with calibrated background-reduced final image and subjected to two-tailed, two-sampled un-equal variance Student's t test using at least 16 cells. To study the role of NMII tailpiece in the assembly processes we created different mutant rod fragments of the three NMII isoforms. These rod fragments are composed of ∼2/3 of the complete coiled-coil region and contain all of the known assembly important domains in the coiled-coil (Fig. 1). The assembly properties of NMII rod fragments lacking the tailpiece (tailless rod fragment) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1A) were examined by sedimentation assay. This assay is considered a good indication of NMII filament assembly capabilities (28Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Dulyaninova N.G. Malashkevich V.N. Almo S.C. Bresnick A.R.

The absence of the tailpiece caused NMII-A and NMII-B tailless rod fragments to create stronger assemblies that became soluble only at higher salt concentrations than intact NMII-A and NMII-B rod fragments (Fig. 2 and Table 1). In contrast, the tailless NMII-C rod fragment created weaker assemblies that became soluble at lower salt concentrations than the intact NMII-C rod fragment. These results indicate that NMII-A and NMII-B tailpieces weakened assembly and NMII-C tailpiece strengthened it.TABLE 1In vitro self-assembly properties of NMII rod fragmentNMII rod fragmentFilament widthFilament morphologyFilament length50% solubilitySolubility, area under the graphnm ± S.D.nm ± S.D.mm NaCl ± S.D.% ± S.D.NMII-A wild type1.13 ± 0.4WideN/AaN/A, not applicable.180 ± 3.348.2 ± 4NMII-B-tailA1.77 ± 0.5WideN/A222 ± 5.032.6 ± 2NMII-C-tailA1.05 ± 0.3WideN/A223 ± 6.334.5 ± 4NMII-B wild type1.22 ± 0.3WideN/A250 ± 2.120.5 ± 1NMII-A-tailB1.51 ± 0.3WideN/A235 ± 1.231.6 ± 2NMII-C-tailB0.91 ± 0.5WideN/A280 ± 4.922.6 ± 2NMII-C wild type0.39 ± 0.1ThinN/A318 ± 4.914.5 ± 4NMII-A-tailC0.39 ± 0.1ThinN/A230 ± 1.333.3 ± 2NMII-B-tailC0.23 ± 0.05ThinN/A232 ± 2.925.9 ± 2NMII-A tailless0.31 ± 0.06Cigar-shaped2.85 ± 1.0179 ± 4.631.6 ± 4NMII-B tailless0.32 ± 0.08Cigar-shaped3.30 ± 1.0300 ± 2.48.9 ± 1NMII-C tailless0.35 ± 0.05Cigar-shaped2.57 ± 0.6261 ± 2.826.8 ± 5a N/A, not applicable. Open table in a new tab NMII forms ordered filamentous structures called paracrystals, which are salt-dependent and show a distinct pattern of 14.3 nm striations similar to bipolar filaments seen in vivo (40Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of the tailpiece in assembly of NMII, we inspected the morphology of paracrystals formed by tailless rod fragments. Wild-type NMII-A and NMII-B formed wide large paracrystals with distinct striations (41Kendrick-Jones J. Szent-Gyorgyi A.S. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 527-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the newly discovered NMII-C isoform formed narrow paracrystals (Fig. 3, Ai, Av, and Aix, and Table 1). Removing the tailpiece created very short cigar-like structures with little detectable striation in all NMII isoforms (Fig. 3B). As NMII-C was recently discovered, we co"
https://openalex.org/W2077697300,"Upon virus infection, the cell mounts an innate type I interferon (IFN) response to limit the spread. This response is orchestrated by the constitutively expressed IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 protein, which becomes post-translationally activated. Although the activation events are understood in detail, the negative regulation of this innate response is less well understood. Many viruses, including Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), have evolved defense strategies against this IFN response. Thus, KSHV encodes a viral IRF (vIRF)-2 protein, sharing homology with cellular IRFs and is a known inhibitor of the innate IFN response. Here, we show that vIRF-2 mediates IRF-3 inactivation by a mechanism involving caspase-3, although vIRF-2 itself is not pro-apoptotic. Importantly, we also show that caspase-3 participates in normal IRF-3 turnover in the absence of vIRF-2, during the antiviral response induced by poly(I:C) transfection. These data provide unprecedented insight into negative regulation of IRF-3 following activation of the type I IFN antiviral response and the mechanism by which KSHV vIRF-2 inhibits this innate response."

https://openalex.org/W2051289805,"Target of rapamycin (TOR) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that controls cell growth, primarily via regulation of protein synthesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TOR can also suppress the transcription of stress response genes by a mechanism involving Tap42, a serine/threonine phosphatase subunit, and the transcription factor Msn2. A physical association between mammalian TOR (mTOR) and the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) was recently identified in human cells, suggesting a similar role for mTOR in the transcription of interferon-gamma-stimulated genes. In the current study, we identified a macromolecular protein complex composed of mTOR, STAT1, the Tap42 homologue alpha4, and the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac). Inactivation of mTOR enhanced its association with STAT1 and increased STAT1 nuclear content in PP2Ac-dependent fashion. Depletion of alpha4, PP2A, or mTOR enhanced the induction of early (i.e. IRF-1) and late (i.e. caspase-1, hiNOS, and Fas) STAT1-dependent genes. The regulation of IRF-1 or caspase-1 by mTOR was independent of other known mTOR effectors p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results describe a new role for mTOR and alpha4/PP2A in the control of STAT1 nuclear content, and the expression of interferon-gamma-sensitive genes involved in immunity and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2087393151,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress-inducible enzyme anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a single transmembrane segment (TMS) located at the C terminus, interacts with NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase and biliverdin reductase to catalyze heme degradation to biliverdin and its metabolite, bilirubin. Previous studies suggested that HO-1 functions as a monomer. Using chemical cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, here we showed that HO-1 forms dimers/oligomers in the ER. However, oligomerization was not observed with a truncated HO-1 lacking the C-terminal TMS (amino acids 266–285), which exhibited cytosolic and nuclear localization, indicating that the TMS is essential for the self-assembly of HO-1 in the ER. To identify the interface involved in the TMS-TMS interaction, residue Trp-270, predicted by molecular modeling as a potential interfacial residue of TMS α-helices, was mutated, and the effects on protein subcellular localization and activity assessed. The results showed that the W270A mutant was present exclusively in the ER and formed oligomers with similar activity to those of the wild type HO-1. Interestingly, the W270N mutant was localized not only in the ER, but also in the cytosol and nucleus, suggesting it is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. Moreover, the microsomal HO activity of the W270N mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild type. The W270N mutation appears to interfere with the oligomeric state, as revealed by a lower FRET efficiency. Collectively, these data suggest that oligomerization, driven by TMS-TMS interactions, is crucial for the stabilization and function of HO-1 in the ER.

Kappas A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 79-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase in the cytosol. Two HO isoforms have been identified in mammalian systems. HO-1 is a 288 amino acid protein and is expressed at high amounts in a variety of pathological conditions associated with cellular stress. There is compelling evidence that HO-1 induction represents an important cytoprotective defense mechanism against oxidative insults by virtue of the anti-oxidant properties of the bilirubin and the anti-inflammatory effect of the CO produced (2Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 79-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). HO-1 is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a single transmembrane segment (TMS) located at the C terminus, while the rest of the molecule is cytoplasmic (3Yoshida T. Sato M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HO-1 is sensitive to proteolytic cleavage (4Yoshida T. Ishikawa K. Sato M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it was recently shown that HO-1 can be proteolytically cleaved from the ER and translocated to the nucleus under certain stress conditions (5Lin Q.

Numerous studies have revealed that interactions between TMSs play an important role in the structure and function of many membrane proteins. Examples include receptors, enzymes, neurotransmitter transporters, and ion channels, in which oligomerization is crucial for their proper cellular localization and function (8Marianayagam N.J. Sunde M. Matthews J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). HO-1 does not contain any cysteine residues and has therefore been assumed to function as a monomer (1Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). To determine whether HO-1 forms oligomers in native membranes, in the present study, we performed chemical cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and FRET analysis using fluorescent protein tags fused to the N terminus of HO-1. The results showed that HO-1 formed dimers/oligomers in the ER and that the TMS provided the interface for the protein-protein interactions. Interference with the TMS-TMS interaction resulted in destabilization of HO-1 and a reduction in enzymatic function. cDNAs for human full-length HO-1 (HO-1-FL) and HO-1 with a 42-amino acid truncation at the C terminus (HO-1-CΔ42) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into the PLNCX2 vector. Flag-tagged HO-1 was constructed by subcloning full-length HO-1 cDNA into the pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector. Full-length HO-1 and C-terminal 24 amino acid truncated HO-1 (HO-1-CΔ24) with CFP or YFP fused to the N terminus were constructed by subcloning the respective cDNAs into the pECFP-C1 or pEYFP-C1 vector (BD Bioscience Clontech). The CFP or YFP fusion HO-1-W270A and HO-1-W270N mutant constructs were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR (9Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/l glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in an environment of 5% CO2, 95% air in a humidified atmosphere. Cell transfection was performed using Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For confocal microscopy and FRET assay, cells were plated on poly l-lysine-coated glass cover slips (42 mm) (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and transiently transfected with an equimolar ratio of CFP and YFP fusion HO-1 plasmids and were used 24 h after transfection. To examine localization of the protein in the ER, cells were cotransfected with an equimolar ratio of YFP fusion HO-1 plasmid and pDsRed-ER(BD Biosciences Clontech), a plasmid coding for a red fluorescent protein expressed specifically in the ER. Cells (3 × 106) were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 500 μl of cold hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem), and homogenized by 30 passages through a 27-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets washed once with hypotonic buffer and nuclear proteins extracted for 20 min on ice using hypotonic buffer containing 420 mm NaCl. The extracts were then centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants collected as the nuclear extract. The supernatants from the first centrifugation were subjected to further centrifugation at 227,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate the cytosol and microsomes. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mm dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] (DSP) (Pierce), and the cross-linker quenched with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The cells were then lysed with SDS sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the presence or absence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, then the proteins were transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-HO-1 antibody as described previously (10Lin P.H. Chiang M.T. Chau L.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1826-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with the Flag-HO-1 plasmid and/or YFP-HO-1 plasmid for 24 h were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture set III), and the lysate centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the Flag HO-1 was purified using ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma). Briefly, prior to the incubation with cell lysate, the affinity gel was washed twice with 20× volume of TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), followed by a wash with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5. The gel was then washed three times again with TBS buffer containing 0.5% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The cell lysate was incubated with the washed gel overnight at 4 °C with continuous shaking. The gel was then washed three times with lysis buffer and bound proteins eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer for 3 min. Confocal images were obtained using a PerkinElmer Ultra-view confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Epi-fluorescence images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a mercury lamp and the following filter cubes (nm): (1) CFP cube: EX 436/20, EM 480/40, DCLP 455; (2) YFP cube: EX 500/20, EM 535/30, DCLP 515; (3) FRET cube: EX 436/20, EM 535/30, DCLP 455 (Omega Optical). Images were recorded with a CoolView-IDI intensifier CCD (Photonic Science). The FR was determined using the 3-cube FRET approach (11Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The FR is equal to the fractional increase in YFP emission due to FRET and is calculated in Equation 1.

The effective FRET efficiency (FE) was determined in Equation 2. FE=(FR−1)[εYFP(440)/εCFP(440)](Eq. 2) The bracketed term is the ratio of the YFP and CFP molar extinction coefficients scaled for the FRET cube excitation filter (11Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and was previously determined to be 0.094 (11Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 25-residue peptide of human HO-1 (QAPLLRW270VLTLSFLVATVAVGLYAM) and two peptides containing W270A and W270N mutations, respectively, were synthesized by JPT Peptide Technologies, Inc (Berlin, Germany) and purchased through its distributor, Prisma Biotech Co. (Taipei, Taiwan). Peptide purity was ∼91% based on HPLC analysis, and the sequence was confirmed by mass spectrometry. CD experiments were performed on an AVIV 202 SF CD spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ) calibrated with d-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 25 °C. The synthesized wild-type peptide (20 μm) dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) in a 1-mm pathlength cuvette was used for CD experiments. In experiments comparing the wild-type and mutated peptides, SDS was increased to 200 mm to enhance the solubility of the mutated peptides. The steady-state CD spectra were recorded from 180 to 260 nm at a scanning rate of 38 nm/min with a wavelength step of 0.5 nm and time constant of 100 ms. All CD data were obtained from an average of 3 scans with a 1-nm bandwidth. After background subtraction and smoothing, all the CD data were converted from the CD signal (millidegree) into the mean residue ellipticity (deg cm2 dmol−1). The quantitative estimation of secondary structure content was performed using three programs, CONTIN/LL, SELCON3, and CDSSTR, accordingly (12Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with indicated HO-1 plasmid constructs for 24 h. Cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The whole cell lysate was prepared and HO activity was determined as described previously (13Yang N.C. Lu L.H. Kao Y.H. Chau L.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2004; 11: 799-809PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the microsomal HO activity, the subcellular fractionation was performed as described above to isolate microsomal fraction. 100 μg of microsomal proteins were then used for HO activity assay. The HO activities in different microsomal preparations were normalized to the corresponding HO-1 protein levels determined by Western blotting. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Group data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To test the possibility that HO-1 forms oligomers in the ER, we expressed full-length human HO-1 (HO-1-FL) and a soluble form lacking the C-terminal 42 residues (HO-1-CΔ42) in HEK293 cells. The cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a thiol-cleavable, amine-reactive cross-linker, DSP. As shown in Fig. 1A, HO-1 dimers and higher oligomers were formed in cells expressing HO-1-FL, but not those expressing HO-1-CΔ42, and the HO-1 dimers and oligomers were reduced to monomers by dithiothreitol. Oligomerization was observed not only in cells with high, but also moderate levels of HO-1 expression, indicating that it was not caused by the aggregation of overexpressed protein. HO-1 protein-protein interactions were also demonstrated in cells co-expressing yellow fluorescent protein-tagged full-length HO-1 (YFP-HO-1-FL) and Flag-tagged full-length HO-1 (Flag-HO-1-FL). As shown in Fig. 1B, when Flag-HO-1-FL was immunoprecipitated from these cells using anti-Flag antibody-conjugated agarose, YFP-HO-1-FL was detected in the immunoprecipitate by Western blot analysis. However, YFP-HO-1-FL was not co-immunoprecipitated from a mixture of cell lysates containing either Flag-HO-1-FL or YFP-HO-1-FL, supporting the idea that the interaction of Flag-HO-1-FL and YFP-HO-1-FL observed in the co-expressing cells occurred prior to detergent solubilization. To examine the intermolecular interactions of HO-1 in living cells, we next performed FRET analysis using the three cube method (11Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)- and YFP-tagged versions of full-length HO-1 (CFP-HO-1-FL and YFP-HO-1-FL) and a second truncated form lacking the C-terminal 24 residues (CFP-HO-1-CΔ24 and YFP-HO-1-CΔ24) were used in the experiments. HEK293 cells expressing YFP and CFP were used as the background control. The subcellular localization of the two YFP-fused HO-1 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells was first examined by confocal microscopy. Fig. 2A shows that YFP-HO-1-FL was found exclusively in the ER, whereas YFP-HO-1-CΔ24 was found in the cytosol and nucleus, but not the ER. The HO activity determined in cells overexpressing YFP-HO-1-CΔ24 was significantly lower as compared with that in cells overexpressing YFP-HO-1-FL (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C shows the epi-fluorescence images obtained using the CFP, YFP, or FRET cube in cells expressing the indicated proteins and the corresponding FRET ratio (FR), the fractional increase in YFP emission due to FRET. In the absence of FRET, the FR is 1, while, when FRET increases, the FR is greater than 1 and reaches a theoretical maximum of 12 if the fluorescence pairs undergo FRET with 100% FRET efficiency (FE) (11Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Fig. 2D shows the averaged FR and the corresponding FE. The FR of control cells co-expressing CFP and YFP was 1.14 ± 0.04, with an FE of 1.3 ± 0.1%, indicating there was no interaction between free CFP and YFP, even though both were overexpressed. In cells co-expressing CFP-HO-1-FL and YFP-HO-1-FL (“HO-1-FL”), the averaged FR was 2.01 ± 0.10 and the FE 9.5 ± 0.1%, supporting the idea of intermolecular interactions of HO-1 molecules in the ER membrane. However, in cells co-expressing CFP-HO-1- CΔ24 and YFP-HO-1-CΔ24 (“HO-1- CΔ24”), the FR was 1.20 ± 0.02 and the FE 1.9 ± 0.1%, indicating that the TMS is crucial not only for ER localization, but also for the protein-protein interaction of HO-1. When fluorescent proteins are overexpressed, concentration-dependent FRET may occur (14Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar). Because HO-1 was expressed in large amounts in the ER membrane, we next determined whether the high FR ratio observed in cells co-expressing CFP-HO-1-FL and YFP-HO-1-FL was due to a concentration-dependent artifact. Fig. 2E shows the relationship between the FR and the fluorescence intensity, which is proportional to the protein concentration. We found that the FR was not higher in cells expressing higher concentrations of CFP-HO-1-FL, CFP-HO-1-CΔ24, or CFP. In addition, even though the fluorescence intensity of CFP was as high as that of CFP-HO-1-FL, the FR was much lower in cells co-expressing CFP and YFP than in those co-expressing CFP-HO-1-FL and YFP-HO-1-FL. These results show that the high FR between CFP-HO-1-FL and YFP-HO-1-FL is not a concentration-dependent artifact. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of HO-1 is highly conserved across different species (Fig. 3A). However, the tertiary structure of the HO-1 TMS has not been determined empirically. We synthesized the C-terminal 25-residue peptide of human HO-1 and performed CD experiments in the presence of SDS or DPC, both of which can form micelles and are commonly used to mimic membrane environments. We found that the CD spectra of the peptide in the presence of SDS or DPC were similar at different pH values (pH 3.0–9.0) (data not shown), indicating that the secondary structure of the peptide was pH-independent. Also, the CD spectra of the peptide in SDS or DPC showed two pronounced CD troughs at 208 and 222 nm and a peak at 191.5 nm (Fig. 3B), showing that the peptide was mainly in the form of α-helix in a membrane environment. We also used COILS (15Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar) and Paircoil (16McDonnell A.V. Jiang T. Keating A.E. Berger B. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) to predict whether the human HO-1 TM helix (residues 264–288) folds as a coiled coil. Both methods predicted heptad repeats indicated by the a-g positions, as shown in Fig. 4A. The amino acids at the “a” and “d” positions were hydrophobic, as in a typical coiled coil. When these residues were placed on the helical wheel generated by GCG (Accelrys Inc., San Diego), Leu-267, Leu-274, and Val-281 were found to be in the “a” position, whereas Trp-270, Leu-277, and Gly-284 were in the “d” position (Fig. 4B). We propose that these residues form the interface between two HO-1 TM α-helices, as shown in the manually docked model (Fig. 4C). The TM segment (residues 267–285) in each molecule was modeled as a right-handed α-helix by the InsightII program (Accelrys Inc. San Diego).FIGURE 4Prediction of a heptad repeat in the TM helix (residues 267–285) of HO-1. Using the COILS and Paircoil2 methods, a heptad repeat (a-g positions) in the TM helix was predicted, as shown in the sequence (A) or on a helical wheel (B). The amino acids at the “a” and “d” positions are hydrophobic, as in a typical coiled coil. C, proposed interface between two HO-1 TM α-helices.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Trp-270, an aromatic amino acid conserved in vertebrate HO-1s, may contribute a strong thermodynamic force in the interface, we proposed that mutation of Trp-270 might have an impact on the oligomeric state of HO-1. To test this, two HO-1 mutants, YFP-HO-1-W270A and YFP-HO-1-W270N, were constructed and their expression, function, and subcellular localization in HEK293 cells examined. The W270A mutation did not significantly affect the subcellular localization of HO-1 (Fig. 5A). Although the activity of W270A HO-1 was slightly lower than that of wild type HO-1, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.102) (Fig. 5C). In contrast, YFP-HO-1-W270N was localized not only in the ER, but also in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5A), suggesting that this mutant is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. The subcellular localization of the W270N mutant was confirmed by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 5B). In addition, HO enzymatic activity in the microsomal fraction of cells expressing the W270N mutant was significantly lower than that in cells expressing wild type HO-1 (Fig. 5C). To examine whether the different Trp-270 mutations have differential effects on the TMS α-helical structure, we performed additional CD experiments with the synthetic C-terminal peptides containing these mutations. Fig. 6 shows the CD spectra of these peptides in the presence of SDS. We then used three different methods, SELCON3, CONTIN/LL, and CDSSTR, to perform the quantitative analysis of the secondary structure content of each peptide (12Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). The results were summarized in Table 1. It was noted that the averaged α-helix contents of wild-type. W270A, and W270N peptides were about 60–70%, indicating that the α-helix remained as a main structure for the mutated peptides. This observation suggests that the effect of W270N mutation on HO-1 stability and enzymatic activity was not due to the impact on the α-helix of HO-1 TMS. To examine whether the Trp-270 mutations affected HO-1 intermolecular interactions, FRET was performed on the YFP- and CFP-fused mutant proteins. Fig. 7A shows the epi-fluorescence images obtained. Fig. 7B shows that the FR and FE in the granular or perinuclear ER in cells expressing the W270A mutant were not significantly different from those in cells expressing wild type HO-1. In contrast, the FRET signal detected in the ER of cells expressing the W270N mutant was significantly lower than that in cells expressing wild type HO-1 (Fig. 7B). Moreover, the FR observed in the cytoplasm of cells expressing the W270N mutant was close to 1 (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 6The CD spectra of the HO-1 TMS containing Trp-270 mutations.

Although oligomerization is a common feature of many proteins containing a single TMS, whether HO-1 could undergo oligomerization was not known. To test this possibility, we first performed chemical cross-linking on intact cells overexpressing HO-1 using a membrane permeable cross-linker, DSP. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis revealed the formation of HO-1 dimers and higher oligomers, which was not influenced by the protein concentration. The co-immunoprecipitation of Flag-HO-1 and YFP-HO-1 from lysates of cells co-expressing these two proteins provided support for HO-1 protein-protein interactions. In addition to the biochemical assessments, we also performed FRET analysis to examine protein-protein interactions in live cells. Consistent with the biochemical results, the FRET data provided convincing evidence to support the existence of HO-1 as preformed oligomers in the ER. Moreover, no oligomerization was observed for the truncated HO-1 lacking the TMS, indicating that the protein-protein interactions are driven by the TMS. A recent study demonstrated that the TMS is essential for the maximal catalytic activity of a recombinant human HO-1 in an in vitro assay (17Huber 3rd, W.J. Backes W.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12212-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the TMS can increase the binding of HO-1 to NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (17Huber 3rd, W.J. Backes W.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12212-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present finding demonstrates a new role of the TMS in the formation of the quaternary structure of HO-1 in native membranes. The crystal structures of the soluble human and rat HO-1 lacking the TMS have been determined (18Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 19Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), but nothing is known about the tertiary and quaternary structures of the TMS in HO-1. Structural studies on membrane proteins have revealed that the TMS is often α-helical (6Arkin I.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Mackenzie K.R. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1931-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Using CD spectroscopy and molecular modeling, we predicted that the HO-1 TMS folds as an α-helix. Transmembrane helix-helix interactions have been reported for several proteins with single transmembrane α-helices (6Arkin I.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Mackenzie K.R. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1931-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), but information regarding the sequence motifs required for the interactions is limited. The human erythrocyte glycophorin A is the most characterized membrane protein where the dimerization has been shown to be mediated through a GXXXG motif in the transmembrane helices (20Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H.R. Adams P.D. Brünger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 21Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Studies on a membrane-helix model have revealed that the hydrogen bonds formed by polar residues, such as Asn, Asp, or Glu, can drive the self-association of membrane helices (22Zhou F.X Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 23Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct.

Moreover, a heptad repeat sequence with a leucine zipper motif can also contribute to the lateral interactions of TMS through van der Waals interactions (27Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The HO-1 TMS does not contain these typical interaction motifs. However, computational modeling predicted a heptad repeat in which the residues at the “a” and “d” positions consisted of three Leu (Leu-267, Leu-274, and Leu-277), one Val (Val-281), one Trp (Trp-270), and one Gly (Gly-284), which may serve as the interface for the helix-helix interaction through aliphatic side-chain packing. Because Trp has been shown to stabilize the self-association of helices through aromatic ring π-π interactions (28Ridder A. Skupjen P. Unterreitmeier S. Langosch D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Bloch I. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19753-19761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we proposed that Trp-270 may have an impact on the lateral interactions between TMSs. The W270A mutation did not significantly affect HO-1 ER localization and oligomerization, indicating that the aromatic π interaction of Trp was not required for the TMS-TMS interaction. Although Asn residues in two transmembrane α-helices can theoretically form interhelical hydrogen bonds, which might contribute to dimer formation (22Zhou F.X Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 23Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the W270N mutation resulted in weaker oligomerization, as revealed by the lower FRET efficiency. Because W270N mutation did not affect the α-helix structure as shown in CD experiment, we speculated that the polar interactions introduced by Asn in the HO-1 TMS somehow decreased the packing effects of other interfacial residues. More studies are required to clarify this issue. Interestingly, the W270N mutation significantly increased the susceptibility of HO-1 to proteolysis without affecting its integration in the ER membrane. These observations clearly support the importance of oligomerization in the proper organization and stabilization of HO-1 in the ER membrane. Moreover, the activity of microsomal W270N HO-1 was significantly lower than that of the wild type HO-1, suggesting that the oligomeric state may have an impact on the catalytic function of HO-1 in the ER. A previous study showed that NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and biliverdin reductase bind to soluble human HO-1 at sites, which are partially overlapping or allosterically modulated (30Wang J. de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Higashimoto Y. Sugishima M. Sato H. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Palmer G. Noguchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 852-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that oligomerization may allow the simultaneous binding of these two proteins on different HO-1 monomers and facilitate the cooperative reaction needed for heme degradation and subsequent bilirubin production. We noticed that the activity of W270A HO-1 was also slightly lower than that of wild type HO-1, although the difference was not statistically significant. The possibility that Trp-270 mutations to other amino acids might affect to various extents the interaction between HO-1 TMS and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (17Huber 3rd, W.J. Backes W.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12212-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) cannot be completely ruled out in the present study. Further work is required to clarify this issue. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the TMS of HO-1 not only functions as a membrane anchor, but also drives the self-association which is crucial for the stabilization and function of HO-1 in the ER. Given the importance of HO-1 in various pathophysiological states associated with cellular stress, genetic variations affecting TMS-TMS interactions may have a significant impact on disease progression. Moreover, whether the oligomeric state can be altered under specific cellular contexts, such as oxidative stress and hypoxia, remains to be explored. Although our data support the importance of Trp-270 in the TMS-TMS interaction, the roles of other residues require further investigation. To gain further insights into the structural framework of helix-helix interactions, studies are currently in progress to determine the structure of HO-1 TMS-TMS dimers in detergent micelles by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance."

https://openalex.org/W2086255996,"Subcellular retrograde transport of cargo receptors from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network is critically involved in a broad range of physiological and pathological processes and highly regulated by a genetically conserved heteropentameric complex, termed retromer. Among the retromer components identified in mammals, sorting nexin 5 and 1 (SNX5; SNX1) have recently been found to interact, possibly controlling the membrane binding specificity of the complex. To elucidate how the unique sequence features of the SNX5 phox domain (SNX5-PX) influence retrograde transport, we have determined the SNX5-PX structure by NMR and x-ray crystallography at 1.5 A resolution. Although the core fold of SNX5-PX resembles that of other known PX domains, we found novel structural features exclusive to SNX5-PX. It is most noteworthy that in SNX5-PX, a long helical hairpin is added to the core formed by a new alpha2'-helix and a much longer alpha3-helix. This results in a significantly altered overall shape of the protein. In addition, the unique double PXXP motif is tightly packed against the rest of the protein, rendering this part of the structure compact, occluding parts of the putative phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) binding pocket. The PtdIns binding and specificity of SNX5-PX was evaluated by NMR titrations with eight different PtdIns and revealed that SNX5-PX preferentially and specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). The distinct structural and PtdIns binding characteristics of SNX5-PX impart specific properties on SNX5, influencing retromer-mediated regulation of retrograde trafficking of transmembrane cargo receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2082736347,"Neural networks that regulate an organism's internal environment must sense perturbations, respond appropriately, and then reset. These adaptations should be reflected as changes in the efficacy of the synapses that drive the final output of these homeostatic networks. Here we show that hemorrhage, an in vivo challenge to fluid homeostasis, induces LTD at glutamate synapses onto hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs). LTD requires the activation of postsynaptic α2-adrenoceptors and the production of endocannabinoids that act in a retrograde fashion to inhibit glutamate release. In addition, both hemorrhage and noradrenaline downregulate presynaptic group III mGluRs. This loss of mGluR function allows high-frequency activity to potentiate these synapses from their depressed state. These findings demonstrate that noradrenaline controls a form of metaplasticity that may underlie the resetting of homeostatic networks following a successful response to an acute physiological challenge."

Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) is required for this gradient. To test whether graded FGF concentrations can instruct graded gene expression, a quantitative tectal explant assay was developed. Engrailed-2 and ephrin-As, normally in posterior > anterior tectal gradients, showed graded upregulation. Moreover, EphAs, normally in anterior > posterior countergradients, showed coordinately graded downregulation. These results provide a mechanism to establish graded mapping labels and more generally provide a developmental strategy to coordinately induce a structure and pattern its cell properties in gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2031964906,"Laminins are large heterotrimeric glycoproteins with many essential functions in basement membrane assembly and function. Cell adhesion to laminins is mediated by a tandem of five laminin G-like (LG) domains at the C terminus of the α chain. Integrin binding requires an intact LG1-3 region, as well as contributions from the coiled coil formed by the α, β, and γ chains. We have determined the crystal structure at 2.8-Å resolution of the LG1-3 region of the laminin α2 chain (α2LG1-3). The three LG domains adopt typical β-sandwich folds, with canonical calcium binding sites in LG1 and LG2. LG2 and LG3 interact through a substantial interface, but LG1 is completely dissociated from the LG2-3 pair. We suggest that the missing γ chain tail may be required to stabilize the interaction between LG1 and LG2-3 in the biologically active conformation. A global analysis of N-linked glycosylation sites shows that the β-sandwich faces of LG1 are free of carbohydrate modifications in all five laminin α chains, suggesting that these surfaces may harbor the integrin binding site.

The laminins constitute a major class of cell-adhesive glycoproteins that are intimately involved in basement membrane assembly and function.

DNA coding for residues 2136–2746 (QANSI … MVHGP) of the mouse laminin α2 chain was obtained by PCR amplification from a cDNA kindly provided by Takako Sasaki. The sequence corresponds to NCBI entry NP_032507, but is missing residues 2476–2479 corresponding to exon 53 of the mouse LAMA2 gene (24Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The PCR primers added EcoRI and NheI sites at the 5′-end and NotI and BamHI sites at the 3′-end. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript II KS+ using EcoRI and BamHI. Using strand overlap extension PCR, the codons for residues 2566–2578 (TLTPPRRKRRQTT) were replaced by a GGA triplet coding for glycine. The sequence-verified insert was cloned into a modified pCEP-Pu vector (25Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) using NheI and NotI. After cleavage of the BM-40 sequence signal, a vector-derived APLA sequence remains at the N terminus of the secreted recombinant α2LG1-3 protein, and a AAAHHHHHH sequence is added at the C terminus. The laminin α2LG1-3 protein was purified from the conditioned medium of episomally transfected 293-EBNA cells. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen), transfected using FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science), and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Confluent cells were maintained for 12 h in DMEM with 10% FCS supplemented with 5 μm kifunensine (Industrial Research Ltd), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 5 μm kifunensine for 3 days. The conditioned medium was loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) and the α2LG1-3 protein eluted with 0.5 m imidazole in Tris-buffered saline buffer pH 7.4 supplemented with 5 mm calcium (TBS-Ca). The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare) run at 0.5 ml/min in TBS-Ca buffer. To remove the N-linked glycan, the α2LG1-3 protein was incubated with endoglycosidase H (expressed in Escherichia coli using a plasmid kindly provided by Dan Leahy) overnight at room temperature in an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:10. The deglycosylated protein was purified from the reaction mixture by a second size exclusion chromatography step in TBS-Ca buffer and concentrated to 7 mg/ml for crystallization. Initial crystallization screening was carried out in 100-nl sitting drops using a Mosquito Nanodrop robot (TTP Labtech). Large, needle-shaped crystals were grown in 2-μl hanging drops using 0.1 m bis-Tris propane pH 6.5–7.0, 0.2 m sodium citrate, 18–22% PEG3350 as precipitant and flash-frozen to 100 K in precipitant solution supplemented with 20% glycerol. The crystals were found to belong to space group P6x with unit cell dimensions a = b = 138.83 Å, c = 73.89 Å; there is one α2LG1-3 molecule in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of ∼60%. Diffraction data to 2.8-Å resolution were collected from a weakly diffracting single crystal at 100 K on beamline 10.1 at the SRS Daresbury (λ = 1.045 Å). The diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM and programs of the CCP4 suite (26CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19734) Google Scholar).

All attempts to locate LG3 at this stage proved unsuccessful. After cautious rebuilding with O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (translation Z-score of 13.8, Rfree = 0.476). The α2LG1-3 model was completed in many rounds of rebuilding and refinement. The final model (Rfree = 0.266) encompasses residues 2142–2707, but the following residues are missing due to lack of electron density: 2146–2149 and 2310–2313 in LG1; 2325–2332 in the LG1-2 linker; 2564–2578, 2598–2601, and 2664–2672 in LG3. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The figures were made with PYMOL. The coordinates of the α2LG1-3 structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry code: 2wjs). The laminin α2LG1-3 region contains a basic sequence in LG3, 2571-RRKRR-2575, that is proteolytically cleaved during protein expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (24Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our initial efforts in crystallizing α2LG1-3 focused on a triple mutant, R2571A/K2573A/R2575A, which had been shown to be resistant to proteolytic processing (32Talts J.F. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, we found that these three mutations did not completely suppress proteolysis. The RRKRR sequence is located in a long loop that is only present in LG3, but not in any of the other four LG domains of laminin α chains (31Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We therefore replaced the entire predicted loop sequence, TLTPPRRKRRQTT, with a single glycine residue. This deletion mutant, hereafter simply termed α2LG1-3, was highly expressed by the 293 cells with no evidence of proteolytic processing. After extensive screening, the best crystals of this construct did not diffract beyond 4-Å resolution. The α2LG1-3 region contains six potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and we suspected that the large amount of glycan was contributing to the poor order of our crystals. We therefore expressed the α2LG1-3 protein in the presence of the α-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine and removed the resulting immature glycan with endoglycosidase H (33Chang V.T. Crispin M. Aricescu A.R. Harvey D.J. Nettleship J.E. Fennelly J.A. Yu C. Boles K.S. Evans E.J. Stuart D.I. Dwek R.A. Jones E.Y. Owens R.J. Davis S.J. Structure. 2007; 15: 267-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The endoglycosidase H-treated protein could be crystallized in a new crystal form that diffracted to 2.8-Å resolution. The α2LG1-3 structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a free R-factor of 0.266 (Table 1). The overall structure of laminin α2LG1-3 in our crystals is shown in Fig. 1A. While there is a substantial interface between domains LG2 and LG3 (see below), LG1 surprisingly makes no contact with either LG2 or LG3, and seven residues in the LG1-2 linker have no electron density. SDS-PAGE analysis of dissolved crystals confirmed that the crystallized protein is intact and not proteolysed at the LG1-2 junction (data not shown). The gap between LG1 and LG2 measures 22.5 Å, a distance that can be spanned by the seven disordered residues in the LG1-2 linker. The unique molecule shown in Fig. 1A is the only one with a physically possible distance between LG1 and LG2; in the crystal lattice, all alternative combinations of LG2–3 with symmetry-related LG1 domains are physically impossible. The open conformation of α2LG1-3 is stabilized by a multitude of crystal packing interactions involving LG1. The dissociation of LG1 from the remainder of the molecule is likely to be a consequence of the missing coiled coil and β and γ chain tails (see “Discussion”). The three LG domains of laminin α2LG1-3 adopt the canonical β-sandwich fold of the LG domain superfamily, including the conserved disulfide bridge near the domain C terminus (7Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 34Rudenko G. Hohenester E. Muller Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 363-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). An additional disulfide bridge (between Cys-2150 and Cys-2321) links the N and C termini of LG1. The A-B and L-N loops are disordered in LG1, but the two disulfide bridges in this region have strong electron density and unambiguously anchor the domain termini. The coiled coil of laminin α chains is predicted to extend right up to β-strand A (35Beck K. Hunter I. Engel J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), which has weak density in our structure. LG2 and the linker to LG3 could be traced without interruption. In LG3 three spatially adjacent loops are disordered: D-E (the site of the engineered 12-residue deletion), F-G, and K-L. Four N-acetylglucosamine moieties remaining after endoglycosidase H digestion are included in the model (Fig. 1A). They are attached, respectively, to Asn-2236 (LG1), Asn-2356, and Asn-2431 (LG2), and Asn-2554 (LG3). Patchy electron density at Asn-2644 (LG3) suggests that this residue is also modified. The only potential glycosylation site that does not appear to be modified is Asn-2547 (LG3). Strong spherical electron densities in LG1 and LG2 indicated the presence of two metal ions, which were modeled as calcium (present at 2.5 mm concentration in the crystallization mixture). The calcium ion in LG1 is bound to the side chains of Asp-2189 and Asp-2268 and the carbonyl oxygens of residues 2206 and 2266, with an average metal-ligand density of 2.6 Å. The calcium ion in LG2 is bound to the side chains of Asp-2383 and Asp-2457 and the carbonyl oxygens of residues 2400 and 2455, with an average metal-ligand density of 2.5 Å. The calcium binding sites of α2LG1-3 are in equivalent positions to the functionally important calcium binding sites of laminin α1LG4-5 (21Harrison D. Hussain S.A. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M.

At the calcium binding site in LG2, there is additional strong electron density 2.7 Å from the carboxylate group of Asp-2383; this density was modeled satisfactorily as another calcium ion, but it could well be derived from some other, unidentified, buffer component. Comparison of the three LG domains of laminin α2LG1-3 emphasizes the conserved β-sandwich core of the three domains and shows that LG3 diverges most from the common template of laminin LG domains (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The segments that make up the top rim of the LG domain, especially the B-C and J-K linkers, follow a unique path in LG3, and the long D-E loop that is deleted in our construct would project from this region. LG3 also has an unusually short I-J hairpin. The divergent structure of LG3 explains why this domain was difficult to locate in molecular replacement searches. The LG2–3 interface in the laminin α2LG1-3 structure buries as much as 990 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface and thus may be stable under physiological conditions. Prominent features of the interface are: an apolar cluster near the LG2–3 linker, consisting of Phe-2367 (LG2), Leu-2519 (LG2), and Val-2522 (LG3); a salt bridge between Asp-2340 (LG2) and Arg-2705 (LG3); and a hydrogen bond between Glu-2342 (LG2) and the main chain of LG3 (Fig. 2). The relative orientation of LG domains in the α2LG2-3 pair differs substantially from that previously observed in α2LG4-5 (22Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the two pairs are superimposed on their respective N-terminal LG domains (LG2 and LG4), a rotation by 58° degrees is required to bring their C-terminal LG domains (LG3 and LG5) into superposition (not shown). Recent studies have shown that a glutamic acid at the C terminus of the laminin γ chain is essential for integrin binding, most likely by promoting an active LG1-3 conformation (15Ido H. Nakamura A.

We used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine whether the crystallized α2LG1-3 protein interacts with a synthetic peptide spanning the last nine residues of the mouse laminin γ1 chain, but no binding could be observed up to a peptide concentration of 70 μm (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the γ chain tail interacts with the α chain only when these two elements are joined in an intact laminin heterotrimer. The available data suggest that both the coiled coil and LG1-3 region of laminins are required for integrin binding, but the precise location of the integrin binding site is unknown (13Deutzmann R.

Because bulky carbohydrate modifications often shield much of the surface of extracellular proteins, their absence from certain regions may be indicative of functionally important protein-protein interaction sites (42Rudd P.M.

Immunol. 2003; 15: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the general location of the integrin binding site is likely to be conserved in all laminin α chains and investigated whether there are any large surface regions in LG1-3 that are not obstructed by carbohydrate modifications. This analysis revealed that the overall distribution of putative N-linked carbohydrates in the LG1-3 region is markedly uneven: considering all five mouse and human laminin α chains, there are a total of five sites in LG1, ten in LG2, and another ten in LG3 (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Strikingly, both faces of the LG1 β-sandwich are free of carbohydrate in all laminin α chains, whereas LG2 and LG3 are modified on every face in at least one α chain (Fig. 4). Based on this observation, we speculate that LG1 may provide an essential protein surface for integrin recognition in all laminin heterotrimers.FIGURE 4Location of N-linked glycosylation sites in the LG1-3 structure. Shown are two surface representations of the α2LG1-3 structure (LG1, green; LG2, blue; LG3, brown) related by a rotation of 180° about a vertical axis. The LG1-2 linker is shown as a black line. The predicted attachment site in LG1 of the coiled coil region is indicated by a gray arrow. Every N-linked glycosylation site present in one or more of the five mouse or human laminin α chains has been mapped onto the α2LG1-3 structure (see text) and marked by a branched core hexasaccharide (magenta). The left view is similar to the one in Fig. 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functionally important binding sites are often located by analyzing the evolutionary conservation of a protein surface, provided that the mode binding is conserved in all homologues. Unfortunately, the laminin α chains are not well suited for such an approach, because the different α chains are quite divergent (the sequence identity for any pairwise alignment typically is 20–30%) and do not all interact with the same integrin heterodimer (9Nishiuchi R.

https://openalex.org/W2013052673,"NK4, a fragment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), exerts bifunctional action as a competitive antagonist against HGF and its receptor c-Met and an angiogenesis inhibitor. Here we studied the anti-angiogenic mechanism of NK4. In cultured human endothelial cells, NK4 inhibited DNA synthesis induced not only by HGF but also by either basic fibroblast growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor. Even if c-Met expression was diminished by small interference RNA, NK4 inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis, indicating that anti-angiogenic action of NK4 is c-Met-independent. Affinity purification with NK4-immobilized beads revealed that NK4 binds to perlecan. Consistent with this, NK4 colocalized with perlecan in endothelial cells. Perlecan is a multidomain heparan sulfate proteoglycan that interacts with basement membrane components such as fibronectin. NK4 inhibited extracellular assembly of fibronectin, by which fibronectin-dependent endothelial cell spreading was inhibited by NK4. Knockdown of perlecan expression by small interference RNA significantly abrogated the inhibitory effect of NK4 on fibronectin assembly and cell spreading. In NK4-treated endothelial cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and Rac activation were reduced, whereas overexpression of activated Rac recovered the DNA synthesis in NK4-treated endothelial cells. These results indicate that the association between NK4 and perlecan impairs fibronectin assembly, thereby inhibiting anchorage-dependent signaling. The identified mechanism for angiostatic action provides further proof of significance for NK4 in the treatment of cancer and potentially for vascular regulation as well."
https://openalex.org/W1979118635,"The Yersinia protein kinase A (YpkA) and outer protein J (YopJ) are co-expressed from a single transcript and are injected directly into eukaryotic cells by the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis. When overexpressed in vertebrate or yeast cells, YpkA disrupts the actin-based cytoskeletal system by an unknown mechanism, whereas YopJ obstructs inductive chemokine expression by inhibiting MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling. Previously, we showed that the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was sensitive to the kinase activity of YpkA. Here, we screened yeast for cellular processes important for YpkA activity and found that the eIF2alpha kinases mollify the toxicity imparted by the kinase activity of YpkA. Specifically, strains lacking the eIF2alpha kinase Hri2 were particularly sensitive to YpkA. Unexpectedly, the activity of YopJ, which conferred a phenotype consistent with its inhibitory effect on MAPK signaling, was also found to be dependent on Hri2. When expressed in S. pombe, YopJ sensitized cells to osmotic and oxidative stresses through a Hri2-dependent mechanism. However, when co-expressed with YpkA, YopJ protected cells from YpkA-mediated toxicity, and this protection was entirely dependent on Hri2. In contrast, YopJ did not confer protection against the toxic effects of the Yersinia virulence factor YopE. These findings are the first to functionally link YpkA and YopJ and suggest that eIF2alpha kinases, which are critically important in antiviral defenses and protection against environmental stresses, also play a role in bacterial virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2065627901,"Some hyperthermophilic archaea use a modified glycolytic pathway that employs an ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADP-GK) and an ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ADP-PFK) or, in the case of Methanococcus jannaschii, a bifunctional ADP-dependent glucophosphofructokinase (ADP-GK/PFK). The crystal structures of three ADP-GKs have been determined. However, there is no structural information available for ADP-PFKs or the ADP-GK/PFK. Here, we present the first crystal structure of an ADP-PFK from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhPFK) in both apo- and AMP-bound forms determined to 2.0-A and 1.9-A resolution, respectively, along with biochemical characterization of the enzyme. The overall structure of PhPFK maintains a similar large and small alpha/beta domain structure seen in the ADP-GK structures. A large conformational change accompanies binding of phosphoryl donor, acceptor, or both, in all members of the ribokinase superfamily characterized thus far, which is believed to be critical to enzyme function. Surprisingly, no such conformational change was observed in the AMP-bound PhPFK structure compared with the apo structure. Through comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis of the substrate binding pocket we identified residues that were critical for both substrate recognition and the phosphotransfer reaction. The catalytic residues and many of the substrate binding residues are conserved between PhPFK and ADP-GKs; however, four key residues differ in the sugar-binding pocket, which we have shown determine the sugar-binding specificity. Using these results we were able to engineer a mutant PhPFK that mimics the ADP-GK/PFK and is able to phosphorylate both fructose 6-phosphate and glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2078465478,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) has many essential functions and its homeostasis is highly regulated. We previously found that hypertonic stress increases PIP(2) by selectively activating the beta isoform of the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5Kbeta) through Ser/Thr dephosphorylation and promoting its translocation to the plasma membrane. Here we report that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) also induces PIP5Kbeta Ser/Thr dephosphorylation, but it has the opposite effect on PIP(2) homeostasis, PIP5Kbeta function, and the actin cytoskeleton. Brief H(2)O(2) treatments decrease cellular PIP(2) in a PIP5Kbeta-dependent manner. PIP5Kbeta is tyrosine phosphorylated, dissociates from the plasma membrane, and has decreased lipid kinase activity. In contrast, the other two PIP5K isoforms are not inhibited by H(2)O(2). We identified spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which is activated by oxidants, as a candidate PIP5Kbeta kinase in this pathway, and mapped the oxidant-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation site to residue 105. The PIP5KbetaY105E phosphomimetic is catalytically inactive and cytosolic, whereas the Y105F non-phosphorylatable mutant has higher intrinsic lipid kinase activity and is much more membrane associated than wild type PIP5Kbeta. These results suggest that during oxidative stress, as modeled by H(2)O(2) treatment, Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PIP5Kbeta is the dominant post-translational modification that is responsible for the decrease in cellular PIP(2)."

https://openalex.org/W2066197855,"Bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) belongs to an unusual subgroup of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily of signaling ligands as it lacks a key cysteine residue in the mature region required for proper intermolecular dimerization. Naturally occurring BMP15 mutation leads to early ovarian failure in humans, and BMP15 has been shown to activate the Smad1/5/8 pathway in that context. Despite its important role in germ cell specification, the embryological function of BMP15 remains unknown. Surprisingly, we find that during early Xenopus embryogenesis BMP15 acts solely as an inhibitor of the Smad1/5/8 pathway and the Wnt pathway. BMP15 gain-of-function leads to embryos with secondary ectopic heads and to direct neural induction in intact explants. BMP15 inhibits BMP4-mediated epidermal induction in dissociated explants. BMP15 strongly inhibits BRE response induced by BMP4 and blocks phosphorylation and activation of Smad1/5/8 MH2-domain. Mechanistically, BMP15 protein specifically interacts with BMP4 protein, suggesting inhibition upstream of receptor binding. Loss-of-function experiments using morpholinos or a naturally occurring human BMP15 dominant-negative mutant (BMP15-Y235C) leads to embryos lacking head. BMP15-Y235C also eliminates the inhibitory activity of BMP15 on BRE (BMP-responsive element). Finally, we show that BMP15 inhibits the canonical branch of the Wnt pathway, upstream of beta-catenin. We, thus, demonstrate that BMP15 is necessary and sufficient for the specification of dorso-anterior structures and highlight novel mechanisms of BMP15 function that strongly suggest a reinterpretation of its function in ovaries specially for ovarian failure."

We engineered Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines expressing α<sub>1</sub>FLAG, β<sub>1</sub>FLAG, or β<sub>2</sub>MYC subunits via a tetracycline-regulated promoter and a line expressing both stable β<sub>1</sub>MYC and tetracycline-regulated β<sub>1</sub>FLAG to examine regulatory mechanisms of sodium pump subunit expression. When overexpression of exogenous β<sub>1</sub>FLAG increased total β subunit levels by >200% without changes in α subunit abundance, endogenous β<sub>1</sub> subunit (β<sub>1</sub>E) abundance decreased. β<sub>1</sub>E down-regulation did not occur during β<sub>2</sub>MYC overexpression, indicating isoform specificity of the repression mechanism. Measurements of RNA stability and content indicated that decreased β subunit expression was not accompanied by any change in mRNA levels. In addition, the degradation rate of β subunits was not altered by β<sub>1</sub>FLAG overexpression. Cells stably expressing β<sub>1</sub>MYC, when induced to express β<sub>1</sub>FLAG subunits, showed reduced β<sub>1</sub>MYC and β<sub>1</sub>E subunit abundance, indicating that these effects occur via the coding sequences of the down-regulated polypeptides. In a similar way, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing exogenous α<sub>1</sub>FLAG subunits exhibited a reduction of endogenous α<sub>1</sub> subunits (α<sub>1</sub>E) with no change in α mRNA levels or β subunits. The reduction in α<sub>1</sub>E compensated for α<sub>1</sub>FLAG subunit expression, resulting in unchanged total α subunit abundance. Thus, regulation of α subunit expression maintained its native level, whereas β subunit was not as tightly regulated and its abundance could increase substantially over native levels. These effects also occurred in human embryonic kidney cells. These data are the first indication that cellular sodium pump subunit abundance is modulated by translational repression. This mechanism represents a novel, potentially important mechanism for regulation of Na,K-ATPase expression."

In this study, we sought to analyze the dynamic organizational principles within the protein interaction network by studying the characteristics of individual neighborhoods of proteins within the network based on their gene expression as well as protein-protein interaction patterns. By clustering proteins into distinct groups based on their neighborhood gene expression characteristics, we identify several significant trends in the dynamic organization of the protein interaction network. We show that proteins with distinct neighborhood gene expression characteristics are positioned in specific localities in the protein interaction network thereby playing specific roles in the dynamic network connectivity. Remarkably, our analysis reveals a neighborhood characteristic that corresponds to the most centrally located group of proteins within the network. Further, we show that the connectivity pattern displayed by this group is consistent with the notion of ""rich club connectivity"" in complex networks. Importantly, our findings are largely reproducible in networks constructed using independent and different datasets."
