https://openalex.org/W2044680442,"One of the most striking patterns in biology is the formation of animal aggregations. Classically, aggregation has been viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous state, in which members derive the benefits of protection, mate choice, and centralized information, balanced by the costs of limiting resources. Consisting of individual members, aggregations nevertheless function as an integrated whole, displaying a complex set of behaviors not possible at the level of the individual organism. Complexity theory indicates that large populations of units can self-organize into aggregations that generate pattern, store information, and engage in collective decision-making. This begs the question, are all emergent properties of animal aggregations functional or are some simply pattern? Solutions to this dilemma will necessitate a closer marriage of theoretical and modeling studies linked to empirical work addressing the choices, and trajectories, of individuals constrained by membership in the group."
https://openalex.org/W2114499604,"After two centuries of studying equilibria-static patterns that call for no further behavioral adjustments-economists are beginning to study the general emergence of structures and the unfolding of patterns in the economy. When viewed in out-of-equilibrium formation, economic patterns sometimes simplify into the simple static equilibria of standard economics. More often they are ever changing, showing perpetually novel behavior and emergent phenomena. Complexity portrays the economy not as deterministic, predictable, and mechanistic, but as process dependent, organic, and always evolving."
https://openalex.org/W1977357980,"Visual imagery is used in a wide range of mental activities, ranging from memory to reasoning, and also plays a role in perception proper. The contribution of early visual cortex, specifically Area 17, to visual mental imagery was examined by the use of two convergent techniques. In one, subjects closed their eyes during positron emission tomography (PET) while they visualized and compared properties (for example, relative length) of sets of stripes. The results showed that when people perform this task, Area 17 is activated. In the other, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied to medial occipital cortex before presentation of the same task. Performance was impaired after rTMS compared with a sham control condition; similar results were obtained when the subjects performed the task by actually looking at the stimuli. In sum, the PET results showed that when patterns of stripes are visualized, Area 17 is activated, and the rTMS results showed that such activation underlies information processing."

Caspase-9 and its cofactor Apaf-1 were found to be essential downstream components of p53 in Myc-induced apoptosis. Like p53 null cells, mouse embryo fibroblast cells deficient in Apaf-1 and caspase-9, and expressing c- Myc , were resistant to apoptotic stimuli that mimic conditions in developing tumors. Inactivation of Apaf-1 or caspase-9 substituted for p53 loss in promoting the oncogenic transformation of Myc -expressing cells. These results imply a role for Apaf-1 and caspase-9 in controlling tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2078401020,"Calcium-calmodulin–dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is thought to increase synaptic strength by phosphorylating postsynaptic density (PSD) ion channels and signaling proteins. It is shown that N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor stimulation reversibly translocates green fluorescent protein–tagged CaMKII from an F-actin–bound to a PSD-bound state. The translocation time was controlled by the ratio of expressed β-CaMKII to α-CaMKII isoforms. Although F-actin dissociation into the cytosol required autophosphorylation of or calcium-calmodulin binding to β-CaMKII, PSD translocation required binding of calcium-calmodulin to either the α- or β-CaMKII subunits. Autophosphorylation of CaMKII indirectly prolongs its PSD localization by increasing the calmodulin-binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2094831175,"Biological signaling pathways interact with one another to form complex networks. Complexity arises from the large number of components, many with isoforms that have partially overlapping functions; from the connections among components; and from the spatial relationship between components. The origins of the complex behavior of signaling networks and analytical approaches to deal with the emergent complexity are discussed here."

https://openalex.org/W2150592964,"The regulation of members of the knotted1 -like homeobox ( knox ) gene family is required for the normal initiation and development of lateral organs. The maize rough sheath2 ( rs2 ) gene, which encodes a Myb-domain protein, is expressed in lateral organ primordia and their initials. Mutations in the rs2 gene permit ectopic expression of knox genes in leaf and floral primordia, causing a variety of developmental defects. Ectopic KNOX protein accumulation in rs2 mutants occurs in a subset of the normal rs2 -expressing cells. This variegated accumulation of KNOX proteins in rs2 mutants suggests that rs2 represses knox expression through epigenetic means."

Here we assessed the effect of SB203580, an inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase family, on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. We found that SB203580, but not its inactive analogue (SB202474), prevented insulin-stimulated glucose transport in both cell types with an IC50 similar to that for inhibition of p38 MAP kinase (0.6 μm). Basal glucose uptake was not affected. Moreover, SB203580 added only during the transport assay did not inhibit basal or insulin-stimulated transport. SB203580 did not inhibit insulin-stimulated translocation of the glucose transporters GLUT1 or GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as assessed by immunoblotting of subcellular fractions or by immunofluorescence of membrane lawns. L6 muscle cells expressing GLUT4 tagged on an extracellular domain with a Myc epitope (GLUT4myc) were used to assess the functional insertion of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane. SB203580 did not affect the insulin-induced gain in GLUT4myc exposure at the cell surface but largely reduced the stimulation of glucose uptake. SB203580 had no effect on insulin-dependent insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation, association of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with insulin receptor substrate-1, nor on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 activities in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, in the presence of SB203580, insulin caused normal translocation and cell surface membrane insertion of glucose transporters without stimulating glucose transport. We propose that insulin stimulates two independent signals contributing to stimulation of glucose transport: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase leads to glucose transporter translocation and a pathway involving p38 MAP kinase leads to activation of the recruited glucose transporter at the membrane.

Whether increased plasma membrane glucose transporter content can fully account for insulin-stimulated increases in glucose uptake is still being debated (4Zierler K. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that translocation of GLUTs might only account for as little as 30% of insulin-stimulated glucose transport (4Zierler K. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the majority of insulin-stimulated glucose transport being due to changes in the intrinsic activity of GLUTs (5Moyers J.S.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling machinery employed by insulin in eliciting glucose transport has also been extensively investigated yet a precise understanding remains to be achieved (8Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To date, only one signaling molecule involved in GLUT translocation has been unequivocally identified, i.e. the p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase1 (9Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-41020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Debate currently exists on which insulin receptor substrates activate the PI 3-kinase pathway leading to GLUT translocation (10Morris A.J. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P.

There is no evidence for or against the participation of any insulin-dependent signaling pathway in regulation of the intrinsic activity of glucose transporters. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades represent one of the main intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by mitogenic and stress-inducing stimuli (16Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and their involvement in glucose transport depends on the tissue and the agonist analyzed (18Denton R.M. Tavare J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 597-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Three families of these proline-directed serine threonine protein kinases, which are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues, have been identified (19Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). One of these is the p38 MAPK (also known as reactivating kinase, stress-activated protein kinase, and CSAID-binding protein) family, activation of which has been best characterized in response to stressors (such as UV light and hyperosmolarity) and cytokines (such as interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-α) (20Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cellular Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We have shown that insulin can phosphorylate p38 in L6 myotubes (21Taha C. Tsakiridis T. McCall A. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E68-E76PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19664-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and insulin has been shown to stimulate p38 activity in hepatoma cells (23Sutherland C. Tebbey P.W. Granner D.K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), yet not in skeletal muscle (24Goodyear L.J. Chang P.Y. Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Moller D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E403-E408PubMed Google Scholar). A group of pyridinyl imidazole compounds were recently reported to bind to and potently inhibit p38 MAP kinase. One of these, SB203580, specifically inhibited the α and β isoforms of p38 MAP kinase with an in vitro IC50 of ∼0.6 μm, while having no effect on the activity of 12 other closely related or prominent intracellular kinases (25Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). In KB cells, SB203580 prevented the stimulation of glucose transport elicited by the potent activator of p38 MAP kinase anisomycin and by IL-1, but had no effect on insulin-like growth factor 1-stimulated glucose transport (26Gould G.W. Cuenda A. Thomson F.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). SB203580 also inhibited anisomycin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (27Barros L.F. Young M. Saklatvala J. Baldwin S.A. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with an IC50 of <1 μm. In the present study we assessed the effect of SB203580 and its inactive structural analogue, SB202474, on insulin-stimulated glucose transport. We report that SB203580 inhibits uptake of 2-deoxyglucose or 3-O-methylglucose in muscle and fat cells without interfering with translocation of GLUTs. This effect was not due to direct binding of SB203580 to GLUTs nor to a nonspecific effect on other signaling molecules. The results suggest that SB203580 attenuates the ability of insulin to stimulate the intrinsic activity of glucose transporter molecules recruited to the plasma membrane.

Wang Q. Ewart H.S. Liu Z. He L. Bennett M.K. Klip A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). L6 cells from a spontaneously fusing subclone of the original L6 muscle cells and L6 cells stably overexpressing GLUT4 tagged with a Myc epitope were grown and differentiated into myotubes as described previously (29Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transport studies cells were treated with trypsin and seeded in 12-well plates (2.5-cm diameter well) and maintained in growth medium as described above except supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained under the same conditions in 6-well plates for preparation of whole cell lysates and in 10-cm diameter dishes for immunoprecipitations. Cells treated with insulin or SB203580 as indicated were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 2 mmPMSF, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) (pH 7.5). Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm to remove cell debris and nuclei. Antiphosphotyrosine antibody (2 μg/condition) was then added to supernatants for overnight incubation under rotation at 4 °C, followed by addition of 30 μl (10% w/v) of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. The immunoprecipitation pellets were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4, solubilized in 30 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Anti-p38 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) was added to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, followed by goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution) and protein was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Immunoprecipitation of p38 MAP kinase and Akt isoforms and analysis of their kinase activity was performed in a similar fashion to that described previously for Akt1 (30Somwar R. Sumitani S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E618-E625PubMed Google Scholar). For both assays, cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 nm okadaic acid. Polyclonal anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody (2 μg/condition) precoupled to a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (20 μl (100 mg/ml) each per condition) beads was added to 200 μg of total protein from cell lysates. Anti-Akt1, -Akt2, and -Akt3 antibodies were also precoupled to a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (2 μg/condition) and added to 200 μg of total protein. Antibody coupled beads were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with ice-cold lysis buffer before use. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating with the antibody bead complex for 2–3 h under constant rotation (4 °C). Immunocomplexes were isolated and washed 4 times with 1 ml of wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μm microcystin, and 100 nm okadaic acid) and twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The complexes were then incubated under constant agitation for 30 min at 30 °C with 30 μl of reaction mixture (kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP plus 2 μg of ATF-2 as substrate in p38 MAP kinase assays and 100 μm Crosstide as substrate in Akt assays). Following the reaction, 30 μl of the supernatant was transferred onto Whatman p81 filter paper and washed 4 times for 10 min with 3 ml of 175 mm phosphoric acid and once with distilled water for 5 min. Filters were air-dried and then subjected to liquid scintillation counting. L6 myotubes were deprived of serum for 5 h with α-minimal essential medium, 0.1% fetal bovine serum (v/v), and 25 mm glucose (serum-deprivation medium) while 3T3-L1 adipocytes were deprived of serum by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h before experimental manipulations. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake measurements were carried out as described previously (31Somwar R. Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Clin. Therap. 1998; 20: 125-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, following all stimulations and incubations with inhibitors cell monolayers were washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na-HEPES, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and any remaining liquid was aspirated. Cells were then incubated for 5 min in HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 μm unlabeled 2-deoxyglucose and 10 μmd-2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (1 μCi/ml for L6 and 0.5 μCi/ml for 3T3-L1) in the absence of insulin. The reaction was terminated by washing three times with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl (w/v). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B. Cell associated radioactivity was determined by lysing the cells with 0.05 n NaOH, followed by liquid scintillation counting. Total cellular protein was determined by the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). 3-O-Methylglucose uptake was measured in a similar fashion with the following differences: 50 μm 3-O-methylglucose (4 μCi/ml) was added to HEPES-buffered saline and uptake allowed to occur for 30 s, a period over which 3-O-methylglucose uptake is known to be linear. After this time, cell monolayers were washed three times with 1 mm HgCl2 in saline solution before lysis with 0.05 n NaOH. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, grown on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes, were treated with SB203580 plus or minus insulin as described in the figure legends. Plasma membrane lawns (sheets) were prepared as described previously (33Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Following the various treatments, the cells were placed on ice and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Hypotonic swelling buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) was added in three quick rinses. Five ml of breaking buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm Na-HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μm pepstatin A, pH 7.5) were added to each well, and the solution was aspirated up and down using a 1.0-ml pipette to promote cell breakage. The coverslips were washed three times in breaking buffer and incubated with cold 3% paraformaldehyde in breaking buffer for 10 min on ice, followed by three washes in PBS. Excess fixative was quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl/PBS for 5 min, followed by three washes with PBS at room temperature. The lawns were subsequently blocked by a 1-h incubation in 5% goat serum in PBS at room temperature, then incubated with rabbit anti-GLUT4 antiserum (1:150) for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antiserum (1:50) was added for 30 min then rinsed out with four washes with PBS and the coverslips mounted with ProLong Antifade mounting solution. Confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS 4D laser confocal fluorescence microscope with a 63X objective. All images shown were collected under identical gain settings. Quantification was made using NIH Image software. Subcellular fractionation was carried out essentially as described previously (34Bashan N. Burdett E. Guma A. Sargeant R. Tumiati L. Liu Z. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C430-C440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in ice-cold 255 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μmpepstatin A, 10 μm E-64, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4) and the homogenate centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 41,000 × g to pellet the crude plasma membranes; the supernatant from this step was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 75 min to yield the low density microsomes. Crude plasma membranes were further purified by layering on a sucrose cushion (1.12 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW-55 rotor for 60 min. The band at the interface was resuspended in homogenization buffer and pelleted at 40,000 × g for 20 min to yield purified plasma membranes. All fractions were resuspended in homogenization buffer to a final concentration of 2–10 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. The movement of Myc-tagged GLUT4 to the cell surface was measured by an antibody-coupled colorimetric assay (35Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A.

Quiescent L6 GLUT4myc cells treated as indicated in the legend for Table II were washed once with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3 min at room temperature, and the fixative was immediately neutralized by incubation with 1% glycine in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were blocked with 10% goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4 °C for at least 30 min. Primary antibody (anti-c-Myc, 9E10) was then added into the cultures at a dilution of 1:100 and maintained for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were extensively washed with PBS before introducing peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000). After 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were extensively washed and 1 ml of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent (0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and 0.4 mg/ml urea hydrogen peroxide in 0.05m phosphate/citrate buffer) was added to each well for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.25 ml of 3 n HCl. The supernatant was collected and the optical absorbance was measured at 492 nm.Table IEffect of addition of SB203580 to assay buffer during measurement of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake2-Deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes2-Deoxyglucose uptake in L6 muscle cellspmol/mg/minControl5.65 ± 0.543.36 ± 0.14SB2035805.38 ± 0.173.48 ± 0.05Insulin32.18 ± 2.786.31 ± 0.15Insulin + SB20358027.41 ± 1.426.18 ± 0.193T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes were treated with or without 100 nm insulin for 30 min prior to measurement of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was measured in the presence or absence of SB203580 (10 μm) during the 5-min assay period.

Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Clin. Therap. 1998; 20: 125-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. To detect tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 the upper part of the blot was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (monoclonal, 1:5000 dilution) and protein detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method using sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibody. The lower part of the blot was probed with anti-p85 antibody (polyclonal, 1:1000 dilution) and protein detected using anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. To determine PI 3-kinase activity, cell extracts were prepared exactly the same way as for IRS-1 immunoprecipitation and PI 3-kinase activity was measured on IRS-1 immunoprecipitates as described previously (36Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the ability of PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1 to convert phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was detected by separation of these lipids by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Detection and quantitation of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate on the TLC plates were done using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager System (Sunnyvale, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using either unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance test (Fischer, multiple comparisons) as indicated in the figure legends. Activation of p38 MAP kinase involves dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes measured by phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting with anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody (Fig.1 A). We have previously shown a similar result in L6 myotubes (22Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol.

An in vitro kinase assay was then used to measure the ability of p38 MAP kinase to phosphorylate one of its known natural substrates, ATF-2. Insulin caused an approximately 5-fold increase in p38-mediated ATF-2 phosphorylation and this effect was inhibited by SB203580 (Fig.1 B). Fig.2 A shows a dose response of the effect of SB203580 on the uptake of 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The compound was given to cells for 20 min prior to addition of insulin. Treatment with the hormone alone for 30 min caused an increase in glucose uptake of over 4-fold (control, 7.4 ± 0.7 pmol/min/mg protein: insulin, 26.9 ± 4.1 pmol/min/mg protein (p < 0.05)). Pretreatment with a range of concentrations of SB203580 from 1 nm to 0.1 mm prevented stimulation by insulin in a dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 for this effect was calculated to be 0.75 μm.

In epithelial cells, the members of this family, such as the classical E-, N-, and P-cadherins, are primarily found at the adherens junctions of adjacent cells (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). β-Catenin as well as plakoglobin (γ-catenin) associate directly with the highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins in a mutually exclusive manner (2Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 3Hinck L. Näthke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The cadherin-catenin complex is linked via α-catenin either directly (4Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The association of the cadherin-catenin complex with the cytoskeleton is essential for tight cell-cell interaction.Nevertheless, cadherin/catenin-mediated cell-cell contacts have to be highly dynamic because, particularly during embryonic development or wound healing, adherens junctions have to be rapidly disassembled and reassembled (7Marrs J.A. Nelson W.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 159-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of cadherins results in the separation of neighboring cells, a phenomenon that is observed during embryonic development at the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)1 of forming mesoderm (8Huber O. Bierkamp C. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) as well as in tumor cells, allowing their invasion and dissemination throughout the body (9Becker K.F. Atkinson M.J. Reich U. Becker I. Nekarda H. Siewert J.R. Höfler H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3845-3852PubMed Google Scholar). During epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cells transiently lose their epithelial features and acquire a fibroblastoid morphology (10Thiery J.P. Duband J.L. Tucker G.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 91-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The critical importance of an intact cadherin-catenin complex is underscored by the observation that down-regulation of any of its components resulting in the loss of the tumor-suppressive actions of adherens junctions correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis (11Birchmeier W. Hülsken J. Behrens J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 189: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the integrity of adherens junctions appears to be dynamically regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.

Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The presence of a repeating 42-amino acid sequence motif defines members of the “armadillo family” (23Peifer M. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Data obtained in theDrosophila and Xenopus systems suggest an additional function for β-catenin independent of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. This involves translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus that is preceded by its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Thus, free β-catenin is involved in transcriptional regulation of specific genes that are essential for embryonic development (24Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The signals resulting in a free pool of β-catenin include the binding of Wingless/Wnt to its transmembrane receptor Frizzled and the inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase Zeste-White 3 (Shaggy) or its vertebrate homologue glycogen synthase kinase 3 (25Moon R.T. Miller J.R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 256-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Further functions for β-catenin and plakoglobin are indicated by their association with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, which is thought to serve as a cytoplasmic effector of β-catenin, negatively regulating the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin in concert with glycogen synthase kinase 3 (26Bullions L.C. Levine A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and axin/conductin (27Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar).In this report we show that during epithelial migration, β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol in a free, uncomplexed and tyrosine-phosphorylated form. However, in confluent cells, β-catenin maintains epithelial cell integrity as an essential part of the cadherin-catenin tumor suppressor system. Our findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the function of β-catenin as a signaling molecule during epithelial cell migration. We further demonstrate PTP LAR to be a modulator of epithelial cell migration, which strongly supports a function of this protein tyrosine phosphatase in the regulation of cell-cell contacts and epithelial cell integrity. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of PTP LAR inhibits tumor formation in nude mice. A dysfunction of PTP LAR may therefore lead to tumor invasion and metastasis.DISCUSSIONCadherin-catenin complex-mediated cell-cell adhesion as well as adhesion-independent functions of catenins have been implicated in the modulation of multicellular differentiation, proliferation, and malignant transformation of epithelial cells (7Marrs J.A. Nelson W.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 159-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Huber O. Bierkamp C. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 11Birchmeier W. Hülsken J. Behrens J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 189: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar). Cell migration is an essential process during embryonic development and in epithelial regeneration of adult organisms, for example in wound healing, and requires precise control, which is altered or lost when tumor cells become invasive and metastatic. In this study we have defined at the cellular and biochemical level distinct mechanisms regulating epithelial cell migration. Furthermore, we have characterized in motile cells the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and its regulation by tyrosine kinases and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR.Growth factors such as EGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor, or hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor have been shown to induce migration of epithelial cells (38Manske M. Bade E.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 155: 49-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A correlation has been suggested between migration and tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin (12Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 14Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), but its significance remained unclear. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling inhibits epithelial cell migration of NBT II cells. Receptor tyrosine kinases like the EGF receptor (17Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases like Src are able to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin (13Hamaguchi M. Matsuyoshi N. Ohnishi Y. Gotoh B. Takeichi M. Nagai Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In NBT II cells, a dominant-negative c-Src mutant was able to inhibit migration (47Rodier J.M. Valles A.M. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. Boyer B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that after induction of migration, the pool of free, uncomplexed β-catenin is increased and that this increase correlates with enhanced β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation may result in a reduced interaction of β-catenin with both E-cadherin and the actin-cytoskeleton. Because the integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex is essential for strong cell-cell adhesion, this reduced interaction may lead to an overall decrease in intercellular contacts. Interestingly, a fusion protein of E-cadherin and α-catenin was reported to be able of mediating the interaction of E-cadherin with the cytoskeleton independent of β-catenin. However, these cells were no longer capable of migration (48Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In light of these data, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin may lead to disruption of the contact between E-cadherin and the cytoskeleton and to an increased pool of free β-catenin. This suggests a function for β-catenin independent of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion.Besides their role at adherens junctions, a signaling function of β-catenin or its Drosophila homologue Armadillo was shown to be essential for normal embryonic development inDrosophila and Xenopus. Interference with the signaling function of free, uncomplexed β-catenin abolished proper vertebrate development (24Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies inDrosophila and Xenopus led to the discovery of a signaling cascade that regulates the cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin. Without a signal, β-catenin is localized mainly at adherens junctions, and any free β-catenin is down-regulated in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (30Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). An extracellular signal such as Wnt or Wingless (49Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E. Development. 1994; 120: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R.

Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) to an inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3/Zeste White 3 activity, thus stabilizing β-catenin/Armadillo in its free form (44Papkoff J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar,53Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). We could show an increased pool of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in migrating cells after EGF treatment, suggesting another way of regulating the free pool of β-catenin during epithelial cell migration beside Wnt/Wingless signaling. Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin may also be able to stabilize free β-catenin, because it was shown for the homologous plakoglobin that the tyrosine-phosphorylated form did no longer associate with APC (54Shibata T. Gotoh M. Ochiai A. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), thereby possibly preventing APC-mediated degradation. Indeed, we were able to demonstrate that the free pool of β-catenin has an increased phosphotyrosine content during EGF-dependent epithelial cell migration. Additionally, EGF is also able to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity (55Eldar-Finkelman H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was shown to correlate with carcinoma formation and tumor invasion (56Sommers C.L.

Only free β-catenin or plakoglobin is able to associate with members of the high mobility group (57Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J.

However, recently it was demonstrated that β-catenin and plakoglobin differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF1 and that LEF1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by β-catenin (63Simcha I.

The transcription factors LEF1 and T-cell factor are able to induce dorsal mesoderm when expressed together with β-catenin in Xenopus embryos (58Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D.

Data from LEF1-deficient and LEF1-transgenic mice demonstrate an important role of this transcription factor during EMT, because it is normally up-regulated during EMT and inductive processes between mesenchyme and epithelium (64van Genderen C.

It is tempting to speculate that a common regulatory system exists that coordinates the expression of genes for mesenchymal and epithelial phenotypes during embryonic development as well as in epithelial cell migration. During EMT or cell migration this common regulator would switch off expression of epithelial genes while switching on genes for the mesenchymal phenotype. The β-catenin·LEF1 complex may represent this common regulator, and molecules that control the free pool of β-catenin may be essential for proper development or wound healing.PTPs were proposed to play an important role in the regulation of cell-cell contacts because treatment with sodium orthovanadate, a potent inhibitor of phosphatase activity, diminished normal cell contact inhibition in epithelial cells and led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation at adherens junctions (16Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabany I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). PTPs may therefore act as steady state equilibrium antagonists of TKs for regulatory events at adherens junctions. Consistent with these findings we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and plakoglobin in migrating epithelial cells was significantly increased after pretreatment with sodium orthovanadate. Little is known about interacting proteins orin vivo substrates of transmembrane PTPs. PTP LAR was recently shown to interact and colocalize at focal adhesions with LAR interacting protein 1 (LIP-1) and the multidomain protein Trio. However, neither of these proteins appears to be a substrate for PTP LAR (45Serra-Pagès C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 67Debant A. Serra-Pagès C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Moreover, a PTP LAR-like PTP was reported to interact with the cadherin-catenin complex at adherens junctions of neurosecretory PC12 cells (68Kypta R.M. Su H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here the colocalization and interaction of PTP LAR with the cadherin-catenin complex in epithelial cells. Furthermore, we show that only β-catenin and plakoglobin are able to associate directly with PTP LAR, and we present evidence that β-catenin is a substrate of PTP LAR. PTP LAR is of special interest because it is localized at adherens junctions and at focal adhesions (this report and Refs. 45Serra-Pagès C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 67Debant A. Serra-Pagès C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); thus PTP LAR could represent an essential regulator of the disassembly and reassembly of cell-cell as well as cell-extracellular matrix adhesions during epithelial cell migration. We demonstrate that modest ectopic overexpression of PTP LAR significantly inhibited epithelial cell migration. A similar situation is found in Drosophila, where PTP LAR, contrary to vertebrates, is almost exclusively expressed in developing neurons. In flies lacking PTP LAR, motor axons bypass their normal target region and instead continue to extend without stopping (69Krueger N.X. Van Vactor D. Wan H.I. Gelbart W.M. Goodman C.S. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 84: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). PTP LAR, PTP μ, PTP κ as well as PTP DEP-1 were found to be expressed at elevated protein levels with increased cell confluence (20Fuchs M. Müller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Knapp A.M. Sutherland R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The increase in phosphatase activity in confluent cells suggests a role of PTPs in the regulation and stabilization of cell-cell contacts and epithelial cell integrity. In contrast, during wound healing, cells at the wound edge are in a subconfluent situation, where PTP action is reduced. This could favor tyrosine kinase signaling through stimulation by growth factors such as EGF, transforming growth factor α, and keratinocyte growth factor, which results in an increase in cell migration and proliferation and, thus, to accelerated wound healing, because the expression of these growth factors was increased during a wound situation (74Buckley A.

Furthermore, expression of hPTP LAR in NBT II cells inhibited tumor formation in nude mice, although the growth characteristics of these cells in vitro were not altered. Ectopic expression of hPTP LAR to about twice the endogenous level was sufficient to result in the biological effects observed. Such modest ectopic expression of hPTP LAR appears to be critical, because high overexpression results in completely altered growth characteristics and apoptosis of the cells (77Weng L.P. Yuan J. Yu Q. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The data presented in this report strongly support an important role for PTP LAR in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion and epithelial cell migration as well as tumorigenesis by controlling the free pool of signaling β-catenin. Because mutations or deletions in either APC or β-catenin leading to a stabilized pool of free β-catenin have been correlated with tumor formation (61Korinek V. Barker N.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), loss of PTP LAR function may also contribute to tumor formation and metastasis. As a potential tumor suppressor gene product, PTP LAR could therefore serve as a prognostic marker for human cancer. The cadherins represent a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate homophilic, Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion. In epithelial cells, the members of this family, such as the classical E-, N-, and P-cadherins, are primarily found at the adherens junctions of adjacent cells (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). β-Catenin as well as plakoglobin (γ-catenin) associate directly with the highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins in a mutually exclusive manner (2Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 3Hinck L. Näthke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J.

Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (mAb 9-E10) derivatized with a fluorophore (europium cryptate, EuK) was used to individually label c-Myc-tagged α1-, β2-, or γ2-subunits of the hetero-oligomeric γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor in intact cells. The maximal fluorescent signal derived from the α1(c-Myc)β2γ2 and the α1β2(c-Myc)γ2 receptors was twice that obtained with α1β2γ2(c-Myc), suggesting that there are 2× α-, 2× β-, and 1× γ-subunits in a receptor monomer. This observation was extended using fluorescence energy transfer.

On exposure to laser light, energy transfer from EuK to XL665 occurred with α1(c-Myc)β2γ2 and α1β2(c-Myc)γ2, but no significant energy transfer was observed with α1β2γ2(c-Myc) receptors, indicating the absence of a second γ-subunit in a receptor monomer.

Many techniques have been used to probe the interaction of proteins including, for example, immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid analysis, circular dichroism, and more recently fluorescence energy transfer between two proteins in close proximity (1Mathis G. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 2Thomas D.D. Carlsen W.F. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have used the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer to investigate the stoichiometric assembly of a GABAA1receptor, a member of the major inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel family in the brain. It is proposed that the GABAA receptors are hetero-oligomeric pentamers composed of α, β, and a third subunit type, γ, δ, or ε. This is based on an analogy with other ligand-gated ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (4Raftery M.A. Hunkapiller M.W. Strader C.D. Hood L.E.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To date, 15 GABAA subunits have been cloned (α1–6, β1–4, γ1–3, δ, and ε), and expression studies reveal that for the most characterized subtypes at least one α, one β, and one γ-subunit are required to recover a fully functional GABAA receptor (9Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). We have investigated the stoichiometry of the most abundant GABAAreceptor isoform in the brain, α1β2γ2, which is responsible for at least some of the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and steroids (10McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Receptors modified with a c-Myc epitope on either the α1-, β2-, or γ2- subunit were expressed transiently in HEK293 cells. It has previously been shown that receptors transiently transfected in these cells using the same methods as employed here are appropriately assembled into αβγ-hetero-oligomers and are expressed on the cell surface. Other subunit assemblies do not reach the cell surface and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). mAbs to the c-Myc epitope were derivatized with the fluorescence donor, europium cryptate (EuK), or the fluorescent energy acceptor, XL-665. Europium, encaged by cryptate, emits a strong long lived fluorescent signal at 620 nm when illuminated with light at 337 nm from a nitrogen laser, which can be time-resolved from short lived background fluorescence. In addition to being used as a single label, analogous to a radiolabel for example, EuK also serves as an energy donor. The fluorescent signal produced by EuK can be transferred to an acceptor molecule if it is in close enough proximity. The recipient molecule for this fluorescent resonance energy transfer is a modified allophycocyanine, XL665, which fluoresces at 665 nm (for review of the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence technology see Mathis (1Mathis G. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar)). The transfer of energy from europium cryptate-labeled c-Myc antibodies to XL-665-labeled antibodies is therefore indicative of the two antibodies being in close proximity. Because the energy transfer is 50% at a distance of 9.5 nm (1Mathis G. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), this would require that the antibodies are very closely associated, for example in the same macromolecular complex. We used EuK-labeled c-Myc mAbs to quantify the number of subunits present on intact cells expressing α1β2γ2 subunits where each of the subunits was epitope-tagged with c-Myc and compared this with the number of receptors present using conventional radioligand binding. Fluorescence energy transfer was then used to confirm the stoichiometry of the receptor as (α1)2(β2)2(γ2)1. [methyl-3H]Ro15-1788 (87.0 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. Flunitrazepam, GABA, and fetal calf serum were from Sigma. Minimal essential medium (MEM) was from Life Technologies, Inc. The GABAAreceptor α1-subunit was epitope-tagged by site-directed mutagenesis using methods described previously (13Wingrove P.B. Wafford K.A. Bain C. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4569-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The epitope sequence (EQKLISEEDL) was introduced between Glu34and Leu35 (these two residues becoming the first and last amino acid of the epitope tag), just C-terminal to the putative signal peptide cleavage site. The β2 and γ2GABAA receptor subunits were epitope-tagged using a modified version of the pcDNA1Amp eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA1AmpSignalMyc). This vector was constructed from the α1 c-Myc cDNA described above and contains the 5′-untranslated region of bovine GABAAα1-subunit (GenBank accession no. X05717), the signal peptide and six amino acids of the mature α1-subunit, and the c-Myc epitope tag sequence (EQKLISEEDL (14Evan G.I. Lewis G. Ramsay G. Bishop J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar)) followed by a small polylinker into which the mature polypeptide of the subunit of interest can be inserted. The human β2-subunit c-Myc construct contains amino acids Glu38–Asn474 of β2, and the human γ2-subunit c-Myc construct contains amino acids Tyr46–le467. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs were prepared using polymerase chain reaction to generate the appropriate β2 and γ2 sequences, which were then subcloned into the pcDNA1AmpSignalMyc vector. DNAs were prepared for transfection by CsCl centrifugation. Transient transfection into HEK293 cells was performed exactly as described previously in detail using a 1:1:1 ratio of α1, β2, and γ2 cDNAs (12Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G.

Binding to the GABA binding site was carried out with [3H]muscimol, and 100 μm GABA was used to define nonspecific binding. Radioligand binding assays were carried out in a total volume of 0.5 ml in 10 mmKH2PO4, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C prior to termination through Whatman GF/C filters followed by 3× 3-ml washes with cold assay buffer and scintillation counting. In binding studies carried out at one concentration of [3H]Ro15-1788, this was 1.8 nm. GABAA receptors solubilized from stably transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-α1-, β-, or γ2-subunit antisera bound to protein A-Sepharose (7Hadingham K.L. Harkness P.C. McKernan R.M.

Receptors were solubilized from the cells using a deoxycholate/Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2) by mixing cell membranes for 1 h at 4 °C with a detergent buffer at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Aliquots (500 μl) of detergent-solubilized cell membranes were incubated with antibodies immobilized on protein A beads overnight at 4 °C. The receptor immobilized on protein A beads was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 by centrifugation and resuspension and was finally resuspended in 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline, and 10–50-μl aliquots of packed beads were used for [3H]Ro15-1788 binding.

An antibody was purified from hybridoma supernatant by Cymbus Biotech, UK, and this was then derivatized with either the fluorophore, europium cryptate (at an average ratio of 9 molecules of europium cryptate per antibody molecule), or with the fluorescence acceptor, XL665 (at a ratio of 1 molecule of XL-665 per antibody molecule), by Cis-Bio International, Marcoule, France. Labeling of c-Myc mAb with EuK at this ratio gave 418 counts of fluorescence/s/fmol of antibody. Intact cells, transiently transfected with GABAA receptors with c-Myc-tagged subunits, were harvested by scraping, washed once by centrifugation (20 s at 1,000 rpm in a bench top Eppendorf Microcentrifuge), and resuspended in MEM + 5% FCS. [3H]Ro15-1788 binding (1.8 nm) was carried out to determine receptor density on intact cells. Cells containing the equivalent of 100 fmol of receptor were incubated with various concentrations of europium cryptate-derivatized mAb (0.3–30 nm) in MEM + 5% FCS at room temperature, in a volume of 1 ml for 1 h on a rotamix wheel. After 3× 1-ml washes in MEM + 5% FCS, the cells were resuspended in 190 μl of MEM + 5% FCS, and the fluorescence signal derived from europium cryptate-labeled c-Myc mAbs was quantified in a 96-well low fluorescence microplate on the Packard discovery fluorescence plate reader, following the addition of 10 μl of 1 m KF (final concentration, 50 mm KF). In preliminary experiments the inclusion of 5% FCS was found to improve the viability of the cells, and KF was included to stabilize europium cryptate and prevent oxidation of unliganded cryptate. XL665-derivatized mAbs were added in excess (10 nm) to each well, and the plate was read over a 24-h time period. Energy transfer was optimal after the receptor had been incubated with c-Myc-XL665 for 1 h, and the signal was stable for up to 18 h afterward. Each of the α1-, β2-, and γ2-subunits was engineered to express a c-Myc epitope tag at the N terminus, and cells expressing c-Myc-tagged α-, β-, or γ-subunits or untagged receptors were generated by transient transfection. GABAA receptors were measured using two ligands, [3H]muscimol, a radioligand for the GABA binding site, and [3H]Ro15-1788, a radioligand for the benzodiazepine binding site, which binds only to fully assembled receptors that contain an α-, β-, and γ-subunit (7Hadingham K.L. Harkness P.C. McKernan R.M. Quirk K. Le Bourdelles B. Horne A.L. Kemp J.A. Barnard E.A. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments it was important to confirm that a homogeneous population of fully assembled receptors was being expressed in the cells. This was done in two ways. First the number of binding sites for [3H]muscimol and [3H]Ro15-1788 was compared. Most evidence supports the presence of two [3H]muscimol binding sites and one [3H]Ro15-1788 binding site in a GABA receptor monomer in receptors immunoprecipitated from rat brain (7Hadingham K.L. Harkness P.C. McKernan R.M. Quirk K. Le Bourdelles B. Horne A.L. Kemp J.A. Barnard E.A. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, if the majority of receptors is correctly assembled in cell lines, the ratio of the B max values for [3H]muscimol binding:[3H]Ro15-1788 binding should be 2:1. It is possible that receptors could be expressed that are composed of α- and β-subunits only, but these would not bind [3H]Ro15-1788, and the ratio would therefore be higher. Saturation analysis of [3H]muscimol and [3H]Ro15-1788 binding was carried out in cells expressing the untagged α1-, β2-, and γ2-subunits. Maximal binding of [3H]muscimol was 2067 ± 98 fmol/mg of protein with a K d of 5.6 ± 0.7 nm(n = 3). Maximal binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 was 1226 ± 21 fmol/mg of protein with a K d of 0.7 ± 0.05 nm (n = 3). The ratio of the GABA:benzodiazepine sites was 1.74 ± 0.11, which is in agreement with the expression of αβγ heterotrimeric receptors and no significant expression of receptors that contain only αβ-subunits. Second, the ability of antibodies raised against the α1-, β2-, and γ2-subunit to immunoprecipitate all the [3H]Ro15-1788 binding sites from a solubilized cell membrane preparation was compared. The majority of receptors could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies raised against the α1-, β-, or γ2-subunits (α1, 74 ± 3%; β, 81 ± 7%; and γ2, 90 ± 4% of [3H]Ro15-1788 binding sites, n = 3). This confirms that the receptors that bind [3H]Ro15-1788 contain at least one α-, one β-, and one γ-subunit. The number of c-Myc-tagged subunits was quantified by labeling with anti-c-Myc mAb derivatized with europium cryptate, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (using the subunit arrangement proposed by Tretter et al. (11Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a model). The presence of a c-Myc tag on the N terminus of the GABAAreceptor subunits did not affect the expression of the receptor. The number of binding sites present on cells was unaffected by the addition of the epitope tag, and saturation analysis of [3H]Ro15-1788 binding showed that there was no major difference in the affinity of receptors for ligand (K d is as follows: α1β2γ2 = 1.3 nm; α1(c-Myc)β2γ2 = 1.1 nm; α1β2(c-Myc)γ2= 1.4 nm; α1β2γ2(c-Myc) = 1.3 nm, n = 1). The density of receptors was unaffected by the expression of subunits with a c-Myc epitope tag, being 1.2–3.1 pmol/mg of protein. This is in agreement with previous studies where GABAA receptors were tagged with c-Myc and FLAG epitopes without compromising binding, function, or modulation of the GABAA receptor (12Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the optimal conditions for the binding of EuK-labeled c-Myc mAbs. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the fluorescence signal emitted by EuK c-Myc at 620 nm was linear with receptor concentration. Therefore the binding of EuK-labeled c-Myc to the receptor was linear up to at least 100 fmol of receptor/ml. Background fluorescence from the plate and other reagents accounted for the fluorescence in the absence of added EuK, and this was typically 800–1500 counts/s as shown in Fig. 2 A. Binding of EuK c-Myc to cells expressing untagged receptors was significant (Fig.2 A). Efforts were made to try to reduce this nonreceptor-mediated binding by extensive washing following incubation with EuK-c-Myc mAb and preincubation of cells with IgG to block any IgG binding sites on the cells. Neither of these measures reduced nonspecific binding to control cells by more than 10% and were not routinely adopted. Instead, each experiment contained a wild type control (i.e. receptors expressed without any c-Myc epitope present), and nonspecific binding to these cells was subtracted from the total fluorescence signal, which was analogous to the methodology employed for defining nonspecific binding in a radioligand binding assay. Saturation binding experiments were carried out using control cells expressing α1β2γ2 and cells expressing receptors where either the α-, β-, or γ-subunit was epitope-tagged with c-Myc. Nonspecific binding of EuK c-Myc to control cells expressing an untagged receptor was subtracted from total binding at each concentration of antibody and was routinely 50% at 3 nm antibody. In all cases binding was saturable and had a high affinity, and EuK-labeled c-Myc bound to more sites in the α1(c-Myc)β2γ2 and α1β2(c-Myc)γ2 compared with α1β2γ2(c-Myc) as exemplified in Fig. 3. To quantitate this, the experiment was repeated on six separate occasions using 3 nm antibody, and the specific fluorescence counts are shown in Fig. 4 A. The ratio of fluorescence labeling to α1(c-Myc)β2γ2, α1β2(c-Myc)γ2, and α1β2γ2(c-Myc) was compared as shown in Fig. 4 B. This clearly shows that there are twice as many EuK c-Myc sites on receptors where the α- or β-subunit is tagged compared with receptors where the γ-subunit is tagged (ratio of α1(c-Myc)β2γ2:α1β2(c-Myc)γ2:α1β2γ2(c-Myc)= 1.89 ± 0.12:1.94 ± 0.18:1).Figure 4Fluorescence signal observed at 620 and 665 nm from cells expressing α1(c-Myc)β2γ2, α1β2(c-Myc)γ2, and α1β2γ2(c-Myc).Data shown are the mean ± S.E. of six independent experiments. The specific fluorescence counts observed at 620 nm for α1(c-Myc)β2γ2 were 315 ± 37/fmol and for α1β2(c-Myc)γ2 were 286 ± 41/fmol. These were both significantly higher than that observed with α1β2γ2(c-Myc), 156 ± 21/fmol. The mean ± S.E. and the ratio for binding relative to α1β2γ2(c-Myc) were calculated for each experiment and are shown in panel B. The ratios of binding for α1(c-Myc) β2γ2:α1β2γ2(c-Myc) and α1β2(c-Myc)γ2:α1β2γ2(c-Myc) were not significantly different from 2.0 (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Panel C, in the fluorescence energy transfer experiments, where emission was measured at 665 nm, there was no significant difference between the fluorescence counts produced by α1(c-Myc)β2γ2(16.7 ± 1.5) and α1β2(c-Myc)γ2 (17.8 ± 1.4), but both were significantly more than α1βγ2(c-Myc) (0.38 ± 2.4), which was not significantly more than 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A comparison of the B max values for [3H]Ro15-1788 and EuK-c-Myc fluorescence can be used to calculate the number of binding sites for the antibody/benzodiazepine binding site. For α1(c-Myc)β2γ2 there are 315 ± 37 fluorescence counts/fmol of Ro15-1788 binding sites using 3 nm antibody and 1.8 nm[3H]Ro15-1788 (Fig. 4). Using Clarke's equation (occupancy = [ligand]/[ligand] + K i) this is equivalent to 610 ± 71 fluorescence counts/fmol of Ro15-1788 binding sites. Given that there are 418 fluorescence counts of EuK/fmol of antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”), there are calculated to be 1.46 ± 0.16 antibody binding sites/[3H]Ro15-1788 binding site. The limitations and multiple sources of error in this experiment (e.g.aggregation of antibody, heterogeneity of antibody labeling, etc.) would be more likely to lead to an underestimate of the number of antibody binding sites therefore the observation that there is more than one antibody binding site/[3H]Ro15-1788 binding site supports the most likely stoichiometry of 2 α-subunits/receptor:1 benzodiazepine site. The affinity of the EuK-derivatized c-Myc antibodies for the GABAA subunits was 4–6 nm as shown in Fig. 3. A concentration of 3 nm was selected for the fluorescence transfer studies because this would less than half-maximally saturate the receptor. Following incubation with 3 nm EuK-derivatized c-Myc mAb, cells were washed and incubated with excess XL665-derivatized c-Myc mAb, and fluorescence at 665 nm was measured in response to laser excitation. As shown in Fig. 4 C, a specific signal is observed, indicating energy transfer when either the α1- or the β2-subunit is epitope-tagged (16.7 ± 1.5 counts/fmol and 17.8 ± 1.4 counts/fmol) but not when the γ2-subunit is epitope-tagged. Because energy transfer can only take place when there are two c-Myc epitopes in close proximity,i.e. two subunits in the same receptor complex, this confirms that the stoichiometry of the GABAA receptor under study is (α1)2(β2)2(γ2)1. Furthermore, the lack of any observable signal with α1β2γ2(c-Myc) could be interpreted as evidence that receptors are not primarily expressed as clusters on the cell surface. If this were the case, it may be possible to observe energy transfer between γ2-subunits on separate receptors. To date, the stoichiometry of the GABAA receptor has been approached both directly and indirectly. Many laboratories have observed that a receptor can contain two different types of α-subunits (16Duggan M.J. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24778-24784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Luddens H. Killisch I. Seeburg P.H. J. Recept. Res. 1991; 11: 523-551Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Zezula J.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Conflicting evidence has been obtained on whether two types of γ-subunit can coexist in a single receptor monomer with two studies proposing that two γ-subunits can be present (21Khan Z.U. Gutierrez A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1466-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Quirk K. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). There have been fewer studies on the presence of two β-subunits because the structural similarity of the β-subunits has precluded the development of antibodies, which clearly distinguish between them. There have been four studies that directly analyzed the stoichiometry of the receptor. The first two, chronologically, have taken an electrophysiological approach. Backus et al. (23Backus K.H. Arigoni M. Drescher U. Scheurer L. Malherbe P. Mohler H. Benson J.A. Neuroreport. 1993; 5: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) favor the composition 2× α, 1× β, and 2× γ based on measuring the outward current induced by point mutation of charged amino acids on either side of the TM2 domain. Chang et al. (24Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5415-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used a similar method (mutation of a lysine in TM2) to increase the sensitivity of the receptor to GABA in proportion to the number of mutant subunits present. In contrast to Backus et al. (23Backus K.H. Arigoni M. Drescher U. Scheurer L. Malherbe P. Mohler H. Benson J.A. Neuroreport. 1993; 5: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), they conclude that the stoichiometry is 2× α, 2× β, and 1× γ, as do Im et al. (25Im W.B. Prezenger J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) from studies of tandem subunit constructs. The most recent study used antibody labeling of chimeric subunits to determine the ratio of subunits present from Western blots, and they conclude that the structure is also 2× α, 2× β, and 1× γ (11Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The approach taken here has used fluorescently derivatized mAbs to quantify subunits relative to the benzodiazepine binding site on the receptor and fluorescent resonance energy transfer to confirm that the stoichiometry of the receptor is (α1)2(β2)2γ2. This method has several advantages over other previously described methods. 1) It uses intact cells; therefore only receptors that are expressed on the surface (and are therefore presumed to be correctly assembled) are considered (12Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 26Angelotti T.P. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) It involves minimal disruption of receptor structure by requiring only epitope tagging, which does not affect the expression or function of the receptor (12Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). 3) Only small amounts of transiently transfected material are required. Furthermore this approach has general applicability to other multisubunit cell surface proteins and can be used particularly to investigate the stoichiometry of subunits in GABAAreceptors composed of rarer subunits and in other ligand-gated ion channels.

Eric Trinquet and Gerard Mathis of Cis-Bio International for constructive discussion, Dr. Mark Shearman for contributing to the assay development, and Peter Wingrove for providing the transfected cells."

Great variability in the oxidation turnover numbers of these and other flavoproteins suggests that endogenous oxidants will be predominantly formed by only a few oxidizable enzymes.

Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the first indication that aerobic organisms are threatened by superoxide (O·̄2). SOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide (Reaction 1) and, in combination with catalase (Reaction 2), helps clear the cell of reactive oxygen species. O·̄2+O·̄2+2H+→O2+H2O2 REACTION1 2H2O2→O2+2H2O REACTION2SOD was found to be virtually ubiquitous among aerobic organisms, suggesting that O·̄2 might be an unavoidable by-product of metabolism in air. This idea was extended to develop the hypothesis that oxygen toxicity might be generally mediated by intracellular O·̄2 (2McCord J.M. Keele Jr., B.B. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The molecular details that underpin this idea (the intracellular sources and targets of O·̄2) were unresolved. Within the past 10 years many details of oxygen toxicity have been revealed. In 1986 Carlioz and Touati (3Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) reported the properties of a mutant strain of Escherichia coli that lacked both of its cytosolic isozymes of SOD. The mutant grew normally in the absence of oxygen; however, in aerobic medium it exhibited requirements for branched chain, aromatic, and sulfurous amino acids, an inability to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, and a high rate of spontaneous mutagenesis (4Farr S.B. D'Ari R. Touati D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8268-8272Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These same traits were elicited when SOD-proficient wild-type strains were exposed to hyperbaric oxygen (5Boehme D.E. Vincent K. Brown O.R. Nature. 1976; 262: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that in these conditions O·̄2 formation must be accelerated enough to overwhelm the cellular defenses. Therefore these observations supported the original model of oxygen toxicity. The root cause of the branched chain auxotrophy was tracked to the ability of O·̄2 to inactivate dihydroxy-acid dehydratase, an enzyme midway in this pathway (6Kuo C.F. Mashino T. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4724-4727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O·̄2 does so by oxidizing and destabilizing the [4Fe-4S] cluster that acts as a Lewis acid during catalysis (7Flint D.H. Emptage M.H. Barak Z. Chipman D. Schloss J.V. Biosynthesis of Branched Chain Amino Acids. Deerfield, Borch and Balaban, Philadelphia1990: 285-314Google Scholar, 8Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iron dissociates from the oxidized cluster, causing a complete loss of activity. The requirement for fermentable carbon sources apparently stems from similar damage to aconitase and fumarase, which also belong to the [4Fe-4S] dehydratase class (9Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The high rate of mutagenesis is linked to the same damage: the iron that is lost from destabilized clusters floats freely into the cytosol where it catalyzes DNA oxidation by H2O2 (11Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 12Keyer K. Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Thus to date all the well understood deficits of SOD mutants arise from this single type of lesion. In higher organisms O·̄2 toxicity is linked to similar damage to mitochondrial aconitase (14Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Less clear is the mechanism by which O·̄2 is generated in cells in the first place. Molecular oxygen is actually a poor chemical oxidant, because its triplet state constrains it to accept one electron at a time from potential donors. Because biological electron carriers such as NAD(P)H resist the loss of a single electron, and the oxidizing potential of the O2/O·̄2 couple is low (−0.18 V using 1 m O2 as standard state), most electron traffic is unaffected by the presence of oxygen. However, complex electron transport chains include redox moieties such as flavins, quinones, and metal centers that excel at univalent electron transfers and are therefore plausible electron donors for oxygen. In the seminal experiments that led to the discovery of SOD, xanthine oxidase served as an enzymic source of O·̄2. Xanthine oxidase is actually a damaged form of xanthine dehydrogenase and has lost the ability to bind NAD+; as a consequence, electrons accumulate on its flavin, iron-sulfur cluster, and molybdopterin cofactors. In the absence of the native substrate, the electrons are transferred at a moderate rate from the flavin to dissolved oxygen, and an admixture of H2O2 and O·̄2 is produced (15Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9090-9095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hille R. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10914-10917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This example provides evidence that adventitious O·̄2 (and H2O2) production can occur quite rapidly but that the physical and electronic structures of proteins have evolved to suppress it. Although a number of native flavoproteins were examined by Massey's group (18Massey V. Strickland S. Mayhew S.G. Howell L.G. Engel P.C. Matthews R.G. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 36: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), none generated O·̄2 at rates close to that of xanthine oxidase. More recently we undertook a systematic effort to identify the primary sources of endogenous O·̄2 in E. coli. This organism does not have any enzymes that deliberately generate either O·̄2 or H2O2; as a facultative anaerobe, E. coli must maintain fluxes through its pathways even in anaerobic habitats. In this aspect E. coli is unlike committed aerobes, which sometimes employ H2O2-generating enzymes in biosynthetic pathways. In earlier work Imlay and Fridovich (19Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the respiratory chain is the apparent source of most endogenous O·̄2. Gonzalez-Flecha and Demple (20Gonzalez-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13681-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) arrived at the same conclusion with respect to H2O2. Subsequently fumarate reductase was determined to be the primary source of O·̄2 in the particular situation of transit from anaerobic to aerobic environments (21Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although fumarate reductase contains three iron-sulfur clusters, its autoxidation, like that of xanthine oxidase, occurred exclusively from the flavin. One purpose of the present study was to determine whether that is a general rule. Sulfite reductase comprises a second, albeit self-contained, electron transport chain in E. coli. Like the respiratory chain, sulfite reductase transfers electrons through FAD, FMN, [4Fe-4S], and siroheme, which are all good univalent redox enzymes and could plausibly transfer an electron to oxygen. In fact its reactivity with oxygen has been well documented (22Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 251-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Siegel L.M. Davis P.S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5921-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By comparing the sites, rates, and valencies of electron transfers from these carriers to oxygen, we wished to identify characteristics that may predispose redox enzymes to generate O·̄2 and/or H2O2. If these oxidants are preponderantly generated by only a few enzymic sources, then variations in the titer of such enzymes (from one growth condition to another or one organism to another) might substantially change the degree of endogenous oxidative stress. Bovine erythrocyte copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, horseradish peroxidase, E. colimanganese superoxide dismutase, NADH, NADPH, deamino-NADH, acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyNAD+), acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AcPyNADP+), plumbagin, potassium ferricyanide, ubiquinone-1, FAD, FMN, chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid, cytochrome c, ADP, H2O2, ferene, o-dianisidine, scopoletin, dichlorofluorescein, hydroxylamine, α-glycerol phosphate, fumaric acid, 4-hydroxybenzoate, djenkolic acid, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and tetracycline were purchased from Sigma. Catalase was from Boehringer Mannheim, ferric chloride was from G. Frederich Smith Chemical, and potassium cyanide and ferrous chloride were from Aldrich. Deionized house water was further purified with a Labconco Water Pro PS system. Strains used in this study are listed in TableI. Mutant strains were constructed by P1 transduction. All comparisons in this work were between congenic strains. Mutant fnr alleles were co-transduced with a linked tetracycline-resistant Tn10; inheritance of thefnr allele was demonstrated by the inability of mutants to grow anaerobically on glycerol/nitrate medium (25Shaw D.J. Guest J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a ubi men (quinoneless) background this screen cannot work, so the allele from putative transductants was transduced back out into a quinone-proficient background and screened. The frd deletion was co-transduced with a Tn10 and screened for growth on glycerol/fumarate. ndh::cam alleles were selected by chloramphenicol. The absence of NADH dehydrogenase II was screened by enzymatic assay for NADH:plumbagin oxidoreductase activity after vesicles were incubated at pH 7.8 to inactivate the NADH dehydrogenase I complex (26Leif H. Sled V.C. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The nuo mutant allele was selected by the linked Tn10. Potential NADH dehydrogenase I-deficient transductants were screened for deamino-NADH:plumbagin oxidoreductase activity (27Matsushita K. Ohnishi T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Table IStrains and plasmidsStrainsGenotypeSourceAN387F− rpsL gal52AN386As AN387 plusmenA40152JI224As AN387 pluszjd∷Tn10 Δ(frdABCD)18P1(GV141) × AN387AN384As AN387 plus ubiA420 menA40152IY13F− thi his ilv trp rspL53IY12As IY13 plus ndh nuo53KM44As AN384 plus Δfnr∷Spr zcj∷Tn10plus pndh +P1(RZ8457) × AN384 plus pMWJI341As UM1 plus ndh∷camP1(MWC215) × UM1JI342As UM1 plus zej-223∷Tn10 nuoP1(MWC190) × UM1JI303As AN384 plus nuo zej-223∷Tn10P1(MWC190) × AN384SLC1As AN384 plus ndh∷camP1(MWC215) × UM1KM50As GK100 plus Δfnr∷Spr zcj∷Tn10 plus pndh +P1(RZ8457) × GK100 plus pMWJI132/pJRS102(sodA∷ Mud PR13)25(sodB-kan)1-Δ2 thr-1 leuB6 proA2 his-4 thi-1 argE2 lacY1 galK2 rspL supE44 ara-14 xyl-15 mtl-1 tsx-33JI132 plus pJRS102DH5α/pcysJsupE44 ΔlacU169 (f80lacZDM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1DH5α plus pcysJGV141zjd∷Tn10 Δ(frdABCD)8 sdhC4 araD139 Δ(argF-lac)U169 rpsL150 relA1 flbB deoC1 pfsF25 rbsR recA938∷catBob GennisRZ8457Δfnr∷Spr zcj∷Tn10Patricia KileyMWC215thi rpsL ndh∷camBob GennisMWC190thi rpsL nuo zej-223∷Tn10Bob GennisUM1katE katG14 lacY rspL thi-154GK100ΔcydAB∷camr Δ(cyoABCDE)456∷kan thi rpsL galBob GennispMW01pBR322 plusndh + insert41pJRS012pBR322 pluscysJIHGNick KredichpcysJpBR322 pluscysJ31 Open table in a new tab Vesicles were prepared from cells grown in either LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, minimal A glucose medium (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 432Google Scholar), or minimal A supplemented with 1% casamino acids and 0.5 mm tryptophan. Standard antibiotic concentrations were used for plasmid maintenance and P1 transductions (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.6Google Scholar). Media for anaerobic cultures were degassed by autoclaving and equilibrated in an anaerobic chamber (10% H2, 5% CO2, 85% N2) for at least 24 h before inoculation. For purification of sulfite reductase, the MgSO4·7H2O and (NH4)2SO4 present in minimal A salts were replaced with (per liter) 0.08 g of MgCl2and 0.8 g of NH4Cl, and cultures were supplemented with 0.5 mm each amino acid except methionine and cystine. For preparation of holoenzyme 0.25 g of djenkolic acid was provided as sole sulfur source (30Ostrowski J. Barber M.J. Rueger D.C. Miller B.E. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15796-15808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); for preparation of flavoprotein, starter cultures grown with 0.8 mmMgSO4·7H2O were diluted 1:100 into sulfur-free medium (31Eschenbrenner M. Coves J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The difference in protocols reflects our evolving strategies to induce maximal expression of the sulfite-reductase operon. Respiratory vesicles were customarily prepared as described previously (53Young I.G. Wallace B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 449: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When we sought to avoid the inactivation of NADH dehydrogenase I, cells were lysed, and vesicles were prepared in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10% glycerol (26Leif H. Sled V.C. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These conditions were not necessary for activity, however, so reactions with respiratory vesicles and enzymes were conducted in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.8. NADH dehydrogenase II was purified from both quinone-proficient and -deficient strains. The wild-type enzyme was purified from KM50, anndh-overexpressing strain which is quinone-proficient but lacks cytochrome oxidases o and d. Preliminary preparations had revealed that trace amounts of cytochrome oxidase activity interfered slightly with assays of NADH oxidase activity during purification. Because cytochrome oxidase mutants grow poorly in air, KM50 was grown in 10 liters of anaerobic LB, 0.2% glucose to anA 600 of 0.3 and then shifted into air and grown to a final A 600 of 0.45. The anaerobic culture permitted a high enzyme titer to be achieved, particularly because of the loss of suppression (32Spiro S. Roberts R.E. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by Fnr protein. The final growth period in air ensured ubiquinone sufficiency. 6.7 g of cell pellet was suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm KPi, pH 7.8, and lysed by French press. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm × 20 min, and vesicles were pelleted at 100,000 ×g for 3 h. NADH dehydrogenase was extracted from resuspended membranes with deoxycholate and purified over hydroxyapatite as described (33Jaworowski A. Mayo G. Shaw D.C. Campbell H.D. Young I.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Active fractions were verified by both NADH:ferricyanide and NADH:ubiquinone-1 oxidoreductase assays. Purified fractions produced a single band on SDS gels (not shown). Samples were dialyzed against 90 volumes of 5 mmKPi, pH 7.5 and 0.1% cholate with two changes of buffer, in order to remove exogenous FAD. Ubiquinone-deficient NADH dehydrogenase II was purified from an anaerobic culture of KM44, which lacks both menaquinone and ubiquinone. The deletion of fnr and presence of a multicopyndh-expressing plasmid again ensured abundant synthesis of the enzyme even during anaerobiosis. Six liters of 0.2A 600 cultures were harvested. The lack of respiratory activity in the vesicles verified that quinones were absent. NADH dehydrogenase II was extracted and purified as above. Sulfite reductase holoenzyme was purified from JI132/pJRS102. This plasmid (34Wu J.-Y. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) includes cysG, which encodes an enzyme needed to generate mature siroheme for sulfite reductase and nitrite reductase, and causes abundant overproduction of sulfite reductase in sulfur-limited cells. A 2.6-g cell pellet was recovered from 4.5 liters of 0.4 A 600 culture. Cells were lysed by French press. The purification scheme of Ref. 24Coves J. Zeghouf M. Macherel D. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5921-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar was followed, including streptomycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate precipitations, Superose sizing column, and hydroxyapatite column. The enzyme activity was monitored by assay for sulfite reductase activity. Purified enzyme migrated as 56- and 61-kDa bands. The spectra of pure fractions matched that observed by other investigators (54Loewen P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 622-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfite reductase flavoprotein (subunit B) was purified from DH5α/pcysJ. Six liters of culture were harvested at 0.25A 600, and the purification scheme described above was followed. Activity was followed by NADPH:cytochromec reductase activity. Active fractions were bright yellow throughout the purification, and the spectrum of the pure enzyme reproduced that reported earlier for the flavoprotein (30Ostrowski J. Barber M.J. Rueger D.C. Miller B.E. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15796-15808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FAD and FMN content of purified proteins was measured by extraction and fluorescence detection (22Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 251-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with authentic FMN and FAD as standards. Specific removal of FMN from the sulfite reductase flavoprotein subunit was achieved by 18 h incubation with 1 mm chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid at 4 °C (31Eschenbrenner M. Coves J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); the FMN content of treated enzyme was below the detection limit, and ∼90% of FAD was retained. Unless noted otherwise, sulfite reductase reactions were conducted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 50 μmEDTA. The production of O·̄2 by the aerobic respiratory chain in the absence of active NADH dehydrogenase I was measured by the standard cytochromec method (1McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method did not work when NADH dehydrogenase I was active, because that enzyme can directly reduce cytochrome c. Acetylation of cytochrome c (35Fridovich I. Oberly L.W. Superoxide Dismutase. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 69-78Google Scholar) diminished the rate of its direct reduction. Five ml of 0.62 mm cytochrome c was treated with 125 mm acetic anhydride for 30 min on ice, dialyzed against two changes of 1 liter of 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, and frozen at −70 °C. 1.5 μm acetylated cytochromec then replaced 10 μm native cytochromec in the standard assay of O·̄2. O·̄2 produced by xanthine oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase II was quantitively detected by the acetylated cytochrome c. Acetylated cytochrome c was still reduced too rapidly by sulfite reductase to serve as an assay of O·̄2 production by that enzyme. Epinephrine, tetranitromethane, luciferase, and nitro blue tetrazolium assays (reviewed in Ref. 35Fridovich I. Oberly L.W. Superoxide Dismutase. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 69-78Google Scholar) also failed because of direct interactions between sulfite reductase and the detector molecules. Therefore, O·̄2 was detected by its ability to reduce Fe3+. Reactions contained 5.2 mm ADP, 210 μm FeCl3, 800 units of catalase, enzyme, and enzyme substrate in 3.5 mm Tris, pH 7.8. All stock solutions were prepared in 3.5 mm buffer, with the exception of enzymes, which were in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8. The ADP stock solution was adjusted to pH 7.8. Control reactions included 30 units of SOD. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme substrate and aliquoted to cuvettes that were each continuously monitored for absorbance at 562. At defined 1-min intervals, ferene was added to consecutive cuvettes to a 900 μm final concentration, and the jump in absorbance was recorded. This increase was used to calculate the amount of Fe2+ that had accumulated by that time, using εmm = 27.5 at 562 nm for the Fe2+-ferene complex. In control experiments this system efficiently detected the O·̄2 that was generated by xanthine oxidase, fumarate reductase, and NADH dehydrogenase II. Catalase was included to prevent re-oxidation of Fe2+ by H2O2. The rate of NADPH oxidation by sulfite reductase was also measured in the same reaction mixture (without ferene addition) so that O·̄2 yields could be compared with enzyme turnover. The oxidation rates of some enzymes were affected by the presence of ferric-ADP. Some of this effect was due to direct reduction of the ferric chelate, and this flux was subtracted in calculations of the oxidase activity of the enzymes. H2O2 production was measured using horseradish peroxidase. H2O2 was generated in high yield by quinoneless respiratory chains and could be conveniently assayed using o-dianisidine as the dye (36Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because NADH is not consumed by quinoneless membranes and interferes with horseradish peroxidase-based assays by competing with the dye, respiration-proficient vesicles were added to scavenge the residual NADH before detection by the horseradish peroxidase system. The H2O2 yielded by the oxidizing vesicles was scant compared with that from the quinoneless membranes, which were present in higher concentration. The initial reaction contained in a total volume of 4.2 ml: 30 μm NADH, quinoneless vesicles containing 0.2 units of NADH dehydrogenase, and 30 units of SOD. At time points over 8 min, 800-ml aliquots were removed, and 0.02 units of NADH oxidase activity were added as UM1 membranes to scavenge rapidly the residual NADH. Then to the sample was added a 100 μmmixture consisting of 150 μm o-dianisidine, 0.06 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase, 25 μm EDTA, and 50 mm KPi, pH 7.8. Absorbance was determined within 5 min at 460 nm. This protocol provided a time course of H2O2 production by quinoneless vesicles; since the scant H2O2 that was generated by UM1 vesicles was common to all time points, it was subtracted. We noted that when vesicles were formed by French pressing, some catalase was typically trapped inside the vesicles. Because this catalase interfered with H2O2 detection, scavenging vesicles were prepared from the catalase mutant UM1, and the measurements of H2O2 formation by respiratory chains were typically conducted on vesicles derived from catalase-free mutants. The yield of H2O2 from actively respiring vesicles was too small to be quantitated accurately by the dianisidine assay. Therefore the fluorescent dyes scopoletin, diacetyldichlorodihydrofluorescein, and amplex red were used as horseradish peroxidase substrates. Diacetyldichlorodihydrofluorescein was synthesized by standard methods (37Brandt R. Keston A.S. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Vesicles were incubated with different amounts of NADH up to 300 μm, in each case until the NADH was exhausted, and the H2O2 that was generated was quantitated by published methods (38Boveris A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 39Keston A.S. Brandt R. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 40Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). By so doing we determined the H2O2 yield as a function of the amount of NADH that was oxidized. With all three fluorescent substrates, we observed a high yield of H2O2 when as little as 10 μm NADH was added; above 25 μm NADH, however, the ratio of H2O2 produced per NADH oxidized was consistent, and that is the value cited in this work. Whereas it is formally possible that H2O2 formation is unusually rapid at low NADH concentrations, we suspect an horseradish peroxidase-based artifact, since the H2O2 yield at these doses was dependent upon the period of dye development. The basis of the artifact remains unclear. NAD(P)H oxidase activities of vesicles and of purified enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. NADH dehydrogenase activity was quantitated by monitoring NADH oxidation in the presence of 100 μm plumbagin and 3 mmcyanide (21Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transhydrogenase, ferricyanide reductase, hydroxylamine reductase, and sulfite reductase activities were measured by standard methods (23Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1572-1586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c reduction was assayed with 0.1 mm cytochrome c rather than 1 mm"

The expression pattern of Flt-4 suggests it may play a role during lymphangiogenesis (14Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Mustonen T. van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Fang G.-H. Dumont D. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3566-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). All of the three VEGF receptors belong to the PDGFR-β family of receptor tyrosine kinases (15Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Upon activation, these receptors dimerize and/or oligomerize, following which autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation of their tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain occurs. There are four putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr-951, Tyr-996, Tyr-1054, and Tyr-1059) in the KDR intracellular domain (16Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated tyrosine molecules act as docking sites for adaptor signaling molecules and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, thereby generating a signal cascade that culminates in a cellular response. The signal transduction pathways involved in mediating the various biological functions of VEGF on endothelial cells such as migration, proliferation, differentiation, or survival remain to be completely defined. The Ras-MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase pathway is a key component in the transduction of signals leading to growth and transformation. It consists of a linear cascade of protein kinases, Raf, MAP kinase kinase, and MAP kinase, which are also called extracellular-regulated kinases (Erks). Erk-1 and Erk-2 are acutely activated upon growth factor stimulation (17Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).

PI 3-kinase phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, which in turn act as second messengers. The p85 subunit contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors after stimulation of cells with growth factors and in this manner recruit p110 into the complex at the cell membrane. The region between the two SH2 domains, the iSH2 region, mediates the association with p110, and this interaction is required for the enzymatic activity of p110 (22Klippel A. Escobeda J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase upon VEGF stimulation (23Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) is suggestive of a potential role for PI 3-kinase in VEGF-mediated signaling. Given this observation, we hypothesized that PI 3-kinase might play a critical role in VEGF signaling, including the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time the functional significance of PI 3-kinase in VEGF signaling from Flk-1/KDR leading to MAP kinase activation, followed by transcriptional activation of the c-Fos serum response element that eventually culminates in endothelial cell proliferation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were passaged in medium M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 2 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor on 80-mm diameter dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma). HUVECs were not used after the sixth passage. For experimental purposes, HUVECs were plated on 0.2% gelatin-coated dishes and allowed to form a monolayer. Cultures were serum-starved with unsupplemented medium M199 containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 16–18 h. Serum-starved cultures were left untreated or treated with VEGF 165 at the indicated concentrations and time in 5.0 ml of medium M199 at 37 °C and harvested in appropriate lysis buffer at 4 °C. Anti-Flk-1, Flt-1, and Erk-2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-Erk-1/2 polyclonal antibodies were from New England Biolabs, and anti-p85 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (12C5A), β-galactosidase and luciferase assay kits, and cell proliferation assay kits containing BrdUrd and anti-BrdUrd antibody were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma, and PD98059 was bought from Calbiochem. PI 3-kinase substrate, phosphatidylinositol (sodium salt), was bought from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). The ECL reagent was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. VEGF 165 was procured from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). Wild type Flk-1 cDNA construct in CMV promoter-based plasmid was from Dr. Axel Ullrich (Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, München, Germany). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Erk-2 (pCMV-HA-Erk2) in pCMV, SRE-Fos-luciferase (SRE-Fos-Luc), and pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmids were from Dr. Joseph Schlessinger (New York University Medical Center, New York, NY). Dominant-negative (DN) p85 mutant plasmid pSG5 p85ΔiSH2-C was from Dr. Julian Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK), and DN Ras (Ras N17) was from Dr. E. Skolnik (New York University Medical Center, New York, NY). Stock solutions of wortmannin and PD98059 in Me2SO were kept at −20 °C. Stocks were diluted in serum-free medium prior to use. Wortmannin, PD98059, or the Me2SO carrier control was added to the cells for 15–20 min before the addition of growth factor. Protein was estimated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. HUVECs were transiently transfected with 5 μg of SRE-Fos-Luc and 1.0 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmids using Superfect according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). 24 or 48 h later, cultures were serum-starved as indicated earlier and treated as mentioned in the legends. Cells were harvested in appropriate lysis buffer. For dominant negative studies, HUVECs were transiently transfected with 2.0 μg of HA-Erk-2, 1.0 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase, and increasing concentrations of DN p85 plasmid. The concentration of DNA per transfection was kept constant by supplementing with the vector alone. For co-immunoprecipitation of p85 with Flk-1, HUVECs were transiently transfected with 10 μg of Flk-1 plasmid. For studies of cell cycle progression with DN p85, cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of CMV-β-gal and increasing concentrations of either DN p85 or DN Ras plasmids. HUVECs were lysed in cell extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors, namely 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A), clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and equal amount of lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 or anti-Flk-1 antibodies and 25 μl of protein A-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, and beads were boiled and resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with either anti-Flk-1 or anti-p85 antibodies. Blots were developed using the ECL reagent. HUVECs were lysed in modified RIPA (cold) buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) containing the above mentioned protease inhibitors. Lysates were precleared and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated for 3 h with either anti-Flk-1 or anti-p85 polyclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold modified RIPA buffer, followed by two washes in kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2) at room temperature. In vitro kinase assay was initiated by adding 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μmol of cold ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>4000 μCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and shaken in a vortex for 15 min at room temperature. Kinase complexes were resolved in an 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were treated with KOH for 2 h at 60 °C to remove serine and threonine phosphorylation. Gels were fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. PI 3-kinase activity was assayed essentially as described by Krook et al. (24Krook A. Whitehead J.P. Dobson S.P. Griffiths M.R. Ouwens M. Baker C. Hayward A.C. Sen S.K. Maassen J.A. Siddle K. Tavare J.M. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30208-30214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Serum-starved HUVECs were treated with VEGF for 5 min. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was used for immunoprecipitation at a concentration of 4 μg/mg of lysate. PI 3-kinase assay was carried out in kinase assay buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 400 μm adenosine) containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl. The reaction products were extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). The chloroform phase was collected, separated by thin layer chromatography, autoradiographed, and quantified using a phosphorimager. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4,1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Equal amount of lysate was resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the blots were immunoblotted with anti-phosphospecific Erk-1/2 antibodies that recognize phosphorylation of Thr202and Tyr204. For inhibition studies, serum-starved cells were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of wortmannin or PD98059 for 15 min prior to VEGF treatment. For assays of transfected HA-Erk-2, affinity-purified anti-HA monoclonal antibody was used for immunoprecipitations (IP). The amount of cell lysate used in the IP was normalized for β-galactosidase activity levels to account for transfection efficiencies. Erk-2 immune complex assays were initiated by adding 30 μl of kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>4000 μCi/mmol) and 2.5 μg of bovine brain-derived myelin basic protein (MBP). The kinase complex was resolved in 14% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. MBP runs as an 18-kDa protein. HUVECs transiently transfected with SRE-Fos-Luc and CMV-β-galactosidase plasmids were pretreated with wortmannin at the concentration mentioned in the figure legend and stimulated with VEGF. Cultures were harvested 6 h later in reporter lysis buffer and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. HUVECs were plated on gelatin-coated coverslips in 12-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells, allowed to adhere for 12 h, and serum-starved for 24 h. After 12 h of incubation in serum-free medium M199 supplemented with 10 ng/ml VEGF containing 10 μm 5′-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), cells were fixed and stained with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins. For DN studies, cells transiently transfected with CMV-β-gal and DN p85 or DN Ras were serum-starved for 36 h and then incubated in medium M199 containing 10 μm BrdUrd and 10 ng/ml VEGF for 10 h. Cells were fixed and stained with X-gal, followed by anti-BrdUrd as described above. The percentage of X-gal-positive cells that had incorporated BrdUrd was evaluated using a light microscope. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t test. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation of the mean. In order to investigate the mitogenic response to VEGF in a physiologically relevant model, we chose to study the response in HUVECs rather than cell line. Unfortunately, available antibodies did not immunoprecipitate KDR from HUVECs, so we transfected these cells with a cDNA encoding Flk-1, the murine homologue of KDR. Transfection efficiencies in HUVECs varied from 20% to 40%, and transfection of HUVECs did not change their gross morphology. We demonstrate the co-immunoprecipitation of Flk-1/KDR with p85 from VEGF unstimulated and stimulated human endothelial cells following immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 antibodies (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to these findings, the anti-Flk-1 antibodies did not immunoprecipitate p85 (Fig. 1 B). We conclude from these results that p85 can directly and constitutively associate with Flk-1/KDR. p85 has been shown to associate with Flt-1 in a yeast two-hybrid system (25Cunningham S.A. Waxham M.N. Arrate P.M. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20254-20257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore looked for Flt-1 association with p85 and Flk-1/KDR in the above immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with Flt-1 specific antibodies. Under our experimental conditions, we could not detect Flt-1 in either p85 or Flk-1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). We next confirmed previous observations that KDR, which has intrinsic kinase activity, was tyrosine-phosphorylated as a result of VEGF treatment (Fig. 2 A). We found that, in addition to KDR, two other proteins migrating with approximate molecular masses of 46 and 70 kDa were also tyrosine-phosphorylated. Concomitant phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in response to VEGF stimulation was demonstrated by in vitrokinase assay following immunopecipitation with a specific anti-p85 antibody (Fig. 2 B). We sought to examine whether p85 phosphorylation in response to VEGF treatment was able to regulate the catalytic counterpart of the PI 3-kinase enzyme, p110. We found VEGF treatment resulted in about 80 ± 25% increase in PI 3-kinase activity when examined by an in vitro kinase assay using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate (Fig.3, A and B). This increase in PI 3-kinase activity could be blocked when endothelial cells were preincubated with wortmannin (10 and 100 nm), a fungal metabolite that is a potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (p < 0.01 versus VEGF-stimulated). Wortmannin also significantly inhibited the unstimulated background PI 3-kinase at 100 nm concentration (p < 0.001 versus control). MAP kinase plays a central role in controlling signals for growth from most growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. We looked at the kinetics of MAP kinase activation in VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells and found a time-dependent response, which was maximum at 10 min (data not shown). To assess the role of PI 3-kinase in MAP kinase activation by VEGF, cells were preincubated with different concentrations of wortmannin prior to VEGF stimulation. Interestingly, wortmannin in a dose-dependent manner inhibited VEGF-induced Erk1/2 activation (Fig. 4 A), indicating that PI 3-kinase is involved in MAP kinase activation by VEGF. About 70% inhibition of MAP kinase activation was observed with 100 nm wortmannin (concentration relevant to PI 3-kinase inhibition). The MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059, was used a positive control (Fig. 4 A). The blot was stripped and reprobed with Erk-2 antibodies to confirm equal loading of protein (Fig. 4 B). To confirm that the PI 3-kinase pathway was responsible for activating MAP kinase in response to VEGF, cells were co-transfected with HA epitope-tagged Erk-2 and increasing concentrations of a DN form of p85 (p85ΔiSH2-C). This DN p85 lacks the amino acids 475–523 in the iSH2 domain and therefore does not bind p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Co-expression of p85 with HA-tagged Erk-2 was necessary to facilitate the evaluation of dominant negative effects in only the transfected cells. As expected, stimulation with VEGF caused an activation of the tagged Erk-2. Importantly, overexpression of a DN p85 mutant inhibited VEGF-induced HA-Erk-2 activation in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of HA-Erk-2 and DN p85 at a 1:5 ratio suppressed Erk-2 activation almost 70% (Fig.5). Erk-1/2 can regulate transcription from the c-Fos serum response element (SRE) by phosphorylating the ternary complex factors Elk-1 and SAP-1, which control induction of immediate early genes (27Triesman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether PI 3-kinase was essential for the nuclear events initiated following VEGF stimulation, HUVECs were transiently transfected with a vector containing the Fos-SRE promoter element linked to the luciferase gene. As expected, treatment with VEGF resulted in a 7-fold increase in transcription from the SRE promoter. Wortmannin at a concentration of 20 nm inhibited the SRE transcriptional activity by 47 ± 3.5%. Higher wortmannin concentration (100 nm) did not further inhibit the transcriptional activity (Fig. 6). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase activation following VEGF stimulation can induce the transcription of c-Fos from SRE and presumably other immediate early genes. To examine the biological effects of VEGF-activated PI 3-kinase signaling events further downstream, experiments were carried out to determine BrdUrd incorporation as a measure of VEGF-induced growth. Following VEGF treatment, 65 ± 4.6% of the serum starved HUVECs entered into the S-phase as detected by staining with anti-BrdUrd antibody. Wortmannin blocked VEGF-induced BrdUrd incorporation by approximately 40% at 10 nm and about 50% at 100 nm concentration (Fig.7 A). Nonspecific effects of wortmannin were eliminated by studies of cell cycle progression with DN p85. Interestingly, DN p85 inhibited in a dose-dependent manner entry of the cells into S-phase (Fig. 7 B). DN Ras was used as positive control. Both DN p85 and DN Ras failed to block cells entering into the S-phase of the cell cycle in media containing 20% serum (data not shown). To further our knowledge of the signal transduction pathways from VEGF receptor, we have analyzed the functional importance of PI 3-kinase in VEGF signaling from Flk-1/KDR. It has been shown that p85, the adaptor subunit of PI 3-kinase, is capable of associating with the VEGF receptor (23Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 25Cunningham S.A. Waxham M.N. Arrate P.M. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20254-20257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The functional significance of PI 3-kinase activation in VEGF signaling has, however, not been defined clearly. In our study, we show that phosphorylation of p85 in response to VEGF regulates its catalytic counterpart, i.e. p110, and furthermore demonstrate that PI 3-kinase activation contributes to MAP kinase activation, transcription of c-Fos SRE, and cell cycle progression in human endothelial cells. Several reports have shown that activated Flk-1/KDR receptors will associate with signaling intermediates such as phospholipase C-γ, GTPase-activating protein, Nck-Grb2, and Shc-Grb2 (23Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 28Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M.

These interactions result in tyrosine phosphorylation of some of the potential substrates. The Ras-MAP kinase pathway has been reported to signal for VEGF-induced growth, as has the PKC-MAP kinase pathway (30Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar,31Takhashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2009-2079Google Scholar). Our results show for the first time that PI 3-kinase not only gets phosphorylated upon VEGF stimulation but also contributes to cell cycle progression following MAP kinase activation. One of the early events observed upon interaction of VEGF with its receptor Flk-1/KDR is activation of the receptor's intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In agreement with previous studies (28Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), Flk-1/KDR was strongly phosphorylated in response to VEGF in our study. Two other proteins phosphorylated and recruited to the activated receptor had approximate molecular masses of 46/47 and 67/70 kDa. The 46/47-kDa protein (p46/47) phosphorylated in our study could either be p46Shc or p47Nck, both of which are known to bind to Flk-1/KDR (30Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) as well as to other receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFR and epidermal growth factor receptor (32Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

Although we did not characterize the identity of these proteins, we subscribed to the idea that these were SH2 domain-containing tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, which potentially couple to the activation of Ras-MAP kinase pathway (35Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). We also show that Flk-1/KDR constitutively associates with p85 as this association was independent of VEGF stimulation. Flk-1/KDR has a candidate motif YXXM in its intracellular region which is a potential site for p85 to bind. It should be noted here that p85 contains two SH2 domain and a SH3 domain, the SH2 domain of p85 is responsible for interaction with phosphorylated tyrosine in the context of above motif. However, mutational analysis of tyrosine residues in Flk-1/KDR would be required to verify this notion. Flt-1, the other receptor for VEGF, has also been shown to associate with p85 in a two-hybrid system, the binding site for which has been identified as a YVNA motif (25Cunningham S.A. Waxham M.N. Arrate P.M. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20254-20257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, Flt-1 does not apparently signal for proliferation, which has been underscored by knockout studies wherein only the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt-1 has been deleted (36Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Flt-1 tyrosine kinase homozygous mice (Flt-1TK−/−) develop normal blood vessels and survive, which suggests that Flt-1 tyrosine kinase domain does not signal for migration, proliferation, and differentiation, essential features of endothelial cells during vasculogenesis. Although activation of the kinase counterpart of PI 3-kinase may or may not require p85 to be phosphorylated (37Van der Greer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that VEGF treatment promoted p85 phosphorylation that in turn increased PI 3-kinase activity. In accordance with published literature (30Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 38Abedi H. Zachary I. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), we have also observed MAP kinase activation in endothelial cells upon VEGF stimulation. We demonstrate for the first time in our study a link between PI 3-kinase and the downstream activation of MAP kinase in VEGF stimulated cells by 1) significantly inhibiting MAP kinase activation with wortmannin, a potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor; and 2) blocking MAP kinase activation with a dominant negative p85 mutant. These observations suggest that the lipid products generated by the PI (3Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Feder J. Dvorak H.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5629-5632PubMed Google Scholar) kinase following VEGF stimulation may bind to a signaling protein which could activate MAP kinase. Candidate proteins could be pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins that require PI 3-kinase products to be fully activated (35Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 40Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto U.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Finally, we demonstrate for the first time the critical role of PI 3-kinase activation in generating a maximal mitogenic response to VEGF. These observations are consistent with previous evidence supporting a role for PI 3-kinase in PDGF-induced and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced mitogenic signaling in smooth muscle cells and macrophages, respectively (41Iwama A. Sawamura M. Nara Y. Yamori Y. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22: S318-S320Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar,42Yusoff P. Hamilton J. Nolan R. Phillips W. Growth Factors. 1994; 1: 181-192Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activation has been linked to a number of biologically diverse processes such as cell survival, membrane trafficking, and insulin-stimulated glucose transport (43Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 44Kapeller R. Cantley L.C.

Very recently, the constitutively active forms of PI 3-kinase have been ingeniously used to identify and study responses specifically induced by PI 3-kinase, an approach that has shown that PI 3-kinase activation alone is sufficient to promote entry into S phase of the cell cycle (46Klippel A. Escobedo M.A. Wachowicz M.S. Apell G. Brown T.W. Giedlin M.A. Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5699-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The fact that our inhibition studies with either DN p85 or wortmannin did not abolish VEGF-induced MAP kinase activation and mitogenesis suggests the presence of additional PI 3-kinase-independent pathways in VEGF-induced growth promoting effects, such as the PKC-MAP kinase (31Takhashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2009-2079Google Scholar) and the Ras-MAP kinase pathway (30Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In summary, results of our study identify PI 3-kinase as an important mediator of VEGF-induced MAP kinase activation and subsequent endothelial cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2025732663,"Fractalkine is a novel multidomain protein expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells. Cells expressing the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 adhere to fractalkine with high affinity, but it is not known if adherence requires G-protein activation and signal transduction. To investigate the cell adhesion properties of fractalkine, we created mutated forms of CX3CR1 that have little or no ability to transduce intracellular signals. Cells expressing signaling-incompetent forms of CX3CR1 bound rapidly and with high affinity to immobilized fractalkine in both static and flow assays. Video microscopy revealed that CX3CR1-expressing cells bound more rapidly to fractalkine than to VCAM-1 (60 versus 190 ms). Unlike VCAM-1, fractalkine did not mediate cell rolling, and after capture on fractalkine, cells did not dislodge. Finally, soluble fractalkine induced intracellular calcium fluxes and chemotaxis, but it did not activate integrins. Taken together these data provide strong evidence that CX3CR1, a seven-transmembrane domain receptor, mediates robust cell adhesion to fractalkine in the absence of G-protein activation and suggest a novel role for this receptor as an adhesion molecule."

Vincent G.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1996-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The combination of two properties, fast inactivation and slow deactivation, distinguish I Kr from other cardiac currents (15Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). HERG channels inactivate much more rapidly than they activate. The net result is that most HERG channels are closed during the plateau phases of the cardiac action potential. Rapid recovery from inactivation during repolarization combined with a very slow subsequent transition to the closed state (deactivation) results in an increase ofI Kr during the terminal phase of cardiac repolarization. The structural basis of rapid inactivation and slow deactivation of HERG is partially understood. Inactivation can be completely removed by a double mutation in the pore region of the channel (17Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of this region and its similarity to C-type inactivation (18Wang S. Morales M.J. Liu S. Strauss H.C. Rasmusson R.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1991; 7: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). This mechanism is in contrast to most rapidly inactivating K+ channels in which interaction of the amino terminus with the S4-S5 linker closes the channel by occlusion of the inner pore region (20Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). HERG channel deactivation is greatly accelerated by removal of the amino-terminal region or by mutation of specific residues in the S4-S5 linker (21Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar,22Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the amino-terminal region of HERG has been determined and shown to possess a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain (23Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This domain may interact with another region of HERG such as the S4-S5 linker to affect channel deactivation. A negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation or acceleration in the rate of deactivation would reduce the contribution of I Kr to repolarization and lengthen the duration of cardiac action potentials. Mutations in HERG that cause LQT and shift the voltage dependence of inactivation have been described (8Nakajima T. Furukawa T. Tanaka T. Katayama Y. Nagai R. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe several LQT-associated mutations in the amino-terminal region of HERG that accelerate the rate of deactivation. The location of these mutations in the recently described three-dimensional structure of the HERG amino-terminal region (23Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests they may disrupt the function of the PAS domain. Mutations were introduced into wild type (WT) HERG by the megaprimer method (24Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant construct was then subcloned into the pSP64 (Promega, Madison, WI) plasmid expression vector. Before use in expression experiments, the constructs were characterized by restriction mapping and DNA sequence analyses. cRNA for injection into oocytes were prepared with SP6 Capscribe (Boehringer Mannheim) following linearization with EcoRI. Xenopus laevis frogs were anesthetized by immersion in 0.2% tricaine for 15–30 min. Ovarian lobes were digested with 2 mg/ml Type 1A collagenase (Sigma) in Ca2+-free ND96 solution for 1.5 h to remove follicle cells. Stage IV and V oocytes were injected with HERG cRNA (7.5 ng), then cultured in Barth's solution supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 1 mm pyruvate at 18 °C. Barth's solution contained 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Oocytes were bathed in a modified ND96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6. Currents were recorded at room temperature (21–23 °C) using standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques (25Stuhmer W. Rudy B. Iverson L.E. Ion Channels Methods in Enzymology. 207. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992: 319-339Google Scholar). Glass microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, and their tips were broken to obtain tip resistances of 0.5–1.5 MΩ. Oocytes were voltage-clamped with a Dagan TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Voltage commands were generated using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), a personal computer, and a TL-1 D/A interface (Axon Instruments). Unless noted otherwise, the oocyte membrane potential was held at −80 mV between test pulses. PCLAMP6.2 software was used to fit current traces to exponential functions. Exponential fits to current tracings were performed using the Chebyshev technique to determine the time constants (τx) and amplitudes (A X) for exponential functions. The voltage dependence of HERG activation was determined from tail currents measured at –70 mV following 2- or 30-s test depolarizations. Normalized tail current amplitude (I n) was plotted versus test potential (V t) and fitted to a Boltzmann function using ORIGIN (Northampton, MA), In=1/(1+exp[(V1/2−Vt)k])Equation 1 V 1/2 is the voltage at which the current is half-activated, and k is the slope factor. The voltage dependence of HERG inactivation was determined using a three-pulse voltage pulse protocol as described previously (26Zou A. Xu Q.P. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 129-137Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The peak of the inactivating current during the third pulse was normalized to the peak value, plotted as a function of the voltage of the second pulse, then fitted with a Boltzmann function. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.(n = number of oocytes). The amino-terminal region is a highly conserved domain in all members of the eag potassium channel family that includes eag, erg, and elk. We and others (21Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A.

(Lond.). 1997; 502: 537-543Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) previously reported that expression of HERG channels lacking this domain deactivate much faster than WT HERG channels, indicating the importance of this domain in normal gating. We hypothesized missense mutations within this domain that cause LQT would also accelerate deactivation and thereby reduce outward current through HERG channels during repolarization of the cardiac action potential. After solving the genomic structure of HERG (9Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Lehmann M.H. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we used single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses to screen for mutations in individuals with LQT. Many mutations were found in the amino-terminal region of HERG. 2Splawski, I., and Keating, M. T., submitted for publication. Eight missense mutations located in the amino-terminal region of HERG were chosen for electrophysiologic characterization (F29L, N33T, G53R, R56Q, C66G, H70R, A78P, and L86R). These mutations are located near the end of the amino terminus of HERG, which is about 400 amino acids in length. Mutant channels were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. cRNA for each construct was prepared and injected into Xenopusoocytes. Voltage clamp experiments were performed to assess the functional consequences of each mutation. Unlike the majority of LQT-associated missense mutations in HERG (13Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the 8 amino-terminal mutant HERG subunits formed functional channels when expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes. The I-V relationship for each oocyte was determined by pulsing to +40 mV for 1 s to allow currents to reach a steady-state level before repolarization for 3 s to a potential ranging from +40 to –120 mV (Fig.1 A). The currents at the end of the 3-s pulse were plotted as a function of voltage (Fig.1 B). The I-V relationships indicate that WT HERG and mutant HERG channels exhibit weak inward rectification. The peak of the I-V for some of the mutant HERG channels was shifted in the positive direction. As discussed below, this shift can be explained by an altered voltage dependence of channel inactivation. The most notable change caused by the mutations was an accelerated rate of current deactivation. Fig.2 A shows tail currents for WT HERG and three mutants elicited by a similar voltage pulse protocol illustrated in Fig. 1. The rate of current deactivation was determined by fitting tail currents to a two-exponential function at potentials ranging from –70 mV to –120 mV for WT HERG and from –50 mV to –120 mV for the mutant channels. Deactivation was too slow to measure during the 3-s period at –50 mV and –60 mV for WT HERG channels. All 8 mutant HERG channels deactivated more rapidly than WT HERG channels at potentials positive to –90 mV. The rate of deactivation varied for each mutant and was fastest for R56Q HERG and slowest for H70R HERG. For example, at –70 mV, WT HERG channels deactivated with time constants of 0.42 s and 1.90 s. By contrast, the mutant channels had time constants that ranged from 0.067 to 0.22 s for the fast component and 0.18 to 1.20 s for the slow component (Fig.2, B and C). The rate of HERG channel activation between –40 mV and 0 mV was best described with a two-exponential function. The rates of activation were similar for WT HERG and most of the mutant HERG channels. The exceptions were R56Q and N33T, which activated more slowly than WT HERG (Fig.3).Figure 3Voltage dependence of HERG activation rate.

These mutants were chosen because they caused the greatest changes in kinetics or shifts in the voltage dependence of the I-V relationship. TheV 1/2 and slope factor for WT HERG was –52.1 ± 0.6 mV and 6.7 ± 0.3 mV (n = 7). The V 1/2 for H70R and L86R HERG channels were similar to WT, but the V 1/2 was shifted by +7.6 mV for N33T HERG and +11.3 mV for R56Q HERG (Fig. 4 B and6 B).Figure 6Currents induced by coexpression of WT HERG and R56Q HERG subunits have properties intermediate to that induced by either subunit alone.

D, fast deactivation of R56Q HERG channels reduces amplitude of current during repolarization phase of a voltage ramp. Currents were normalized to amplitude of instantaneous tail currents at −120 mV to account for variable levels of channel expression between individual oocytes. Instantaneous tail current was measured by extrapolation of the deactivating phase to the time of initial repolarization from a prepulse to +40 mV. The traces represent the mean current for 5 oocytes + or – 1 S.E. (n = 5 for eachtrace).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The voltage dependence of channel availability was determined using a three-pulse protocol described previously (17Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 26Zou A. Xu Q.P. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 129-137Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A 1-s pulse to +35 mV to inactivate most channels was followed by a 20-ms pulse to a variable potential (−145 to +35 mV) to allow a variable recovery of channels from inactivation but little or no deactivation. The third pulse was to +35 mV to assess the relative number of channels that recovered from inactivation during the second pulse (Fig.5 A). The peak current elicited by the third pulse was estimated by extrapolation of a single exponential fit of the current trace to the beginning of the pulse. These data were plotted as a function of the voltage for pulse two and then fit with a Boltzmann function to determine the peak current to be used for normalization. The normalized data was averaged and fit with a Boltzmann function to determine the V 1/2 and slope factor of the relationship (Fig. 5 B). For these experiments, we characterized the four mutants that caused the greatest positive shift in the peak of the steady-state I-V relationship. TheV 1/2 for the voltage dependence of steady-state channel availability was –89.3 mV for WT HERG channels. All four mutants (N33T, R56Q, H70R, L86R) caused a positive shift in this relationship. The V 1/2 was shifted by +19.6 mV for N33T, +9.5 mV for H70R, +9.0 mV for L86R (Fig. 5 B), and +35.8 mV for R56Q HERG (Fig.6 C). The slope factor of the relationship was not significantly altered by any of the mutant channels. The shift in the voltage dependence of channel availability explains the shift in the peak of the steady-state I-V relationship shown in Fig. 1. The mutations of HERG studied here are inherited in a dominant manner. Thus, affected individuals have one normal allele and one mutant allele. To mimic the disease condition, the currents induced by coexpression of WT HERG subunits and one of the mutant subunits (R56Q) were compared with currents induced by expression of WT HERG or R56Q HERG subunits alone. Coexpression of R56Q HERG and WT HERG subunits resulted in a current that was similar or larger in magnitude compared with WT HERG alone but had intermediate kinetics of deactivation and voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 6 A). For example, at –70 mV, the time constants for deactivation were 0.42 s and 1.90 s for WT HERG, 0.067 s and 0.18 s for R56Q HERG, and 0.11 s and 0.58 s for cells expressing WT + R56Q HERG channel subunits. The shift in the V 1/2 for steady-state activation induced by coexpression of WT and R56Q HERG channel subunits was +7.4 mV, about half that caused by R56Q HERG alone (Fig.6 B). As shown in Fig. 6 C, the shift in the voltage dependence of channel availability induced by R56Q HERG (+35.8 mV) was about twice that measured for oocytes expressing WT + R56Q HERG subunits (+18.9 mV). These data indicate that R56Q HERG does not have a dominant negative effect when coexpressed with WT HERG but does alter the kinetics and voltage dependence of heteromultimeric channels. To simulate the voltage transition that occurs during a cardiac action potential, we applied a voltage step from –80 mV to +40 mV followed by a slow (1.7 s) voltage ramp back to –80 mV. Although this voltage protocol does not accurately simulate a ventricular action potential, it is useful to demonstrate the gradual increase then decrease in current magnitude during membrane repolarization. The amplitude of current during the declining voltage ramp is determined by (1Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar) the number of channels that recover from inactivation, which increases current magnitude, (2Benson D.W. MacRae C.A.

Haneda N. Nakano O. Shibata A. Sawayama T. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Nakamura Y. Circulation. 1997; 95: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) the rate of channel deactivation, which decreases current magnitude. The voltage dependence of channel availability (Fig. 6 C) is the only important determinant of the number of channels that recover from inactivation because the rate of recovery from inactivation is extremely fast (11Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). Because R56Q HERG caused the greatest shift in channel availability (Fig. 6 C) and rate of deactivation (Fig. 2), we compared the current induced by voltage ramps for this mutant with WT HERG. As shown in Fig.6 D, R56Q HERG current is initially larger than WT HERG current. However, later in the voltage ramp, corresponding to voltages negative to –48 mV, WT HERG current is larger than R56Q HERG current. The ramp current recorded in oocytes that were coinjected with cRNA for WT and R56Q HERG subunits was intermediate in magnitude to oocytes expressing either WT or R56Q HERG alone. These data indicate that although the R56Q HERG current activated during step depolarizations can be larger than WT HERG because of the positive shift in the voltage dependence of channel availability, the rapid deactivation caused by this mutation results in a smaller current when the membrane is slowly repolarized. Mutations in HERG that cause LQT can reduce the amplitude ofI Kr by several different mechanisms. The most common mechanism is a loss of channel function and a dominant negative effect when mutant subunits are coexpressed with WT HERG subunits. Loss of function can result from an alteration of a critical structural component, exemplified by mutations in the pore region of HERG (13Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar,14Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Frameshift or deletion mutations that cause truncation of the encoded protein can cause haplo-insufficiency without a dominant-negative effect (13Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Only a few LQT-associated HERG mutants encode proteins that can form functional channels when expressed alone in a heterologous expression system (8Nakajima T. Furukawa T. Tanaka T. Katayama Y. Nagai R. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,13Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). We have found that eight LQT-associated missense mutations in the amino terminus of HERG channels form functional channels with altered properties when expressed alone in oocytes. These mutations cause an accelerated rate of channel deactivation. This alteration in gating reduces outward current through HERG channels during repolarization from the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential, prolongs the QTc interval, and is the likely cause of the increased risk of torsades de pointes arrhythmia in affected individuals (16Roden D.M. Lazzara R. Rosen M. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J. Vincent G.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1996-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Nakajima et al. (8Nakajima T. Furukawa T. Tanaka T. Katayama Y. Nagai R. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) recently reported on the functional consequences of two LQT-associated missense mutations in HERG (V630L, A614V) that cause loss of function. These mutants suppressed current by a dominant negative effect and by altering properties of inactivation when coexpressed with WT HERG subunits. These mutant residues are located in the outer mouth of the channel pore, a region known to be an important determinant of fast C-type inactivation of HERG channels (17Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Both mutant subunits enhanced inactivation by causing a negative shift in the voltage dependence of channel availability when coexpressed with WT HERG subunits. This effect would increase channel rectification and reduce repolarizing current during an action potential and prolong action potential duration and the QTcinterval. Surprisingly, we found that several missense mutations in the amino-terminal domain of HERG shifted the voltage dependence of channel availability in the positive direction. In the absence of any other effect, this shift would cause an increase in outward current during repolarization and, inferentially, a decrease in QTcinterval. However, these mutations also accelerated the rate of channel deactivation, an affect that dominates the shift in channel availability and would cause a net reduction in outward current during slow repolarization typical of a cardiac action potential. This effect is exemplified by R56Q, the mutation that caused the greatest shift in the voltage dependence of channel availability (+36 mV) and the most pronounced increase (7- to 10-fold at –70 mV) in the rate of deactivation (Fig. 2). The altered channel deactivation properties caused by mutations in the amino-terminal region of HERG indicate the important role of this domain in gating. The crystal structure of this domain was recently solved and shown to be a PAS domain (23Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAS domains are basic helix-loop-helix structures that have been shown to be the site of protein-protein interactions for factors that function in sensing and signal transduction. Examples include PAS-mediated dimerization of the transcription factors trachealless (Trh) with single-minded (Sim) (31Zelzer E. Wappner P. Shilo B.Z. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the transcription factors PER with TIM (32Dunlap J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the dioxin receptor with the basic helix-loop-helix PAS factor Arnt (33Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Sensing proteins with a PAS domain include photoactive yellow protein that senses light in bacteria (35Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although the interactive regions in these PAS domains are understood, it is unclear how the PAS domain of HERG modulates channel gating. Physiologic studies suggest that this domain may interact with the S4-S5 linker of the same channel. Removal of the amino-terminal region of HERG channels accelerates deactivation (21Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 22Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced variants of erg channels that lack a portion of the amino-terminal domain also exhibit fast deactivation (36London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 37Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Missense mutations or chemical modification of the S4-S5 linker of HERG mimic the effects of amino-terminal deletion on channel deactivation (28Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38Wang J. Trudeau M.C. Zappia A.M. Robertson G.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Similar interactions have been noted in the eag channel, which also contains the same PAS domain in the amino terminus (27Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Stuhmer W. Pongs O. Ludwig J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 537-543Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Deletion of amino acids 2–12 from HERG speeds deactivation but has no effect on inactivation gating (38Wang J. Trudeau M.C. Zappia A.M. Robertson G.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Removal of a larger portion of the amino-terminal region (residues 2–354) also shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation to more positive potentials (21Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and slows the rate of C-type inactivation (38Wang J. Trudeau M.C. Zappia A.M. Robertson G.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that mutation of a single residue (i.e. R56Q) can alter the gating of both deactivation and inactivation. Thus, it appears that the amino-terminal region of HERG slows deactivation by binding to the S4-S5 linker. The mechanism by which this interaction affects inactivation is unknown. F29L, N33T, G53R, R56Q, C66G, and L86R are conserved in all known erg, eag, and elk channels, emphasizing their critical role for normal channel function. The functional effect of a mutation in this region has been studied previously. Morais Cabral et al. (23Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the mutation F29A HERG sped the rate of deactivation the most of any missense mutation by a factor of about two. Deletion of residues 2–9 had a similar effect, and further deletion (Δ2–26) was as effective as complete truncation of the amino terminus. In general, all the mutations studied here are likely to disrupt the structural integrity of the PAS domain and alter its required interaction with the rest of the channel to modulate deactivation. In summary, LQT-associated mutations in HERG accelerate the rate of channel deactivation. It is likely that this effect is caused by disruption of the interaction of the amino-terminal domain with the S4-S5 linker of HERG subunits, which normally slows the gating associated with channel deactivation. The increased rate of channel deactivation decreases the contribution of HERG current to cardiac repolarization, resulting in prolongation of ventricular action potentials and predisposes affected individuals to life-threatening arrhythmias.

In order to identify the ligand and type II receptor for ALK-1 and to investigate the role of endoglin in ALK-1 signaling, we devised a chimeric receptor signaling assay by exchanging the kinase domain of ALK-1 with either the TGF-β type I receptor or the activin type IB receptor, both of which can activate an inducible PAI-1 promoter. We show that TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, as well as a third unknown ligand present in serum, can activate chimeric ALK-1. HHT-associated missense mutations in the ALK-1 extracellular domain abrogate signaling. The ALK-1/ligand interaction is mediated by the type II TGF-β receptor for TGF-β and most likely through the activin type II or type IIB receptors for the serum ligand. Endoglin is a bifunctional receptor partner since it can bind to ALK-1 as well as to type I TGF-β receptor.

By sequence homologies, endoglin and ALK-1 are thought to be endothelial cell receptors for members of the TGF-β superfamily. The TGF-β superfamily (TGF-βs, activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and Müllerian-inhibiting substance) constitutes a family of multifunctional cytokines that regulate many aspects of cellular function such as proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix formation (11Massagué J.

Signaling occurs via different ligand-induced heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. Models for TGF-β and activin signaling have been proposed by several authors (15Wrana J.L. Attisano A. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 16Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TGF-β or activin initially binds the constitutively phosphorylated type II receptor, thereby recruiting the type I receptor into the ligand-type II receptor complex. The type I receptor is subsequently phosphorylated by the type II receptor on serine and threonine residues in its cytoplasmic juxtamembrane GS domain (15Wrana J.L. Attisano A. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 18Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The type I receptor then phosphorylates downstream signaling mediators such as members of the recently identified Smad family (reviewed in Refs. 19Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

For the majority of these, ligands and corresponding type II receptors have been identified. ALK-4 is an activin type I receptor, ActR-IB (22Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massague J.

Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). ALK-7 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and can complex with type II receptors for both TGF-β and activin (28Tsuchida K. Sawchenko P.E. Nishikawa S. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell.

However, neither of these complexes elicits a signal, as determined by a number of outcomes including proliferation response, an alteration in fibronectin expression, or the ability to activate a PAI-1promoter-based reporter gene in the mink cell line Mv1Lu. Nonetheless, this does not exclude TGF-β and activin as ALK-1 ligands, as ALK-1 signaling initiated by these cytokines might activate other cellular responses. Unfortunately, the lack of a signaling assay prohibits further analysis of ALK-1 signal transduction and its role in the pathogenesis of HHT. Signaling assays have been devised for other receptors in this superfamily. In Mv1Lu cells, TβR-I and ActR-IB are able to mediate TGF-β or activin-induced activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter construct, which contains the ligand-inducible portion of thePAI-1 promoter (22Attisano L.

By using chimeric receptors, several investigators have shown that signal specificity is determined by the intracellular domain of a chimeric type I receptor, together with the appropriate type II receptor, independent of the ligand binding specificity of the extracellular domain (33Muramatsu M.

We hypothesized that the same would hold true for the domains of ALK-1 if provided with the correct ligand/type II receptor combination. Therefore, we constructed chimeric receptors with the ALK-1 extracellular domain and the cytoplasmic domain of TβR-I or ActR-IB to create an ALK-1 signaling assay. Endoglin is thought to be a TGF-β type III receptor based on its sequence homology to the proteoglycan betaglycan (38Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J.

Betaglycan presents the ligands to TβR-II and TβR-I increasing the signaling activity of the type I receptor (41Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Because of its sequence homology to betaglycan, a similar function is proposed for endoglin. We will present here data that endoglin is the binding partner for ALK-1 suggesting a role for endoglin in modulating signaling via ALK-1. All cell media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained by Life Technologies, Inc. COS-1 cells, a gift by Dr. B. Cullen (Duke University, Durham, NC), were cultured in modified Dulbecco's medium + 5% FBS. R-1B and DR-26 cells were derived in earlier studies by chemical mutagenesis of Mv1Lu cells (42Boyd F.T. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2272-2278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing nonessential amino acids (NEAA) and 10% FBS. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. Rabbit antiserum against endoglin and ALK-1 was prepared against part of the endoglin extracellular domain, encoded by exons 2–5, and the entire ALK-1 extracellular domain except for the leading sequence. Briefly, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-15b (Novagen) behind a 6× His tag and expressed in bacteria. Bacteria were lysed, and recombinant proteins were purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). The column-purified recombinant proteins were then separated over a SDS-PAGE, cut out, and electroeluted. The eluted antigen was mixed with Freund's adjuvant and used to immunize rabbits. The anti-endoglin and anti-ALK-1 rabbit serum were tested in Western blots detecting endoglin and ALK-1 only in those cells (COS cells) that were transfected with an endoglin or ALK-1 expression construct. Western blot immunostaining with the rabbit preimmune serum showed no specificity. Proteins tagged with the HA epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin were detected in immunoblots with a monoclonal antibody. The antibody (12CA5) was obtained from the supernatant of a mouse hybridoma cell line expressing and secreting the monoclonal antibody. Polyclonal anti-TGF-β1 antibody was obtained from Promega (catalog number G1221), Madison, WI. The monoclonal endoglin antibody P3D1 was obtained from Karen Jensen (University of Iowa). TGF-β1 was obtained from R & D Systems, Minneapolis. TGF-β2 and -β3 were purchased from Calbiochem, and TGF-β2 was also from R & D Systems. BMP-2, BMP-7, and Inhibin A were obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. For activin A, COS cells were transiently transfected with a pCMV5-activin A expression construct. Transfection was done using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After transfection, cells were kept for an additional day in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 5% FBS. Medium was then exchanged, and cells were incubated an additional 3 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 0.5% FBS. The supernatant was collected and stored at 4 °C and was used in the activin A luciferase reporter assays. The supernatant (IMD medium) of COS cells incubated for 3 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 0.5% FBS was collected and used as a negative control in the activin A luciferase reporter assays. Human serum was purchased from the Nation Blood Institute Blood Center (Cincinnati, OH) and Gemini Biological Products (Calabasas, CA). All cDNAs of the different receptors and chimeric receptors were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5. All constructs, except for endoglin, have a C-terminal HA epitope tag. Two ALK-1 constructs were used, one with an HA tag and one without, which will be indicated in the text. The ALK-1, TβR-I, ActR-IB, ALK-3 (BMPR-IA), TβR-II, and ActR-II constructs were described previously (22Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massague J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 44Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The endoglin cDNA was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Endoglin was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pCMV5 (pCMV5-Endowt). The endoglin coding sequence has after the first seven amino acids after the transmembrane domain a convenientMluI site, and 3′ prime from this there is a second site in the pCMV5 multiple cloning site. To create the endoglin-truncated version EndoglinΔcyto pCMV5-Endowt was digested with MluI which cuts out the endoglin cytoplasmic domain and then subsequently religated, resulting in pCMV5-EndoΔcyto. To construct the chimeric type I receptors that were swapped in the GS domain, we had to introduce a new unique restriction site,AccIII, in each receptor cDNA sequence, which does not alter the amino acid sequence in the GS domain. The receptor cDNAs ALK-1, TβR-I, ActR-IB, and ALK-3 were first cloned in pUC18 or pUC19, respectively. The new restriction site was introduced with the TransformerTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH), using sequence-specific oligonucleotides (numbers 1–4) for the GS domains of the different receptors, containing the AccIII recognition sequence in the middle of the primer. The new AccIII sites were verified by sequencing. The constructs were then digested with the restriction enzyme AccIII and an appropriate second enzyme that allowed us to cut out the C-domain of the different type I receptors. The resulting DNA fragments were gel-purified (QIAEX Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen) and used for ligations to create the different chimeric receptors. These chimeras are assigned a name with the addition -GS,i.e. ALK-1/TβR-I(GS). The correct reading frame around theAccIII site was verified by DNA sequencing. The chimeric cDNAs were then cloned back into the pCMV5 vector. A second set of chimeric receptors was constructed, containing the extracellular domain of ALK-1 or ALK-3 and the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain of TβR-I, ALK-1/TβR-I(TM) (ALK-1(TM)), and ALK-3/TβR-I(TM) (ALK-3(TM)). The chimeric receptors were constructed using PCR with a 1/5 mixture of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs)/Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Specifically, the TβR-I cDNA in pUC18 was used as template in the PCRs. To create ALK-1(TM) the entire TβR-I transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain encoding sequence was amplified using, as the 5′-primer, an oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide 5) containing the last 11 nucleotides of the ALK-1 extracellular domain, with the ALK-1 uniqueMscI site, followed by the first 23 nucleotides of the TβR-I transmembrane domain. As the 3′-primer the M13 reverse primer was used, amplifying part of the pUC18 multiple cloning site, which allows cutting the PCR products at their 3′-end with BamHI for subsequent cloning. To create ALK-3(TM) the same approach was employed. For the 5′-primer an oligonucleotide (number 6) was used, containing the last 12 nucleotides of the ALK-3 extracellular domain, with the ALK-3 unique BsmI site, followed by the first 21 nucleotides of the TβR-I transmembrane domain. For the 3′-end the M13 reverse primer was used. The resulting PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), digested withMscI/BamHI or BsmI/BamHI, gel-purified, and then ligated to the extracellular domain of ALK-1 or ALK-3. The correct sequence and reading frame were verified by DNA sequencing. All chimeras were transiently transfected in COS cells, and their expression was verified by Western blot analysis using the HA antibody since all constructs have a C-terminal HA tag. Extracellular HHT patient mutations were introduced in the ALK-1/TβR-I(TM) chimeric receptor by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChangeTM mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The following constructs were made with the following oligonucleotide pair combinations: ALK-1(TM)insG140 (number 7/8), ALK-1(TM)W50C (number 9/10), ALK-1(TM)C51Y (number 11/12), ALK-1(TM)R67Q (number 13/14). COS cells were cultured in 6-well plates to 70–80% confluence. The LipofectAMINE method was used for transfections according to the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells were transfected with the following: (a) 2 μg of pCMV5; (b) 1 μg of receptor cDNA and 1 μg of pCMV5; or (c) in co-transfections of two different receptor cDNAs 1 μg of each. After 2 days post-transfection, cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and 20 μl were stored away for later analysis. The remaining cell lysate was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (resolved in lysis buffer (w/v)) for 3 h. The precleared lysate was incubated at 4 °C with 10 μl of polyclonal antibody (endoglin or ALK-1 rabbit anti-serum) or 20 μl of monoclonal antibody (cell culture supernatant). After at least 3 h 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added for additional 3 h. The protein A-Sepharose immunocomplex was then washed three times in 500 μl of lysis buffer and resolved in 15 μl of Laemmli buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (BioBlot-NC, Costar) for immunodetection with the indicated antibody. Immunodetection was performed with the ECLTM Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For luciferase expression assays, the R-1B and DR-26 cells were transiently transfected with p3TP-Lux (32Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), the indicated receptor cDNA in pCMV5, pCMV5 alone, or both. The pSV-β-galactosidase vector (pSV-β) (Promega) was always included to normalize the luciferase activity for the different transfections. Cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and grown to 80% confluence. Prior to transfection, cells were washed once with serum-free medium. Cells were transfected in 3 ml of serum-free medium containing 6 μg of total DNA in the following combinations: (a) 2 μg of p3TP-Lux, 3 μg of pCMV5, and 1 μg of pSV-β; (b) 2 μg of p3TP-Lux with either 2 μg of type I receptors or type I chimeras, 1 μg of pCMV5, and 1 μg of pSV-β. The transfections also included 0.1 mm chloroquine/ml and 0.125 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in phosphate-buffered saline. In assays where two type I receptors were co-transfected, 1.5 μg of each receptor cDNA were used. In assays where the activity for cells co-transfected with two receptors had to be compared with the activity of single receptor transfected cells, the second receptor was substituted with 1.5 μg of pCMV5 DNA in the single receptor transfected cells. After 3 h incubation at 37 °C, cells were shocked with 10% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min and allowed to recover overnight in MEM/NEAA + 10% FBS. The following day, cells were trypsinized and replated into a 24-well plate and incubated for at least 3 h in MEM/NEAA + 10% FBS to allow the cells to reattach. Prior to the luciferase reporter induction, cells were incubated for 2 h in MEM/NEAA + 0.2% FBS. Medium was then exchanged for fresh MEM/NEAA + 0.2% FBS with the addition of the different cytokines to induce the luciferase reporter. After 16 h incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min in 40 μl of lysis buffer. 10 μl were used to measure the luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) in a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer. The remaining 30-μl lysates were used to measure the LacZ activity as described previously (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was corrected for LacZ activity. The following primers were used in the constructions: 1 (ALK-1Acc3), 5′-GGGAGTGGCTCCGGACTCCCCTTCC-3′; 2 (TbR-IAcc3), 5′-GGTTCTGGCTCCGGATTACCATTGC-3′; 3 (ActR-IBAcc3), 5′-GGGTCTGGCTCCGGATTACCCCTCT-3′; 4 (ALK-3Acc3), 5′-GTAGTGGGTCCGGACTACCT-3′; 5 (ALK-1MscI/TbR-I), 5′-CAGATGGCCA(G/C)TGGCAGCTGTCATTGCTGGACC-3′; 6 (ALK-3BsmI/TbR-I), 5′-GGCAGCATTCG(A/C)TGGCAGCTGTCATTGCTGGA; 7, 5′-CTACCTGCCGGGGGGGCCTGGTGCAC-′3; 8, 5′-GTGCACCAGGCCCCCCCGGCAGGTAG-′3; 9, 5′-CGGGGGGCCTGTTGCACAGTAGTGCTG-′3; 10, 5′-CAGCACTACTGTGCAACAGGCCCCCCG-′3; 11, 5′-CGGGGGGCCTGGTACACAGTAGTGC-′3; 12, 5′-GCACTACTGTGTACCAGGCCCCCCG-′3; 13, 5′-CCGCAGCCCTGATGTTCCTG-′3; 14, 5′-CAGGAACATCAGGGCTGCGG-′3. Since the ligand and type II receptor for ALK-1 are not known, a signaling assay for ALK-1 activity is not currently available. We sought to develop a signaling assay involving chimeric receptors. As an initial test, we created chimeric receptors which we surmised would be able to transmit a signal. ALK-3 is the receptor for BMP-2 and to a lesser extent BMP-7, but does not signal in the p3TP-Lux reporter assay. Thus we created a chimeric ALK-3 receptor by exchanging the ALK-3 cytoplasmic domain with the corresponding TβR-I and ActR-IB domains. Three chimeras were constructed; two were exchanged in the GS domain, ALK-3/TβR-I(GS) and ALK-3/ActR-IB(GS), and one within the transmembrane (TM) domain, ALK-3/TβR-I(TM) (Fig. 1). In order to eliminate signaling through endogenous TGF-β receptors, the chimeric receptors were transfected into one of two mink lung cell derivatives, R-1B or DR-26, which are deficient for TβR-I and TβR-II, respectively (32Wrana J.L.

We observed that in transiently transfected R-1B or DR-26 cells, all ALK-3 chimeric receptors were able to induce a significant increase of luciferase activity over basal level after incubation with either BMP-2 or BMP-7.

The upstream mediators that link extracellular signals with the p38 MAPK signaling pathway are currently unknown. Here we demonstrate that pp125 focal adhesion kinase-related tyrosine kinase RAFTK (also known as PYK2, CADTK) is activated specifically by methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and hyperosmolarity but not by ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, or cis-platinum. Overexpression of RAFTK leads to the activation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of RAFTK (RAFTK K-M) inhibits MMS-induced p38 MAPK activation. MKK3 and MKK6 are known potential constituents of p38 MAPK signaling pathway, whereas SEK1 and MEK1 are upstream activators of SAPK/JNK and ERK pathways, respectively. We observe that the dominant-negative mutant of MKK3 but not of MKK6, SEK1, or MEK1 inhibits RAFTK-induced p38 MAPK activity. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that treatment of cells with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester, a membrane-permeable calcium chelator, inhibits MMS-induced activation of RAFTK and p38 MAPK.

Moreover, in contrast to activation of ERKs, interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor are potent activators of p38 MAPK, suggesting upstream signals via Ras does not play a key role in p38 MAPK activation. Previous studies have shown that diverse genotoxic agents activate p38 MAPK and that this response is mediated by c-Abl protein tyrosine kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms (20Pandey P.

Taken together, although certain insights are available, the precise upstream mechanisms responsible for activation of p38 MAPK are presently unclear. The results of the present study demonstrate that in contrast to ionizing radiation (IR), cis-platinum (CDDP), or ultraviolet radiation (UV), RAFTK is activated in response to certain cytotoxic agents such as methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) or hyperosmolarity. Overexpression of RAFTK leads to the activation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, the dominant-negative mutant of MKK3 but not of MKK6 (potential upstream mediators of p38 MAPK signaling pathway) inhibits RAFTK-induced p38 MAPK activity. These findings indicate that RAFTK represents a stress-sensitive mediator of the p38 MAPK pathway. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modifed Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modifed Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells (1 × 106/100-mm culture dish) were plated 24 h before treating with 1 mm MMS (Sigma), 100 μm CDDP (Sigma), 500 mm NaCl, 20 μm BAPTA-AM (Sigma), or 20 Gy IR at room temperature with a Gammacell 1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa) under aerobic conditions with a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.76 Gy min−1 as determined by dosimetry. Cells were also treated with 40 J/m2 UV (UV StratalinkerTM, 1800, Stratagene). U-937 or PC12 cells were treated with 1 mm MMS, 500 mm NaCl, 100 μm CDDP, 20 Gy IR, 20 μm BAPTA-AM, or 40 J/m2 UV and harvested at different time intervals. The cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK antibody as described (23Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D.

U-937 cells were also treated with 1 mm MMS and harvested at different time intervals. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MKK3/MKK6 antibody (New England Biolab). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). 293T cells were transiently transfected with vector or Flag-RAFTK with HA-p38 MAPK or pEBG-SAPK using a standard calcium phosphate method as described by Kharbanda et al.

Cells were co-transfected separately with dominant-negative mutants of Flag-MKK3, Flag-MKK6, MEK1, or SEK1 with HA-p38 MAPK. After 48 h of transfections, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) as described by Kharbanda et al.

Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C and then for 1 h after addition of protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with kinase buffer, and resuspended in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and GST-ATF2 (1–109) (20Pandey P.

After 48 h of transfection separately, total cell lysates were also incubated with GST, and the protein precipitates were analyzed by immune complex kinase assays using GST-Jun (1–102) as substrate (26Saleem A.

The proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The immune complexes were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA, anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RAFTK (12Avraham S.

PC12 cells were transiently transfected with vector or Flag-RAFTK (K-M) with HA-p38 MAPK using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, cells were treated with MMS, and total cell lysates were subjected to incubation with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immune complex kinase assays using GST-ATF2 as substrate as described. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The immune complexes were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA. Previous studies have demonstrated that certain agents, such as phorbol esters and sorbitol, activate RAFTK (15Yu H. Li X.

Activation of RAFTK by tumor necrosis factor or UV, as detected by its phosphorylation on tyrosine, is controversial and may be cell type specific (15Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D.

Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RAFTK has also been linked to cell and inducer type specific activation of JNK/SAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (14Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 15Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine whether RAFTK is involved in activation of p38 MAPK pathway, we transiently overexpressed wild type RAFTK along with HA-tag p38 MAPK in 293T cells and analyzed the anti-HA protein precipitates for GST-ATF2 phosphorylation. In a parallel experiment, we also overexpressed wild type RAFTK with pEBG-SAPK, and GST protein precipitates were analyzed for GST-Jun phosphorylation. The results demonstrate increased GST-ATF2 phosphorylation (increased p38 MAPK activity) in cells transfected with wild type RAFTK compared with that with vector (Fig. 1 A). The activation of p38 MAPK was dependent on expression of the RAFTK protein (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when wild type RAFTK transfected cells were analyzed for JNK activity (Fig. 1 B). The RAFTK-induced increase in p38 MAPK or JNK activities occurred in the absence of changes in p38 or JNK protein levels, respectively (Fig.1, A and B). To confirm expression of RAFTK, we assayed the anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitates for reactivity with anti-RAFTK or anti-P-Tyr antibody. The results demonstrate increased protein levels and tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in overexpressed cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Taken together, these findings indicate that RAFTK acts as an upstream mediator of the p38 MAPK pathway. Because RAFTK is activated in part by phosphorylation on Tyr (13Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musachhio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of different potent p38 MAPK activators on the status of RAFTK phosphorylation in human myelomonocytic leukemia (U-937) cells and in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. In contrast to IR or CDDP, stimulation with MMS or hyperosmolarity lead to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in U-937 and PC12 cells (Fig.2). Exposure of U-937 or PC12 cells to UV caused, little, if any, increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Moreover, all of these stress inducers activate p38 MAPK in both cell types (Fig. 2,B and D and data not shown). Taken together, these findings indicated that not all stress signals stimulate activation of RAFTK. Our findings suggest that RAFTK acts as an upstream mediator of the p38 MAPK pathway. To further confirm a direct role for RAFTK in MMS-induced activation of p38 MAPK, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of RAFTK (RAFTK K-M). The cells were also cotransfected with HA-p38 MAPK. PC12 cells were used in this study because RAFTK is expressed in these cells and the transfection efficiency in PC12 cells is comparatively better than that in U-937 cells. After transfection, cells were treated with MMS and assayed for activation of p38 MAPK. As a control, PC12 cells expressing the empty vector and HA-p38 MAPK were treated with MMS. The results demonstrate that treatment of PC12 cells expressing RAFTK K-M mutant but not the empty vector with MMS is associated with a significant inhibition of p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 3). Anti-HA-immunoprecipitates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA as a control to determine equal protein expression of p38 MAPK (Fig. 3). Taken together, these findings indicate that RAFTK acts as an upstream activator of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway at least in the cellular response to MMS. RAFTK is activated by various extracellular signals that increase intracellular calcium levels such as carbachol, angiotensin II, or sorbitol (13Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musachhio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 16Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To examine the role of calcium on MMS-induced activation of RAFTK and induction of p38 MAPK activity, we treated U-937 cells with MMS in the presence or absence of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester (BAPTA-AM). BAPTA-AM is a membrane-permeable calcium chelator and has been shown to inhibit JNK activation in response to various inducers that raise intracellular calcium, such as angiotensin II, thapsigargin, or ionophore (27Zohn I.E. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that BAPTA-AM acts also as an intracellular calcium channel blocker (28Narahara H. Miyakawa I. Johnston J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3121-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that MMS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was significantly inhibited in cells that were treated in the presence of BAPTA-AM (Fig.4 A). Moreover, in the presence of BAPTA-AM, p38 MAPK activity induced in response to MMS is also significantly inhibited but not completely blocked (Fig. 4 B,top panel). Furthermore, the inhibition of MMS-induced p38 MAPK activity by BAPTA-AM was without any significant effect on p38 MAPK protein levels (Fig. 4 B, bottom panel). Treatment of U-937 cells with MMS in the presence and absence of BAPTA-AM. These results suggest that MMS-induced activation of RAFTK is mediated, at least in part, by the increase in intracellular calcium levels that is induced by this stimuli. Thus inhibition in MMS-induced p38 MAPK activity by BAPTA-AM further confirms the role of RAFTK in mediating p38 MAPK activation in response to MMS. Because MMS-induced activation of p38 MAPK is not completely blocked in the presence of BAPTA-AM, it is likely that MMS activates the p38 MAPK by multiple upstream pathways. Therefore, RAFTK may function as one and not the only upstream mediator in the MMS response. The p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway is activated by diverse classes of stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines, environmental stress, and DNA damage (1Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 20Pandey P. Raingeaud J. Kaneki M. Weichselbaum R. Davis R. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. J. Biol.

Moreover, the role of selective upstream activators of these pathways such as MKK3 and MKK6 for p38 MAPK, MEK1 and MEK2 for ERK, and MKK4 (SEK1) and MKK7 are necessary for JNK activation (29Whitmarsh A.J.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). To determine whether RAFTK-induced activation of p38 MAPK involves MKK3 or MKK6, we used catalytically inactive mutants of MKK3 (MKK3 K-A) and MKK6 (MKK6 K-A) (31Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), which act as dominant-negative inhibitors. 293T cells were transiently transfected with wild-type RAFTK, Flag-MKK3 K-A or Flag-MKK6 K-A with HA-p38 MAPK. After 48 h, anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed for p38 MAPK activity. The results demonstrate that RAFTK-induced activation of p38 MAPK is significantly inhibited by MKK3 K-A but not by MKK6 K-A (Fig.5 A). As a control, 293T cells were also transfected separately with dominant-negative mutants of SEK1 or MEK1 in the presence of wild-type RAFTK and HA-p38 MAPK and anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed for p38 MAPK activity. The results demonstrate that in contrast to MKK3 K-M, dominant-negative mutants of SEK1 or MEK1 are not associated with significant inhibition in p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 5 B). To assess whether treatment of cells with MMS induces phosphorylation of MKK3, U-937 cells were treated with MMS and harvested at different time intervals. Cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody raised against the phosphorylated form of MKK3. The results demonstrate that treatment with MMS is associated with induction in the phosphorylated form of MKK3 (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that RAFTK acts upstream to MKK3 in the stress response to MMS. The present results demonstrate that diverse types of stress inducers induce p38 MAPK activity in U-937 and PC12 cells. The findings also demonstrate that MMS and NaCl induce p38 MAPK activity by RAFTK-dependent mechanisms. Previous work has shown that IR- and CDDP-induced activation of p38 MAPK occurs by c-Abl tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, MMS, UV, tumor necrosis factor, and NaCl induce p38 MAPK by c-Abl-independent mechanisms. The finding correlates that MMS- and NaCl-induced p38 MAPK activity requires activation of RAFTK, further supports distinct signaling events used by various cytotoxic agents. The UV response in mammalian cells is initiated in an extranuclear compartment (35Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The finding that Ha-Ras contributes to the induction of JNK by UV is also consistent with the hypothesis that UV response is initiated in the cytoplasm. MMS is a monofunctional alkylating agent that alkylates DNA and damages membrane proteins (36Schwartz J.L. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37Smith G.J. Grisham G.W. Fatteh M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 488-492PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, MMS may also activate p38 MAPK activity by DNA damage-independent mechanisms. In this context, taken together with our previous findings (20Pandey P. Raingeaud J. Kaneki M. Weichselbaum R. Davis R. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23775-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) in contrast to DNA-damaging agents, MMS and NaCl induces p38 MAPK activity by RAFTK-dependent and c-Abl-independent mechanisms. Therefore, these results demonstrate that activation of the stress response to diverse agents can be distinguished by c-Abl-dependent, RAFTK-dependent, and/or other tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanisms.

A chimeric molecule was designed to introduce an A to C nucleotide conversion at the Ser365 position of the rat factor IX gene. The oligonucleotides were encapsulated in positive, neutral, and negatively charged liposomes containing galactocerebroside or complexed with lactosylated polyethyleneimine. The formulations were evaluated for stability and efficiency in targeting hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Physical characterization and electron microscopy revealed that the oligonucleotides were efficiently encapsulated within the liposomes, with the positive and negative formulations remaining stable for at least 1 month. Transfection efficiencies in isolated rat hepatocytes approached 100% with each of the formulations. However, the negative liposomes and 25-kDa lactosylated polyethyleneimine provided the most intense nuclear fluorescence with the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. The lactosylated polyethyleneimine and the three different liposomal formulations resulted in A to C conversion efficiencies of 19–24%. In addition, lactosylated polyethyleneimine was also highly effective in transfecting plasmid DNA into isolated hepatocytes.

The technology involves the use of a chimeric oligonucleotide (ON)1 composed of a contiguous stretch of RNA and DNA residues in a duplex conformation with poly(T) hairpin caps at both ends and a 3′ G:C clamp. In a typical heteroduplex molecule, two blocks of 10 2′-O-methyl RNA residues flank a pentameric stretch of DNA. The structure exhibits increased chemical and thermal stability as well as greater resistance to a variety of nucleases. The chimeric molecule is designed so that it aligns in perfect register with a specified genome target, with the exception of a single base pair in the region of the pentameric stretch of DNA. The single mismatched nucleotide is recognized by endogenous DNA repair systems, thus affecting alteration of the DNA sequence of the targeted gene (1Kmiec E.B. Adv.

While the efficiency of nucleotide conversion may depend on a number of factors, delivery of DNA to the cell and its nucleus remains key. In designing an optimal delivery system, important parameters include cell toxicity and targeting specificity as well as stability of the formulation. The delivery of intact nucleic acids from the extracellular environment to the nucleus has remained a major barrier to long term and stable gene expression both ex vivo and in vivo. After cellular uptake of nucleic acids by endocytosis, only a small fraction of the molecules reach the nucleus intact (6Loke S.L. Stein C.A. Zhang X.H. Mori K. Nakanishi M. Subasinghe C. Cohen J.S.

Interestingly, a variety of studies, including direct cytoplasmic injection of nucleic acids, suggest that these molecules display significant nuclear tropism (7Chin D.J. Green G.A. Zon G.

However, the movement of DNA from the cytoplasm to the nucleus continues to be an important limitation to successful gene transfer (10Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J.

Huang L. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 710-722PubMed Google Scholar). Polycations, such as poly-l-lysine, polyethyleneimine (PEI), and polyamino lipids, form water-soluble complexes that can provide simple but very efficient delivery systems. The presence of free amino groups on these agents makes them amenable to chemical modification for the attachment of ligands capable of targeting specific tissues. For example, asia- loorosomucoid (16Findeis M.A. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 247: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Martinez-Fong D. Mullersman J.E. Purchio A.F.

The asialoorosomucoid-poly-l-lysine system has been demonstrated to increase hepatocyte-directed gene delivery bothin vitro (19Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and in vivo (20Chowdhury N.R. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Yerneni P.C. Bommineni V.R. Chowdhury J.R. J. Biol.

A similar strategy has been utilized for hepatocyte-specific gene delivery using lipopolyamine-condensed DNA targeted with galactose ligands (21Remy J.-S. Kichler A. Mordvinov V. Schuber F.

Transfection of different cell types with the chimeric ONs has been accomplished with dioleoyl trimethylammoniumpropane (4Cole-Strauss A. Yoon K. Xiang Y. Byrne B.C Rice M.C. Gryn J. Holloman W.K.

Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, these systems lack the physicochemical stability and proper formulation for efficientin vivo delivery. The existing system of gene delivery by cationic lipids consists primarily of heterogeneous complexes and aggregates rather than liposome-encapsulated material (23Smith J.G. Walzem R.L. German J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A combinatorial approach of condensing the DNA using polycationic molecules followed by liposome association or encapsulation has been demonstrated to greatly increase the efficacy of the delivery systems (24Zhou X. Huang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 25Gao X. Huang L.

In the present study, we describe the preparation and characterization of three liposomal systems, targeted to the ASGPR on rat hepatocytes with galactocerebroside, for delivery of the chimeric molecules. In addition, we have characterized a nonliposomal targeting system using lactosylated PEI. In fact, unmodified PEI has been shown to be a useful gene delivery vehicle bothin vitro and in vivo (27Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.-P. Proc. Natl.

Human Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that RNA/DNA ONs can be efficiently delivered to hepatocytes for gene conversion by both liposomal and nonliposomal systems without the use of viral vectors. Chimeric RNA/DNA factor IX ONs were synthesized by Applied Biosystems, Inc. (Foster City, CA) as described previously (2Yoon K. Cole-Strauss A. Kmiec E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The crude ONs were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and quantitated by UV absorbance. Greater than 95% of the purified ONs were determined to be full-length. A 68-mer all-DNA chimeric ON was obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). The molecules were 3′-end-labeled using terminal transferase and fluorescein-12-dUTP from Boehringer Mannheim according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Labeled ONs were then mixed with unlabeled ONs at a 2:3 ratio. Dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine, dioleoyl phosphatidylserine, galactocerebroside, and dioleoyl trimethylammoniumpropane were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL) as dried powders. Stock solutions (2 mg/ml) of the lipids and lipid films were prepared as described previously (30Bandyopadhyay P. Kren B.T. Ma X. Steer C.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Positively charged liposomes consisted of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine/dioleoyl trimethylammoniumpropane/galactocerebroside at a 6:1:0.56 molar ratio; neutral liposomes included dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine/dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine/galactocerebroside at a 1:1:0.16 ratio, and negatively charged liposomes were formulated with dioleoyl phosphatidylserine/dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine/galactocerebroside at a molar ratio of 1:1:0.16. PEI (800 kDa) was purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. (Ronkonkoma, NY). A stock solution of 0.05 mPEI monomer corresponding to ∼50 nmol of PEI amine/μl (27Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar) was prepared in Milli Q® (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) water, and its pH was adjusted to 7.6 with 6 m HCl. PEI (4 nmol of amine/nmol of RNA/DNA phosphate) and either unlabeled or fluorescently labeled chimeric molecules (100–250 μg) were each diluted into 250 μl of 0.15 m NaCl. The solutions were vortexed separately for 5–10 min at room temperature followed by the dropwise addition of the PEI solution to the ON, with continual vortexing for an additional 5–10 min. The PEI complex was then added to the positively charged lipid film. For the neutral and negatively charged liposomes, naked or fluorescently labeled chimeric ONs (150 μg) were diluted into 500 μl of 0.15 m NaCl and added to the lipid film. The films were hydrated by alternate vortex mixing and warming until a homogeneous suspension was formed. The resulting suspension was extruded through a series of polycarbonate membranes down to a pore size of 0.05 μm using a Liposofast® miniextruder system (Avestin, Inc., Ottawa, Canada). The size of the extruded liposomes was determined by light scattering using a NICOMP 370 submicron particle size analyzer (Pacific Scientific Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). In short, the Brownian motion of suspended particles modulates the phase of scattered light waves from a laser beam. Thus, the intensity of the detected light fluctuates in a random fashion and is detected with a photomultiplier tube. For a given particle, the average lifetime for the intensity fluctuations is roughly equal to the average time required for two particles to change their separation by one-half of the fixed laser wavelength λ. The spherical radius of the particle is then obtained from the diffusion coefficient of the particle over time using the Stokes-Einstein relation. The phospholipid concentrations in the liposomal preparations were determined by the method of Stewart (31Stewart J.C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 20–50 μl were diluted to 500 μl using Milli Q® water, and the phospholipids were extracted twice using 500 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1 v/v). The liposomal extracts were also analyzed for PEI complexes and naked ONs following ultrafiltration to remove the nonencapsulated material. Briefly, 40–50 μl of liposome suspension after lipid extraction was diluted with 300 μl of heparin (1 unit/μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, the aqueous phase was precipitated at −20 °C overnight following the addition of 80 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 500 μl isopropyl alcohol, 10 μg of tRNA, and 300 μl of RNAmate® (Intermountain Scientific, Inc., Kaysville, UT). An aliquot of the stock PEI·ON complex was subjected to the same extraction procedure. The ONs were analyzed by 4% low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized using UV light. The relative intensities of the bands were analyzed by densitometry using a Bio-Rad model GS-700 imaging densitometer. PEI was lactosylated by a modification of a previously described method for oligosaccharide conjugation (32Gray G.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 163: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3–5 ml of a 0.1–0.2 m stock of either 800- or 25-kDa PEI (Aldrich) in 0.2 m ammonium acetate or Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer solution was incubated with 7–8 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma) and approximately 20–30 mg of lactose monohydrate (Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 days. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against Milli Q® water for 48 h with 1–2 changes of water/day. The amount of sugar (as galactose) conjugated with PEI was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (33Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar). The number of moles of free secondary amines in the lactosylated PEI (L-PEI) was determined as follows. A standard curve was generated using a 0.02 m stock solution of PEI; several aliquots of the stock were diluted to 1 ml using Milli Q® water in glass tubes, and then 50 μl of ninhydrin reagent (Sigma) was added to each tube and vortexed vigorously for 10 s. Color development was allowed to proceed in the dark at room temperature for 10–12 min, and the OD was determined at 485 nm on a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer. An equivalent of 5 nmol of amine as L-PEI and 5 nmol as PEI per nmol of RNA/DNA phosphate were mixed, diluted in 0.15 m NaCl as required, and used for transfection as described previously (5Kren B.T. Bandyopadhyay P. Steer C.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For the in vitrofluorescently labeled ON uptake experiments, the 25-kDa PEI plus L-PEI mix (1:1 molar ratio of amines) was complexed with the labeled chimeric molecules at a ratio of 10 or 6 nmol of PEI amines per nmol of DNA/RNA phosphate in 5% dextrose. For the in vivo studies, the 25-kDa PEI plus L-PEI mix (1:1 molar ratio of amines) was complexed with the RNA/DNA ONs at the 6:1 amine:phosphate ratio in 5% dextrose. Nuclease resistance of the complexed RNA/DNA molecules was determined by treating the samples with 40 units of RNase A and 40 units of RQ1 RNase free DNase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated using 2 μl each of 0.5 m EGTA and 0.5 m EDTA. Following two phenol/chloroform extractions, the complexes were dissociated using heparin (50 units/μg of nucleic acid) at 37 °C for 60 min, and the products were analyzed on a 4% low melting point agarose gel. The size of the chimeric molecules alone or complexed to PEI was determined by gas phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) (TSI Inc., Minneapolis, MN) (34Kaufman S.L. Skogen J.W. Dorman F.D. Zarrin F. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1895-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or by light scattering measurements. For GEMMA, chimeric ONs (4 mg/ml) were diluted at a 1:3,000 ratio with 0.02m ammonium acetate buffer. The diluted suspension was then transformed into an aerosol by electrospray drying. The resulting high charge on the molecules was neutralized by a radioactive α-emitter, and the singly charged chimeric molecules were size-separated according to their mobility in air. Liposome suspensions were applied as a drop on glow-discharged formvar carbon-coated grids (300 or 400 mesh, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) and negatively stained using 2% ammonium molybdate. PEI complexes were stained with either a 1% uranyl acetate or a 2% ammonium molybdate solution, and the samples were visualized using a JEOL100-CX electron microscope. For scanning electron microscopy, samples were mounted in drops onto borosilicate chips and fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide vapors for 2 h at 25 °C, followed by stepwise dehydration in ethanol (35Hamilton-Attwell V.L. Du Plessis J. van Wyk C.J. J. Microscopy. 1987; 145: 347-349PubMed Google Scholar). The mounted samples were stored in 100% ethanol until critical point drying in liquid carbon dioxide. Immediately following drying, samples were sputter-coated with platinum metal for 6 min at 4.2 V. Samples were viewed the following day on a Hitachi S-900 field emission scanning electron microscope at 1.5 kV at magnifications of × 1,200–200,000. For freeze-fracture analysis, anionic liposomes were made using fluorescein-, Cy3-labeled, or naked ONs, frozen in freon, and then stored in liquid nitrogen until fracture. Fracture was performed on a BAF 060 apparatus. The fractured surfaces were coated with 6 nm of platinum at a 45° angle to the surface, followed by 20 nm of carbon at a 90° angle to the surface. Replicas were cleaned overnight by flotation in 1 m sodium hypochlorite and then rinsed for 1 h in water. After transfer to 200 mesh carbon grids, the specimens were viewed at 80 kV on a JE0L100-CX electron microscope. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (125–175 g) (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) using a two-step collagenase perfusion procedure described previously (36Mariash C.N. Seelig S. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hepatocytes were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/35 × 10-mm PrimariaTMdish (Becton-Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) and maintained for 18–24 h prior to transfection in William's E medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with l-glutamine, 0.01 units/ml insulin, 2 mm Hepes, 23 mmNaHCO3, 0.01 μm dexamethasone, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Positive, neutral, and negative liposomes were diluted with Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 2–6 μg of ON/100 μl and used for transfection as described previously (30Bandyopadhyay P. Kren B.T. Ma X. Steer C.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nonencapsulated PEI·ON complexes at identical amine:phosphate ratios were used as positive controls and diluted as described above. The cells were washed twice with William's E medium further supplemented with an additional 2.5 mmCaCl2 and then incubated with 1 ml of the same medium. An aliquot of 100 μl of transfecting solution was then added to each 35-mm dish. After 18 h of transfection, an additional 2 ml of medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS was added, and the cells were maintained for an additional 6–30 h. The reporter plasmid PGL3 (Promega Corp.) encoding the luciferase gene was prepared in 0.15m NaCl or 5% dextrose using various ratios ofL-PEI to 25-kDa PEI amines as well as nucleic acid phosphate to PEI amines. Hepatocytes were harvested 48 h after transfection using 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was determined by the luciferase assay reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein was quantitated with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent as specified by the manufacturer. Hepatocytes transfected with the fluorescently labeled ONs were fixed 24 h post-transfection in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) for 10 min at room temperature. Following fixation, the cells were counterstained using DiI (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and coverslipped using SlowFade™ (Molecular Probes) antifade mounting medium in phosphate-buffered saline and examined using a MRC1000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) (22Kren B.T. Cole-Strauss A. Kmiec E.B. Steer C.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) (∼65 g) were maintained on a standard 12-h light-dark cycle and fed ad libitum standard laboratory chow. The rats were restrained by hand, and the chimeric molecules, complexed with 25-kDa PEI/L-PEI (1:1 molar ratio of amines) at a ratio of 6 equivalents of PEI nitrogen per RNA/DNA phosphate in 500 μl of 5% dextrose (28Abdallah B. Hassan A. Benoist C. Goula D. Behr J.P. Demeneix B.A. Human Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) were administered in vivo by tail vein injection. Vehicle controls received an equal volume of PEI in Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The animals were anesthesized with ether 1 and 18 weeks postinjection and underwent a midline incision. The liver was exposed, and random samples were excised for DNA isolation. After 3 weeks, two of the animals received an additional injection of 500 μg of the L-PEI/chimeric complexes followed 24 h later by 70% partial hepatectomy (37Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar) to determine the replicative stability of the genomic nucleotide conversion. Genomic DNA larger than 100–150 base pairs was isolated from the tissue samples using the high pure PCR template preparation kit (Boehringer Mannheim) for PCR amplification of exon 8 of the rat factor IX gene. Blood samples were obtained from the test groups at varying times up to 52 weeks after the final tail vein injection and mixed in 0.1 volume of 0.105 m sodium citrate/citric acid. The blood samples were centrifuged at 2,500 × g, followed by 15,000 × gcentrifugation, and the resulting plasma was stored at −70 °C. The factor IX activity was determined from activated partial thromboplastin time assays as described previously (5Kren B.T. Bandyopadhyay P. Steer C.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The factor IX activity of duplicate samples was determined from a log-log standard curve constructed from the activated partial thromboplastin time results of pooled plasma from 12 similarly aged normal male rats through multiple dilutions. The chimeric ON- and vehicle-transfected cells were harvested by scraping 48 h after transfection. Genomic DNA larger than 100–150 base pairs was isolated using the high pure PCR template preparation kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The isolated DNA (500 ng) from either primary hepatocytes or liver was used for PCR amplification of a 374-nucleotide fragment of the rat factor IX gene as described previously (5Kren B.T. Bandyopadhyay P. Steer C.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The primers were designed as 5′-ATTGCCTTGCTGGAACTGGATAAAC-3′ and 5′-TTGCCTTTCATTGCACATTCTTCAC-3′ (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR) corresponding to nucleotides 433–457 and 782–806, respectively, of the rat factor IX cDNA (38Sarkar G. Koeberl D.D. Sommer S.S. Genomics. 1990; 6: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The PCR amplicons were subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR™2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the ligated material was used to transform frozen competent E. coli. 18–20 h after plating, the colonies were lifted onto MSI MagnaGraph nylon filters, replicated, and processed for hybridization according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The filters were hybridized with 17-mer ON probes 365A (5′-AAGGAGATAGTGGGGGA-3′) or 365C (5′-AAGGAGATCGTGGGGGA-3′) (Life Technologies), where the targeted nucleotide for mutagenesis is underlined. The probes were 32P-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (>7,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). Hybridizations were performed at 37 °C, and the filters were processed posthybridization as described previously (5Kren B.T. Bandyopadhyay P. Steer C.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 39Melchoir Jr., W.B. Von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed with NEN® Reflection film at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. Plasmid DNA was prepared from colonies hybridizing to either 365A or 365Cusing a Qiagen miniprep kit (Chatsworth, CA). Sequencing was performed with an ABI 370A sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Corp., Foster City, CA) using a gene-specific primer, 5′-GTTGACCGAGCCACATGCCTTAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 616–638 of the rat factor IX cDNA (38Sarkar G. Koeberl D.D. Sommer S.S. Genomics. 1990; 6: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the mp13 forward and reverse primers. Data were analyzed using InStat version 2.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to calculate analysis of variance, and probability (p) values were determined using Bonferroni multiple comparisons. Two column comparisons were analyzed using Welch's alternate t test. By GEMMA the chimeric ONs ranged in size from 4 to 7 nm, with major peaks at 4.6 and 5.8 nm (Fig.1 a). After heating to 95 °C and then cooling to room temperature, the chimeric molecules exhibited a unimodal distribution with an average diameter of 4.4 nm (Fig.1 b). ONs complexed with PEI in 0.15 m NaCl ranged in size from 20 to 200 nm. Electron microscopy revealed that the complexes were often aggregated into large c"
https://openalex.org/W2021109997,"Cytosine deamination to uracil occurs frequently in cellular DNA. In vitro, RNA polymerase efficiently inserts adenine opposite to uracil, resulting in G to A base substitutions. In vivo, uracil could potentially alter transcriptional fidelity, resulting in production of mutant proteins. This study demonstrates that in nondividing Escherichia coli cells, a DNA template base replaced with uracil in a stop codon in the firefly luciferase gene results in conversion of inactive to active luciferase. The level of transcriptional base substitution is dependent on the capacity to repair uracil. These results provide evidence for a DNA damage-dependent, transcription-driven pathway for generating mutant proteins in nondividing cells."

The striking structural feature of the viral FLIPs is the presence of a tandem repeat of a so-called death effector domain (DED). The DED has structural homology to a motif called the death domain, which is present in the cytoplasmic part of death receptors such as Fas. The death domain of Fas interacts with the C-terminal death domain of FADD, which in turn induces the binding of the N-terminal DED of FADD to the DED-containing prodomain of caspase-8. The recruitment and activation of caspase-8 by Fas result in the processing of downstream caspases and the induction of apoptosis (6Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). The DED-containing v-FLIPs interfere with the FADD-caspase-8 interaction and hence block apoptosis (3Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F. Mattmann C. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Thus, the DED and the death domain are important protein-protein interaction modules implicated in cell death signaling. Recently, the existence of a third related protein-protein interaction domain, designated the caspase-recruiting domain (CARD), was revealed (7Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The prototype CARD is found in Apaf-1, a mitochondrial protein related to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein CED-4 (8Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2745) Google Scholar). Activation of Apaf-1 by cytochrome c leads to the recruitment of the CARD-containing caspase-9 and to subsequent apoptosis (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar). Additional CARD-dependent protein interactions have been identified. The CARD-containing adaptor molecule RAIDD recruits caspase-2 to the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (10Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), whereas the CARD-containing kinase CARDIAK/RIP-2 may mediate both the recruitment and activation of caspase-1 by CD40 and the activation of JNK and NF-κB (11Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The respective recruiting/regulatory proteins of other CARD-containing caspases (caspase-4, -5, -11, and -12), are currently not known. Other CARD-containing proteins, i.e.ARC (13Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 (14Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. We have previously reported on a gene product from equine herpesvirus type 2 (EHV-2), designated E10, that comprises a CARD motif (7Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because the E8 gene, which is found in the same region of the EHV-2 genome, encodes the potent apoptosis inhibitor v-FLIP, we undertook a study to investigate whether E10 may also be implicated in the modulation of apoptosis. The complete ORF of viral E10 was amplified from viral EHV-2 DNA (a kind gift of A. J. Davison, Glasgow, United Kingdom). The amplified E10 ORF is longer than the originally publishedE10 ORF (after resequencing of the respective region of the viral genome, we had to correct the originally reported E10sequence (15Telford E.A.R. Watson M.S. Aird H.C. Perry J. Davison A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) that predicted a shorter ORF). EST clones encoding a related human and mouse CARD-containing protein were identified in the dbEST data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (EST clones 703916 and 574273) by performing a data base search using a generalized profile method (16Bucher P. Karplus K. Moeri N. Hofmann K. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) based on the sequence homology among other CARD-containing proteins (7Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed by probing a murine multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe encompassing the complete ORF of murine CARMEN cDNA. cDNAs encoding CARMEN proteins or fragments thereof were amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction methods using Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and specific primers containing suitable restriction sites on the 5′- and 3′-end on cDNA templates from the following sources. Full-length humanCARMEN (amino acids 2–233), a deletion construct encompassing the N-terminal CARD (amino acids 2–89, h-CARMEN-NT) or lacking the CARD (amino acids 85–233, h-CARMEN-CT), was amplified on EST clone 703916; full-length murine CARMEN (amino acids 2–233) was amplified on EST clone 574273; and full-length v-CARMEN was amplified on EHV-2 DNA. An internalBamHI site at nucleotide 412 of v-CARMEN was used for the construction of a C-terminally truncated v-CARMENencompassing the N-terminal CARD (amino acids 1–139, v-CARMEN-NT). A deletion construct lacking the CARD (amino acids 109–311, v-CARMEN-CT) was amplified on cloned full-length v-CARMEN. Amplified products were cloned into pCRblunt (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Subcloning into expression vectors derived from pCR-3 (Invitrogen) yielded expression constructs with an N-terminal FLAG, hemagglutinin (HA), or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) tag. For the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, sequenced constructs of v-CARMEN, h-CARMEN, and their above described N-terminally truncated versions were subcloned into pGBT-9 or pGAD10 (CLONTECH), yielding GAL4-DNA-binding proteins or GAL4-activation-domain fusion proteins, respectively. The following expression plasmids were obtained from the indicated sources: NF-κBLuc (V. Jongeneel, Lausanne, Switzerland); FLAG-tagged JNK (C. Widmann, Denver, CO); HA-tagged p38 (J. S. Gutkind, NIDR, Bethesda, MD); ERK-1 (J. Pouysségur, Nice, France); dominant negative (DN) GFP-TRAF2 (amino acids 266–501) (H. Wajant, Stuttgart, Germany); DN TRAF6, wild type, and DN IKK2 (S. Whiteside and A. Israël, Paris, France); v-19 ras (E. Reichmann, Lausanne, Switzerland). These techniques were performed essentially as described before (11Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F.

Activation of p38 and ERK-1 was detected using phosphospecific antibodies that detect the active form of the respective mitogen-activated protein kinases (New England Biolabs). Protein-protein interactions were analyzed by cotransforming a plasmid encoding a v-CARMEN-GAL4-DNA-binding (GAL4-DB) fusion protein with plasmids encoding various v/h-CARMEN-GAL4-activation-domain fusion protein constructs (2.5 μg of each plasmid) into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 and subsequent filter lift assays for colony color development according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH, yeast protocols handbook). Controls were performed by using the respective vectors without insert. To study the possible physiological role of the viral E10 gene product, designated v-CARMEN (for CARD-containingmolecule enhancing NF-κB, see below), we assessed effector functions that have been described for other CARD-containing proteins such as modulation of apoptosis and activation of JNK and NF-κB. Expression constructs encoding v-CARMEN and a number of proapoptotic proteins were transfected into 293T cells, and the presence of apoptotic cells was subsequently analyzed. Although overexpression of v-CARMEN was very weakly cytotoxic, expression of Fas, DR-3/TRAMP, TRAIL-R1, or TRAIL-R2 lead to extensive cell death, which was neither inhibited nor enhanced by the coexpression of v-CARMEN (data not shown). Stable transfection of Jurkat cells with v-CARMEN or a construct lacking the CARD motif did not alter the cells' susceptibility to Fas or staurosporine-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Next we tested whether v-CARMEN was able to stimulate activation of JNK by coexpressing v-CARMEN with JNK in 293T cells. Activation of JNK leads to its phosphorylation by upstream kinases, which can be detected by antibodies specifically recognizing the phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated form of JNK. Compared with the vector control, v-CARMEN potently induced JNK activation (Fig.1 A). Activation of the kinase appeared to be dependent on the CARD motif, because overexpression of the C-terminal part of v-CARMEN (lacking the CARD) did not result in increased JNK activation, whereas a C-terminally truncated construct encompassing the CARD (v-CARMEN-NT) was able to induce some JNK activation. v-CARMEN-induced JNK activation was not inhibited by dominant negative versions of TRAF2 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1) (data not shown), indicating that v-CARMEN acts downstream or independently of these mediators of tumor necrosis factor-induced JNK activation (19Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). v-CARMEN also activated the stress kinase p38 in a CARD-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, no activation of the MAP kinase ERK-1 was seen by the overexpression of the viral protein (Fig. 1 C). The ability of v-CARMEN to activate an NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid was next investigated. Expression of v-CARMEN in 293T cells resulted in a dose-dependent activation of the reporter gene, reaching an approximately 10-fold increase in luciferase activity as compared with the vector control (Fig. 1, D andE). Induction of NF-κB activity by v-CARMEN was almost as strong as that seen with the adaptor protein MyD88 (Fig.1 D), which links interleukin-1R and toll receptors to NF-κB signaling pathways (17Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 20Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z.

Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Similar to the requirement for JNK activation, the initiation of NF-κB signals by v-CARMEN was dependent on the presence of the CARD motif. Activation of NF-κB is dependent on the formation of a multiprotein complex, which is comprised of TRAFs, the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), IKK1, IKK2, the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), IκBα, IκBβ, and the IKK-complex-associated protein (ICAP) (23Scheidereit C. Nature. 1998; 395: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Dominant negative versions of some of these proteins can block NF-κB-activating signals triggered by upstream receptors. Indeed, DN IKK2, but not DN TRAF2 or DN TRAF6, inhibited v-CARMEN-mediated NF-κB activation, indicating that the overexpression of the viral protein initiated a signal cascade downstream of TRAFs but upstream of IKK2 in the NF-κB signaling complex (Fig. 1 F and data not shown). CARDs are known to serve as protein-protein interaction motifs (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar, 10Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). It was therefore likely that v-CARMEN exerted its JNK and NF-κB activating effects through association with another CARD-containing protein. In this regard, by screening public data bases with a CARD sequence profile (7Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 16Bucher P. Karplus K. Moeri N. Hofmann K. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) we discovered the presence of a novel CARD protein with high homology to the CARD motif of v-CARMEN, which we call c-CARMEN (Fig. 2 A). v-CARMEN corresponds to a 311-amino acid protein with an N-terminal CARD motif followed by a C-terminal, glycine-rich extension of approximately 200 amino acid residues. After the resequencing of this region of the viral genome, we had to correct the original E10 sequence deposited in the data base, which predicted a shorter ORF corresponding to only 210 amino acids (15Telford E.A.R. Watson M.S. Aird H.C. Perry J. Davison A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The predicted protein size of the corrected 311-amino acid v-CARMEN (34 kDa) agrees well with the 36-kDa protein detectable after expression in 293T cells (see Fig. 1). c-CARMEN (the cellular homologue of v-CARMEN) consists of an N-terminal CARD followed by a C-terminal extension of approximately 130 amino acids with a predicted molecular size of 26 kDa. The CARD of v-CARMEN shows 47 and 46% sequence identity with mouse and human c-CARMEN, respectively, but only approximately 20–25% sequence identity with other CARD-containing proteins (Fig. 2 B). Little sequence identity is found in the C-terminal extensions of the viral and the cellular CARMEN, the latter of which lacks the glycine-rich regions. Neither of the C-terminal extensions has significant homology to protein sequences currently found in public data bases. Northern blot analysis revealed that murine CARMEN(m-CARMEN) was expressed in all mouse tissues as a single transcript of approximately 2.4 kilobases (Fig.3), suggesting that the protein is of functional relevance in many cell types. The potential interaction of c-CARMEN with other CARD-containing proteins was examined by coexpression of the different FLAG-tagged CARD proteins with HA-tagged human CARMEN (h-CARMEN) in 293T cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Using this technique, an interaction was noted only between v-CARMEN and h-CARMEN, whereas caspase-1, -2, -4, and -9, RAIDD, or CARDIAK did not interact with h-CARMEN (Fig.4 A). We also did not detect an interaction with the CARD motif of Apaf-1, cIAP-1, or cIAP-2 (data not shown). A truncated version of v-CARMEN lacking the CARD motif (v-CARMEN-CT) did not interact with either human or mouse c-CARMEN, indicating that binding was mediated through the CARD motif (Fig.4 B). An analysis of this interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system confirmed a direct and CARD-dependent interaction of v-CARMEN with h-CARMEN (Table I). Interestingly, c-CARMEN of human and mouse origin also formed CARD-dependent homodimers in 293T cells (Fig.4 B). We were unable to detect homodimers of v-CARMEN in 293T cells, although a homodimeric interaction of v-CARMEN was detected in the yeast two-hybrid system (Table I). Interestingly, the interaction between v-CARMEN and its cellular homologue lead to an altered electrophoretic mobility of the c-CARMENs (Fig. 4 B). Human and murine CARMEN migrated slightly slower by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of v-CARMEN, suggesting that the cellular homologue may undergo a post-translational modification such as phosphorylation upon interaction with the viral homologue. Whether this is because of the JNK/IKK kinase-inducing activity of v-CARMEN (potentially recruiting kinases to the complex of viral/cellular CARMEN) remains to be seen.Table ICARD-dependent interaction of v- and h-CARMEN in the yeast two-hybrid systemDBADh-CARMENh-CARMEN-CTv-CARMENv-CARMEN-CTControlv-CARMEN++−++−−Control−−−−−Viral and human CARMEN or C-terminal (CT) constructs thereof lacking the CARD were expressed in yeast as GAL4 DNA binding (DB) or GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion proteins and were tested for interaction by a filter lift β-galactosidase color assay.

Open table in a new tab Viral and human CARMEN or C-terminal (CT) constructs thereof lacking the CARD were expressed in yeast as GAL4 DNA binding (DB) or GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion proteins and were tested for interaction by a filter lift β-galactosidase color assay. (++) indicates blue color development within 30 min, (−) indicates no color development even after 6 h. Controls were performed using the respective expression vectors without insert. Because v-CARMEN was a potent activator of the JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways, we anticipated a similar function for the cellular homologue. However, overexpression of either full-length c-CARMEN or of domains thereof was not capable of activating these signaling pathways in 293T cells (Fig. 5, A andB, and data not shown). c-CARMEN and its N- or C-terminal deletion constructs also did not inhibit NF-κB or JNK signals induced by v-CARMEN or by triggering the receptors for tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1 (data not shown), indicating that the cellular homologue is not essential to these pathways. We considered that the difference in signaling by v-CARMENversus c-CARMEN might be because of their ability to interact with specific TRAF molecules, because members of the TRAF family of adaptor proteins have been shown to be implicated in the activation of transcription through JNK- and NF-κB-dependent pathways (reviewed in Ref. 24Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of c-CARMEN and v-CARMEN to bind to specific members of the TRAF family by coexpression of the respective proteins in 293T cells. The result of the co-precipitation study shown in Fig. 5 revealed a clear difference in the TRAF binding specificity of c-CARMEN and v-CARMEN; human CARMEN bound specifically to TRAF1 and TRAF5, whereas the v-CARMEN had a clear binding preference for TRAF6 and, to a smaller degree, for TRAF3 (Fig. 5, C andD). EHV-2 is a slow growing, cytopathogenic γ-herpesvirus, which appears to be ubiquitous in the equine population (15Telford E.A.R. Watson M.S. Aird H.C. Perry J. Davison A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, its precise role as a pathogen remains uncertain. In infected horses, the virus can induce chronic pharyngitis associated with lymphoid proliferation (25Blakeslee Jr., J.R. Olsen R.G. McAllister E.S. Fassbender J. Dennis R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1975; 21: 1940-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The virus is persistent in peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting that it copes well with apoptotic processes occurring in the host. We have previously identified its DED-containing E8 gene product (v-FLIP) as a potent inhibitor of the death receptor-signaling pathways (3Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F. Mattmann C. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Moreover, EHV-2 also has a predicted bcl-2 gene homologue in its genome (2Tschopp J. Thome M. Hofmann K. Meinl E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although its biological activity has not yet been verified, it is predicted that the gene product of this viralbcl-2 homologue inhibits apoptotic signals originating from the Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway. In this report we have characterized the EHV-2 protein E10, designated v-CARMEN, as a potent inducer of the NF-κB and JNK pathways. Cellular gene products induced by the NF-κB transcription factor are known to inhibit apoptosis by a variety of means (26Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar, 27Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the E8-FLIP and the bcl-2 homologue, the E10/CARMEN gene product of EHV-2 may provide the virus with a third anti-apoptotic mechanism. In addition, NF-κB induction by v-CARMEN may serve to control the expression of viral genes with an NF-κB promotor in the course of viral replication (28Mosialos G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have identified a cellular homologue and binding partner of v-CARMEN as c-CARMEN, which is highly homologous to the viral protein in its N-terminal CARD motif. v-CARMEN and c-CARMEN interact directly in a CARD-dependent manner yet reveal different binding specificities toward members of the TRAF family. When overexpressed in 293T cells, v-CARMEN is a potent inducer of the JNK, p38, and NF-κB transcriptional pathways, whereas c-CARMEN or truncated versions thereof do not appear to activate these pathways by themselves nor do they affect the JNK and NF-κB activating potential of v-CARMEN. c-CARMEN may therefore act upstream of v-CARMEN in an as yet unidentified NF-κB/JNK-activating pathway. Alternatively, c-CARMEN may interfere with NF-κB/JNK activation only upon a post-translational regulatory event, such as phosphorylation, or upon interaction with a third component lacking in our cellular system. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that c-CARMEN mediates yet another NF-κB/JNK-unrelated function of v-CARMEN and that the observed CARD-dependent NF-κB/JNK activation through v-CARMEN is mediated by an as yet unidentified CARD-containing protein. Interestingly, mutation of a novel gene (Bcl10) identical to c-CARMEN was recently reported to be associated with B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and other tumor types (29Willis T.G. Jadayel D.M. Du M.-Q. Peng H. Perry A.R. Abdul-Rauf M. Price H. Karran L. Majekodunmi O. Wlodarska I. Pan L. Crook T. Hamoudi R. Isaacson P.G. Dyer M.J.S. Cell. 1999; 96: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Further study of the molecular mechanism of v-CARMEN function may help in the understanding of the physiological role of its cellular homologue and its potential implication in tumor development.

https://openalex.org/W2005017475,"The biosynthetic gene cluster for the 26-membered ring of the polyene macrolide pimaricin extends for about 110 kilobase pairs of contiguous DNA in the genome of Streptomyces natalensis. Two sets of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes are separated by a group of small polyketide-functionalizing genes. Two of the polyketide synthase genes, pimS0 and pimS1, have been fully sequenced and disrupted proving the involvement of each of these genes in pimaricin biosynthesis. The pimS0 gene encodes a relatively small acetate-activating PKS (approximately 193 kDa) that appears to work as a loading protein which presents the starter unit to the second PKS subunit. The pimS1 gene encodes a giant multienzyme (approximately 710 kDa) harboring 15 activities responsible for the first four cycles of chain elongation in pimaricin biosynthesis, resulting in formation of the polyene chromophore."

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have proposed that in genes0.3 and 10 of bacteriophage T7, a specific region located downstream of the initiation codon serves as an independent translational signal. This region of the RNA sequence designated as the downstream box (DB)1 is complementary to bases 1469–1483 within the Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA (anti-DB sequence). It is speculated that formation of a duplex between the DB and anti-DB of 16 S rRNA is responsible for translational enhancement (2Sprengart M.L. Fuchs E. Porter A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The DB sequence has also been implicated in the translation of the λc1 mRNA, an mRNA that lacks any untranslated region and the SD sequence (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E.

Interestingly, λc1 translation was enhanced at 42 °C in a temperature-sensitive strain in which the amount of ribosomal protein S2 decreased at 42 °C. It was proposed that the anti-DB sequence in S2-deficient ribosomes indirectly becomes more accessible to DB, resulting in enhancement of translation initiation of the λc1 mRNA (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Powers T. Stern S. Changchien L. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 697-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the role of the DB in λc1translation initiation was disputed by Resch and co-workers (5Resch A. Tedin K. Grundling A. Mundlein A. Blasi U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4740-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These authors constructed lacZ translational fusions with theλc1 gene to test the DB function. Since a deletion of 6 bases encompassing a portion of the DB sequence did not reduce the formation of the translation initiation complex, they disputed the existence of DB. Despite these elusive roles of DB (6Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we have shown that the presence of a DB sequence in cold-shock mRNAs plays an important role in translation efficiency, and we proposed that the DB is involved in the formation of a stable initiation complex at low temperature before the induction of cold ribosomal factors (7Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we pointed out the SELEX enrichment of DB-like sequences in an mRNA when the 30 S ribosomal subunit was used as a ligand (8Ringquist S. Jones T. Snyder E.E. Gibson T. Boni I. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Etchegaray J.-P. Xia B. Jiang W. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 873-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the results obtained by Resch et al. (5Resch A. Tedin K. Grundling A. Mundlein A. Blasi U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4740-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) could be explained by recreating a new DB as a result of the deletion of the original DB in the λc1 mRNA (6Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, a 6-base deletion eliminating 5 out of 8 matches in the original DB recreated a new 9-base matching DB sequence including the initiation codon. Therefore, the results by Resch and collaborators (5Resch A. Tedin K. Grundling A. Mundlein A. Blasi U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4740-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) could be explained by the newly created DB. In the present paper, we performed both biochemical and genetic experiments to reexamine the role of the DB in translation initiation, and we determined that DB plays a crucial role in regulation of gene expression in E. coli by enhancing the formation of the translation initiation complex. The cspA-lacZ fusion constructs were made by the insertion of annealed oligonucleotides at the EcoRI site of the pJJG78 (10Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Annealed oligonucleotides DB1 (5′-AATTAATCACAAAGTGGG-3′) with DB1′ (5′-AATTCCCACTTTGTGATT-3′) or DB2 (5′-AATTATGAATCACAAAGTGGG-3′) with DB2′ (5′-AATTCCCACTTTGTGATTCAT-3′) were used to create pJJG78DB1 or pJJG78DB2 constructs, respectively. The pIN-lacZ constructs were made by inserting theXbaI-SalI fragments from pJJG78 or pJJG78DB2 into the XbaI-SalI sites of pIN-III (10Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create pINZ and pINZDB1, respectively. Then, the annealed oligonucleotides ZDB2 (5′-CTAGCCCTTATTAATAATGAAAGGGGGAATTATGAATCACAAAGTGGG-3′) with ZDB2′ (5′-AATTCCCACTTTGTGATTCATAATTCCCCCTTTCATTATTAATAAGGG-3′) were inserted at the XbaI-EcoRI sites of pINZ to create pINZDB2. Annealed oligonucleotides ZDB3 (5′-CTAGCCCTTATTAATAATGAATCACAAAGTGGG-3′) with ZDB3′ (5′-AATTCCCACTTTGTGATTCATTATTAATAAGGG-3′) or ZDB4 (5′-CTAGAGGGTATTAATAATGAATCACAAAGTGGG-3′) with ZDB4′ (5′-AATTCCCACTTTGTG-ATTCATTATTAATACCCT-3′) were inserted at theXbaI-EcoRI sites of pINZ to construct pINZDB3 and pINZDB4, respectively. E. coli AR137 (pcnB −) (11Harlocker S.L. Rampersaund A. Yang W.-P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1956-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or JM83 (pcnB +) harboring different plasmids were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase in 20 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin in a 125-ml flask. The cultures were then transformed to a 15 °C shaking water bath, or isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mm) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. A 100-μl culture was taken at each time point. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to Miller's procedure (12Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). E. coli AR137 (pcnB −) or JM83 (pcnB +) carrying different plasmids were grown under the same condition as used for the β-galactosidase assay described above. To estimate the mRNA amounts of the lacZ fusion constructs, 1.5 ml of culture was taken at each time point, and total RNA was extracted by the hot phenol method (13Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For the mRNA stability experiments at 15 °C, rifampicin (0.2 mg/ml) was added 30 min after the temperature downshift from 37 °C. The mRNA amounts from the cspA-lacZ fusion constructs were estimated by primer extension using the 32P-labeled M13-47 antisense primer complementary to the region of lacZbetween codons 14 and 22 as described previously (7Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out with AMV-RT according to the manufacturer's procedure (Boehringer Mannheim), and the cDNA products were resolved on a 6% Sequencing Gel and quantified by PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Cultures of E. coli AR137 (pcnB −) cells carrying pINZ or pINZDB1 were grown at 37 °C under the same conditions used for the β-galactosidase assay. IPTG (1 mm) was added at mid-log phase to each culture. At each time point, 1 ml of the culture was labeled for 5 min with 100 μCi oftrans-[35S]methionine (1, 175 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (14Jones P.G. Mitta M. Kim Y. Jiang W. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cell extracts from each time point were loaded on a 5% SDS-PAGE, and β-galactosidase synthesis was measured by PhosphorImager. Cultures of E. coli JM83 (pcnB +) cells carrying pINZ or pINZDB1 were grown in 600 ml of LB medium in a 4-liter flask under the same condition as described above. At mid-log phase IPTG (1 mm) was added to each culture. Ribosomal particles were isolated by the procedure described by Dammel and Noller (15Dammel C.S. Noller H.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 626-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with some modifications as follows: a 100-ml aliquot from the original culture was taken at each time point, and chloramphenicol was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml to stop cell growth. Cells were immediately collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), resuspended in buffer 1 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mg/ml lysozyme), and frozen at −80 °C for few hours. The cells were lysed by the freeze-thaw method (16Ron E.Z. Kohler R.E. Davis B.D. Science. 1966; 153: 1119-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cell extracts (0.5 ml) were then layered on top of a 5–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient (7.5 ml), and the polysomes and ribosomal subunits were separated by centrifugation at 151,000 ×g for 2.5 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW-41 rotor. The polysome profiles were detected by a fast protein liquid chromatography system, and a total of 15 fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. From each polysome fraction (0.5 ml) 0.2 ml was spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane using the Minifold II Slot-Blot System (Schleicher & Schuell). ThelacZ-mRNA was detected by hybridization using the32P-labeled M13-47 primer (17Inouye S. Inouye M. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 202Google Scholar), and the amount oflacZ-mRNA was estimated by PhosphorImager. Using the E. coli S30 Extract System for Linear Templates Kit (Promega), the transcription-translation coupled reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol as follows. To 20 μl of pre-mix containing all the amino acids except for methionine, 10 μCi oftrans-[35S]methionine (1,175 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and the E. coli S30 extracts, 160 ng of pINZ or pINZDB1 (1 μl), were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The products were precipitated with acetone and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. It has been previously shown that DB is essential for the production of CspA at low temperature (7Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the wild-type DB of cspA has 10 matches out of 15 possible matches to the anti-DB in 16 S rRNA (7Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we added DBs of 12 (pJJG78DB1) or 15 (pJJG78DB2) bases that are complementary with the anti-DB of 16 S rRNA to the site after the 5th codon of lacZ under the cspA regulatory system in pJJG78 (see Fig. 1 A) to examine if they enhance lacZ expression at 15 °C. Mid-log phase cells (pcnB −) grown at 37 °C were shifted to 15 °C, and β-galactosidase activity was measured at 1, 2, and 3 h after the shift. Fig. 1 B shows that at 1 h at 15 °C the β-galactosidase activity was 3- and 8-fold higher with pJJG78DB1 and pJJG78DB2, respectively, than with pJJG78. After 2 and 3 h at 15 °C, the β-galactosidase activity was increased 3.5 and 10.5 times with pJJG78DB1 and pJJG78DB2, respectively, than with pJJG78 (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the effect of the DB was observed at 37 °C in which the β-galactosidase activity of pJJG78DB1 and pJJG78DB2 was 2- and 4-fold higher as compared with pJJG78. The amount of the lacZmRNA (Fig. 1 C) at each time point as well as the mRNA stability (Fig. 1 D) did not vary significantly between these constructs. The lacZ mRNA half-life from pJJG78, pJJG78DB1, and pJJG78DB2 was calculated to be 27, 23, and 25 min, respectively. In addition, computer analysis (18Zuker M. Stieger P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 9: 133-148Crossref Scopus (2619) Google Scholar) revealed no significant differences in the mRNA secondary structures among pJJG78, pJJG78DB1, and pJJG78DB2, suggesting that the insertion of the perfectly matching DB may not have a particular effect in the mRNA secondary structures that could account for the difference in their β-galactosidase expression. These results indicate that DB functions as a translational enhancer and that greater complementarity to the anti-DB improves translational efficiency and/or that specific base pairings like the first three nucleotides of the DB from pJJG78DB2 may play an important role for the DB activity. The experiments described above were carried out at 15 °C. In order to examine whether DB also works at 37 °C, the cspA cold-shock regulatory regions upstream of SD of pJJG78 and pJJG78DB2 were replaced with the constitutive lpp promoter and the lacpromoter-operator fragment using a pINIII vector (19Inouye M. Inouye M. Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression. Academic Press, New York1983: 15-32Crossref Google Scholar), yielding pINZ and pINZDB1, respectively (Fig.2 A). Cells (pcnB −) transformed with pINZ or pINZDB1 showed very low β-galactosidase activity in the absence of IPTG, an inducer of the lac promoter (Fig. 2 B, time 0). Upon the addition of 1 mm IPTG, β-galactosidase activity was induced in both cells. After 3 h induction, β-galactosidase activity increased 18- and 37-fold for pINZ and pINZDB1, respectively (Fig. 2 B). However, the levels of β-galactosidase activity show a dramatic difference between the two; the activity with DB (pINZDB1) was 34 times higher than that without DB (pINZ), demonstrating that DB functions at 37 °C as well. Specific activities of β-galactosidase produced from vector pINZ and pINZDB1 are almost identical (data not shown), and thus the addition of the five amino acid residues in the β-galactosidase sequence of pINZDB1 (due to DB) does not affect the enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the stabilities of β-galactosidase from pINZ and pINZDB1 are also identical with a half-life of approximately 3 h (data not shown). Next, we examined whether DB functions independently from SD, the initial ribosome-binding site. For this purpose, the SD sequence of pINZDB1, GAGG was changed to GCCC, yielding pINZDB2 (Fig. 2, A and C). The β-galactosidase level of pINZDB2 induction was reduced to 1/7 of that of pINZDB1 but still 3-fold higher than that of pINZ at 3 h after IPTG induction (Fig. 2 B). However, since pINZDB2 has the second AUG codon 6 codons downstream as a result of DB insertion, it might serve as a secondary initiation codon for the lacZgene. Indeed, the N-terminal sequence analysis showed that 100% of the β-galactosidase produced from pINZDB2 is initiated at the second AUG codon as compared with pINZDB1, which is more than 90% initiated at the first AUG codon (data not shown). Furthermore, the second AUG codon is presided by a potential but poor SD sequence (AAGG) at the region corresponding to the 2nd and 3th codons (underlined; Fig.2 C). Indeed, when this secondary SD was removed by deletion of the 15-base sequence (codons 1–5; pINZDB3 in Fig.2 A), β-galactosidase activity at all time points was reduced to the background level (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the secondary SD played a crucial role in the translation of the pINZDB2 lacZ mRNA. When the SD sequence was recreated by 5-base substitution in pINZDB3 (pINZDB4; Fig. 2 C), β-galactosidase activity of this construct was recovered to a comparable level to that of pINZDB1 (Fig. 2 B). It is important to notice that the DB sequence starting from the first AUG codon was eliminated in pINZDB4 (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, the high expression of β-galactosidase from pINZDB1 and pINZDB4 is due to the perfectly matching DB sequence (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that (a) DB functions only in the presence of SD, and (b) the position of DB is flexible starting from either codon 1 or 6. The β-galactosidase activity shown in Fig. 2 B indicates that DB enhances the translation of pINZDB1. Therefore, in order to test the effect of the DB in translation efficiency, the rate of β-galactosidase synthesis from pINZ and pINZDB1 was analyzed. The rate of β-galactosidase synthesis was measured by pulse labeling cells for 5 min with [35S]methionine after the addition of IPTG using cells harboring pINZ and pINZDB1. After SDS-PAGE, the amounts of radioactive β-galactosidase were estimated using a PhosphorImager (Fig.3). Prior to the addition of IPTG, the rate of β-galactosidase synthesis from pINZ and pINZDB1 was identical. However, upon IPTG induction the rates of β-galactosidase synthesis from pINZDB1 were continuously increasing at each time point, whereas the rate of β-galactosidase synthesis from pINZ was almost not affected. After 4 h of IPTG addition the rate of β-galactosidase synthesis from pINZDB1 was 6.5 times higher than that of pINZ. This result demonstrates that DB enhances the translation efficiency of pINZDB1 as reflected by the increment in the synthesis of β-galactosidase. In order to examine whether DB enhances translation initiation, we next analyze the ability of lacZ mRNA from pINZ and pINZDB1 to form polysomes. For this experiment, pcnB + cells were used to amplify the effect of DB. Interestingly, cells with pINZDB1 could not form colonies on LB plates in the presence of 1 mm IPTG, whereas cells with pINZ formed colonies. The lethal effect of IPTG on the cells with pINZDB1 is considered to be due to overexpression of β-galactosidase. After the addition of IPTG, cell growth was stopped by the addition of chloramphenicol (0.1 mg/ml) at 15, 30, and 60 min, and then polysome profiles were examined as shown in Fig. 4. From each gradient fraction (500 μl), 200 μl were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and the amount of the lacZ mRNA analyzed using a 24-base antisense oligonucleotide (M13–47 oligonucleotide). The amounts of the lacZ mRNA were quantified by a PhosphorImager and are displayed in Fig. 4. Although the polysome profiles are similar, there are significant differences in the distribution of the lacZ mRNA; at 15 min thelacZ mRNA mainly exists in the upper half of the gradient (fraction 8–14, corresponding to 70 S to 30 S ribosomes) with pINZ, while with pINZDB1 a major peak (fraction 3 to 8) is formed in the lower half of the gradient. At 30 min, the lacZmRNA from pINZ moved to the position of the 70 S ribosome, whereas the lacZ mRNA from pINZDB1 maintained a similar pattern as that at 15 min. At 60 min a major fraction of the lacZmRNA from pINZ remained in the upper half of the gradient, whereas the lacZ mRNA from pINZDB1 was broadly distributed from higher order polysomes to 70 S ribosome fraction. Therefore, the reason why cells harboring pINZDB1 could not form colonies on LB plates containing 1 mm IPTG may be due to a decrease in the concentration of free ribosomes as a result of the massive expression of a highly translatable DB-containing mRNA (20Vind J. Sorensen M.A. Rasmussen M.D. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These results indicate that DB enhances the efficiency of polysome formation probably due to a translation initiation enhancement. In order to estimate the exact effect of DB from the above experiment, the amount of the lacZ mRNA and the β-galactosidase activity were measured at the same time points taken in the polysome profiles (15, 30, and 60 min after IPTG induction). As shown in Fig.5 A, the amounts of thelacZ mRNA reached almost the maximal level at 15 min for both pINZ and pINZDB1. The PhosphorImager analysis of this result revealed that the amounts of the pINZDB1 mRNA are 1.5, 1.4, and 1.3 times higher than those of the pINZ mRNA at 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively. The higher mRNA levels for pINZDB1 are probably attributable to the highly efficient polysome formation of pINZDB1 that may stabilize the mRNA (21Iost I. Dreyfus M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3252-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The induction of β-galactosidase activity is shown in Fig. 5 B. In the case of pINZDB1, the activity is very high even in the absence of IPTG, and upon the addition of IPTG, it increased from 18,500 to 64,400 units (3.5-fold) after 2.5 h incubation. In the case of pINZ, the background activity prior to IPTG induction was much lower, and it increased from 900 to 2,900 units (3-fold) at the 2.5-h time point. The increment of the β-galactosidase activity of pINZDB1 between 30 and 60 min is 35 times higher than that of pINZ, and therefore the efficiency of β-galactosidase production for pINZDB1 is calculated to be 26 times higher than that for pINZ on the basis of the amount of mRNA. Therefore, the higher levels of β-galactosidase production from pINZDB1 are due to a high efficiency of polysome formation. Next, in order to demonstrate more directly the translation-enhancement effect of DB, the β-galactosidase synthesis was examined in a cell-free system using pINZ and pINZDB1. The [35S]methionine incorporation into β-galactosidase (band G) with pINZDB1 (2nd lane, Fig.6 A) was 8-fold higher than that with pINZ (1st lane), whereas the β-lactamase (band L) production was almost identical in both lanes. Fig. 6 B shows a time course of in vitroproduction of β-galactosidase from pINZ and pINZDB1 performed as described above. The same reaction was carried out with non-radioactive methionine, spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with the M13–47 oligonucleotide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 6 C, at each time point the amount of lacZ mRNA from pINZ and pINZDB1 was almost identical. This result supports the role of the DB as a translational enhancer from the in vivo data described above. It has been proposed that in the absence of ribosomal protein S2, structural changes in 16 S rRNA result in the release of the anti-DB sequence from the penultimate stem making it more accessible to base pair with DB (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Powers T. Stern S. Changchien L. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 697-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We analyzed the β-galactosidase expression of pINZ, and pINZDB1 in E. coliCS239 that carries an S2 temperature-sensitive mutation (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig.7 A shows that the β-galactosidase activity of pINZDB1 significantly increases upon shifting the temperature from 30 to 42 °C in the S2tsstrain (CS239) (6.3-fold from 0 to 3.5 h), whereas the activity in the wild-type strain (CS240) slightly increased (1.1-fold from 0 to 3.5 h). If the initial ratio of the activity of CS239 to that of CS240 at time 0 is taken as 1, the ratio dramatically increased, reaching 5.8 at 3.5 h after temperature shift (Fig.7 B). In contrast, the lacZ gene without DB, pINZ, did not show any significant differences in its expression between CS240 and CS239, and the ratios of the activity of CS239 to that of CS240 remained also at the initial level throughout the incubation time (Fig. 7 B). A similar experiment was carried out with pINZDB3 (SD−, DB+), and the ratio of the activity in CS239 to that in CS240 increased 3.4-fold at 3.5 h after the temperature shift (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the low levels of S2 protein at 42 °C causes significant stimulation of the lacZ expression only if thelacZ gene contains DB, consistent to the proposal of Shean and Gottesman (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The present results clearly demonstrate that there is acis element downstream of the initiation codon, which in concert with SD plays an important role in the translation efficiency of mRNAs in E. coli. Our results provide supporting evidence for the DB hypothesis (1Sprengart M.L. Fatscher H.P. Fuchs E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Sprengart M.L. Fuchs E. Porter A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) that DB forms a complex with the anti-DB in the 16 S rRNA to enhance translation initiation of DB-containing mRNA. The present data reveal the following five features of the DB function. (a) The β-galactosidase activity of the pJJG78DB2 is 2–3-fold higher than that of the pJJG78DB1, indicating that a better complementarity between DB and anti-DB yields better translation and/or that the first 3 residues (AUG) in the DB are required for the better activity of the DB. (b) The position of DB in the mRNA is quite flexible as DB can start from codon 1 (pINZDB1) or codon 6 (pINZDB4). (c) DB itself works very poorly in the absence of SD, suggesting that the formation of translation initiation complex could be first initiated by the SD-16 S rRNA interaction, which subsequently leads to the DB-anti-DB interaction. Alternatively, the SD-16 S rRNA interaction could be stabilized by DB-anti-DB base pairing. It has been shown that the 30 S ribosomal subunit can bind to mRNA in the absence of initiator tRNA to form an intermediate translation initiation complex (22Wu X.-Q. Lyengar P. RajBhandary U.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This intermediate complex could be stabilized by the interaction of DB with anti-DB. (d) DB enhances the translation initiation as judged by increased mRNA translational efficiency both in vivo and in vitro as observed by the increase of polysome formation and β-galactosidase production in a cell-free system. (e) In the absence of S2 protein, the DB function is enhanced, consistently with the notion that anti-DB becomes more accessible to DB (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Powers T. Stern S. Changchien L. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 697-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since that the major conclusions for the behavior of the DB in translation have been made from artificially created DBs in overexpression systems as shown above, it would be important to analyze the effect of DB under more physiological conditions. In this regard, we have reported earlier that the DB is crucial for the induction of the cold-shock proteinA (CspA) at low temperature and, furthermore, that major cold-shock genes contain DB sequences (7Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently postulated that the DB is essentially required for the induction of major cold-shock proteins under conditions completely blocking protein synthesis at low temperature (23.Etchegaray, J.-P., and Inouye, M. (1999) in press.Google Scholar). Future experiments testing artificially created DBs using single copies of DB-containinglacZ mRNAs would greatly support the conclusions about the role of the DB as a translational enhancer. It should be noted that there are a number of mRNAs without the 5′-untranslated region such as λc1 (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), mRNA from other phages (5Resch A. Tedin K. Grundling A. Mundlein A. Blasi U.

In these leaderless mRNAs, conclusive evidence indicates that DB plays an essential role in the formation of the translation initiation complex in the absence of SD (3Shean C.S. Gottesman M.E.

Under our experimental conditions, IbpB exhibited pronounced size heterogeneity. Basic oligomers, roughly spherical and approximately 15 nm in diameter, interacted to form larger particles in the 100–200-nm range, which themselves associated to yield loose aggregates of micrometer size. IbpB suppressed the thermal aggregation of model proteins in a concentration-dependent manner, and its CD spectrum was consistent with a mostly β-pleated secondary structure. Incubation at high temperatures led to a partial loss of secondary structure, the progressive exposure of tryptophan residues to the solvent, the dissociation of high molecular mass aggregates into ≈600-kDa oligomers, and an increase in surface hydrophobicity. Structural changes were reversible between 37 and 55 °C, and, up to 55 °C, hydrophobic sites were reburied upon cooling. IbpB exhibited a biphasic unfolding trend upon guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) treatment and underwent comparable conformational changes upon melting and during the first GdnHCl-induced transition. However, hydrophobicity decreased with increasing GdnHCl concentrations, suggesting that efficient exposure of structured hydrophobic sites involves denaturant-sensitive structural features. By contrast, IbpB hydrophobicity rose at high NaCl concentrations and increased further at high temperatures. Our results support a model in which temperature-driven conformational changes lead to the reversible exposure of normally shielded binding sites for nonnative proteins and suggest that both hydrophobicity and charge context may determine substrate binding to IbpB.

More than 25 different sHsps have been identified in the cytosol and organelles of heat-shocked plants (1Boston R.S. Viitanen P.V. Vierling E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar); mammalian and yeast cells encode fewer sHsps (2Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). The overall homology between sHsps isolated from diverse sources is not as pronounced as that found in other stress protein families. In fact, sHsps are only grouped as a family of heat shock proteins based on a low degree of homology in a core region of about 85 amino acids (the α-crystallin domain), their ability to be induced by cellular stress, and their small protomer molecular mass, which usually ranges between 15 and 30 kDa. Because of structural and functional similarities, the major eye lens proteins αA- and αB-crystallin are also included in the sHsp family.sHsps are abundant in unstressed cells (3Klemenz R. Andres A.-C. Fröhli E. Schäfer R. Aoyama A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and their synthesis is up-regulated by cellular stress as well as a variety of additional signals related to the growth state and oncogenic status of the cell (e.g. Refs. 4Bond U. Schlesinger M.J. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Gernold M. Knauf U. Gaestel M. Stahl J. Kloetzel P.M. Dev.

Biochem. 1992; 48: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most sHsps assemble into large oligomers in a process that requires an intact NH2 terminus (7Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, sHsps form complexes ranging from 300 to 800 kDa (2Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar,8Behlke J. Lutsch G. Gaestel M. Bielka H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin, which is normally isolated as an 800-kDa oligomer, has been reported to range in size from 280 kDa to 10 MDa (for a review, see Ref. 9Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. De Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Plant sHsps exhibit a more uniform size distribution (≈200–240 kDa); pea Hsp18.1 consists of 12 subunits arranged in a globular structure, whereas pea Hsp17.7 is organized in both round and triangular structures (10Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The recently crystallizedMethanococcus jannaschii Hsp16.5 (MjHsp16.5) is organized as a hollow sphere built from 24 subunits (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Finally,Mycobacterium tuberculosis Hsp16.3 forms another type of oligomeric structure, a 150-kDa triangular trimer of trimers (12Chang Z. Primm T.P. Jakana J. Lee I.H. Serysheva I. Chiu W. Gilbert H.F. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7218-7223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).sHsps are believed to play a key role in thermoprotection because their overexpression confers a significant degree of thermotolerance to host cells (13Knauf U. Jakob U. Engel K. Buchner J. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Landry J. Chrétien P. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. J.

Mammalian sHsps appear to perform this function by stabilizing cytoskeletal elements such as actin (7Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol.

In other systems, sHsps may increase thermotolerance by preventing the aggregation of cellular proteins accumulating as a result of cellular stress. Indeed, a number of sHsps suppress the thermal aggregation of model proteins in vitro (10Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol.

Furthermore, murine Hsp25, human Hsp27, and pea Hsp18.1 and Hsp17.7 exhibit abona fide molecular chaperone function because they partially improve the reactivation of certain chemically unfolded proteins (10Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the above cases, the addition of ATP to the refolding buffer is not necessary to enhance refolding. Nevertheless, the reactivation yields of citrate synthase (CS) by human αB-crystallin are increased 2-fold in the presence of ATP (17Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The formation of large oligomeric structures appears to be necessary for molecular chaperone function because NH2-terminally truncated variants of Caenorhabditis elegansHsp16.2 and the only known monomeric sHsp, C. elegansHsp12.6, are unable to suppress the aggregation of test substrates (7Leroux M.R.

Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Purified murine Hsp25 (23Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and pea Hsp18.1 (22Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind thermally denatured proteins on their surface and maintain them in a folding-competent state. This observation has led to the idea that sHsps act as a reservoir of partially folded proteins that are accessible for refolding by ATP-dependent molecular chaperones once the effect of cellular stress has abated (23Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar).In contrast to the relatively large amount of information available on eukaryotic sHsps and α-crystallins, little is known about theirEscherichia coli homologs. The approximately 16-kDa E. coli IbpA and IbpB polypeptides were first discovered as contaminants tightly associated with recombinant protein inclusion bodies (25Allen S.P. Polazzi J.O. Gierse J.K. Easton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These inclusion-body-associatedproteins were later found to cosediment with host proteins aggregated intracellularly by heat shock (26Laskowska E. Wawrzynów A. Taylor A. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The ibpA andibpB genes are part of an Eς32-transcribed operon that is the strongest heat-inducible operon of E. coli (27Chuang S.-E. Burland V. Plunkett III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The bacterial sHsps are about 50% identical to each other at the amino acid level and share 20–27% identity with homologs from plant chloroplasts, Drosophila, C. elegans, and Xenopus (25Allen S.P. Polazzi J.O. Gierse J.K. Easton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chuang S.-E. Burland V. Plunkett III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). IbpAB are dispensable in E. coli, and deletion of the ibp operon only leads to modest effects on growth and viability at high temperatures (28Thomas J.G. Baneyx F. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5165-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that a Δibp mutation exerts a deleterious effect on the growth of dnaK756 but not groES30 mutants at high temperatures suggests that IbpAB cooperate with DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE but not with GroEL-GroES in vivo (28Thomas J.G. Baneyx F. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5165-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with a recent investigation of the interplay between IbpB and the major chaperone systems showing that purified IbpB forms stable complexes with denatured malate and lactate dehydrogenase and that the bound proteins are specifically delivered to the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, but not to the GroEL-GroES system in vitro (29Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).To gain further information on the structure-function relationship of bacterial sHsps, we have purified and refolded IbpB from a Δibp strain. We show that despite its pronounced size heterogeneity, IbpB shares many of the traditional features of sHsps. Our results indicate that reversible structural modifications induced by temperature changes in the 32–50 °C range drive the exposure of denaturant-sensitive hydrophobic regions that may constitute substrate binding sites for nonnative proteins. Charge effects appear to be important for the optimal exposure of hydrophobic domains to the solvent.DISCUSSIONDespite a low degree of homology restricted to a core region known as the α-crystallin domain, all sHsps characterized to date share common structural and functional features: (i) their protomers are mostly β-pleated with little α-helical content, as judged from far UV CD spectroscopy and crystallographic data (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar); (ii) they form large oligomers ranging in molecular mass between 200 and 800 kDa; and (iii) they can suppress the aggregation of thermally or chemically denatured model proteins by capturing folding intermediates on their surface (22Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar,23Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Although E. coli IbpB behaves as a typical sHsp in terms of function and protomer secondary structure (Figs. 2 and 4), it exhibits uncommon size heterogeneity (Fig. 3). The basic oligomer appears to be a roughly spherical particle approximately 15 nm in diameter and 600 kDa in apparent molecular mass, a size and morphology comparable to those of other sHsps (22Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 23Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

Under our experimental conditions, these oligomers interacted to form larger structures in the 100–200-nm range, which themselves loosely associated to yield amorphous, micrometer size clusters. The eye lens protein α-crystallin, which has a dynamic oligomeric structure (44Haley D.A. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,45Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), has also been isolated as distinct populations in the 600–900-kDa, 900-kDa–4-MDa, and greater than 10-MDa ranges (46Spector A. Li L.-K. Augusteyn R.C. Schneider A. Freund T. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, because concentration, pH, ionic strength, and temperature of isolation have all been reported to affect the oligomeric state of α-crystallins (47Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licino P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 48Koenig S.H. Brown III, R.D. Spiller M. Chakrabarti B. Pande A. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 776-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and because IbpA may modulate the quaternary structure of IbpB, it is not clear whether large IbpB oligomers also exist in vivo.Temperature increases have profound effects on IbpB conformation which are characterized by: (i) a partial loss of secondary structure (Fig.2); (ii) the progressive exposure of tryptophan residues to the solvent (Fig. 5 A); (iii) the dissociation of large aggregates into constituent oligomers (Fig. 6); and (iv) an increase in protein surface hydrophobicity (Fig. 7). Several lines of evidence suggest that these temperature-driven structural modifications have a functional role. First, IbpB is remarkably thermostable and retains a significant amount of secondary and tertiary structure up to 55 °C (Figs. 2 and 5). Second, conformational changes appear to be reversible between the physiological (37 °C) and maximum growth temperature (50 °C) forE. coli (Figs. 2 and 5 B). Finally, after incubation to temperatures as high as 55 °C, solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches are reburied upon cooling (Fig. 7 B). An increase in bis-ANS labeling with the incubation temperature has been reported previously for α-crystallin (49Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 50Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and pea Hsp18.1 (22Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), leading to the idea that temperature-induced structural rearrangements promote the exposure of normally hidden hydrophobic regions that allow sHsps to bind and stabilize partially folded proteins as they denature. Our results are fully consistent with this hypothesis. Such a “molecular sponge” function would prevent saturation of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES major chaperone systems at high temperatures. As the temperature returns to physiological values, IbpB would act as a “reservoir” of partially folded proteins for the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system (22Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 23Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), thereby eliminating the need forde novo synthesis of thermolabile proteins. Alternatively, bound proteins could be presented to the cellular degradation machinery for recycling.Although high temperatures and incubation with up to 1.2 mGdnHCl appear to induce comparable structural changes in IbpB (Figs. 2,5, and 8), bis-ANS binding decreases above 0.3 m GdnHCl while it increases progressively upon temperature upshift (Fig.7 A). This result suggests that efficient exposure of structured hydrophobic patches to the solvent involves fine structural features that are readily disrupted at low denaturant concentrations. The bis-ANS binding sites of pea Hsp18.1 (22Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and α-crystallin (51Sharma K.K.

Caspers G.-J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the binding sites for bis-ANS and nonnative proteins are identical in sHsps (51Sharma K.K.

The Hsp18.1 region that binds bis-ANS maps in a surface-exposed loop that links the third and fourth β-strands of the composite β-sandwich in each folding unit of the MjHsp16.5 crystal structure (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Whether low concentrations of GdnHCl disrupt an organized hydrophobic site involving this loop or affects IbpB hydrophobicity in a different fashion remains to be determined.An interesting feature of the melting study of Fig. 5 is that the structural changes that take place between 10 and 32 °C are not reversible. Although the physiological significance of this phenomenon remains unclear, it is possible that the cell needs to maintain any IbpB synthesized at low temperatures (e.g. during the Hsp up-regulation period that accompanies recovery from cold shock (52Taura T. Kusukawa N. Yura T. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,53Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar)) in a minimally active form. Around 32 °C, a thermally induced rearrangement may activate the protein into a fully functional form. In support of this hypothesis, evidence for thermal switching events have been reported between 25 and 30 °C in the case of GroEL (54Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21632-21636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6286-6289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and around 30 °C for α-crystallin (56Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our observation that IbpB hydrophobicity increases with NaCl concentration is consistent with the hypothesis of ionic triggering of hydrophobic surface exposure proposed by Horowitz and co-workers for GroEL (57Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this model, hydrophobic stretches in partially folded protein substrates are presented to the chaperonin in a charged context to stimulate and/or lead to the optimal exposure of hidden hydrophobic binding sites to the solvent. In agreement with this idea, we noted that although 1 m NaCl raises the hydrophobicity of IbpB by about 40% at 23 °C (Fig. 9), the increase in bis-ANS photoincorporation with the incubation temperature remained comparable whether or not NaCl was present in the buffer (Fig. 7 and data not shown). NMR solution studies have revealed the presence of flexible COOH-terminal extensions 8–18 residues in length in both α-crystallins and mouse Hsp25 (58Carver J.A. Esposito G. Schwedersky G. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 59Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Ralston J.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In MjHsp16.5, the ultimate 6 COOH-terminal residues in one subunit reach out to interact with β4 and β8 of a neighboring subunit (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), a location that is in close proximity to the bis-ANS photoincorporation site. Because both the COOH-terminal end and putative bis-ANS/substrate binding site of IbpB are rich in charged residues, it is tempting to hypothesize that the bacterial sHsp possesses a flexible COOH terminus that participates in substrate binding through ionic triggering.It has been shown that the portion of human granulocyte ribonuclease that binds GroEL consists of 9 hydrophobic residues, 4 positively charged arginines and no negatively charged amino acids (60Rosenberg H.F. Ackerman S.J. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4499-4503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, binding of substrates to DnaK is determined by 4–5 hydrophobic residues flanked by basic residues, and negatively charged residues are excluded throughout (61Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Google Scholar, 62Gragerov A. Zeng X. Zhao W. Brukholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol.

It therefore appears that despite large differences in structure, several families of molecular chaperones have conserved a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic effects as the most effective means to recognize, bind, and possibly exchange partially folded proteins. Despite their presence in all organisms examined to date, small heat shock proteins (sHsps)1remain one of the most disparate family of stress proteins. More than 25 different sHsps have been identified in the cytosol and organelles of heat-shocked plants (1Boston R.S. Viitanen P.V. Vierling E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar); mammalian and yeast cells encode fewer sHsps (2Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). The overall homology between sHsps isolated from diverse sources is not as pronounced as that found in other stress protein families. In fact, sHsps are only grouped as a family of heat shock proteins based on a low degree of homology in a core region of about 85 amino acids (the α-crystallin domain), their ability to be induced by cellular stress, and their small protomer molecular mass, which usually ranges between 15 and 30 kDa. Because of structural and functional similarities, the major eye lens proteins αA- and αB-crystallin are also included in the sHsp family. sHsps are abundant in unstressed cells (3Klemenz R. Andres A.-C. Fröhli E. Schäfer R. Aoyama A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and their synthesis is up-regulated by cellular stress as well as a variety of additional signals related to the growth state and oncogenic status of the cell (e.g. Refs. 4Bond U. Schlesinger M.J. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Gernold M. Knauf U. Gaestel M. Stahl J. Kloetzel P.M. Dev.

Biochem. 1992; 48: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most sHsps assemble into large oligomers in a process that requires an intact NH2 terminus (7Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, sHsps form complexes ranging from 300 to 800 kDa (2Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar,8Behlke J. Lutsch G. Gaestel M. Bielka H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 119-122C"
https://openalex.org/W2007287542,"This paper tests the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase plays a causal role in cellular transformation induced by SV40 T antigen. We show that T antigen expression results in elevation of DNA methyltransferase (MeTase) mRNA, DNA MeTase protein levels, and global genomic DNA methylation. A T antigen mutant that has lost the ability to bind pRb does not induce DNA MeTase. This up-regulation of DNA MeTase by T antigen occurs mainly at the posttranscriptional level by altering mRNA stability. Inhibition of DNA MeTase by antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors results in inhibition of induction of cellular transformation by T antigen as determined by a transient transfection and soft agar assay. These results suggest that elevation of DNA MeTase is an essential component of the oncogenic program induced by T antigen.

DNA methyltransferase polymerase chain reaction In mammalian cells 60–80% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated, forming a pattern that correlates with gene expression (1Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 2Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase (DNA MeTase)1 is the enzyme responsible for the establishment of this pattern (3Adams R.L. McKay E.L. Craig L.M. Burdon R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 561: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that cancer cells bear increased levels of DNA MeTase (4Kautiainen T.L. Jones P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1594-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that increased DNA MeTase is an early event in tumor progression in an animal model of lung carcinogenesis (5Belinsky S.A. Nikula K.J. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4045-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and that regional hypermethylation is characteristic of tumor cells (6Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 7Nelkin B.D. Przepiorka D. Burke P.J. Thomas E.D. Baylin S.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 2431-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the extent to which DNA MeTase activity is elevated in cancer cellsin vivo is still debatable (8Lee P.J. Washer L.L. Law D.J. Boland C.R. Horon I.L. Feinberg A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10366-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A basic question is whether an increase in DNA MeTase activity is a critical downstream component of oncogenic pathways (9Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 7: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or whether it is an aberrant consequence of the transformed state? One molecular link between DNA MeTase and an oncogenic pathway is the observation that its expression in mouse cells is up-regulated at the transcriptional level by the Ras signaling pathway (9Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 7: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10MacLeod A.R. Rouleau J. Szyf M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested recently that elevated DNA MeTase might play a causal role in cancer (12Szyf M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 70: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Inhibition of DNA MeTase in Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells by either expressing an antisense to DNA MeTase (13MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or by antisense oligonucleotides (14Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) inhibits tumorigenesis ex vivo. Injection of DNA MeTase antisense oligonucleotides into mice harboring Y1 tumors inhibits tumor growth in vivo (14Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and reduction of DNA MeTase level by 5-azaCdR suppresses neoplasia in Minmice (15Laird P.W. Jacksongrusby L. Fazeli A. Dickinson S.L. Jung W.E. Li E.A. Weinberg R. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1995; 81: 197-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). If increased DNA MeTase is a necessary constituent of cellular transformation, it should be induced by diverse oncogenic pathways. SV40 T antigen is one of the most studied viral oncoproteins that can induce frequent tumors when expressed as a transgene in mice (16Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Messing A. van Dyke T. Levine A.J. Palmiter D. Cell. 1984; 37: 367-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), can immortalize primary cell lines (17Tevethia M.J. Virology. 1984; 137: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or transform immortalized cells (18Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. Virology. 1968; 36: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but transforms primary cells only when expressed in conjunction with Ras or other components of its signaling pathway (19Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Thus, T antigen induces a very effective transformation pathway that is complementary to, but different from, the one induced by Ras. Extensive studies have established that T antigen transformation is a consequence of its ability to physically interact with the tumor suppressors pRb (20De Caprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.Y. Huang C.M. Lee W.H. Marsilio E. Paucha E. Livingston D. Cell. 1988; 54: 275-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) and p53(21) as well as yet non characterized functions. A recent observation has shown that two human SV40-transformed lines express higher levels of DNA MeTase protein than their nontransformed counterparts (22Chuang L.S.-H. Ian H.-I. Koh T.-W. Ng H.-H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Is it possible that similar to the Ras signaling pathway, the T antigen-tumor suppressor pathway utilizes DNA MeTase as a downstream effector? This paper tests this hypothesis by determining whether expression of T antigen increases the levels of DNA MeTase mRNA and protein in the cell, defining the level of gene expression regulation at which T antigen acts, and testing whether DNA MeTase plays a causal role in T antigen triggered cellular transformation? Balb/c 3T3 cells (ATCC) were maintained as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium which was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Immunocorp, Montreal). All other media and reagents for cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells (1 × 106) were plated on a 150-mm dish (Nunc) 15 h before transfection. The pZip U19 (ts A58)Tneo T antigen expressing vector (23Almazan G. McKay R. Brain Res. 1992; 579: 234-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (this plasmid expresses high levels of T antigen and is highly transforming in our experience at 37 °C, it was not temperature-sensitive in our experience) was introduced into Balb/c 3T3 cells with 1 μg of pUCSVneo as a selectable marker by DNA mediated gene transfer using the calcium phosphate protocol. Selection was initiated 48 h after transfection by adding 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to the medium. G418-resistant cells were cloned in selective medium. For analysis of growth in soft agar, 3 × 103 cells were seeded in triplicate onto a six well dish (Falcon) in 4 ml of complete medium containing 0.33% agar solution at 37 °C (24Freedman V.H. Shin S. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Cells were fed with 2 ml of medium every 2 days. Growth was scored as colonies containing >10 cells, 21 days after plating. Cells were plated on tissue culture grade 100-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 105/plate 24 h before treatment. Each treatment was performed in triplicate. The phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study are HYB101584, which is antisense to a sequence encoding the second putative translation initiation site of DNA MeTase (5′-TCT ATT TGA GTC TGC CAT TT-3′) and the reverse sequence HYB101585 (5′-TTT ACC GTC TGA GTT TAT CT-3′) as described in Ref. 14Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar. To determine whether DNA MeTase antisense oligonucleotides inhibit transformation initiated by transient expression of T antigen, Balb/c 3T3 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104/well in a six-well plate 24 h before initiation of oligonucleotide treatment. Oligonucleotides were mixed with 31 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 4 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to the mix. The cells were incubated in the Opti-MEM/oligonucleotide mix for 4 h, following which the mix was replaced with regular growth medium. The cells were treated with 100 nm amounts of either HYB101584, HYB101585, or with Lipofectin carrier alone. 48 h after plating, 2 μg of either pZip U19 (ts A58)Tneo, T ant Rb− or pUC SVneo plasmids were included in the transfection mix with oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide treatment was then repeated a third time 72 h after plating with oligonucleotides but without plasmid. The cells were then harvested following the third treatment and counted. The viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, and the cells were plated onto soft agar as described above. For RNase protection, methyltransferase activity assay and nearest neighbor analysis, RNA, nuclear extracts, and DNA were prepared from treated cells as described below. To verify equal efficiency of transfection and expression of T antigen under the different conditions, a sample of the transfected cells was plated on glass coverslips, fixed for immunostaining with methanol, and incubated with an SV40 T antigen mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz number sc-147) for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The signal was detected using Texas Red-conjugated secondary anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (Vector number H0724) using standard techniques as recommended by the manufacturer. No difference in transfection efficiency and expression of T antigen was observed in oligonucleotide-treated transfectants. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (ICN number 157574) (data not shown). For transient transfection of a human DNA MeTase expression plasmid bearing the entire coding sequence of DNA MeTase (codons 1–1616) under the direction of a cytomegalovirus promoter (pcDNA 3.1 His DNA MeTase), 10 μg of either pcDNA 3.1 His DNA MeTase or pcDNA His control were mixed with 4 μl of Lipofectin, and transfection was performed as described above. Expression of transfected constructs was verified by immunocytochemistry essentially as described above using the Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen number 46-0528) for detection of His-tagged proteins and Texas Red secondary monoclonal antibody. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (data not shown). Cells were harvested for soft agar assay 48 h posttransfection. Genomic DNA was prepared from pelleted nuclei, and total cellular RNA was prepared from cytosolic fractions. To quantify the relative abundance of DNA MeTase and T antigen mRNA, total RNA (5 μg) was blotted onto Hybond N+ using the Bio-Rad slot blot apparatus. The filter-bound RNA was hybridized to a32P-labeled 0.6-kilobase pair cDNA probe encoding the 5′ sequences of the mouse DNA MeTase (1–600) (13MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and exposed to XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The filter was rehybridized with a T antigen probe, and after removing this probe, the filter was hybridized to an 18 S RNA-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (13MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The autoradiograms were scanned with a Scanalytics scanner (one D analysis), and the signal at each band was determined. The signal obtained at each point was normalized to the amount of total RNA at the same point. For Northern blot analysis, the RNA was transferred to an Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Northern blots were hybridized to a 0.6-kilobase pair antisense fragment resulting from a single stranded PCR reaction with a DNA MeTase cDNA fragment (1–600) using the oligonucleotide (TCAATGACAGCTCTCTCTGGTGTGACG) as a 3′ primer and a single-stranded PCR amplification of c-fos(1440–1458) using the oligonucleotide (CCCAGCCCACAAAGGTCCAGAATC) as a 3′ primer as well as an oligonucleotide hybridizing to 18 S rRNA. The autoradiograms were quantified by densitometry (Scanalytics), and hybridization was plotted as DNA MeTase signal standardized to 18 S and compared with 0 h actinomycin D treatment. RNA was prepared from exponentially growing cells using standard protocols. RNase protection assays were performed as described in Ref. 11Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar using a 0.7-kilobase pairHindIII-BamHI fragment as a riboprobe. This probe is a genomic fragment bearing exons 3 and 4 of the murine DNA MeTase probe. It therefore protects, as described in Ref. 11Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, two major bands of 112 and 100 nucleotides corresponding to these exons as well as a number of minor alternatively spliced and alternate initiations as described previously (25Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To normalize the signal obtained for DNA MeTase with the amount of total RNA present in each sample and to verify equal loading, the RNA was simultaneously hybridized with a32P-labeled riboprobe complementary to 18 S RNA and subjected to RNase digestion and protection (Ambion). Nuclei were prepared from 3 × 106 exponentially growing 3T3 and T ant 10 transfectants and were incubated with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) as described previously (26Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An equal concentration of32P-labeled RNA samples (1 × 106dpm/sample) was hybridized in triplicate with Hybond-N+ filters bearing 20 μg of immobilized pSKMet5′ (containing a genomic fragment bearing exons 2–4 of the murine DNA MeTase gene) (31Sakamoto K. Howard T. Ogryzko V. Xu N.-Z. Corsico C.C. Jones D.H. Howard B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar) (indicated as Met in Fig. 3), pZip U19 (ts A58)Tneo (T ant), and pγ-actin (γ-actin) plasmids and subjected to autoradiography as described previously (26Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of the signals corresponding to32P-labeled RNA hybridizing to DNA MeTase transcribed in T antigen expressing transfectants and control cells was determined by scanning densitometry and normalized to the signal obtained for γ-actin. The ratio of DNA MeTase/actin signal in T antigen transfectants was compared with the value obtained for neotransfectants. Two μg of DNA were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.1 unit of DNase, 2.5 μl of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 2 units of Kornberg DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) were then added and the reaction was incubated for an additional 15 min at 30 °C as described previously (10MacLeod A.R. Rouleau J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11327-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The labeled DNA (8 μl) was digested to 3′ mononucleotides with 70 μg of micrococcal nuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the manufacturer's recommended buffer for 10 h at 37 °C, spleen phosphodiesterase (Boehringer Mannheim) was then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 3 additional h. Equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded on TLC phosphocellulose plates (Kodak), and the 3′ mononucleotides were separated by chromatography in one dimension (isobutyric acid:H2O:NH4OH in the ratio 66:33:1). The chromatograms were exposed to XAR film (Kodak), and the autoradiograms were scanned by scanning laser densitometry (Scanalytics one D analysis). Spots corresponding to cytosine and 5-methylcytosine were quantified. To determine nuclear DNA MeTase levels, cells were harvested immediately posttransfection, and DNA MeTase activity was assayed as described previously (26Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously with small modifications (27Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Sodium bisulfite, catalog number S-8890, free weight = 104, was used. A 3.6 msolution of sodium bisulfite (ACS grade, Sigma) (pH 5) was prepared fresh each time, and a 20 mm stock of solution of hydroquinone was prepared and stored at −20 °C. 5 μg of DNA (digested with EcoRI) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 54 μl of double distilled H2O, 6 μl of 3N NaOH. Following this incubation, 431 μl of a 3.6 m sodium bisulfite, 1 mm hydroquinone solution was added. 100 μl of mineral oil were added to overlay the solution, and the tube was heated at 55 °C for 12 h. The bisulfite reaction was recovered from beneath the mineral oil and desalted using the QIA Quick PCR Purification Kit (followed manufacturer's protocol). 6 μl of 3n NaOH were added to the desalted solution, and the tube was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following ethanol precipitation (in the presence of 0.3 m NH4OAc) the DNA was resuspended in 100 μl in double distilled H2O. Approximately 50 ng of DNA were used in each of the PCR amplifications. PCR products were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions utilizing nested primers. The PCR products of the second reaction were then subcloned using the Invitrogen TA Cloning Kit (we followed the manufacturer's protocol), and the clones were sequenced using the T7 Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (we followed the manufacturer's protocol, procedure C). The primers used for the MyoD first exon (GenBankTM accession M84918) were: MyoD5′1, 5′-atttaggaattgggatatgga-3′ (176–196); MyoD5′ (nested), 5′-ttttttttgtttttttgagat-3′ (245–265); MyoD3′1, 5′-ctcatttcacttactccaaaa-3′ (577–554); and MyoD3′ (nested), 5′-caaacaacacccaaacattc-3′ (488–469). The primers used for the DNA MeTase genomic region (GenBankTM accession M84387) were: MET5′1, 5′-ggattttggtttatagtattgt-3′; MET 5′ (nested), 5′-ggaattttaggtttttatatgtt-3′; MET3′1, 5′-ctcttcataaactaaatattataa-3′; and MET3′ (nested), 5′-tccaaaactcaacataaaaaaat-3′. To determine whether ectopic expression of T antigen alters the levels of DNA MeTase in the cell, we cotransfected immortalized but nontransformed Balb/c 3T3 cells with a T antigen expression vector pZipneoSV40U19tsA58 (23Almazan G. McKay R. Brain Res. 1992; 579: 234-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and G418-resistant clones were isolated. Quantification of the level of DNA MeTase mRNA as a function of T antigen expression in 24 independent T antigen transfectants by a slot blot analysis (Fig.1 A) shows a strong stimulation of DNA MeTase mRNA by increasing levels of T antigen expression, as assessed by quantifying the hybridization signals obtained with a DNA MeTase probe or T antigen probe and normalizing these signals to the signal observed following hybridization to an 18 S ribosomal RNA probe. Our data show a good correlation between T antigen and DNA MeTase expression. The levels of DNA MeTase mRNA in four independentneo clones expressing the selection marker but not T antigen remain significantly lower than the levels observed in the high T antigen expressers (Fig. 1 A). These data exclude the possibility that the dramatic increase in DNA MeTase observed in T antigen transfectants is a consequence of clonal variability in expression of this gene. Two independent clones were chosen to discount the possibility of clonal artifacts; T antigen 10 (high level of T antigen and DNA MeTase expression) and T antigen 22 (medium level of T antigen and DNA MeTase expression) were used for further characterization. T ant 10 was arbitrarily chosen as a representative clone in a category of high T antigen expressers. T ant 22 was also arbitrarily chosen as a representative clone in a category of significantly lower T antigen expressers. The Western blot presented in Fig. 1 Bdemonstrates a significant increase in DNA MeTase protein in these T antigen transfectants that corresponds with the differences observed in T antigen expression. This increase in DNA MeTase protein results in a 5–15-fold increase in DNA maintenance methylation activity as determined using a hemimethylated DNA substrate and [3H]S-adenosylmethionine (18Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. Virology. 1968; 36: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The general level of methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the genome of the T antigen transfectants and the control cells was determined by a nearest neighbor analysis (10MacLeod A.R. Rouleau J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11327-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A there is a 1.5 (T ant 22)- to 2-fold (T ant 10) reduction in the population of nonmethylated CpG dinucleotides in T antigen-transfected cells, suggesting that increased DNA MeTase activity results in a detectable increase in genomic DNA methylation.Figure 2State of DNA methylation in T antigen transfectants. A, nearest neighbor analysis of methylation at CpG dinucleotides. DNA from 3T3 cells and the T antigen transfectant clones T ant 10 and 22 was subjected to nearest neighbor analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative abundance of nonmethylated and methylated cytosines was quantified (Scanalytics), and the results are plotted as the percentage of nonmethylated cytosines from the total population of cytosines residing in the dinucleotide sequence CpG. B, bisulfite mapping of the MyoD locus in T antigen and neo transfectants. DNA was extracted from T ant 10 transfectants (T ant 10) as well as 3T3 neo controls (NEO). The first line is a physical map of the MyoD genomic region (exons are indicated byfilled boxes, intronic sequence is indicated by aline). A blowup of the region amplified is shown under the physical map; the different CpG sites in the fragment are presented asovals. The percentage of methylated cytosines per site in the 16–18 clones analyzed per treatment were determined and are presented as different shadings of the circlesrepresenting each of the sites as indicated. Fully methylated sites (>75%) are represented as filled ovals, mainly methylated sites (50–75%) are indicated as ovals with acheckerboard pattern, partially methylated sites are indicated as shaded ovals, and nonmethylated sites (0–24%) are indicated as open ovals. Sites that were hypermethylated in T antigen transfectants are indicated by arrows. The numbering is according to GenBankTM accession numberM84918. The average methylation of all CpG sites in all sequenced clones for T antigen (T ant 10) and neo(NEO) transfectants is presented in the lower panel as the percentage of unmethylated cytosines. The difference between methylation status of the Myo D locus for T ant 10 andneo transfectants was determined to be statistically significant (t test, p < 0.05).C, bisulfite mapping of the dnmt 1 locus in T antigen and neo transfectants. DNA was extracted from T ant 10 transfectants (T ant 10) as well as neocontrols (NEO). The first line is a physical map of thednmt 1 genomic region residing upstream to the second exon (exons are indicated by filled boxes, intronic sequence is indicated by a line). Similarly to the MyoD region inB, a blowup of the region amplified is shown under the physical map, with the 7 CpG sites in the fragment presented asovals. The percentage of methylated cytosines per site in the 9–17 clones analyzed per treatment were determined and are presented as different shadings of the circles representing each of the sites as indicated as described above. The numbering is according to GenBankTM accession number M84387. The average methylation of all CpG sites in all sequenced clones for T antigen (T ant 10) and neo (NEO) transfectants is presented in the lower panel as the percentage of unmethylated cytosines. The difference between methylation status of the dnmt 1 locus for T ant 10 and neotransfectants was not determined to be statistically significant (t test, p = 0.14). D, representative bisulfite mapping sequencing films of T antigen (T Ant 10) and neo (NEO) clones at the MyoD anddnmt 1 loci. One representative sequencing film of bisulfite-treated DNA is presented per clone for each locus. Lollipops indicate the specific CpG sites by their position, shaded as described above. The numbering is according to GenBankTM accession number M84918for the MyoD locus and M84387 for the dnmt 1 locus. (Not shown in the films are the sixth and seventh CpG sites (sites number 290 and 303), which are demethylated in both T ant 10 andneo clones as indicated in the map). The DNA was subjected to bisulfite treatment as described in the methods. The genomic region bearing 18 CpG sites in the first exon of the MyoD gene and the genomic region bearing 7 CpG sites upstream to the second exon of thednmt 1 gene was amplified by PCR using the primers indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and sequenced. Unmethylated cytosines are converted to thymidines by this protocol, whereas methylated cytosines are protected and are visualized as cytosines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is hard to determine whether this hypermethylation indicates complete hypermethylation of a limited set of specific sites or whether it reflects a limited increase in the frequency of methylation of all sites. Comparing the state of methylation of specific sites in different transfectants is an arduous task because of the tendency of cells in culture to exhibit fluctuations in the state of methylation of CpG sites. A previous report has shown, however, that increased ectopic expression of DNA MeTase leads to hypermethylation of CpG islands (28Vertino P.M. Yen R.W. Gao J. Baylin S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4555-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We therefore studied by bisulfite mapping the state of methylation of the CG-rich region in the first exon of the MyoD gene (GenBankTM accession number M84918) in the higher expressing T antigen clone, T ant 10. CpG islands in general and MyoD in particular have been shown to undergo hypermethylation upon cellular transformation (29Jones P.A. Wolkowicz M.J. Rideout W.M. Gonzales F.A. Marziasz C.M. Coetzee G.A. Tapscott S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6117-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The bisulfite method enables one to look at a large number of copies of the studied gene, thus enabling a representative picture of the state of methylation of each specific site in the population of cells (27Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 2,B and D, the MyoD region analyzed in our study is hypermethylated in T antigen transfectants relative to neocontrols. Of the 18 CpG sites analyzed, a total of 9 sites were found to be hypermethylated in the T ant 10 stable line relative toneo controls (Fig. 2 B). When the results for all of the CpG sites in this region in all the sequenced clones (18 forneo, 16 for T ant 10) were pooled and averaged for comparative analysis, the average methylation of CpG sites was found to be 39% for neo transfectants and 71% for T ant 10 transfectants. In order to determine whether this genomic hypermethylation extends to CG sites not contained in CG-rich areas, we chose to map the region upstream to the second exon of the DNA Methyltransferase (dnmt 1) locus. As shown in Fig. 2,C and D, the methylation status of the dnmt 1 locus does not change substantially with T antigen overexpression. Of the seven CpG sites analyzed in this region, only one site (CpG 101) was shown to be partially hypermethylated in the T ant 10 stable line relative to the neo control line. Interestingly, another site (CpG 157) was actual"

They form proton-gated channels that are expressed in the central nervous system and in sensory neurons, where they are thought to play an important role in pain accompanying tissue acidosis. A splice variant of ASIC2, ASIC2b, is not active on its own but modifies the properties of ASIC3. In particular, whereas most members of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel/degenerin family are highly selective for Na+ over K+, ASIC3/ASIC2b heteromultimers show a nonselective component. Chimeras of the two splice variants allowed identification of a 9-amino acid region preceding the first transmembrane (TM) domain (pre-TM1) of ASIC2 that is involved in ion permeation and is critical for Na+ selectivity. Three amino acids in this region (Ile-19, Phe-20, and Thr-25) appear to be particularly important, because channels mutated at these residues discriminate poorly between Na+ and K+. In addition, the pH dependences of the activity of the F20S and T25K mutants are changed as compared with that of wild-type ASIC2. A corresponding ASIC3 mutant (T26K) also has modified Na+selectivity. Our results suggest that the pre-TM1 region of ASICs participates in the ion pore.

ASIC1, ASIC2, and ASIC3 (previously named ASIC (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), MDEG (2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and DRASIC (3Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), respectively) are located in the central nervous system (ASIC1 and ASIC2) or in sensory neurons (ASIC1 and ASIC3). They are activated by a drop in extracellular pH. It has been proposed that ASICs in sensory neurons mediate the pain accompanying tissue acidosis (3Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). ASIC2b (previously named MDEG2) is a splice variant of ASIC2 found in the brain and in sensory neurons (4Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). It does not form a pH-activated channel by itself but acts as a modulatory subunit when associated with other ASIC subunits such as ASIC3. The ASIC3 response to a drop in pH is biphasic, with both current components being carried mainly by Na+ (3Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Co-expressing ASIC3 with ASIC2b does not change the characteristics of the transient current, but the sustained current becomes nonselective (4Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The native proton-gated current in dorsal root ganglia also shows a transient Na+-selective component and a sustained nonselective component (5Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ASIC2b/ASIC3 association appears to be a good candidate for the H+-gated channel involved in pain sensation (4Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The ASIC2 and ASIC2b splice variants differ only in the first 185 N-terminal amino acids of ASIC2. Chimeric constructs of these splice variants led us to identify a region before the first transmembrane (TM1) domain of ASIC2 that controls the ion selectivity and the pH dependence of the channel. Point mutations in this particular region of the ASIC2 protein have led to identification of amino acids that play a key role in defining the biophysical properties of the channel. Corresponding mutations in ASIC3 induce similar changes in ion selectivity. These results indicate the important role of the region preceding the first transmembrane domain (pre-TM1) in the pore formation of ASICs. We used the previously described constructions of FaNaC in pRC/CMV vector (Invitrogen) (6Coscoy S. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8317-8322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and of ASIC2, ASIC2b, and ASIC3 in pCI vector (Promega) (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

For the generation of chimeras, two complementary primers containing the sequence of the desired junction between ASIC2 and ASIC2b were chosen. Two different PCRs were performed, one on the ASIC2 plasmid with a junction primer and a specific ASIC2 primer, and the other on the ASIC2b plasmid with the other junction primer and a specific ASIC2b primer. Fragments were purified with the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega). Both fragments were mixed with the specific primers, and another PCR was performed. The PCR product was digested and subcloned in ASIC2 or ASIC2b expression plasmids. The PCR was carried out using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim), and the subcloned fragments were sequenced. Five percent Me2SO or GC Melt (CLONTECH) was added for PCR on the GC-rich ASIC2b 5′ translated region. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR according to the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit protocol (Stratagene) or with a variation of the method used for chimeras. COS cells, at a density of 20,000 cells/35-mm diameter Petri dish, were co-transfected with expression vectors containing CD8 receptor cDNA and the PCI-ASIC vectors (a 1:5 ratio) using the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements 1–3 days after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were recognized by their ability to bind to CD8 antibody-coated beads (7Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Ion currents were recorded using either the whole cell or outside-out patch-clamp technique and stored on a hard disk for later off-line analysis. The pipette solution contained 120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mmHEPES/KOH (pH 7.2). The bath solution contained 140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3 (Na+-rich solution) or 145 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.3 (K+-rich solution). Changes in extracellular pH were induced by shifting one of six outlets of a microperfusion system in front of the cell or patch. Test solutions with a pH < 6 were buffered with 10 mm MES rather than HEPES but were identical to the control solution in all other respects. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (20 °C to 24 °C). The ASIC2 and ASIC2b splice variants are different in their first half, which includes the N-terminal region, the first transmembrane domain, and one-third of the extracellular loop. They are identical from amino acid 186 of ASIC2 onward (Fig.1 A). Replacement of the N-terminal intracellular region of ASIC2 (amino acids 1–42) with that of ASIC2b led to functional chimeras that displayed different properties compared with wild-type ASIC2 (Fig. 1, B andC, chimera C1). ASIC2 was selective for sodium over potassium (4Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 8Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), as confirmed by the current reversal potential of 32 ± 2 mV (n = 19; pNa+:pK+ = 9.8), which is close to the sodium equilibrium potential of 41 mV. Chimera C1 did not discriminate well between Na+ and K+ because the reversal potential (E rev) was 7 ± 1 mV (n = 6), corresponding to a pNa+:pK+ ratio of 1.5. Chimera C2, with a junction at amino acid 26 of the ASIC2 sequence, also had a lower selectivity for Na+ over K+ as compared with ASIC2 (E rev = 11 ± 3 mV; n= 4; pNa+:pK+ = 1.9). Chimera C3, with a junction at amino acid 17, was at least as selective for Na+ as the wild-type ASIC2 channel (E rev = 39 ± 2 mV;n = 5). The modification in ion selectivity observed with chimeras can thus be associated with a 9-amino acid region of ASIC2, from Ile-17 to Thr-25, located before the TM1. These nine amino acids were then systematically replaced in ASIC2 by those that are present in the ASIC2b sequence, and the reversal potential was determined for each mutant (TableI). Shifting the pH from pH 7.4 to pH 5 activated all mutant channels, with current amplitudes similar to that of wild-type ASIC2 (data not shown). Six mutants had reversal potentials that were significantly lower than that of ASIC2 (Table I). The largest changes in selectivity were observed for the I19P, F20S, and T25K mutants, with pNa+:pK+ values of 3.3 (n = 7), 1.7 (n = 5), and 1.4 (n = 8), respectively, whereas the pNa+:pK+ value calculated for wild-type ASIC2 was 9.8, as described previously (8Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A similar change in selectivity occurred when Thr-25 was mutated for an apolar Val or a negatively charged Asp residue instead of a Lys residue. The pNa+:pK+ ratio was 2.7 for T25D (n = 4) and 1.5 for T25V (n = 4) (TableI).Table INa+/K+ selectivity and inactivation time constants for ASIC2 mutantsAn alignment between the pre-TM1 regions of ASIC2 and ASIC2b is shown above the table.

Standard errors of the mean are shown. Asterisks indicate a significant difference from wild-type ASIC2, with p < 0.05, using an unpaired ttest. Open table in a new tab An alignment between the pre-TM1 regions of ASIC2 and ASIC2b is shown above the table. Motifs conserved among all NaC/DEG family members are framed. Each ASIC2 residue was mutated in its ASIC2b counterpart. Mutations causing the largest change in Na+/K+selectivity (I19P, F20S, and T25K) are indicated with a dot. Reversal potentials and time constants for inactivation were determined for each mutant. Standard errors of the mean are shown. Asterisks indicate a significant difference from wild-type ASIC2, with p < 0.05, using an unpaired ttest. The ASIC2a current inactivates exponentially and completely after a change in pH. The time constant for inactivation, which is 3.2 s for the wild-type, was also modified for some mutants. Mutants Q18R, N22S, and T25K had a time constant of inactivation that was twice as large as that for the wild-type (Table I). The two mutants that are particularly altered in their ion selectivity, F20S and T25K, were analyzed in more detail. Unlike ASIC2, unitary currents recorded from the T25K and F20S mutants were very noisy, so that single-channel properties could not be determined. Reversal potentials for outside-out patches (ASIC2-F20S, 8 ± 2 mV,n = 4; ASIC-T25K, 12 ± 2 mV, n = 4) were similar to these for the whole cell (Table I; Fig.2, A and B). When extracellular Na+ was replaced by K+, proton-gated currents elicited by a pH step from pH 7.3 to pH 5 were almost as large as in the presence of Na+ (Fig. 2,C and D). The currents recorded in the K+-rich extracellular solution reversed at −2 and 4 mV for the ASIC2-F20S and ASIC2-T25K mutants, respectively. The pH of half-maximal activation (pH0.5) of the F20S and T25K mutants was shifted to a more alkaline pH as compared with that of wild-type ASIC2. Whereas the pH0.5 value was 4.4 for wild-type ASIC2 and 4.7 for ASIC2-I19P, it was 5.7 and 5.4 for ASIC2-F20S and ASIC2-T25K, respectively (Fig.3). Mutations corresponding to ASIC2-I19P, F20S, and T25K were then introduced in other channels of the NaC/DEG family (Fig.4 A). This led to a loss of function for some of the mutants such as FaNaC-N51K, ASIC1-F21S, ASIC1-T26K, and ASIC3-F21S. However, two ASIC3 mutants, ASIC3-V20P and ASIC3-T26K, could still be activated by a drop in extracellular pH. ASIC3 normally displays biphasic kinetics with a rapidly inactivating current and a sustained current (3Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and both currents are carried essentially by Na+ (Ref. 3Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 C; reversal potential, 32 ± 3 mV (n = 5), pNa+:pK+ = 9.8). Both components of ASIC3-V20P were also selective for Na+. Their reversal potentials of 26 ± 2 mV (n = 6) correspond to a pNa+:pK+ ratio of 5.2 (Fig. 4 C). On the contrary, ASIC3-T26K, like ASIC2-T25K, displayed a reduced Na+/K+ selectivity. The reversal potential for both the transient current and the sustained current was 9 ± 3 mV (n = 7), corresponding to a pNa+:pK+ ratio of 1.7 (Fig. 4 C). Neither component of the ASIC3-T26K mutant showed a change in pH0.5 with respect to the wild-type (Fig.4 B). ASICs are a new class of cation channels activated by extracellular acidification. They belong to the NaC/DEG superfamily of ion channels (9Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).

Selective functional domains in control of the pore selectivity, the sensitivity to amiloride, and the gating properties have been identified for some members of the family (16Waldmann R.

The participation of the transmembrane domain TM2 and perhaps TM1 in the ion pore has not been directly demonstrated for ASICs but is well documented for ENaC (20Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and another ligand-gated channel, FaNaC (21Lingueglia E. Champigny G.

The region located just before TM2 has been shown to be important for gating and for the pharmacological properties of ASIC2. The ASIC2 mutations G430T, G430V, or G430F, which correspond to mutations leading to gain of function or neurodegeneration in C. elegansdegenerins (22Driscoll M. Chalfie M.

Participation of the pre-TM2 region in ion selectivity and conductance has also been established for ENaC (17Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18Fuller C.M. Awayda M.S. Arrate M.P. Bradford A.L. Morris R.G. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C641-C654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the pre-TM1 domain of ASICs. This region is highly conserved among NaC/DEG family members and is involved in the gating properties of the epithelial sodium channel. Mutations of a conserved glycine in the pre-TM1 domain of β-ENaC is associated with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (26Chang S.S. Grunder S. Hanukoglu A. Rosler A. Mathew P.M. Hanukoglu I. Schild L. Lu Y. Shimkets R.A. Nelson W.C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and leads to a reduction of ENaC activity. ENaC channels containing α-ENaC or β-ENaC subunits mutated at this glycine residue display a reduction in open probability, with no change in ion conductance and selectivity (27Grunder S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, a participation of this region in the ion permeation or the selectivity filter was never reported. Our results demonstrate an involvement of the pre-TM1 domain of ASIC2 in both the pH dependence and the ion pore properties. F20S and T25K mutations in ASIC2 change the pH dependence from a pH0.5 of 4.4 to 5.7 (F20S) and 5.4 (T25K). The pH dependence of ASICs is associated with several regions of the protein because mutations in the pre-TM2 position can also modify the pH0.5 value (8Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the modification of ASIC2 ion selectivity after mutations in the pre-TM1 domain. The I19P, F20S, and T25K mutations cause a 3- to 7-fold reduction in the Na+:K+ permeability ratio. The large changes in selectivity are not restricted to ASIC2 mutants because both the peak and sustained components of the ASIC3-T26K mutant show a 6-fold reduction in the Na+:K+ permeability ratio. This loss of ion selectivity is associated with the replacement of ASIC2 and ASIC3 pre-TM1 residues by amino acids present in ASIC2b. In sensory cells, ASIC2b associates with ASIC3 and then confers a nonselective character to its sustained component (4Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The pre-TM1 domain of ASIC2b may thus be one of the structural elements responsible for the loss of Na+ selectivity of this sustained component. The T26K mutation in ASIC3 changes the reversal potential of the peak and sustained currents in parallel, whereas co-expression of ASIC3 and ASIC2b influences the sustained current but not the peak current. This discrepancy between the properties of the heteromeric ASIC3/ASIC2b and the mutated ASIC3 T26K channel could be explained by the existence of two channel modes for ASIC3, one associated with the transient current, and one associated with the sustained current. The ASIC2b subunit would associate only with the conformation corresponding to the channel mode responsible for the sustained component and would modify its properties by changing its ionic selectivity. The T26K mutation introduced in ASIC3 would change the ion selectivity of both modes (transient and sustained currents) of the ASIC3 channel. This study suggests that the pre-TM1 domain contributes to the ion pore of ASICs and plays a crucial role in the selectivity filter, possibly as a re-entrant loop from the cytoplasmic side. The present data suggest a model for the ion pore of ASICs that involves the transmembrane domains (TM2 and perhaps TM1) and the pre-TM2 and pre-TM1 regions. This model could possibly be suitable for other members of the NaC/DEG family. We are very grateful to Drs. P. Barbry and R. Waldmann for helpful discussions; to N. Leroudier, V. Friend, and M. Jodar for excellent technical assistance; and to V. Briet for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1989260964,"Several recent studies have shown that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) is phosphorylated and activated by a protein kinase (CaMKK) that is itself subject to regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin. In the present study, we demonstrate that this enzyme cascade is regulated by cAMP-mediated activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In vitro, CaMKK is phosphorylated by PKA and this is associated with inhibition of enzyme activity. The major site of phosphorylation is threonine 108, although additional sites are phosphorylated with lower efficiency. In vitro, CaMKK is also phosphorylated by CaMKI at the same sites as PKA, suggesting that this regulatory phosphorylation might play a role as a negative-feedback mechanism. In intact PC12 cells, activation of PKA with forskolin resulted in a rapid inhibition of both CaMKK and CaMKI activity. In hippocampal slices CaMKK was phosphorylated under basal conditions, and activation of PKA led to an increase in phosphorylation. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping indicated that activation of PKA led to increased phosphorylation of multiple sites including threonine 108. These results indicate that in vitro and in intact cells the CaMKK/CaMKI cascade is subject to inhibition by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CaMKK. The phosphorylation and inhibition of CaMKK by PKA is likely to be involved in modulating the balance between cAMP- and Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways.

CaMKI was initially identified in brain, but subsequently the enzyme was found to have widespread tissue and cellular distribution (11Picciotto M.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. J. Biol.

More recently several cDNAs have been isolated that appear to be isoforms of CaMKI derived from distinct genes (13Yokokura H. Terada O. Naito Y. Hidaka H. Biochim. Biophys.

CaMKI was originally purified from brain based on its ability to phosphorylate the synaptic vesicle protein synapsin I at site 1 (14Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and physiological substrates for CaMKI include synapsin I and synapsin II (14Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol.

In vitro, CaMKI has also been found to phosphorylate cAMP response element-binding protein (16Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), and CF-2, a portion of the R-domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (17Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for CaMKI in the phosphorylation and regulation of the transcription factor, ATF-1, has also been suggested (18Sun P. Lou L. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Notably, for all of the well characterized substrates, CaMKI and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylate the same residue, although CaMKI phosphorylates only a subset of PKA substrates, indicating differences in the recognition of substrates by the two enzymes. CaMKI, myosin light chain kinase, CaMKII, and CaMKIV are activated upon binding of Ca2+/CaM to a COOH-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme, which in turn leads to removal of a short pseudosubstrate-like autoinhibitory region from the active site of the enzyme (7Soderling T.R.

In addition, several recent studies have indicated that in a manner analogous to the MAP kinases and cyclin-dependent protein kinases, CaMKI and CaMKIV activities are strongly dependent on phosphorylation by a highly specific CaMKI kinase (CaMKK) at an equivalent threonine (Thr177 in CaMKI) in the activation loops of both kinases (26Matsushita M.

Two isoforms of CaMKK have been identified that appear to recognize both CaMKI and CaMKIV (36Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), phosphorylated CaMKI remains fully dependent on Ca2+/CaM for activity. In contrast to CaMKI and CaMKIV, CaMKII, myosin light chain kinase, and phosphorylase kinase are not regulated by phosphorylation within the activation loop. The precise physiological consequences of linking two CaMKs as part of an enzyme cascade remains to be clarified. However, this is likely to contribute to amplification of the Ca2+ signal since CaMKK appears to be more sensitive to activation by Ca2+/CaM than CaMKI (26Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, by analogy to kinase cascades upstream of the MAP kinases, the CaMK cascade may serve to integrate information from other signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we report that both in vitro and in intact cells the CaMKK/CaMKI cascade is subject to inhibition by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CaMKK. The phosphorylation and inhibition of CaMKK by PKA suggests a novel mechanism to modulate the balance between cAMP- and Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. CaMKK is also phosphorylated by CaMKI, reflecting the overlapping substrate specificities of CaMKI and PKA, and suggesting the possibility of a classical negative feedback mechanism.

Forskolin (10 mm) and H89 (1 mm) were dissolved in Me2SO. Depolarization of intact cells was accomplished by raising extracellular K+ to 40 mm by addition of an appropriate volume of 150 mm KCl. Proteins (100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham). For the 125I-CaM overlay, nitrocellulose filters were incubated with a blocking buffer containing: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mm CaCl2. 125I-CaM (Amersham) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in the blocking buffer and the filter incubated for 30 min. The filter was then washed in the blocking buffer for 1 h, and then analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphorylation assays were carried out for different amounts time at 30 °C. The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 2–5 × 102 cpm/pmol). Reaction mixtures with CaMKK contained 1 μm CaM, 1.5 mm Ca2+, CaMKI wild type or mutants. The final concentrations of kinases in the reaction mixtures were as follows: PKA, 0.2–10 μg/ml; CaMKI, 10 μg/ml; CaMKK, 1–10 μg/ml. After 2 min of preincubation at 30 °C, reactions were initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP or nonradioactive ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (final concentrations, 1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mβ-mercaptoethanol). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide), gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography or analysis using a PhosphorImager. PC12 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysates were prepared as described previously (41Aletta J.M. Selbert M.A. Nairn A.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20930-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CaMKI and CaMKKα were immunoprecipitated with CC76 or CC135, respectively. Cultures were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (60 kallikrein inactivating units/ml), 100 nmokadaic acid, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were allowed to stand on ice for 10 min. After preclearing the lysates with 6 mg of protein A-Sepharose, 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated for 1 h with 1 μl of CC76, 10 μl of CC135 or nonimmune serum. Immune complexes were precipitated with 3 mg of protein A-Sepharose, washed twice with 1 ml of IP buffer, and then twice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Immune complexes were immediately resuspended in an assay mixture consisting of: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm CaM, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm[32P]ATP (100 cpm/pmol). For CaMKI activity, 50 μm synapsin site 1 peptide was used as substrate. For CaMKK activity, GST-CaMKI or GST-CaMKI-293 (10 μg/ml) were used as substrate. For CaMKI, the assay mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, at which time 20-μl aliquots were removed and 32P incorporation into synapsin site 1 peptide was quantified by adsorption of the peptide to phosphocellulose P81 papers and scintillation counting. For CaMKK, the assay mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and 32P incorporation into GST-CaMKI was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Assays were linear with time and protein concentration. A Mcllwain tissue chopper was used to prepare 400-μm thick slices from freshly dissected rat hippocampus. Dissection, cutting, and preincubation (for 30 min) were carried out in a modified Krebs-bicarbonate buffer (phosphate free) of the following composition: 124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 15 μmCaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, which was saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and adjusted to pH 7.4. At the end of the preincubation period, the buffer was removed and replaced with prelabeling buffer of the following composition: 124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 25 mmNaHCO3, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Slices were prelabeled for 60 min before application of drugs. All compounds were diluted in prelabeling buffer. Forskolin was dissolved in Me2SO, then diluted into prelabeling buffer resulting in a final concentration of 0.5% Me2SO in the slice medium. Incubations were stopped by rapidly removing the medium with a Pasteur pipette and immersing the tubes in liquid nitrogen. Slices were homogenized using IP buffer and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide), and gel pieces containing CaMKK were identified by alignment with the autradiogram and excised. After measuring 32P incorporation by scintillation counting (Cerenkov), gel pieces from triplicate samples were pooled and processed for two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Gel pieces containing 32P-labeled CaMKK were excised from dried SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed as described (14Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When incubated together, CaMKK-WT phosphorylated CaMKI-WT in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). A low but significant level of phosphorylation of CaMKK-WT was also observed in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, CaMKK-WT, when incubated alone, was not phosphorylated under any condition (Fig.1 B). This raised the possibility that the phosphorylation of CaMKK-WT was catalyzed by activated CaMKI-WT. To test this idea further, CaMKI-293, a constitutively active form of CaMKI, and CaMKI-299, an autoinhibited form of CaMKI (23Yokokura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23851-23859Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), were incubated with CaMKK-WT (Fig. 1 A). With CaMKI-293, phosphorylation of CaMKK-WT was observed in both the absence and presence of Ca2+/CaM. However, with CaMKI-299 no phosphorylation of CaMKK-WT or CaMKI-299 was detected. The failure to observe phosphorylation of CaMKI-299 was expected since CaMKI has to be in an active form to act as a substrate for CaMKK (26Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, the failure to observe phosphorylation of CaMKK when incubated alone or in the presence of CaMKI-299 indicated that active forms of CaMKI catalyzed phosphorylation of CaMKK. Notably, all substrates for CaMKI identified to date are also phosphorylated by PKA, and studies of phosphorylation of peptide analogs have indicated that the two enzymes display closely overlapping specificities (42Lee J.C. Kwon Y.-G. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6413-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 2T. Karasawa, A. C. Nairn, P. Huynh, C. Koenigsberger, C. Wiedemann, J. I. Elliott, A. J. Czernik, and M. R. Picciotto, submitted for publication. We reasoned therefore that PKA might also phosphorylate CaMKK and that the functional effects of any phosphorylation would be easier to analyze. To investigate this, CaMKK-WT, PKA, and Ca2+/CaM were incubated togther in various combinations. PKA phosphorylated CaMKK-WT in either the absence or presence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig.1 B). At short incubation times (<20–30 min) phosphorylation of CaMKK by either CaMKI or PKA was found to be predominantly on threonine although phosphorylation on serine was also observed (Fig. 2). At longer incubation times (>60 min), phosphorylation of serine increased (data not shown). In addition, two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping indicated that both CaMKI and PKA largely phosphorylated the same site(s) in CaMKK (Fig. 2). PKA was incubated with CaMKK for various times using either [32P]ATP (Fig.3 A), or non-radioactive ATP. In the latter case, at each time point PKA activity was terminated by addition of PKI fragment-(5–24), and the activity of CaMKK was measured in a second assay using CaMKI as substrate (Fig.3 B). As measured by 32P incorporation, phosphorylation of CaMKK proceeded in a time-dependent manner reaching a maximal stoichiometry of ∼1.8 mol/mol after 60 min (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). The phosphorylation was accompanied by inhibition of CaMKK activity (Fig. 3 B). No phosphorylation (data not shown) or inhibition of CaMKK was observed in the absence of PKA (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of CaMKK indicated the presence of three good consensus phosphorylation sites for PKA, at Ser74 (RKFSL), Thr108 (RRPTI), and Ser458 (RKRSF). Removal of the COOH terminus of CaMKK at amino acid 433 (CaMKK-433) did not affect significantly phosphorylation by PKA, or the inhibition of enzyme activity as measured by phosphorylation of CaMKI-WT (Fig.4 A). This suggested that Ser458 was not a major site of phosphorylation, and that phosphorylation did not contribute to inhibition of CaMKK activity, under the conditions used in this assay. Mutation of Thr108to alanine (T108A) resulted in a large decrease in phosphorylation by PKA (Fig. 4 B). Additional mutation of Ser74 to alanine (S74A) resulted in a further small reduction in phosphorylation. These results indicated that Thr108 was the major site of CaMKK phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. However, a low level of phosphorylation of Ser74 was likely. Moreover, a low level of phosphate was incorporated into CaMKK-108M-505, indicating that phosphorylation of residues in the catalytic or regulatory domain also occurred. Ser458 is present within the CaM-binding domain of CaMKK (26Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results illustrated in Figs. 1 and 4 Bindicated that under our assay conditions little phosphorylation of Ser458 occurs, and that the presence of Ca2+/CaM has no significant effect on phosphorylation of CaMKK by PKA. However, phosphorylation of CaMKK with a concentration of PKA 50-fold higher than that used in the normal assay reduced binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKK as measured by 125I-CaM overlay (Fig. 4 C). As a first step in the analysis of the regulation of CaMKK and CaMKI in intact cells, we characterized the tissue and cell distribution of CaMKKα using an antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide derived from the COOH terminus of the enzyme. In all brain regions examined, this antibody recognized a single band of ∼66 kDa (Fig.5 A). CaMKKα expression was highest in cortex and hippocampus, intermediate in striatum and nucleus accumbens, and low in cerebellum. Very low levels of CaMKKα were detected in non-neuronal tissues but only following longer exposure of the immunoblot (data not shown). In cell lines, CaMKK was also expressed at much lower levels than that found in brain tissue. However, measurable amounts were found in PC12 cells, with other cell lines expressing barely detectable amounts (Fig. 5 B). Based on these results, forebrain regions or PC12 cells appeared good preparations for further analysis. As shown in part in a previous study in PC12 cells (41Aletta J.M. Selbert M.A. Nairn A.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20930-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), membrane depolarization, but not treatment with NGF or PDBu, led to activation of CaMKI (Fig. 6). Membrane depolarization, NGF, and PDBu did not affect CaMKK activity. However, treatment with forskolin resulted in a decrease in both CaMKK and CaMKI activities to approximately the same magnitude. The forskolin-dependent inhibition of both CaMKK and CaMKI activities occurred rapidly, but transiently, reaching a peak within 5 min, after which both activities returned to an intermediate level (Fig.7). Pretreatment with H89, a relatively specific inhibitor of PKA, significantly attenuated the effect of forskolin on both CaMKK and CaMKI activities.Figure 7Time course of regulation of CaMKK and CaMKI by PKA in PC12 cells.

We have characterized the properties of a truncated, epitope-tagged construct containing part of the extracellular amino-terminal domain of mGluR4. The truncated receptor was secreted into the cell culture medium of transfected human embryonic kidney cells. The oligomeric structure of the soluble truncated receptor was assessed by gel electrophoresis. In the presence of high concentrations of a reducing agent, the truncated receptor migrated as a monomer; at lower concentrations of the reducing agent, only higher molecular weight oligomers were observed. Competition binding experiments using the radiolabeled agonist [3H]l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid revealed that the rank order of potency of metabotropic ligands at the truncated receptor was similar to that of the full-length membrane-bound receptor. However, the truncated receptor displayed higher affinities for agonists and lower affinities for antagonists compared with the full-length receptor. Deglycosylation produced a shift in the relative molecular weight of the soluble protein fromM r = 71,000 to M r = 63,000; deglycosylation had no effect on the binding of [3H]l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, indicating that the asparagine-linked carbohydrates are not necessary for agonist binding. These results demonstrate that although the primary determinants of ligand binding to mGluR4 are contained within the first 548 amino acids of the receptor, additional amino acids located downstream of this region may influence the affinity of ligands for the binding site.

The mGluR family of receptors has been divided into three subgroups based on sequence homology, signal transduction properties, and pharmacological profiles (1Pin J.-P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 2Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Group I mGluRs include mGluR1 and mGluR5 and are coupled to the stimulation of phosphoinositol turnover. Group II receptors include mGluR2 and mGluR3, and group III receptors include mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8. In cell lines, group II and III mGluRs couple to the inhibition of cAMP formation. The mGluRs are homologous with the calcium-sensing receptors, the GABAB receptors, and a class of mammalian pheromone receptors (2Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Within the family of mGluRs, the amino acid sequence identity among members of a subgroup is approximately 70%, whereas the homology between the different groups is about 45%. The basic structural domains of mGluRs include a large extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD), a hydrophobic region containing seven putative transmembrane domains, and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. A molecular model of the tertiary structure of the ATD of the mGluR1 subtype of mGluR has been formulated based on the sequence similarity between the mGluRs and the periplasmic-binding proteins in prokaryotes (3O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The periplasmic-binding proteins are a family of proteins that transport nutrients into bacteria. Within the family of bacterial proteins, the leucine, isoleucine, valine-binding protein is the most homologous with a region within the ATD of mGluRs. The leucine, isoleucine, valine-binding protein, like other periplasmic-binding proteins in bacteria, is a soluble protein that forms the recognition unit of a multimeric transport complex. In addition to the binding proteins, the bacterial transport complexes also include membrane-bound transport modules responsible for the translocation of amino acids and other nutrients across the membrane (see Ref. 4Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar for a review). Previous studies using site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric receptors have suggested that the ligand binding pockets of mGluRs are located in the ATDs (3O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 5Takahashi K. Tsuchida K.

Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 117-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether all of the determinants for ligand binding to mGluRs are contained within the ATD, or whether there are additional amino acids in other regions of receptor protein located extracellularly that may contribute directly or indirectly to ligand binding affinity in mGluRs. Recently, Okamotoet al. (7Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have shown that a construct containing the entire ATD of the mGluR1 receptor forms a soluble protein that retains the ability to bind the group I mGluR agonist [3H]quisqualic acid. In the present study, we demonstrate that a fragment of the ATD of mGluR4 forms a soluble protein that is secreted from cells. This truncated receptor retains the ability to bind the group III mGluR agonist [3H]L-AP4 and displays the basic pharmacological profile of the full-length receptor. However, the truncated receptor has a higher affinity for agonists and a lower affinity for antagonists compared to the membrane-bound receptor, indicating that additional structural determinants contribute to ligand binding affinity in mGluR4. For the expression of wild-type mGluR4a in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, theBglII-EcoRI fragment of rat mGluR4a cDNA in the pBluescript SK− phagemid (8Tanabe Y. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen Corp.) at the BamHI site. For the construction of c-myc-tagged mGluR4a, the mGluR4a-pcDNA3 plasmid was cut with XhoI, and the larger fragment containing the pcDNA3 backbone was ligated to itself (the 5′-mGluR4a-pcDNA3 plasmid). The oligonucleotides encoding the c-myc epitope s-BstEII-c-myc (5′-GTCACGAACAAAAGCTTATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTGGATCCAG) and rev-BstEII-c-myc (5′-GTGACCTGGATCCAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGCTTTTGTTC) were phosphorylated, annealed to each other, and inserted into the 5′-mGluR4a-pcDNA3 plasmid at the BstEII site to produce 5′-mGluR4a-c-myc-pcDNA3. The 931-bp NdeI-XhoI fragment from 5′-mGluR4a-c-myc-pcDNA3 and a 3335-bpXhoI-NotI fragment of mGluR4a-pcDNA3 were subcloned into pcDNA3 at the NdeI-NotI sites using a three-piece ligation to produce c-myc-mGluR4-pcDNA3. The construction of an expression vector containing a segment of the ATD of mGluR4 was made by digesting c-myc-mGluR4 with KpnI. The 1,686-bp KpnI fragment contained a sequence encoding the mGluR4 signal peptide, the c-myc epitope, and the amino-terminal domain of mGluR4 truncated immediately after Tyr-548 (numbering is based on the untagged rat receptor as indicated by Tanabe et al. (8Tanabe Y. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar)). The KpnI fragment from the c-myc mGluR4 construct was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. cDNA constructs were transformed into XL-1 blue competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were inoculated in 3 ml of Luria-Bertaini medium containing ampicillin and grown at 37 °C for 16 h; the cells were collected, and plasmid DNA was prepared using the QIAspin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). The DNA from the plasmid preparation was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis to check the orientation of the insert. The plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were grown in 100-mm plates to 80% confluence; 10 ml of fresh minimum essential medium containing 6% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Corp., Logan, UT) were added to the cells 3 h before transfection. For transfections, 20 μg of plasmid DNA were added to 450 ml of 1:10 TE buffer (pH 7.0), followed by the addition of 50 μl of 2.5m CaCl2. The reagents were mixed with 500 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline solution and added to HEK cells. The cells were incubated with the DNA at 37 °C for 4 h, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were exposed to 15% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, for 30 s and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline; fresh medium was subsequently added. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cell culture medium was replaced with OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each 100-mm plate of transfected cells was subcultured into two 100-mm plates containing 7 ml of OptiMEM. Forty-eight h after transfection, the culture media (the soluble fraction) and the cells (the total cell fraction) were collected separately. The cells were collected by centrifugation (1,380 ×g for 10 min), and the pellet was suspended in 20 ml of cold lysis buffer (30 mm HEPES, 1 mm ethylene glycol-bis-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, and 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron. The pellet was then centrifuged at 48,400 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer with 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.08% Triton X-100, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. An additional 12 ml of nonsupplemented lysis buffer were added, and the sample was centrifuged at 48,400 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged, resuspended in 1.0–2.0 ml of assay buffer (30 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2-6H2O, 5 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0), and then homogenized with a glass homogenizer. The homogenized samples were stored at −75 °C. For the processing of the proteins secreted into the medium, the cell culture medium was centrifuged at 48,400 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C in 800 ml of assay buffer containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm ethylene glycol-bis-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. The dialysis buffer was changed three times over a 24-h period; the samples were pooled and stored at −75 °C. The radioligand binding assay for the soluble truncated mGluR4 receptor was conducted in a total volume of 250 μl. [3H]l-AP4 (specific activity, 49 Ci/mol) was purchased from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, United Kingdom). Reagents were added in the following order: 25 μl of 10× competing drug or 25 μl of 3 mml-SOP (300 μm final concentration for blanks) or 25 μl of assay buffer (for total binding), 100 μl of assay buffer, 100 μl of the dialyzed sample containing 9 μg of total protein, and 25 μl of [3H]l-AP4 (final concentration, 30 nm, except for autocompetition experiments withl-AP4 in which 10 nm[3H]l-AP4 was used). Preliminary experiments in which different incubation times with the radioisotope were tested demonstrated that under these conditions, equilibrium had been reached after 40 min. Therefore, after a 40-min incubation on ice, 340 μg of γ-globulin were added to each tube, followed by the addition of 200 μl of 30% polyethylene glycol. The mixture was incubated on ice for an additional 3 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant fraction was aspirated. The pellet was washed with 500 μl of cold 15% polyethylene glycol and dissolved in 500 μl of 1 m NaOH. After 24 h, the samples were transferred to scintillation vials containing 4.5 ml of scintillation solution (Ultima Gold; Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). After a 2-h equilibration time, the samples were counted on a Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instruments). The assay for membrane-bound receptors was carried out as described by Eriksen and Thomsen (9Eriksen L. Thomsen C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3279-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Thomsen et al. (10Thomsen C. Pekhletski R. Haldeman B. Gilbert T.A. O'Hara P.J. Hampson D.R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except that 300 μml-SOP was used for blanks. The inhibition constants were obtained using Prism software from GraphPad, Inc. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) of [3H]l-AP4 binding to the membrane-bound and truncated mGluR4 receptors was calculated from the IC50values from autocompetition experiments using labeled and unlabeledl-AP4 and the equation IC50 =K D (1 + [P]/K p) where [P] is the concentration of the labeled probe ([3H]l-AP4, 10 nm), andK p is the K D of the labeled probe. Three μl of 10× G7 Buffer (New England BioLabs, Beverley, MA) and 1 μl of PNGase F (500,000 units/ml, New England BioLabs) were added to 26 μl of the dialyzed sample of soluble receptor. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, 4× SDS sample buffer and 100 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) were added, and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting. For control experiments, the samples were treated in the same way, except that the PNGase was omitted. For experiments on the effects of deglycosylation on the binding of [3H]l-AP4, the proportions of the reagents were scaled up accordingly. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was conducted on samples of the soluble and total cellular fractions. The samples were suspended in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (unless indicated otherwise) and separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (pore size, 0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) by transblotting at 225 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. The blots were incubated in washing buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20, pH 8.0) containing 5% powdered milk for 16 h, followed by three incubations with washing buffer for 5 min each. The blots were incubated with the anti-c-myc mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h, followed by three 5-min washes, and then incubated in anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Canada, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) for 2 h, followed by three 5-min washes. After an additional 30-min washing period, the membrane was soaked in ECL Western blotting detection reagents for 2 min and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). A truncated cDNA expression construct was produced that contained a sequence encoding the mGluR4 signal peptide, a c-myc epitope tag, and a portion of the amino-terminal domain of mGluR4 up to and including Tyr-548. The carboxyl terminus of the truncated protein was 39 amino acids upstream from first putative transmembrane domain (Fig.1). Previous experiments in our laboratory have shown that the insertion of the c-myc epitope at this position in mGluR4 does not alter the pharmacological properties of the full-length receptor (data not shown). The full-length c-myc-tagged mGluR4a or the truncated c-myc-tagged expression plasmids were transiently expressed in HEK cells, and aliquots of the cell culture media (the soluble fraction) and the transfected cells (the cellular fraction) were collected 48 h after transfection and examined by immunoblotting using an anti-c-myc antibody. Cells transfected with full-length c-myc-tagged mGluR4a expressed immunoreactive proteins (M r 93,000 andM r 109,000) that likely correspond to the unglycoslylated and glycosylated mGluR4a monomers. An additional higher molecular weight band at approximately M r224,000 was also observed; this protein is likely a dimer of mGluR4 (Fig. 2). The soluble fraction from cells transfected with the truncated mGluR4 construct contained a c-myc immunoreactive protein that migrated at M r71,000 (Fig. 2, lane 2). Samples of the soluble fraction collected from untransfected HEK cells contained low levels of a protein that cross-reacted with the c-myc antibody; this protein migrated at a slightly slower rate than the M r71,000 protein present in the soluble fraction from transfected cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). The effects of the reducing agent DTT on the truncated receptor were examined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. In the presence of high concentrations of DTT (1–100 mm), the receptor migrated as a monomer with a M r of 71,000 (Fig. 3). Lowering the concentration of DTT from 1 mm to 0.1 mmproduced an abrupt shift in the pattern of the immunoreactive bands; the band corresponding to the monomer disappeared, and two higher immunoreactive bands appeared. The lower molecular weight band migrated at M r 145,000, whereas the upper band migrated with an estimated M r of 202,000; these likely correspond to dimers and trimers of the truncated receptor. The pattern of bands observed in the presence of 0.01 mm DTT was identical to that seen with 0.1 mm DTT. These results indicate that oligomers of the truncated receptor are formed by intermolecular disulfide bonds. High affinity binding of l-AP4 and l-SOP are unique pharmacological features of group III mGluRs. No specific [3H]l-AP4 binding was detected in samples of the soluble fraction from untransfected HEK cells. However, in the soluble fraction of cells transfected with the truncated mGluR4, a high level of specific binding was consistently observed. Typically, 100 μl of the soluble preparation in a 250-μl assay yielded approximately 12,770 specific d.p.m.s (0.12 pmol) bound at 30 nm [3H]l-AP4, and specific binding represented 66 ± 3% of the total binding. The inhibitory potency of the agonists l-AP4, l-SOP,l-glutamate, and cyclobutylene AP5 and the group III mGluR antagonists MAP4, CPPG, and MPPG for the truncated soluble mGluR4 receptor were compared with the full-length membrane-bound receptor. The rank order of potency of the agonists at the soluble truncated receptor (l-AP4 > l-SOP >l-glutamate > cyclobutylene AP5) was identical to that of the full-length membrane-bound receptor. The affinities of all four agonists were higher for the truncated receptor compared with the full-length receptor. The affinity for the endogenous ligandl-glutamate at the truncated receptor was about 2-fold higher than that at the membrane-bound receptor (Fig.4; TableI). The rank order of the antagonists at the truncated receptor (MAP4 > MPPG > CPPG) was similar to that at the membrane-bound receptor (CPPG = MAP4 > MPPG) except for CPPG, which was the most potent of the three compounds for the full-length receptor but was the least potent at the soluble receptor (Table I; Fig. 4). In contrast to the agonists, the antagonists displayed lower affinities for the soluble truncated receptor compared with the membrane-bound receptor.Table IBinding constants for agonists and antagonists at the truncated and full-length mGluR4a receptorsKiTruncated mGluR4mGluR4a(μm)(μm)Agonistsl-AP40.12 ± 0.020.47 ± 0.05l-SOP0.23 ± 0.032.4 ± 0.5l-Glutamate2.2 ± 0.65.3 ± 0.5Cyclobutylene-AP53.2 ± 0.912 ± 2AntagonistsCPPG166 ± 2823 ± 3MAP442 ± 925 ± 2MPPG74 ± 2860 ± 12All values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent measurements.

The binding properties of the soluble truncated mGluR4 were also compared with the membrane-bound receptor using other glutamate receptor ligands including the nonselective mGluR agonist (1S,3R)-1-amino cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, the group I mGluR antagonist (R,S) α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, and the ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists kainic acid and N-methyl-d-aspartate (Fig. 5). Each drug was tested at a concentration of 100 μm. At the truncated receptor, kainic acid, N-methyl-d-aspartate, and (R,S) α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine produced less than 10% inhibition of [3H]l-AP4 binding; a similar low level of inhibition was observed with the membrane-bound receptor. The very low potency of (R,S) α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine for mGluR4 has also been reported for experiments on human mGluR4 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Flor P.J. Lukic S. Ruegg D. Leonhardt T. Knopfel T. Kuhn R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). (1S,3R)-1-Amino cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid showed a greater degree of inhibition at the truncated mGluR4 receptor (27% of control binding) compared with the full-length receptor (61% of control binding), indicating that as seen with the other agonists tested, (1S,3R)-1-amino cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid may be more potent at the truncated receptor. The relatively low potency of (1S,3R)-1-amino cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid compared with group III mGluR ligands such as l-AP4 and l-SOP is consistent with previous binding data from mGluR4 expressed in sf9 insect cells (10Thomsen C. Pekhletski R. Haldeman B. Gilbert T.A. O'Hara P.J. Hampson D.R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The soluble truncated receptor migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a M r of 71,000; this is approximatelyM r 8,000 larger than the predicted molecular weight based on the amino acid sequence, suggesting that the truncated receptor was glycosylated. Treatment of the soluble fraction containing the truncated mGluR4 receptor with PNGase F, which cleaves all asparagine-linked carbohydrates, shifted the immunoreactive band fromM r 71,000 to M r 63,000 (Fig. 6); the lower molecular weight estimate was very close to the predicted molecular mass of the nonglycosylated protein (62,700 daltons). The binding of [3H]l-AP4 to the deglycosylated receptor was also assessed. [3H]l-AP4 binding to samples treated with PNGase was 99% of control samples (average of two independent determinations) that were not treated with the enzyme, indicating that agonist binding to truncated mGluR4 is not dependent upon asparagine-linked carbohydrates. The truncated receptor analyzed in this study included the first 548 amino acids of the 912 amino acids of mGluR4a. The expression construct contained a part of the ATD that extended from the amino terminus to Tyr-548, which is located 39 amino acids upstream from the junction of the ATD and the first putative transmembrane domain. This portion of the ATD includes the entire leucine, isoleucine, valine-binding protein homology region. The expression construct incorporated a c-myc epitope tag inserted immediately downstream of the signal peptide. The truncated receptor was secreted into the cell culture medium, indicating that the protein did not possess regions of sufficient hydrophobicity to cause retention in the endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane of the cell and that it was soluble in an aqueous environment. The soluble truncated mGluR4 receptor exists as a monomer in the presence of high concentrations of a reducing reagent and as a dimer and trimer in the presence of low concentrations of reducing agents.

Analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of a truncated construct of mGluR5 indicated that the intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed between cysteine residues located in the ATD of mGluR5 (16Romano C.

Modulation of monomer and dimeric forms by reducing agents was also seen with the soluble truncated form of the mGluR1 receptor (7Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S.

Despite the studies outlined above providing evidence for dimers of mGluRs, no data exist demonstrating a direct link between the ability to bind ligands or activate signal transduction pathways and a particular oligomeric configuration of an mGluR. However, in the experiments described here, the [3H]l-AP4 radioligand binding assay was carried out in the absence of reducing agents, whereas the addition of reducing agents decreased binding activity in a concentration-dependent fashion. 2G. Han and D. R. Hampson, unpublished observation. It is likely that in the typical oxidation/reduction environment of the extracellular space in nerve tissue, mGluRs exist as oligomeric complexes. Although the oligomeric configurations of the mGluRs as they exist in nerve cells in vivo are not known, our observations on the amino-terminal domain of mGluR4 together with the results on mGluR1 and mGluR5 noted above all suggest that intermolecular disulfide bonds are a general structural feature of the mGluR family of receptors and that the active form of the receptor is likely to be a multimeric complex. The homologous calcium-sensing receptor is also present in tissues and transfected cells in a dimeric configuration (19Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Herbert C.S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The oligomeric structures of mGluRs may resemble the structures of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors. The insulin receptors exist as preformed disulfide-linked dimers, and unlike other tyrosine kinase receptors, monomer-to-dimer transitions are not modulated by the presence of ligand (20Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The truncated mGluR4 receptor contains four consensus sequences for asparagine-linked glycoslylation. The decrease in the molecular weight of the truncated protein by about M r 8,000 after complete deglycoslation indicates that one or more of these sites are glycosylated. An analysis of the effects of deglycosylation on the binding of [3H]l-AP4 to the soluble receptor demonstrated that the bound carbohydrate is not required for agonist binding. Similarly, asparagine-linked oligosaccharides also do not appear to be obligatory for the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (21Everts I. Villmann C. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although our data show that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are not required for ligand binding to mGluR4, it is possible that the bound carbohydrates may be important in the subcellular targeting of this receptor in the nervous system. In the case of mGluR4, the targeting is to presynaptic nerve terminals (18Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Risso Bradley S. Levey A.I. Hersch S.M. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2044-2056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where the receptor acts to inhibit glutamate release and thereby modulates synaptic transmission (15Pekhletski R. Gerlai R. Overstreet L. Huang X.-P. Agoypan N. Slater N.T. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Hampson D.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many G-protein-coupled receptors display biphasic binding curves indicative of the presence of high and low affinity binding sites. The commonly accepted explanation for high and low affinity binding sites is that they reflect receptors with bound and unbound G-protein, respectively. However, some G-protein-coupled receptors, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, show multiple states of affinity in the absence of G-proteins (23Perterson G.L. Herron G.S. Yamaki M. Fullerton D.S. Schimerlik M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4993-4997Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Conversely, other G-protein-coupled receptors such as the cloned mGluR4 receptor display only a single class of sites in radioligand binding assays (9Eriksen L. Thomsen C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3279-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Thomsen C. Pekhletski R. Haldeman B. Gilbert T.A. O'Hara P.J. Hampson D.R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); it is possible that lower affinity sites may exist in mGluR4 but cannot be detected in the binding assay because of the very low affinity. Alternatively, it is possible that the unitary nature of the binding site of the cloned membrane-bound mGluR4 receptor reflects only a low affinity site due to the absence of the appropriate G-proteins in the host cell lines (baby hamster kidney cells, Ref. 9Eriksen L. Thomsen C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3279-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; sf9 insect cells, Ref. 10Thomsen C. Pekhletski R. Haldeman B. Gilbert T.A. O'Hara P.J. Hampson D.R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; HEK-293 cells, the present study). However, we have observed that co-expression of full-length mGluR4 with various mammalian G-protein subunits including Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, and Go in insect sf9 cells does not significantly increase the affinity or the capacity (B max) of [ 3L. Blythe and D. R. Hampson, unpublished observation. H]l-AP4 for mGluR4.3 Moreover, [3H]l-AP4 binding experiments conducted in rat (25Hudtloff C. Thomsen C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and mouse (26Thomsen C. Hampson D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) brain have detected only a single class of sites with a K D value very similar to that seen with the cloned receptor. Thus, the binding site in the full-length receptor with an affinity for [3H]l-AP4 in the 400–500 nm range may represent the G-protein-coupled form of mGluR4. A pharmacological analysis of the truncated receptor was conducted by assessing the ability of various mGluR4 ligands to compete with the binding of the radiolabeled agonist [3H]l-AP4. Our results demonstrate that the binding properties displayed by the soluble truncated mGluR4 reflect the unique pharmacological profile of the group III mGluRs. Except for the antagonist CPPG, the rank order of potency for a series of group III mGluR ligands at the truncated receptor was the same as at the full-length membrane-bound receptor. Moreover, ligands at group I mGluRs or ionotropic glutamate receptors showed little or no affinity for either receptor. These observations suggest that the primary determinants of [3H]l-AP4 binding are conferred by residues present in the ATD of mGluR4. However, the inhibition constants for l-glutamate, l-AP4,l-SOP, and cyclobutylene AP5 were lower than those of the full-length receptor, indicating that the truncated soluble receptor displayed higher affinities for agonists compared with the membrane-bound receptor. The differences in affinity of the ligands could have been caused by differences in assay conditions for the soluble and membrane-bound receptors. However, if differences in assay conditions were responsible for the differences in the affinities, it is likely that the direction of change would have been the same for all ligands tested. This explanation seems unlikely because the affinity of the truncated receptor for antagonists was lower compared with the full-length receptor whereas the affinity for agonists was higher. An alternative explanation for the differences in affinity is that ligand affinity might be influenced by regions of mGluR4 that were excluded from the soluble construct that was examined in the present study; these regions include the transmembrane domains, the extracellular loops between the transmembrane domains, and the 40 amino acids immediately upstream from the first putative transmembrane domain. It is possible that the ATD may interact with one or more of these regions to induce an increase in affinity for antagonists and a decrease in affinity of the receptor for agonists. Whether or not ligand binding in other mGluRs is affected by regions outside the ATDs remains to determined. Although the pharmacological results reported by Okamoto et al. (7Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) on the binding of [3H]quisqualic acid to the soluble mGluR1 receptor are difficult to compare with ours because they did not report IC50 values for l-glutamate or other compounds that were assessed in the present study, it appears that the affinity for [3H]quisqualic acid for the soluble receptor was very similar to the affinity measured for the full-length receptor. One difference between the truncated mGluR1 receptor and the truncated mGluR4 receptor is that the former contained the entire ATD of mGluR1, whereas the latter did not include the 39 amino acids immediately upstream from the first putative transmembrane domain. Our results demonstrate that this part of the receptor is not required for high affinity binding of [3H]l-AP4 to mGluR4. This observation is consistent with mutational and chimeric studies conducted on mGluR1 that showed that several residues located in the more amino-terminal regions of the ATD of mGluR1 are required for ligand binding (3O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19341-19345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this 39-amino acid segment of mGluR4 may affect the affinity of ligands for the binding site. Of interest in this regard are studies on the receptor for the glycoprotein hormones luteinizing hormone and choriogonadotropin. The luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family and, like mGluRs, it has a large ATD that can be separated from the seven transmembrane domains and still retain ligand binding activity. Radioligand binding studies using I125-labeled human choriogonadotropin have shown that the exodomain (equivalent to the ATD) alone has a higher affinity for the glycoprotein hormone than the full-length receptor (27Xie Y.-B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C.-S. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A structural analysis of this receptor using site-directed mutagenesis has shown that several amino acids in the second extracellular loop within the transmembrane domain region affect the affinity of the ligand for the receptor; it was suggested that residues within this loop constrain the affinity of the hormone for the receptor (28Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C.-S. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences of the mGluRs are not homologous with the glycoprotein hormone receptors, our observations suggest that residues in the extracellular loops or residues located within or immediately upstream of the membrane domains may influence the affinity of ligands for the binding site located in the ATD of mGluR4.

https://openalex.org/W2036606278,"In search of possible epigenetic regulatory mechanisms ruling the initiation of O-glycosylation by polypeptide:N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, we studied the influences of mono- and disaccharide substituents of glycopeptide substrates on the site-specific in vitroaddition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues by recombinant GalNAc-Ts (rGalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3). The substrates were 20-mers (HGV20) or 21-mers (AHG21) of the MUC1 tandem repeat peptide carrying GalNAcα or Galβ1–3GalNAcα at different positions. The enzymatic products were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry and Edman degradation for the number and sites of incorporated GalNAc. Disaccharide placed on the first position of the diad Ser-16-Thr-17 prevents glycosylation of the second, whereas disaccharide on the second position of Ser-16-Thr-17 and Thr-5-Ser-6 does not prevent GalNAc addition to the first. Multiple disaccharide substituents suppress any further glycosylation at the remaining sites. Glycosylation of Ser-16 is negatively affected by glycosylation at position −6 (Thr-10) or −10 (Ser-6) and is inhibited by disaccharide at position −11 (Thr-5), suggesting the occurrence of glycosylation-induced effects on distant acceptor sites. Kinetic studies revealed the accelerated addition of GalNAc to Ser-16 adjacent to GalNAc-substituted Thr-17, demonstrating positive regulatory effects induced by glycosylation on the monosaccharide level. These antagonistic effects of mono- and disaccharides could underlie a postulated regulatory mechanism.

Kinetic studies revealed the accelerated addition of GalNAc to Ser-16 adjacent to GalNAc-substituted Thr-17, demonstrating positive regulatory effects induced by glycosylation on the monosaccharide level. These antagonistic effects of mono- and disaccharides could underlie a postulated regulatory mechanism.

Until now, the prediction of O-glycosylation sites was based on two different approaches: the analysis of in vitro or ofin vivo glycosylated peptides (4O'Connell B.C. Tabak L.A. Ramusubbu N. Biochem.

Strikingly, these two methodological strategies revealed deviating results when the patterns of GalNAc addition to MUC1 tandem repeat peptide were analyzed (7Stadie T.R.E. Chai W. Lawson A.M.

These differences could be explained by substrate specificities of the enzymes involved. On the other hand, the source of ppGalNAc-Ts used in the in vitrostudies and that of the in vivo processed MUC1 were the same. However, distinct enzyme species may have been lost during preparation or may not be active under the conditions used for in vitro glycosylation. It could also be assumed that there is a need for these enzymes to act spatially or temporally in specific subcellular compartments that are not retained in the in vitro system. Finally, a further explanation should be considered that assumes that initial glycosylation of a peptide substrate influences the subsequent glycosylation events at vicinal or distant Ser/Thr positions. There are two observations that would favor this concept: 1) although ppGalNAc-Ts have largely been localized to the cis-Golgi (10Roth J. Wang Y. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8935-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), there are reports demonstrating a more diffuse distribution of these enzymes throughout the Golgi system (11Röttger S. White T. Wandall H.H. Olivo J.C. Stark A. Bennett E.P. Whitehouse C. Berger E.G. Clausen H. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) the mucin core peptide can cycle between cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum (11Röttger S. White T. Wandall H.H. Olivo J.C. Stark A. Bennett E.P. Whitehouse C. Berger E.G. Clausen H. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GalNAc may be added successively to incompletely glycosylated substrates carrying short, core-type glycans. Positive or negative influences on the acceptor qualities of the remaining, still unglycosylated positions could be postulated to be exerted on the mono- or oligosaccharide level and could account for the partial unpredictability of the actual glycosylation sites. According to this concept, the site specificity of initial O-glycosylation would not merely be ruled by the peptide sequence around putative target sites. Evidence for negative effects on vicinal sites induced by mono- or disaccharide substituents has previously been reported for a series of glycopeptide substrates based on the MUC2 repeat peptide (12Brockhausen I. Toki D. Brockhausen J. Peters S. Bielefeldt T. Kleen A. Paulsen H. Meldal M. Hagen F. Tabak L.A. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another in vitro glycosylation study indicated that positive regulatory effects on vicinal sites could also be responsible for the accelerated GalNAc transfer (7Stadie T.R.E. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Byfield P.G.H. Hanisch F.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We followed this line of considerations by testing a panel of mono- and disaccharide substituted peptides corresponding to one MUC1 tandem repeat and carrying GalNAc or Galβ1–3GalNAc at single or multiple positions. The site-specific activities of three recombinant enzymes (rGalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3) were assayed and compared with those of the soluble enzymes shed into human milk (milk GalNAc-Ts). The products were separated and quantitated by reversed phase HPLC, identified by MALDI mass spectrometry and the “terminally” glycosylated peptides with a maximum number of incorporated GalNAc were sequenced by Edman degradation to localize the sites of glycosylation. We were able to demonstrate that negative vicinal effects on glycosylation are exerted on the disaccharide level and are site-restricted. On the monosaccharide level, positive effects could be proven to occurin vitro, resulting in greatly accelerated GalNAc transfer to a vicinal position. Finally, also distant effects on initialO-glycosylation were observed that suggest that glycosylation-induced conformational changes of the peptide substrate may influence the accessibility of particular acceptor sites for ppGalNAc-Ts. The glycopeptides listed in Table I were synthesized as described previously (13Karsten U. Diotel C. Klich G. Paulsen H. Goletz S. Müller S. Hanisch F.-G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2541-2549PubMed Google Scholar) and were analyzed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (400 MHz) (14Mathieux N. Paulsen H. Meldal M. Bock K. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1997; 1: 2359-2368Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and by MALDI mass spectrometry (15Goletz S. Thiede B. Hanisch F.-G. Schultz M. Peter-Katalinic J. Müller S. Seitz O. Karsten U. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 881-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The peptides A1 to A8 correspond to a 21-mer of the MUC1 tandem repeat domain starting with the AHG motif and carrying one to fourO-linked disaccharides Galβ1–3GalNAcα at various positions. Glycopeptides A11 and A13 carrying GalNAc in defined positions of a 20-mer (HGV20) or 21-mer (AHG21) were synthesized similarly (13Karsten U. Diotel C. Klich G. Paulsen H. Goletz S. Müller S.

Enzymes were partially purified from serum-free culture supernatant of transfected High-FiveTM (Invitrogen) cells as described previously (3Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Bennett E.P. Nielsen P.A. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23503-23514Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The ppGalNAc-transferases from human milk were enriched by ultracentrifugation as described previously and next mixed with an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, containing a series of protease inhibitors (7Stadie T.R.E. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Byfield P.G.H. Hanisch F.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The peptide or glycopeptide substrates (22 nmol, 430 μm) were dried from solutions in water in a speed vac and solubilized in 20 μl of imidazol-HCl (0.1 m), pH 7.2, containing MnCl2 (10 mm). Addition of the cosubstrate UDP-GalNAc (300 μm) was followed by the respective enzyme preparations (25 μl of rGalNAc-T1, 2.04 milliunits/ml; rGalNAc-T2, 4.04 milliunits/ml; rGalNAc-T3, 4.65 milliunits/ml; milk GalNAc-Ts, 1.85 milliunits/ml; specific activity measured for TAP25 as a substrate) to yield a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated for varying time periods at 37 °C (maximum, 7 days) by adding fresh aliquots of cosubstrate and enzyme(s) at 24-h intervals. The samples were diluted with incubation buffer to give a total volume of 210 μl prior to ultrafiltration through ultrafree MC membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) with a nominal cut-off of 10 kDa. Kinetic parameters were calculated by double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk transformations at four substrate concentrations using assay conditions described by Brockhausen et al. (12Brockhausen I. Toki D. Brockhausen J. Peters S. Bielefeldt T. Kleen A. Paulsen H. Meldal M. Hagen F. Tabak L.A. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Aliquots (50–100 μl) of the reaction mixtures were injected onto a PLRP-S column (250 × 4.6 mm, Polymer Laboratories, Shropshire, United Kingdom) or a narrow-bore ODS Ultrasphere column (150 × 2 mm, Beckman Instruments, Munich, Germany) and chromatographed on an HPLC system (System Gold Beckman Instruments, Munich, Germany) by gradient elution in a mixture of acetonitrile in water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) from 2% (solvent A) to 80% (solvent B) (duration, 80 min). Alternatively, gradient elution was performed starting from 0% solvent B to 6% solvent B (duration, 3 min), followed by a gradient from 6% solvent B to 16% solvent B (duration, 30 min). The glycopeptides were run at 1 ml/min and detected photometrically at 214 nm. The HPLC-purified glycopeptides were dried in a speed vac and dissolved in a mixture of water and methanol (1:1, v/v) to yield concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml. 2,6-Dihydroxyacetophenon (concentration, 10 g/liter in 50% aqueous methanol) as a MALDI matrix was co-crystallized with the analyte in a dried droplet preparation. MALDI-time-of-flight experiments were performed on a VISION 2000 prototype mass spectrometer with a 2.3 m flight tube. N2 laser at 337 nm was used. Measurements were carried out in linear mode using appropriate delay time and potential to focus the ions of interest. Glycopeptides were sequenced on a Hewlett-Packard G1000A protein sequencer with 3.1 (solid) chemistry that uses methanol rather than ethyl acetate to transfer the ATZ-amino acid (16Zachara N.E. Gooley A.A. Corfield T. Mucin Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar). The Sequelon AATM membranes were from the Perseptive Biosystems division of Perkin-Elmer. Quantitation of theO-glycosidic serine/threonine substitution was calculated using a glycopeptide derived from Dictyostelium discoideumrecombinant expressed glycoprotein PsA, which contains a 100% substituted GlcNAcα-Thr in position 4. The corrected yield for this cycle (repetitive yield for the glycopeptide ITATPAPT) was 95%. The retention time of GlcNAcα-Thr was almost identical to the corresponding GalNAc derivative on reversed phase HPLC. The glycopeptide substrates A1–A8, A11, and A13 (TableI) were incubated with the single or combined recombinant enzymes (or with the GalNAc-Ts from milk) for at least 72 h or up to 7 days in order to identify the sites and to measure the maximal number of GalNAc residues added to the Thr/Ser positions of the MUC1 repeat peptide. In all cases, glycopeptide products with the maximal number of glycosylated sites were formed within 3 days and called terminally glycosylated products. These glycopeptides were separated from substrate or intermediate products by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 1) and were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry (TableII). Between one and three GalNAc residues were transferred depending on the glycopeptide substrate (Table II). This was calculated on the basis of pseudomolecular ions MH+ and the mass increment of HexNAc (203.2 mass units). Edman sequencing showed that only positions Thr-5, Ser-16, and Thr-17 could be glycosylated in vitro, and it was independent from the glycopeptide substrate (Tables II andIII). Accordingly, the “isolated” Thr within PDTR and Ser within VTSA do not represent target sites in vitro for the enzymes tested in the present study as was previously shown for the unglycosylated control peptide TAP25 (7Stadie T.R.E. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Byfield P.G.H. Hanisch F.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The only exception from this general pattern was A11, which after glycosylation over a period of 7 days showed the incorporation of trace amounts of GalNAc into the positions Ser-6/Thr-10 (pseudomolecular ion measured at m/z 2741.5). The terminally glycosylated final products of glycopeptides A6, A7, and A8 carrying more than one disaccharide did not reveal detectable GalNAc incorporation (Table II). The qualitative data of the site specificity of terminal glycosylation agreed for the enzyme preparation from human milk and the combined recombinant GalNAc-Ts (T1–T3).Table IINumber of GalNAc residues introduced into glycopeptide substrates after 72 h of reaction timePeptideNumber of GalNAc residues introducedExpectedaMaximum numbers of GalNAc residues expected to be incorporated into MUC1 repeat peptide on the basis of previous in vitro glycosylation studies with TAP25 (7).HPLCMALDI mass spectrometryEdmanA12111A23333A32222A43333A5bTwo products were identified due to a heterogeneity of the peptide substrate A5 (Table 1).21 (2Bennett E.P.

ND, not determined. The glycopeptides (A1–A8, A11, and A13) and the nonglycosylated control peptide TAP25 were analyzed for the sites of glycosylation after in vitro transfer of the maximal number of GalNAc residues (Table III). On the basis of these qualitative data, several site-specific effects of substrate glycosylation on vicinal, proximal, and distant target sites were revealed. The terminally glycosylated product of glycopeptide A1 did not carry GalNAc at Ser-16 (Table III). By contrast, the nonglycosylated control peptide TAP25 and the glycopeptide substrates, including glycopeptide A4, were glycosylated at this position. This finding indicates that a disaccharide substituted at Thr-5 can negatively affect a distant target site with respect to its acceptor qualities. The long range effect, which is exerted over a peptide stretch of 11 amino acids, is site-specific, because a disaccharide substitution at the adjacent Ser-6 (glycopeptide A4) had no influence on Ser-16 glycosylation (Table III). Exertion of the distance effect is also strikingly dependent on the glycan substituted at Thr-5,i.e. glycopeptide A11 with GalNAc at Thr-5 exhibited Ser-16 glycosylation. Results obtained for another group of glycopeptide substrates demonstrated that besides long range effects disaccharide substituents can also exert negative effects on vicinal target sites. In glycopeptide A5 (Table I), the disaccharide at Ser-16 is located adjacent to the acceptor position Thr-17 and may exert a negative influence, possibly mediated by steric hindrance, on the binding of ppGalNAc-transferases and hence prevents glycosylation of Thr-17 (Table III). A sequence variant of A5, glycopeptide A5b (TableI), with an additional Thr in position 18 was found to be glycosylated at this site (Table III). It can, therefore, be argued that the negative influence of the disaccharide in Ser-16 is solely exerted vicinal and not proximal. The relatively low amount of this minor glycopeptide (below 20%) renders unlikely substrate competition as an explanation for nonglycosylation of A5, the major glycopeptide in the substrate mixture. Interestingly, a similar negative effect with complete inhibition of vicinal glycosylation was not observed for GalNAc addition to Ser-16 in the substrates A3 (disaccharide at Thr-17) and A4 (disaccharide at Ser-6) (Table III). It may be suggested, accordingly, that disaccharides placed on the first position of an ST diad (here, Ser-16) could prevent the glycosylation of the second position, whereas disaccharide on the second position of ST or TS diads (here, Thr-17 or Ser-6) may not necessarily inhibit addition to the first. Ser-16 glycosylation was not affected by disaccharide substitution at the proximal position −6 in glycopeptide substrate A2 (Table III). The same holds true for glycopeptide A13 exhibiting monosaccharide substitution of Thr-10 (Table III). Although the pattern of site-specific GalNAc addition on glycopeptides A2 and A13 agrees with that on the nonglycosylated control peptide TAP25, the rate of Ser-16 glycosylation in A2 and A13 was found to be affected negatively by glycans at Thr-10 (see kinetic analyses and Fig.2). Remarkably, substrate peptides substituted with more than one disaccharide (A6, A7, and A8) could not serve as acceptors for rGalNAc-Ts or milk GalNAc-Ts at any of the remaining possible positions (Table III). With respect to positions Ser-6 and Thr-10, which are not in vitro target sites for rGalNAc-T1 to -T3 or milk GalNAc-Ts, this finding excludes the possible existence of positive regulatory mechanisms mediated by core1-disaccharides. On the other hand, the negative effect on Ser-16 glycosylation in A6 induced by disaccharide substitution at Thr-5 and Thr-17 is solely exerted on the disaccharide level, because the structural analogue of the glycopeptide, the monosaccharide substituted glycopeptide A11, was a substrate of ppGalNAc-Ts (Table III). Most likely, the prevention of Ser-16 glycosylation in A6 is caused by disaccharide substitution of Thr-5 and is exerted in the same way as the negative long range effect on Ser-16 glycosylation in glycopeptide A1. It should be recalled at this point that vicinal substitution with disaccharide at Thr-17 did not suppress Ser-16 glycosylation in A3 (Table III). The rates of GalNAc incorporation into the three actual in vitro glycosylation sites of MUC1 repeat peptide (Thr-5, Ser-16, and Thr-17) were different for each position and ppGalNAc-T used. Kinetic studies were performed by quantitative HPLC/Edman sequencing and by radiometric measurement of [14C]GalNAc incorporation to determine the apparent kinetic constants. This approach allowed the identification and quantitation of each intermediate or final glycopeptide product. It was also possible to assign for some of the glycopeptide substrates apparent K m and V max values to distinct glycosylated sites. The ppGalNAc-Ts from milk glycosylated Thr-5 at higher rates than Thr-17 or Ser-16. This is evidenced from previous HPLC/Edman analysis of TAP25 products (7Stadie T.R.E. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Byfield P.G.H. Hanisch F.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but also from the apparent kinetic constants (Table III) obtained for glycopeptide substrates A1 (glycosylation of Thr-17; see also Fig.2 C), A3 (mainly glycosylation of Thr-5; see also Fig. 2,A and C), and A5 (glycosylation of Thr-5). The lowest relative reaction rates were measured for the Ser-16 position, which made glycosylation of this site the rate-limiting step in the glycosylation of peptides A2, A3, A4, A13, and TAP25 (Fig. 2,A and B). Accordingly, no Ser-16 glycosylation was generally found in HPLC fractions corresponding to intermediate products. The same relative rates of GalNAc incorporation into the three positions were found when using the recombinant enzymes in a mixture. The single rGalNAc-T species exhibited distinct preferences for the in vitro glycosylation sites within the VTSA and GSTA motifs, respectively (Tables IV andV). As demonstrated previously for rGalNAc-T1 and -T3 (1Sorensen T. White T. Wandall H.H. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24166-24173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the best substrates for these enzymes are characterized by a nonglycosylated Thr-5 (compare A3 to A1 in TableIV), whereas rGalNAc-T2 prefers the nonglycosylated GSTA motif (compare A1 to A3 and A5 in Table IV). rGalNAc-T2 is the enzyme species that adds GalNAc most efficiently to Ser-16 (glycosylation of A11). This is also evident from HPLC analysis of the final product of A3 glycosylation (Table V). Whereas the formation of A3(Thr-5, Ser-16)-GalNAc2 catalyzed by the rGalNAc-T1 and rGalNAc-T3 did not exceed 7% of the total glycopeptides (substrate and products) after reaction times of 72 h, the same product represented 28% of total glycopeptide using rGalNAc-T2 (Table V).Table IVGlycosylation-induced effects on the activities of rGalNAc-T1 to -T3 as revealed by the apparent kinetic constants for glycopeptide substratesSubstrate (preferential target site)Enzyme GalNAc-Tpmol h−1K MV maxmmnmol h−1A1 (Thr-17)T164NDNDT216961.44.00T3109NDNDA3 (Thr-5)T14320.40.63T22032.50.63T313170.31.82A11 (Ser-16)T1<50NDNDT21280.50.19T3<50NDNDA2 (Thr-17)T216820.73.03A4 (Thr-17)T26010.20.85A5 (Thr-5)T23092.01.00The reaction conditions were identical to those given in Table 3 except for the replacement of milk enzymes by the individual rGalNAc-Ts. In case of substrates A1, A5, and A11, where only one GalNAc is added to a defined peptide position, the apparent kinetic constants correspond to the individual site constants: Thr-17 (A1), Thr-5 (A5), and Ser-16 (A11). Considering the neglegible rates of Ser-16 glycosylation, an estimation of the individual site constants for GalNAc addition to Thr-5 (A3) is possible.

MMP activities are controlled by four homologous endogenous protein inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), yet different TIMPs show little specificity for individual MMPs.

The N-terminal domains of different TIMPs fold into a correct native structure which carries the inhibitory activity against MMPs (9Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.O.-A. Shea M.

Although correctly folded and functional C-terminal domains have not been described, truncation experiments indicate that this region is responsible for the interactions of TIMPs with pro-MMPs (12Murphy G.

There is little specificity in the inhibitory actions of TIMPs on metalloproteinases, with the exception of the ability of TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 to inhibit membrane-type metalloproteinases-1 and -2, whereas TIMP-1 is a poor inhibitor of these enzymes (12Murphy G.

For example, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 form specific complexes with pro-MMP-2 (progelatinase A), whereas TIMP-1 can bind to pro-MMP-9. In addition to their activities as MMP inhibitors and in binding to pro-MMPs, TIMPs promote the growth of various types of cells in tissue culture (15Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Tanzawa K. Uchijima E. Iwata K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 16Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shimagawa A. J.

Opthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). However, the structural basis of these activities is unknown.Crystallographic structures have been recently reported for a complex of TIMP-1 with the catalytic domain of stromelysin-1, MMP-3ΔC (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), and a complex of TIMP-2 with the catalytic domain of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (19Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Together with a solution NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of TIMP-2, N-TIMP-2 (20Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Feeney J. Freedman R.B. Carr M.D. Williamson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21736-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), these reveal that the inhibitory domain of TIMP consists of a 5-stranded β-barrel with three associated α-helices, resembling the folds of members of the OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) protein family (22Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The TIMP-1·MMP-3 structure reveals that the principle interactions between TIMP and the metalloproteinase involve the N-terminal pentapeptide and part of the loop between β-strands C and D; other interactions are through the A-B loop and some residues in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 A). Three quarters of all contacts are by residues adjacent to the disulfide bond between Cys1 and Cys70, specifically residues 1–5 and 66–70 (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Cys1 is a key to the inhibitory strategy of TIMP because it sits on top of the catalytic Zn2+ of the metalloproteinase and coordinates the metal ion through the α-amino group and peptide carbonyl group (Fig. 1 B). Similar contacts are seen in the TIMP-2·MT1-MMP complex, although there are differences in the relative orientations of the two proteins and in the extensiveness of interactions involving other parts of the structure (19Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).The reactive site of TIMP revealed by this structure is consistent with the results of a study which showed that TIMP-1 activity is lost when the Val69-Cys70 peptide bond is cleaved by human neutrophil elastase, but that this cleavage is prevented by complex formation between TIMP-1 and MMP-3 (23Nagase H. Suzuki K. Cawston T.E. Brew K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previous mutational studies of N-TIMP-1 also show that substitutions at a number of sites between residues 18 and 45 have small effects on the affinity for MMP-3, whereas mutations that disrupt the Cys1 to Cys70 disulfide and substitutions for Thr2, Met66, or Val69 had large effects on activity (24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Most significantly, whereas other substitutions that perturb N-TIMP-1 activity have approximately equal effects on binding to MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3, the substitution of Ala for Thr2 produces a 17-fold greater loss in binding to MMP-1 relative to MMP-3 (24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This is in accord with the crystallographic structures which indicate that Thr2 of TIMP-1 and Ser2 of TIMP-2 interact with the region of the metalloproteinases that correspond to the binding site for the P1′ residue of peptide substrates, the residue that has a dominant role in MMP specificity (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 19Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).As part of a study of the structural basis of TIMP-1 specificity and as a step toward generating variants that are more selective as MMP inhibitors, we have characterized fifteen N-TIMP-1 mutants with substitutions for Thr2. The results show that this residue has a major influence on the specificity of TIMP for different metalloproteinases but also show that there is little correlation between the effect of an amino acid at position 2 in TIMP-1 and the same residue at the P1′ site of a peptide substrate on their respective activities with an MMP as inhibitor or substrate. The structural basis of these observations is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe present results suggest that protein engineering of TIMP is a viable approach for generating more specific protein inhibitors of MMPs for studies of the biological roles of different MMPs and to facilitate the development of therapeutic agents for diseases linked with excess activity of specific MMPs. The development of specifically targeted high affinity variants will require substitutions at multiple sites but the inhibitory properties of the Met66 and Val69 mutants and full-length TIMP-1 (11Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) indicate that residue 2 has a much greater influence on specificity than other components of the reactive site (see Fig. 3). The effects of systematic substitutions for Thr2 provide information about the determinants of MMP binding by N-TIMP-1 and also some TIMP variants with enhanced specificity. Table II shows that the best inhibitors for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3, based on affinity and selectivity, have different substitutions at position 2: valine, leucine, or serine, respectively. The substitution of Gly for Thr2 produces a protein that is essentially inactive as an inhibitor at concentrations below 100 nm yet retains a native structure as indicated by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Although the isolated C-domain of TIMP may not be capable of folding, the Gly2 substitution in full-length TIMP-1 will generate a protein that can be used to investigate the interactions of the C-terminal domain in a molecule that has little affinity for a metalloproteinase active site and to determine whether the protease-inhibitory action of TIMP is connected with other functions such as cell growth stimulation and anti-angiogenic activity (15Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Tanzawa K. Uchijima E. Iwata K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 16Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shimagawa A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Anand-Apte B. Pepper M.S. Voest E. Montesano K. Olsen B. Murphy G. Apte S. Zetter B. Invest. Opthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar).Some properties of the side chain of residue 2 correlate with the affinity for different MMPs but, at present, there is insufficient information to explain the structural basis of the effects of mutations on activity. In the TIMP-1·MMP-3 crystal structure, the N-terminal region of MMP-3 has a different structure from that in free MMP-3 (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Based on the NMR structure of N-TIMP-2, it appears possible that conformational changes in TIMP may also occur during complex formation (21Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Feeney J. Freedman R.B. Carr M.D. Williamson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21736-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consequently, mutations in the reactive site could affect the interaction with MMPs through effects on local dynamics (as well as structure). Binding to different MMPs may also be affected differentially by regions distant from the Cys1-Cys70 disulfide bond. The higher affinity of MMP-3 for the Gly2 mutant suggests that interactions outside of the S1′ pocket contribute more of the binding energy for the interaction with MMP-3 than with the other MMPs.The structure of the S1′ pocket of MMP-1 is narrower and less deep than those of other MMPs. Arginine 195, which replaces leucine in MMP-2 and MMP-3, projects into the S1′ pocket toward the catalytic Zn2+, resulting in a less deep more cationic pocket (31Stams T. Spurlino J.C. Smith D.L. Wahl R.C. Ho T.F. Qoronfleh M.W. Banks T.M. Rubin B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The reduced depth may account for the preference of MMP-1 for valine and threonine over leucine, for example, and charge repulsion is also a likely factor in the unfavorable binding of positively charged substituents to MMP-1. The specificity pocket of an MMP with no bound substrate or inhibitor will be expected to contain multiple solvent molecules so that the binding of TIMP mutants will be affected by the ability of the residue 2 side chain to interact with or displace solvent molecules.Large areas of molecular surface become buried in the formation of high affinity heterologous protein-protein complexes (32Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that approximately 1300 Å2 of the accessible surface of each component is buried on formation of the TIMP-1·MMP-3 complex (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 accounts for few of these contacts and less than 10% of the free energy of interaction (11Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The present results show that a single residue of the reactive site of N-TIMP-1, Thr2, exerts a large influence on the strength and specificity of binding to MMPs. The magnitude of this effect is surprising because, even if the environment of Thr2 changed from being totally exposed to 100% buried on complex formation with the protease, it accounts for less than 8% (102/1300 Å (2Nagase H. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteinases in Health and Disease. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996: 153-204Google Scholar) of the area of the protein−protein interaction site (33Miller S. Janin J. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The loss of 33–55% of the free energy of binding on removal of the Thr2 side chain by the substitution of glycine indicates that residue 2 of TIMP-1 could be designated a “hot spot” in the TIMP/MMP interaction interface, a residue that has a uniquely large influence on the strength of the protein-protein interaction (34Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 35Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Many other residues form contacts with MMP-3 in the crystal structure (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), but mutagenesis of others, particularly Met66 and Val69, and the removal of all C-domain contacts in N-TIMP-1 indicates that these residues are less important for binding than Thr2 (24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, the present results show that the nature of the contacts in the structure of the TIMP-1·MMP-3 complex are an important step toward understanding the structural basis of the inhibitory strategy and specificity in TIMP, but it is important to experimentally evaluate their contributions to the stability of the complex. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 are a family of about twenty Zn2+-dependent endopeptidases that have important roles in connective tissue turnover during physiological processes including development, morphogenesis, and wound healing (1Woessner Jr., J.F.

Together with a solution NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of TIMP-2, N-TIMP-2 (20Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Feeney J. Freedman R.B. Carr M.D. Williamson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21736-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), these reveal that the inhibitory domain of TIMP consists of a 5-stranded β-barrel with three associated α-helices, resembling the folds of members of the OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) protein family (22Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The TIMP-1·MMP-3 structure reveals that the principle interactions between TIMP and the metalloproteinase involve the N-terminal pentapeptide and part of the loop between β-strands C and D; other interactions are through the A-B loop and some residues in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 A). Three quarters of all contacts are by residues adjacent to the disulfide bond between Cys1 and Cys70, specifically residues 1–5 and 66–70 (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Cys1 is a key to the inhibitory strategy of TIMP because it sits on top of the catalytic Zn2+ of the metalloproteinase and coordinates the metal ion through the α-amino group and peptide carbonyl group (Fig. 1 B). Similar contacts are seen in the TIMP-2·MT1-MMP complex, although there are differences in the relative orientations of the two proteins and in the extensiveness of interactions involving other parts of the structure (19Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The reactive site of TIMP revealed by this structure is consistent with the results of a study which showed that TIMP-1 activity is lost when the Val69-Cys70 peptide bond is cleaved by human neutrophil elastase, but that this cleavage is prevented by complex formation between TIMP-1 and MMP-3 (23Nagase H. Suzuki K. Cawston T.E. Brew K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previous mutational studies of N-TIMP-1 also show that substitutions at a number of sites between residues 18 and 45 have small effects on the affinity for MMP-3, whereas mutations that disrupt the Cys1 to Cys70 disulfide and substitutions for Thr2, Met66, or Val69 had large effects on activity (24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Most significantly, whereas other substitutions that perturb N-TIMP-1 activity have approximately equal effects on binding to MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3, the substitution of Ala for Thr2 produces a 17-fold greater loss in binding to MMP-1 relative to MMP-3 (24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This is in accord with the crystallographic structures which indicate that Thr2 of TIMP-1 and Ser2 of TIMP-2 interact with the region of the metalloproteinases that correspond to the binding site for the P1′ residue of peptide substrates, the residue that has a dominant role in MMP specificity (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 19Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As part of a study of the structural basis of TIMP-1 specificity and as a step toward generating variants that are more selective as MMP inhibitors, we have characterized fifteen N-TIMP-1 mutants with substitutions for Thr2. The results show that this residue has a major influence on the specificity of TIMP for different metalloproteinases but also show that there is little correlation between the effect of an amino acid at position 2 in TIMP-1 and the same residue at the P1′ site of a peptide substrate on their respective activities with an MMP as inhibitor or substrate. The structural basis of these observations is discussed. DISCUSSIONThe present results suggest that protein engineering of TIMP is a viable approach for generating more specific protein inhibitors of MMPs for studies of the biological roles of different MMPs and to facilitate the development of therapeutic agents for diseases linked with excess activity of specific MMPs. The development of specifically targeted high affinity variants will require substitutions at multiple sites but the inhibitory properties of the Met66 and Val69 mutants and full-length TIMP-1 (11Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) indicate that residue 2 has a much greater influence on specificity than other components of the reactive site (see Fig. 3). The effects of systematic substitutions for Thr2 provide information about the determinants of MMP binding by N-TIMP-1 and also some TIMP variants with enhanced specificity. Table II shows that the best inhibitors for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3, based on affinity and selectivity, have different substitutions at position 2: valine, leucine, or serine, respectively. The substitution of Gly for Thr2 produces a protein that is essentially inactive as an inhibitor at concentrations below 100 nm yet retains a native structure as indicated by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Although the isolated C-domain of TIMP may not be capable of folding, the Gly2 substitution in full-length TIMP-1 will generate a protein that can be used to investigate the interactions of the C-terminal domain in a molecule that has little affinity for a metalloproteinase active site and to determine whether the protease-inhibitory action of TIMP is connected with other functions such as cell growth stimulation and anti-angiogenic activity (15Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Tanzawa K. Uchijima E. Iwata K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 16Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shimagawa A. J.

Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar).Some properties of the side chain of residue 2 correlate with the affinity for different MMPs but, at present, there is insufficient information to explain the structural basis of the effects of mutations on activity. In the TIMP-1·MMP-3 crystal structure, the N-terminal region of MMP-3 has a different structure from that in free MMP-3 (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Based on the NMR structure of N-TIMP-2, it appears possible that conformational changes in TIMP may also occur during complex formation (21Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Feeney J. Freedman R.B. Carr M.D. Williamson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21736-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consequently, mutations in the reactive site could affect the interaction with MMPs through effects on local dynamics (as well as structure). Binding to different MMPs may also be affected differentially by regions distant from the Cys1-Cys70 disulfide bond. The higher affinity of MMP-3 for the Gly2 mutant suggests that interactions outside of the S1′ pocket contribute more of the binding energy for the interaction with MMP-3 than with the other MMPs.The structure of the S1′ pocket of MMP-1 is narrower and less deep than those of other MMPs. Arginine 195, which replaces leucine in MMP-2 and MMP-3, projects into the S1′ pocket toward the catalytic Zn2+, resulting in a less deep more cationic pocket (31Stams T. Spurlino J.C. Smith D.L. Wahl R.C. Ho T.F. Qoronfleh M.W. Banks T.M. Rubin B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The reduced depth may account for the preference of MMP-1 for valine and threonine over leucine, for example, and charge repulsion is also a likely factor in the unfavorable binding of positively charged substituents to MMP-1. The specificity pocket of an MMP with no bound substrate or inhibitor will be expected to contain multiple solvent molecules so that the binding of TIMP mutants will be affected by the ability of the residue 2 side chain to interact with or displace solvent molecules.Large areas of molecular surface become buried in the formation of high affinity heterologous protein-protein complexes (32Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that approximately 1300 Å2 of the accessible surface of each component is buried on formation of the TIMP-1·MMP-3 complex (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 accounts for few of these contacts and less than 10% of the free energy of interaction (11Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The present results show that a single residue of the reactive site of N-TIMP-1, Thr2, exerts a large influence on the strength and specificity of binding to MMPs. The magnitude of this effect is surprising because, even if the environment of Thr2 changed from being totally exposed to 100% buried on complex formation with the protease, it accounts for less than 8% (102/1300 Å (2Nagase H. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteinases in Health and Disease. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996: 153-204Google Scholar) of the area of the protein−protein interaction site (33Miller S. Janin J. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The loss of 33–55% of the free energy of binding on removal of the Thr2 side chain by the substitution of glycine indicates that residue 2 of TIMP-1 could be designated a “hot spot” in the TIMP/MMP interaction interface, a residue that has a uniquely large influence on the strength of the protein-protein interaction (34Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 35Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Many other residues form contacts with MMP-3 in the crystal structure (18Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), but mutagenesis of others, particularly Met66 and Val69, and the removal of all C-domain contacts in N-TIMP-1 indicates that these residues are less important for binding than Thr2 (24Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, the present results show that the nature of the contacts in the structure of the TIMP-1·MMP-3 complex are an important step toward understanding the structural basis of the inhibitory strategy and specificity in TIMP, but it is important to experimentally evaluate their contributions to the stability of the complex.

Increased expression of NSP1 in 293 cells induces activation of JNK1, but not of ERK2. Consistent with this observation, NSP1 increases the activity of an AP-1-containing promoter.

Although many of the molecules that participate in these processes have been defined, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how multiple signals are integrated into an appropriate outcome.The MAPK kinase family of proteins (ERK, JNK, and p38) can phosphorylate and activate one or more transcription factors and are activated by a cascade of upstream kinases (for reviews, see Refs. 3Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Current Opinion in Cell Biology. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholarand 4Treisman R. Curr. Opin.

Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). JNK is itself activated following phosphorylation by a JNK kinase (7Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H.

Although several kinases have been described that can phosphorylate the JNK kinases, the most important appear to be the MEKK proteins (11Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Activation of the MEKK proteins is dependent on one or more of the small GTP-binding proteins such as Cdc42, Rac, and Ras (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T.

Although the activation of the MAPK kinases can be described in terms of a linear series of sequential activations, it has become clear that many of the relevant components are assembled into complexes through scaffolding molecules such as MP1 (15Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and JIP-1 (16Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J.

Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and for the ERK kinases, many of the components of the pathway are well established (17Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In contrast, the signaling from EGF to the JNK pathway has received relatively less attention. The ability of EGF to activate guanylate exchange factors such as Sos and the known involvement of the GTP-binding proteins in JNK activation suggest that EGF may also be linked to JNK via guanylate exchange factors (18Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

In addition to integrating independent extracellular signals, cell type-specific expression of the adaptor molecules may be critical in determining the cell type-specific response to extracellular stimuli. Although most of the more extensively characterized signal transduction molecules are ubiquitously expressed (15Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J.

A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).To identify additional adaptor proteins that are involved in growth factor and integrin signaling, we have searched an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for sequences that share homology with SH2-containing adaptor proteins. By this method, we isolated a cDNA encoding a family of novel SH2-containing proteins. The structure and characteristics of at least NSP1 (novelSH2-containing protein 1) suggest that this protein may play an important role in cell proliferation and fetal development.DISCUSSIONWe have isolated a family of novel adaptor proteins (NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3) that contain an N-terminal SH2 domain, a central proline/serine-rich region, and a C-terminal sequence that is distinctive for the NSP proteins. While this manuscript was in preparation, the sequence of NSP2 was published as BCAR3; this protein (BCAR3) appears to be implicated in the development of resistance to the cytostatic agent Taxol (40van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T.L. Dekker A. van der Spek P.J. Vreede L. Dorssers L.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NSP1expression may be restricted to tissues with secretory epithelial cells, whereas NSP2 and NSP3 are expressed in variety of tissues. In hematopoietic tissues, twoNSP3-related transcripts are detected. The coding potential of these two NSP3 transcripts is being explored.NSP1 is phosphorylated in response to insulin and EGF (and insulin-like growth factor I and heregulin (data not shown)), indicating that NSP1 is a common target for a variety of growth factor receptors. In response to EGF, NSP1 associates with the EGF receptor and is phosphorylated. The data are consistent with a direct interaction between the phosphotyrosines on the EGF receptor and the NSP1 SH2 domain and a subsequent receptor kinase-dependent phosphorylation of NSP1. Preliminary data indicate that the SH2 domain alone is able to interact with the EGF receptor, although other regions of NSP1 may also participate in this interaction (data not shown). It is also possible that the EGF receptor-NSP1 interaction is indirect. NSP1 is only modestly phosphorylated in response to integrin signaling. This weak integrin-mediated phosphorylation could conceivably be through FAK or Src-related kinases, both of which are known to associate with Cas (20Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 22Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol.

Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19719-19724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that NSP1 interacts with p130Cas. Preliminary data from a yeast two-hybrid analysis are consistent with this result and suggest that the interaction is direct (data not shown). In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the interaction between NSP1 and Cas could be detected under conditions in which there was no detectable phosphorylation of NSP1 or Cas, suggesting that the interaction between NSP1 and Cas is phosphorylation-independent and may occur via the SH3 domain in Cas and the proline/serine-rich domain in NSP1. Neither of the demonstrated associations (EGF receptor and Cas) appears to utilize the phosphotyrosines in NSP1. This conclusion is reinforced by the experiments using the tyrosine replacement variants in which both EGF receptor and Cas interactions can occur in the absence of any detectable NSP1 phosphorylation.The relative level of the NSP1·Cas complex and the phosphorylation status of Cas are quite different between receptor tyrosine kinase and integrin signaling. Thus, EGF treatment leads to NSP1 phosphorylation, to dephosphorylation of the Cas that is associated with NSP1, and to an increase in the amount of the NSP·Cas complex. In contrast, in response to fibronectin, there is little change in NSP1 phosphorylation, but there is a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the Cas associated with NSP1. Cas dephosphorylation in response to EGF (42Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Cas phosphorylation in response to fibronectin (30Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously reported. There is also an apparent dissociation of NSP1 from Cas at short time periods and a subsequent reassociation at longer (4 h) times. These results led to the hypothesis that the biological outcome in response to extracellular signals could be quite distinct in the presence or absence of NSP1. For example, FAK associates with the SH3 region in Cas via a PXXP region at the C terminus of FAK (P715SRP; mouse nomenclature (22Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar)). There are six PXXP signatures in NSP1. Thus, it is possible that NSP1 could compete for the SH3 region in Cas and decrease the amount of FAK that is bound to Cas and so alter FAK-dependent events (21Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In contrast, EGF treatment leads to NSP1 phosphorylation, to dephosphorylation of NSP1-associated Cas, and to an increase in the amount of the NSP1·Cas complex. This complex is then likely to have a decrease in the number of proteins associated with the phosphotyrosines in Cas and so may lead to changes in downstream signaling.Increased expression of NSP1 results in JNK activation and increased expression from an AP-1-dependent promoter. Whether this activation of JNK is related to the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of NSP1 or the interaction of Cas with NSP1 is currently unknown, although preliminary data from a luciferase assay indicate that NSP1Y95F, which is not phosphorylated but still interacts with both Cas and the EGF receptor, has diminished but not abolished activity in this assay. It has been previously shown that activation of the JNK kinase cascade is dependent on one of several small GTP-binding proteins (Cdc42, Rac, and Ras) (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 14Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). How or whether NSP1 can modify any of these components of the signaling pathway is under investigation.The activation of the c-Jun kinases in response to receptor tyrosine kinase and integrin receptor signaling appears to be critical for regulating cell proliferation (45Antonyak M.A. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 46Bost F. McKay R. Dean N. Mercola D. J. Biol.

Birrer M. Dent P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic analysis of JNK signaling in Drosophila (5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) and the abnormal liver development in mice genetically lacking the JNK kinase activator MKK4 suggest a critical role for JNK in normal development (48Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of a novel adaptor protein that functions in these processes may provide a valuable molecular tool for understanding cell proliferation and fetal development. Cell contact with growth factors and extracellular matrix activates one or more of the MAPK1 pathways, and these responses appear to be critical for the appropriate regulation of cell division and differentiation (1Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 2Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Although many of the molecules that participate in these processes have been defined, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how multiple signals are integrated into an appropriate outcome. The MAPK kinase family of proteins (ERK, JNK, and p38) can phosphorylate and activate one or more transcription factors and are activated by a cascade of upstream kinases (for reviews, see Refs. 3Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Current Opinion in Cell Biology. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholarand 4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The JNK series of kinases that are part of the process that leads to the activation of AP-1-containing promoters (6Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar) appear to be especially critical for transducing an immediate response to a changing environment and for regulating cell proliferation (5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). JNK is itself activated following phosphorylation by a JNK kinase (7Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 8Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar), which in turn is also activated by phosphorylation. Although several kinases have been described that can phosphorylate the JNK kinases, the most important appear to be the MEKK proteins (11Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Activation of the MEKK proteins is dependent on one or more of the small GTP-binding proteins such as Cdc42, Rac, and Ras (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 13Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Although the activation of the MAPK kinases can be described in terms of a linear series of sequential activations, it has become clear that many of the relevant components are assembled into complexes through scaffolding molecules such as MP1 (15Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and JIP-1 (16Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Growth factors such as EGF can stimulate all of the MAPK kinases (11Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and for the ERK kinases, many of the components of the pathway are well established (17Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In contrast, the signaling from EGF to the JNK pathway has received relatively less attention. The ability of EGF to activate guanylate exchange factors such as Sos and the known involvement of the GTP-binding proteins in JNK activation suggest that EGF may also be linked to JNK via guanylate exchange factors (18Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in linking EGF to JNK has also been reported (19Logan S.K. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

This complex contains at least the kinases FAK, c-Crk, and c-Src and the adaptor molecule Cas (Crk-associatedsubstrate) (20Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DISCUSSIONWe have isolated a family of novel adaptor proteins (NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3) that contain an N-terminal SH2 domain, a central proline/serine-rich region, and a C-terminal sequence that is distinctive for the NSP proteins. While this manuscript was in preparation, the sequence of NSP2 was published as BCAR3; this protein (BCAR3) appears to be implicated in the development of resistance to the cytostatic agent Taxol (40van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T.L. Dekker A. van der Spek P.J. Vreede L. Dorssers L.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NSP1expression may be restricted to tissues with secretory epithelial cells, whereas NSP2 and NSP3 are expressed in variety of tissues. In hematopoietic tissues, twoNSP3-related transcripts are detected. The coding potential of these two NSP3 transcripts is being explored.NSP1 is phosphorylated in response to insulin and EGF (and insulin-like growth factor I and heregulin (data not shown)), indicating that NSP1 is a common target for a variety of growth factor receptors. In response to EGF, NSP1 associates with the EGF receptor and is phosphorylated. The data are consistent with a direct interaction between the phosphotyrosines on the EGF receptor and the NSP1 SH2 domain and a subsequent receptor kinase-dependent phosphorylation of NSP1. Preliminary data indicate that the SH2 domain alone is able to interact with the EGF receptor, although other regions of NSP1 may also participate in this interaction (data not shown). It is also possible that the EGF receptor-NSP1 interaction is indirect. NSP1 is only modestly phosphorylated in response to integrin signaling. This weak integrin-mediated phosphorylation could conceivably be through FAK or Src-related kinases, both of which are known to associate with Cas (20Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 22Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol.

Preliminary data from a yeast two-hybrid analysis are consistent with this result and suggest that the interaction is direct (data not shown). In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the interaction between NSP1 and Cas could be detected under conditions in which there was no detectable phosphorylation of NSP1 or Cas, suggesting that the interaction between NSP1 and Cas is phosphorylation-independent and may occur via the SH3 domain in Cas and the proline/serine-rich domain in NSP1. Neither of the demonstrated associations (EGF receptor and Cas) appears to utilize the phosphotyrosines in NSP1. This conclusion is reinforced by the experiments using the tyrosine replacement variants in which both EGF receptor and Cas interactions can occur in the absence of any detectable NSP1 phosphorylation.The relative level of the NSP1·Cas complex and the phosphorylation status of Cas are quite different between receptor tyrosine kinase and integrin signaling. Thus, EGF treatment leads to NSP1 phosphorylation, to dephosphorylation of the Cas that is associated with NSP1, and to an increase in the amount of the NSP·Cas complex. In contrast, in response to fibronectin, there is little change in NSP1 phosphorylation, but there is a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the Cas associated with NSP1. Cas dephosphorylation in response to EGF (42Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Cas phosphorylation in response to fibronectin (30Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously reported. There is also an apparent dissociation of NSP1 from Cas at short time periods and a subsequent reassociation at longer (4 h) times. These results led to the hypothesis that the biological outcome in response to extracellular signals could be quite distinct in the presence or absence of NSP1. For example, FAK associates with the SH3 region in Cas via a PXXP region at the C terminus of FAK (P715SRP; mouse nomenclature (22Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar)). There are six PXXP signatures in NSP1. Thus, it is possible that NSP1 could compete for the SH3 region in Cas and decrease the amount of FAK that is bound to Cas and so alter FAK-dependent events (21Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In contrast, EGF treatment leads to NSP1 phosphorylation, to dephosphorylation of NSP1-associated Cas, and to an increase in the amount of the NSP1·Cas complex. This complex is then likely to have a decrease in the number of proteins associated with the phosphotyrosines in Cas and so may lead to changes in downstream signaling.Increased expression of NSP1 results in JNK activation and increased expression from an AP-1-dependent promoter. Whether this activation of JNK is related to the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of NSP1 or the interaction of Cas with NSP1 is currently unknown, although preliminary data from a luciferase assay indicate that NSP1Y95F, which is not phosphorylated but still interacts with both Cas and the EGF receptor, has diminished but not abolished activity in this assay. It has been previously shown that activation of the JNK kinase cascade is dependent on one of several small GTP-binding proteins (Cdc42, Rac, and Ras) (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) and the abnormal liver development in mice genetically lacking the JNK kinase activator MKK4 suggest a critical role for JNK in normal development (48Yang D.

We previously demonstrated that BK-stimulated NF-κB activation requires the small GTPase RhoA. We present evidence that BK-induced NF-κB activation both activates and requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in A549 human epithelial cells. Pre-treatment with the PI 3-kinase-specific inhibitors, wortmannin, and LY294002 effectively blocked BK-induced PI 3-kinase activity. Wortmannin and LY294002 also abolished BK-induced NF-κB activation, as did transient transfection with a dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit. BK-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and NF-κB activation were sensitive to pertussis but not cholera toxin, suggesting that the B2 BK receptors transducing the response were coupled to Gαi or Gαo heterotrimeric G proteins. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) also stimulated increased PI 3-kinase activity, however TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation was not affected by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors or the p85 dominant negative mutant. These findings provide evidence that BK-induced NF-κB activation utilizes a signaling pathway that requires activity of both RhoA and PI 3-kinase and is distinct from the signaling pathway utilized by TNFα. Furthermore, we show that the p85 regulatory subunit is required for activation of PI 3-kinase activity by this G protein-coupled receptor.

BK-stimulated NF-κB activation was shown to be mediated through the G protein-coupled B2 BK receptor and was pertussis toxin sensitive (1Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D.

The small GTPase RhoA was also shown to be both necessary and sufficient for BK-stimulated NF-κB activation (2Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is a ubiquitous lipid kinase that phosphorylates the 3-position of the inositol ring of inositol phospholipids to generate such lipid messengers as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). The exact role and signal molecular targets of these lipid products has not yet been determined, however, increasing evidence suggests that they may serve as intracellular second messengers (3Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 4Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit with SH2 domains and a p110 catalytic subunit (5Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S.

In the regulation of receptor-mediated intracellular pathways, including G-protein-coupled receptor, PI 3-kinase has been reported to be directly activated by βγ subunits released from activated G proteins (7Zhang J.

We therefore investigated the role of PI 3-kinase in the signaling events that lead to NF-κB activation in BK-stimulated A549 human transformed epithelial cells. In this report we show that BK stimulates PI 3-kinase activity in A549 cells and that inhibition of PI 3-kinase blocks BK-stimulated NF-κB activation. These results indicate that PI 3-kinase is a novel signal transducer for BK-induced NF-κB activation in airway epithelial cells. BK was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, (distal respiratory epithelium-like) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). A549 cells were maintained in Ham's F12K medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. Immediately before stimulation, A549 cells were changed into serum-free RPMI 1640 (Irvine Scientific). Oligonucleotides and their complementary strands for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were from Promega (Madison, WI) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The sequences were a consensus κB site (underlined), 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (NF-κB) (8Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar), and a mutant κB site with the G to C substitution (underlined) in the κB binding motif, 5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The plasmid pmTNFα (a gift from Vladimir Kravchenko, The Scripps Research Institute La Jolla, CA) was used for preparation of recombinant murine TNFα from Escherichia coli. The specific activity of TNFα purified by ion-exchange chromatography was 7 × 107 units/mg protein. The p85 dominant negative plasmid, p85αN-CΔ478–514, was constructed using a previously published method (9Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from A549 cells plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells in a 6-well plate using a modified method of Dignam et al. (10Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), and EMSA were performed using 2.5 μg of the nuclear extract as described previously (2Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysates normalized for protein content were incubated for 3 h with anti-PI 3-kinase antibodies directed against the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The immune complexes were absorbed onto protein A-Sepharose and washed as described (11Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase assays were performed directly on beads. Briefly, the reaction was carried out for 10 min in a buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg of PI (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Adenosine (0.2 mm) was added to the reaction mixture to inhibit residual PI 4-kinase activity. After the incubation, the reaction was stopped with methanol plus 2.4 N HCl (1:1, v/v), and lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. The plasmids p0.2kb[WT]CAT (WT-IκB-CAT) and p0.2kb[MU]CAT (MU-IκB-CAT), which contain the wild-type and mutant κB enhancers from the IκB gene, respectively, were obtained from P. Chiao (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) (12Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The pSVL-CAT plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as a positive control for CAT expression. The plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH) was used as a control for monitoring the transfection efficiency by the expression of β-galactosidase. Transient transfection of the A549 cells and measurement of CAT activity were performed exactly as described previously (2Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected A549 cells were specifically isolated using the Capture-Tec pHook-2 system (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, 4 × 106 A549 cells were transfected with the pHook-2 plasmid that directs the synthesis of a fusion protein containing the platelet-derived growth factor receptor transmembrane domain fused to a single-stranded cell surface antibody recognizing the hapten phOx. Transfected cells were then recovered by incubating the cells in suspension for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 × 106magnetic beads coupled to phOx followed by magnetic separation. To assess the role of PI 3-kinase in BK-induced NF-κB activation, we examined the consequences of pre-incubating cells with PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Wortmannin and LY294002 have both been shown to specifically inhibit PI 3-kinase in multiple cell types with distinct and different modes of action (13Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Following pretreatment with wortmannin, LY294002, or media control, A549 cells were stimulated with BK or TNFα, and NF-κB activation was assessed by EMSA. Whereas the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was potently induced by BK and TNFα (Fig. 1,lanes 2–3), BK-induced NF-κB activation was completely inhibited in A549 cells pretreated with wortmannin (Fig. 1, lane 4) or LY294002 (Fig. 1, lane 6). In contrast, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 had an effect on TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 7). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase activity is required for BK- but not TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. We next examined the dose-response and timing of the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on BK-induced NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig.2 A, wortmannin at doses greater than or equal to 50 nm significantly inhibited BK-induced NF-κB activation. To effectively inhibit BK-induced NF-κB activation, wortmannin needed to be added to the A549 cells at least 5 min prior to stimulation with BK (Fig. 2 B). The results presented above demonstrate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity abrogates BK-induced NF-κB activation. We next examined whether BK would induce increased PI 3-kinase activity in A549 cells. PI 3-kinase activity was measured using an in vitro kinase assay using phosphatidylinositol as the substrate (11Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A549 cells were lysed at varying times following stimulation with BK, and the cellular extracts were collected for analysis for PI 3-kinase activity. BK stimulated a time-dependent increase in PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 3). The BK-induced increase of PI 3-kinase activity was seen within 5 min of stimulation and peaked at 20 min. The kinetics of BK-induced PI 3-kinase activation preceded that of BK-induced NF-κB activation, consistent with a role for PI 3-kinase in the activation of NF-κB. Although the PI 3-kinase inhibitors did not effect TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, TNFα, like BK, stimulated increased PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 4, lane 6). Wortmannin and LY294002 each abolished the PI 3-kinase activity stimulated by either BK (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 4) or TNFα (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5). Thus BK stimulates PI 3-kinase activity, and this activity is required for subsequent NF-κB activation. We previously demonstrated that BK-induced NF-κB activation in WI-38 and A549 cells is mediated through the B2 BK receptor (1Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (14Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We also showed that the B2 BK receptor is coupled to a Gi protein in WI38 cells, based on the sensitivity of BK-induced NF-κB activation and interleukin-1β gene expression to pertussis toxin treatment (1Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The identity of the heterotrimeric G proteins coupling the B2 BK receptor to PI 3-kinase activity and NF-κB activation in A549 epithelial cells has not been elucidated. We therefore examined the effect of pertussis toxin and cholera toxin on BK-induced NF-κB activation and PI 3-kinase. A549 cells were pre-treated with pertussis and cholera toxins separately, then stimulated with BK. Pertussis toxin (0.5 μg/ml) markedly reduced BK-stimulated NF-κB activation (Fig.5 A, lane 5), whereas cholera toxin had no such inhibitory effect in A549 cells (Fig.5 A, lane 2). Neither of the toxins inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in the same cells (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 6). BK-induced PI 3-kinase activity was also blocked by pertussis toxin (Fig.5 B, lane 5) but not cholera toxin (Fig.5 B, lane 2), whereas neither pertussis nor cholera toxin inhibited TNFα-induced PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.5 B, lanes 3 and 6). Thus, our results indicate that BK stimulates both PI 3-kinase and NF-κB activation through B2 BK receptors that are coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins. Further demonstration of the necessity for PI 3-kinase activity in BK-induced NF-κB activation was obtained by overexpressing a dominant negative PI 3-kinase (p85αN-CΔ478–514) in A549 cells. The deletion of codons 478–514 from the regulatory p85 component of PI 3-kinase has been shown to confer PI 3-kinase dominant negative activity (9Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A549 cells were co-transfected with p85αN-CΔ478–514 together with an IκB promoter-CAT reporter construct. Overexpression of the dominant negative PI 3-kinase mutant protein abolished BK-induced κB-mediated CAT activity but had no effect on TNFα-mediated CAT activity (Fig.6, A and B). To confirm that overexpression of p85αN-CΔ478–514 mutant protein inhibited PI 3-kinase activity in A549 cells, transfected cells were recovered using the plasmid pHook-2, which encodes a single-stranded cell surface antibody that can be bound to magnetic beads coated with antigen (phOx). Co-transfection of A549 cells with the p85αN-CΔ478–514 plasmid inhibited BK-stimulated PI 3-kinase 83% compared with A549 cells transfected with pHook-2 plasmid alone (Fig.6 C). BK has recently been shown to stimulate activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (1Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), an effect that may be an important contributor to the inflammatory actions of BK (15Zuraw B.L. Christiansen S.C. Holgate S.T. Busse W. Inflammatory Mechanisms in Asthma. 117. Mercel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 783-803Google Scholar). The cellular signaling pathways required for BK-induced NF-κB activation, however, are not completely understood. We recently demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of BK stimulated NF-κB activation in A549 epithelial cells and that the small G protein RhoA was necessary to mediate this effect (2Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar). The present study provides evidence that the lipid products of PI 3-kinase are an important part of the signaling pathway leading to activation of NF-κB by BK. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that BK stimulates increased PI 3-kinase activity in A549 epithelial cells and further that PI 3-kinase activity is essential for BK-induced activation of NF-κB. Compared with BK-induced NF-κB activation, BK-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity occurred earlier (5 versus 15 min after adding BK) and peaked earlier (20 versus 60 min after adding BK). To test the possibility that PI 3-kinase is a component of the BK-stimulated signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation, we assessed the effect of inhibiting PI 3-kinase activity on subsequent BK-induced NF-κB activation. Wortmannin and LY294002 have been shown to be specific PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Wortmannin irreversibly inactivates PI 3-kinase by binding to its p110 catalytic subunit (13Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); LY294002 is a competitive inhibitor, binding to the ATP-binding site of the PI 3-kinase (16Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-incubation of A549 cells with either wortmannin or LY294002 completely abrogated BK-induced NF-κB activation. Additional proof that PI 3-kinase was required for BK-induced NF-κB activation was provided by the ability of a dominant negative mutant form of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase to block BK-induced NF-κB activation. The role of PI 3-kinase in NF-κB activation has been recently addressed in several other reports with variable results. Like BK, interleukin-1-mediated activation of NF-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) was shown to require PI 3-kinase in human hepatoma (HepG2) and epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cell lines (17Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this system, overexpression of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase was necessary but not sufficient to activate NF-κB, however it was both necessary and sufficient to activate AP-1. Interestingly, we found that TNFα-induced NF-κB activation was unaffected by pre-incubation with PI 3-kinase inhibitors or expression of the dominant negative p85 PI 3-kinase mutant. Wortmannin also failed to inhibit activation of NF-κB in human T-cell blasts following CD28 receptor ligation, although it did inhibit AP-1 activation (18Edmead C.E. Patel Y.I. Wilson A. Boulougouris G. Hall N.D. Ward S.G. Sansom D.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3290-3297PubMed Google Scholar). A number of distinct forms of PI 3-kinase have been described in mammalian cells. The classic PI 3-kinase is linked to receptors with intrinsic or associated tyrosine kinase activity and is a heterodimer consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85 regulatory subunit containing one SH3 and two SH2 domains. At least 3 isoforms of the p110 and p85 subunits have been described in mammalian cells. The p110/p85 form of PI 3-kinase 3-phosphorylates PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro, although its primary productin vivo appears to be PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (19Stephens L. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Jackson T. Volinia S. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A p110 PI 3-kinase that does not bind to p85 has also been described (5Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) as well as a p170 form of PI 3-kinase that preferentially 3-phosphorylates PtdIns and to a lesser extent PtdIns(4)P and is relatively insensitive to wortmannin (20Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13304-13307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A mammalian counterpart to the yeast Vps34p kinase that only phosphorylates PtdIns has been found and is associated with a 150-kDa protein but not p85 (19Stephens L. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Jackson T. Volinia S. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the PI 3-kinase involved in BK-induced NF-κB activation is the p110/p85 heterodimer. This conclusion is based on: 1) its sensitivity to low concentrations of wortmannin, 2) the ability of a dominant negative p85 mutant to inhibit the response, and 3) the capacity of an anti-p85 antibody to immunoprecipitate BK-induced PI 3-kinase. BK is an agonist for the B2 BK receptor, and we have previously shown that B2 BK receptor antagonists completely block BK-induced NF-κB activation. The B2 BK receptor is a member of the heptahelical superfamily of receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. To assess the type of heterotrimeric G protein coupling of the B2 BK receptor to PI 3-kinase and NF-κB, we analyzed the effects of pertussis and cholera toxins. Pertussis toxin ADP ribosylates Gαi and Gαo proteins, whereas cholera toxin ADP ribosylates Gαs proteins (22Burnette W.N. Structure. 1994; 2: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). BK-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and NF-κB activation were both inhibited by pertussis toxin but not by cholera toxin, indicating that both responses are transduced through the Gαi or Gαo class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Previous studies suggested that G protein-coupled receptors may activate PI 3-kinase through the p110 γ, which is independent of p85 independent (5Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 23Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, provided indirect evidence that some G protein-coupled receptors activate PI 3-kinase through the p85/p110 heterodimer (24Ptasznik A. Prossnitz E.R. Yoshikawa D. Smrcka A. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25204-25207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26356-26361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By transfecting the A549 cells with a p85 dominant negative mutant, we showed that the p85/p110 form of PI 3-kinase was activated and required for NF-κB activation following stimulation with BK, a ligand that acts through a G protein-coupled receptor. The mechanisms linking PI 3-kinase activation to NF-κB activation are unknown. D3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols are known to play important roles in cell growth and survival, although the exact role and immediate downstream molecular targets of PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are only now emerging (26Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 27Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has been shown to activate several of the Ca2+-independent isotypes of protein kinase C (PKC) (28Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the atypical ζ isotype (PKCζ) (29Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKCζ has been reported to be important in NF-κB activation (30Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), an effect that was dependent on p85/p110 PI 3-kinase and protein phosphatase 2A activity (31Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase was also shown to be required for NF-κB activation induced by interleukin-4 in transformed human B cells (32Yanagihara Y. Basaki Y. Ikizawa K. Kajiwara K. Cell Immunol. 1997; 176: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on our current results and our previous report that RhoA is required for BK-induced NF-κB activation (2Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar), the relationship between PI 3-kinase activation and activation of the Rho family of small GTPases appears to be an important issue. Several studies have demonstrated that PI 3-kinase may be activated downstream of the small Rho GTPases (33Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 34Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Gomez J. Garcia R.-A. Borlado L. Bonay P. Martinez A.C. Silva A. Fresno M. Carrera A.C. Eicher-Streiber C. Rebollo A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1516-1522PubMed Google Scholar). GTP-loaded Rac (but not RhoA) was shown to directly bind PI 3-kinase (36Bokoch G.M. Vlahos C.J. Wang Y. Knaus U.G. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of Rho using bacterial toxin C3 inhibited lysophosphatidic acid-induced PI 3-kinase activation in Swiss 3T3 cells (37Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies, however, have suggested that PI 3-kinase may activate the small Rho GTPases. Expression of a constitutively active PI 3-kinase mutant in Swiss 3T3 cells induced a subset of Rac and Rho-mediated cellular responses (38Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has been shown to bind the pleckstrin homology domain of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, providing a potential mechanism for PI 3-kinase-mediated regulation of Rho activation (38Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Additionally, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase contains a breakpoint cluster region homology domain (BH) that has been shown to have GTPase activating protein activity (40Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that BK rapidly activates the p85/p110 heterodimeric PI 3-kinase in A549 cells. BK-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and NF-κB activation were both inhibited by pertussis toxin but not cholera toxin, suggesting that the B2 BK receptor mediating both responses is coupled to the Gi/Go class of Gα proteins. Utilizing both specific inhibitors as well as transient expression of a dominant negative p85 PI 3-kinase mutant, we further showed that BK-induced NF-κB activation required PI 3-kinase activity. Although TNFα also stimulated PI 3-kinase activity, TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation was not affected by inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity. These findings provide evidence that BK-induced NF-κB activation utilizes a signaling pathway that requires activity of both RhoA and PI 3-kinase and is distinct from the signaling pathway utilized by TNFα. The relationship between BK-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase and RhoA, however, remains to be determined."

Especially intriguing is the ability of MHV-3 to inducede novo synthesis of a unique procoagulant, thefgl2 prothrombinase, encoded by the fgl2 gene located on mouse chromosome 5 (1Parr R.L.

Several lines of evidence implicate expression of this gene product in the pathogenesis of fulminant murine hepatitis. First, levels of this prothrombinase activity correlate with the severity of the disease (3Levy G.A. Macphee P. Fung L.S. Fisher M.M. Rappaport A.M.

Second, treatment of mice with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to the MHV-3-induced prothrombinase prevents the lethality associated with MHV-3 infection (5Li C. Fung L.S. Crow A. Myers-Mason N.

The MHV genome is a single-stranded nonsegmented RNA of approximately 32 kb (7Lai M.M.C. Stohlman S.A. J. Virol. 1978; 26: 236-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA genome contains seven or eight genes encoding three or four structural proteins and four nonstructural proteins (8Lai M.M.C. Cavanagh D. Adv. Virus Res. 1997; 48: 1-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important aspect of MHV biology is the high frequency of RNA-RNA recombination between strains of MHV (9Makino S. Fleming J.O. Keck J.G.

RNA recombination may contribute to viral pathogenesis and also provides a useful tool for the study of genetic control of the biologic properties of viruses. Studies using recombinant viruses derived from MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 have demonstrated that the 3′-portion (about 25%) of the viral genome, representing RNA genomic regions encoding for all of the structural proteins, controls biologic properties such as organotropism of the virus, the pattern of the virus-induced central nervous system pathology in mice, plaque morphology, and virus yield in tissue culture (12Lavi E. Murray E.M. Makino S. Stohlman S.A. Lai M.M.C. Weiss S.R. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 570-578PubMed Google Scholar, 13Masters P.S. Sturman L.S. Cavanagh D. Brown T.D.K. Coronaviruses and Their Diseases. Academic Press, New York1990: 235-238Google Scholar). In this paper, we have defined the genetic basis for induction of fgl2 gene transcription by MHV-3. Female BALB/cJ mice, 6–8 weeks of age, from Charles River Laboratories (St. Constant, Quebec) were kept in microisolated cages, housed in the animal facilities at the Toronto Hospital, and fed a standard laboratory chow diet and water ad libitum. MHV-3 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD) and plaque purified on monolayers of DBT cells. Parental viruses A59, JHM, MHV-2, and two sets of recombinant viruses have been described previously (14Lai M.M.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The schematic representations of oligonucleotide maps of the recombinant viruses are presented in Fig.1. To ensure that the recombinant virus strains are clonal, ML3 and ML11 were plaque purified three times in 17Cl-1 cells. The purified strains were used for creating nucleocapsid (N) gene expression constructs and transfection experiments. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from BALB/cJ mice 4 days after intraperitoneal administration of 1.5 ml of 3% thioglycolate (Difco Laboratories) as described previously (6Ding J.W. Ning Q. Liu M. Lai A. Leibowitz J. Peltekian K.M. Cole E.H. Fung L.S. Holloway C. Marsden P.A. Yeger H. Phillips M.J. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9223-9230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Sigma) and 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Macrophages were greater than 95% in purity as determined by morphology and nonspecific esterase stain. Viability exceeded 95% by trypan blue exclusion. Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO cells) were from ATCC. MHV and recombinant virus-infected macrophages, at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5, were incubated for 8 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 200 mmglutamine. Mock-infected macrophages and MHV-3-infected macrophages represented negative and positive controls, respectively. Macrophages were evaluated for functional PCA in a one-stage clotting assay, as described previously (15Levy G.A. Leibowitz J.L. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1150-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After incubation, samples to be assayed for PCA were washed three times with unsupplemented RPMI 1640 and resuspended at a concentration of 106/ml. Samples were assayed for the ability to shorten the spontaneous clotting time of normal citrated human platelet-poor plasma. Milliunits of PCA were assigned by reference to a standard curve generated with serial log dilutions of a standard rabbit brain thromboplastin (Dade Division, American Hospital Supply Co., Miami, FL). Expression of fgl2 was detected by RT-PCR. Freshly isolated macrophages, at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5, were infected with different strains of viruses for 6 h. 1 × 107 macrophages were pelleted in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and total cellular RNA was isolated by 8 m acid-guanidium hydrochloride extraction in a modified procedure as described previously (16Evans R. Kamdar S.J. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar). The quantity and quality of RNA were examined by spectrophotometry and on a 1% analytical agarose gel containing formaldehyde. RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in 20-μl reactions, as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR was then performed in 50-μl reactions using 1-μl portions of cDNA and the primersfgl2−318 (TGC CCA CGC TGA CCA TCC A) corresponding to nucleotides 318–336 of BALB/cJ fgl2 cDNA (M 15761) andfgl2 −1224 (GAG ACA ACG ATC GGT ACC CCT) corresponding to nucleotides 1224–1244 of BALB/cJ fgl2 cDNA. (M16238), which yield a 906-base pair band in 1% agarose DNA gel. Amplification products were not obtained when reverse transcriptase was omitted (data not shown). RT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also set up as an internal control to assess the quality of first strand synthesis. Restriction enzymes used to create constructs were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All plasmids were purified using Qiagen Maxiprep Kits and grown in DH5 Escherichia coli bacteria (Life Technologies, Inc.). The entire N gene coding regions and 3′-untranslated regions of MHV-A59, MHV-2, ML3, and ML11 were amplified by RT-PCR. RNA was originally extracted from infected macrophages. The sense primer ACG ATG TCT TTT GTT CCT GGG was phosphorylated chemically at position 1 to achieve directed insertion and ligation of PCR products to its vector; the antisense primer at position 1654 TTT TTT TTT GTG ATT CTT CCA had a poly(T) group to match the poly(A) tail at the 3′-end of nucleocapsid genomic RNA. The N gene fragments were subcloned into the 5.0-kb expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen), under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and bovine growth hormone 3′-processing signals. External restriction endonuclease HindIII and PstI and internal restriction endonuclease EcoRI, EcoRV were used to analysis the size and orientation of N gene insert in recombinant plasmid constructs. A 1.3-kb DNA fragment flanking the 5′-end of mouse fgl2 was released by restriction digestion with EcoRV and SalI from a subclone pBluescript-m166 (pm166) of mouse genomic P1 plasmid (Genome System Inc.) which contains the entire mouse fgl2 gene. This fragment was sequenced by cycle sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer (model 377, Applied Biosystems) using dideoxy dye terminator chemistry. This sequence has been deposited into GenBank with the Accession number AF025817 (Fig. 2) (17Koyama T. Hall L.R. Haser H.G. Tonegawa S. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This 1.3-kb fragment was inserted into SmaI andXhoI sites of the pGL2-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) to form pfgl2(−1328)LUC. 5′-Deletion constructs offgl2 promoter were made by first amplifying the specific fragment using pm166 as template and then cloned into pCR2.1 cloning vector (Strategene) and resubcloned into pGL2-basic plasmid atXhoI and HindIII sites. The reverse primer (GCC ACA ACC AAC CAG GAA G) was used to make all deletion constructs by PCR amplification. The upstream primers used were: GAG CTG AGT GAT GGG GAA GGA for pfgl2(−693)LUC, CCA CTG ACG ATT ACA TAG CC for pfgl2(−625)LUC, GGA CCT TTG TTC TGA TTA GGG GC for pfgl2(−511)LUC, CGC AGA CAT TTA GAC GTT CC for pfgl2(−372)LUC, and GGG CAC TGG TAT TAC AAC TGT for pfgl2(−306)LUC. All promoter-luciferase report constructs were sequenced to confirm the orientation and to verify the sequence. Positive control, pGL2 control plasmid with SV40 promoter, and Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase vector were from Promega. A 2-kb tissue factor promoter construct pTF(−2kb)LUC was a kind gift of Dr. Nigel Mackman (18Mackman N. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2254-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The N gene sequence of multiple clones for each strain of virus was determined using primer-directed strategies by cycle sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer, using the Applied Biosystems PRISMTM dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reading Reaction kit (model 377, PE Applied Biosystems). The T7 primer and pCR3.1 reverse primer were used for 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′ sequence, respectively. A new primer CTC AGG GCT TTT ATG TTG AAG (MHV-ND557) at position 557 was also designed based on the outcome of sequencing and the published cDNA sequence of MHV-A59 to complete the sequencing. Extension products were purified by ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on the PRISM 310. The sequence was analyzed using the DNAsis for windows, sequence analysis software (Hitachi Software Engineering America Ltd., San Bruno, CA). CHO cells were cultured in six-well plates until 50–80% confluence. 1 μg of N gene construct DNA or 1 μg of empty pCR3.1 vector, 0.5 μg of fgl2 promoter-luciferase report construct DNA, and 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase DNA (as a marker for transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase assay) in 100 μl of Opti-DMEM were mixed by vortexing with 3.5 μl of LipofectAMINETM (2 μg/μl) in 100 μl of Opti-DMEM medium. After incubation of the mixture at room temperature for 30 min, 1.8 ml of Opti-DMEM medium was added to bring up the volume to 2 ml. 1 ml of this mixture was distributed into one of the duplicated wells with CHO cells, and transfection were performed at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 44–48 h. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer and freeze-thawed three times in liquid N2. Aliquots of supernatants were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity. At 48 h post-transfection with N gene and pfgl2(−1328)LUC, cultures of 1 × 106 CHO cells were collected and lysed in 100 μl of Western blot lysis buffer with protease inhibitor. 20 μl of lysate was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in 4% milk and phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, membrane was probed with a monoclonal antibody against the N protein at 4 °C overnight followed by washing a total of five times in 2% milk, phosphate-buffered saline, and Tween. The membrane was then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h and washed five times in 2% milk, phosphate-buffered saline, and Tween. Substrates luminol and Enhancer were added and incubated for 1 min. The membrane was then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens for 10 min. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. where applicable. Student's t test for unpaired samples (two-tailed) was used to analyze the data. Studies were undertaken using parental A59, JHM, and MHV-2 strains and two sets of recombinant viruses between them (A59 × JHM, A59 × MHV-2) (Fig. 1). MHV-A59 infection of macrophages resulted in a marked elevation of functional PCA, similar to what was reported previously for MHV-3 (1Parr R.L. Leibowitz L. Fung L.S. Reneker J. Myers-Mason N. Leibowitz J.L. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Ding J.W. Ning Q. Liu M. Lai A. Leibowitz J. Peltekian K.M. Cole E.H. Fung L.S. Holloway C. Marsden P.A. Yeger H. Phillips M.J. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9223-9230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas JHM and MHV-2 failed to induce PCA (Fig.3 A). A59 × JHM-derived recombinants B1, RL1, and IL27, in which the 3′-portion of the genome is derived from MHV-A59, induced high level of functional PCA. In contrast, CA13 and CA43, two recombinants in which the 3′-portion of the genome is derived from MHV-JHM, did not induce PCA, suggesting that the 3′-portion of the MHV-A59 genome may contain a viral genetic determinant needed for induction of functional PCA, which is lacking in the corresponding region of MHV-JHM. To delineate better the candidate genes required for induction of fgl2, we next studied a set of recombinants derived from MHV-A59 × MHV-2, which have multiple crossovers in a single genome, particularly within the 3′-portion of the genome. Recombinants ML3 and ML10 induced functional PCA, whereas ML11 did not (Fig. 3 B). The differences between recombinants ML3 and ML11 in the 3′-portion of the genome maps within the 5′-end of the N gene. Therefore, the ability of recombinants to induce functional PCA parallels the presence or absence of MHV-A59 sequences representing the N gene, strongly suggesting that the MHV-A59 N gene is responsible for activation of fgl2. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the presence or absence of detectable fgl2 mRNA in macrophages infected with various parental or recombinant viruses correlated with the results of assays for functional fgl2 prothrombinase (Fig.4). The entire N gene sequence was determined for MHV-A59, MHV-2, and the recombinant viruses ML3 and ML11, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (sequence data not shown). A comparison of different N gene sequences is shown in Table I. Compared with the published sequence of A59 in GenBank (M35156), the sequence of MHV-A59 used in this study had two point mutations at nucleotides 441 (T → A) and 1613 (T → C); ML3 had three point mutations at nucleotides 405 (C → A), 441 (T → A), and 1613 (T → C). Sequence differences between the N genes of MHV-A59 and MHV-2 (AF061835) were mainly within two regions corresponding to nucleotides 400–500 and 1100–1200 of the MHV-A59 sequence. In addition, MHV-2 had a 12-nucleotide deletion at 111–123 and a 3-nucleotide insertion at 1143–1145 compared with MHV-A59. In contrast, the 3′-untranslated regions following the N gene are completely identical between MHV-A59 and MHV-2.Table IIdentity comparison of N gene sequenceM35156 (1.666 kb)MHV-2 (1.657 kb)%%MHV-A59 (1.666 Kb)9993MHV-ML3 (1.666 Kb)9992MHV-ML11 (1.657 Kb)9399Multiple clones from each construct were sequenced. T7 primer and pCR3.1 reverse primer were used for 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′ sequence, respectively. A new primer at position 557 was also designed to accomplish the cloned entire N gene sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence was analyzed using the DNAsis for Windows sequence analysis software. Open table in a new tab Multiple clones from each construct were sequenced. T7 primer and pCR3.1 reverse primer were used for 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′ sequence, respectively. A new primer at position 557 was also designed to accomplish the cloned entire N gene sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence was analyzed using the DNAsis for Windows sequence analysis software. To establish that the N gene of MHV is responsible for the induction of thefgl2 gene, cotransfection of CHO cells with the N gene under the cytomegalovirus promoter and fgl2(′1328)LUC were performed. The expression of the N protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig.5). CHO cells cotransfected with the N gene construct from A59 and a murine pfgl2(′1328)LUC showed a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with cells cotransfected with the pCR 3.1 empty vector (Fig. 6). In contrast, MHV-2 N protein expression did not enhance fgl2expression. To confirm the specificity of the effect of N protein onfgl2 promoter activity, pTF(−2kb)LUC and a pGL2-control vector under SV40 promoter were each cotransfected with the MHV-A59 N gene construct. There was no significant increase in luciferase expression when these two constructs were cotransfected with or without the MHV-A59 N gene construct (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of N protein on fgl2promoter. 0.5 μg of N gene construct from MHV-A59, MHV-2 was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pfgl2(−1328)LUC or pTF(−2kb)LUC in CHO cells for 40–44 h, and cells were harvested and freeze-thawed three times for measurement of luciferase activity.

Preliminary mapping of the fgl2 promoter has defined a region from −372 to −306 to be responsive to induction of N protein. The activity of the deletion construct −306 was comparable to the promoterless plasmid pGL2-basic. Using DNAsis software, three positive cis-acting regulatory elements were identified within this region which included a liver factor A1 binding element (LF-A1, −332 to −325), human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene 1.2 (IE1.2, −345 to −336) regulatory elements, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor binding element (GMCSF, −353 to −346) (Fig.7 B). Studies using a model of viral hepatitis induced by infection with MHV-3 have provided significant insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease and have suggested novel approaches to therapy (2Ning Q. Brown D. Parodo J. Cattral M. Gorczynski R. Cole E. Fung L. Ding J.W. Liu M.F. Rotstein O. Phillips M.J. Levy G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3487-3493PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cattral M.C. Levy G.A. N.

Sci. 1977; 284: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the role of the selective expression of the fgl2 prothrombinase in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced fulminant liver failure (1Parr R.L. Leibowitz L. Fung L.S. Reneker J. Myers-Mason N. Leibowitz J.L. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ning Q. Brown D. Parodo J. Cattral M. Gorczynski R. Cole E. Fung L.

Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9223-9230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studies presented here demonstrate that infection of macrophages with MHV-A59 resulted in transcription of fgl2 and elevated functional prothrombinase activity, a result similar to that observed during infection of macrophages with MHV-3. This contrasts with the results obtained with MHV-JHM and MHV-2, which do not induce elevations of prothrombinase in infected macrophages. Recombinant viruses (n = 5) which derive a portion of their genomic RNA from the 3′-region of MHV-A59 induce functional prothrombinase, whereas those containing a 3′-region derived from JHM or MHV-2 (n = 5) do not, suggesting that the 3′-portion of the genome may play an important role in the induction of fgl2transcription. The sequence differences in the genome in the 3′-area of interest lie mainly within the 5′-end of the N gene. The sequence differences in the N gene between inducers and noninducers are a 12-nucleotide deletion at nucleotides 111–123 of the coding region for the structural domain I and a 3-nucleotide insertion at 1143–1145 of the coding region for structural domain III, which may account for the inability of JHM or MHV-2 to induce fgl2. CHO cells cotransfected with the N gene construct from A59 and with thefgl2 promoter construct showed a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity in contrast to base-line or MHV-2-cotransfected cells. These findings strongly suggest that the N protein is responsible forfgl2 induction. It should be noted that induction offgl2 could not be explained by differences in virus replication, as MHV-2, a noninducer, replicates to higher titers than A59, whereas A59 replicates to higher titers than JHM. It is also of great interest that all of the recombinants of MHV-2 × A59 have the MHV-2-derived leader sequence, whereas the majority of recombinants between A59 × JHM contain the A59 leader (21Keck H.J.G. Soe L.H. Makino S. Stohlman S.A. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the leader sequence differences among viruses are responsible for the altered growth property of the virus. MHV N protein has been proposed to consists of three conserved structural domains (I basic, II basic, and III acidic) which are tethered to each other by two regions of variable amino acid composition (designated A and B) (22Parler M.M. Masters P.S. Virology. 1990; 179: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The sequence differences in the N gene between A59 and MHV-2 lie within two regions corresponding to domain I (nucleotides 400–500) and domain III (nucleotides 1100–1200), respectively. These differences may account for the inability of MHV-2 to induce the fgl2 gene. Cotransfection of an N gene expression construct with thefgl2 promoter/reporter luciferase construct in the CHO cell line confirms that the N gene of A59 accounts for induction offgl2. To confirm the specificity of the induction of N protein for the fgl2 promoter, the same experiment was performed with two irrelevant constructs. Neither showed enhancement of luciferase activity when cotransfected with fgl2 promoter construct. However, this does not suggest that the N protein will not induce the expression of other proinflammatory genes, which are important in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced hepatitis (23Pope M. Rotstein O. Cole E. Sinclair S. Parr R. Cruz B. Fingerote R. Chung S. Gorczynski R. Fung L. Leibowitz J. Rao Y.S. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5252-5260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms by which N protein induces fgl2 prothrombinase expression include the transport of the N protein into the nucleus of infected cells, acting as a transcription activator forfgl2, or modulation of signal transduction pathways that regulate host transcription machinery, or production of additional transcription factors thereby increasing the steady-state levels forfgl2 transcripts. Recent work by both nuclear runoff assays and transient transfection experiments have demonstrated that the induction of fgl2 mRNA by MHV-3 infection is at least in part attributable to new transcription (18Mackman N. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2254-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism may be N protein binding directly to fgl2 mRNA, thus altering the rate of fgl2 transcript degradation. Further experiments are now in progress to clarify the mechanisms involved. Preliminary mapping of the fgl2 promoter has defined a region from −372 to −306 to be responsive to the N protein. At present, we have not determined the precise cis-element(s) that are necessary for transcription. However, we have identified three putative cis-elements. Of particular interest, previous reports have suggested that LF-A1 was typical of a liver-specific gene and liver-enriched transcription factor. Furthermore, LF-A1 is known to regulate gene expression of coagulation factors IX, X, and XII (24Crossley M. Ludwig M. Stowell K.M. Vos P.D. Olek K. Brownlee G.G.

Additionally, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor is released by activated T lymphocytes, monocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts treated with proinflammatory cytokines (27Gasson J.C.

IE1.2 has been implicated as human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene 1 and 2 regulatory elements, providing a link between virus infection and inflammation (29Fickenscher H. Stamminger T. Ruger R. Fleckenstein B. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data do not exclude the presence of othercis-elements that might contribute to transcription offgl2, and studies now ongoing will firmly define relevant elements necessary for fgl2 transcription. Recent studies have shown that the severity of hepatic injury in patients with hepatitis B is related to the synthesis and expression of nucleocapsid protein of the hepatitis B virus, suggesting that the accumulation of hepatitis B core antigen may damage hepatocytes directly or may serve to stimulate cell-mediated immune responses (30Davies S.E.

We have recently cloned and sequenced the human prothrombinase gene (hfgl2) gene and have shown its expression in the liver of three patients with fulminant hepatic failure. 2Q. Ning, M. Liu, P. Kongkham, M. M. C. Lai, P. A. Marsden, J. Tseng, B. Pereira, M. Belyavskyi, J. Leibowitz, M. J. Phillips, and G. Levy, manuscript in preparation. Studies are now in progress to determine if hepatitis B core antigen induces transcription of hfgl2. In conclusion, mapping of genetic determinants in parental and recombinant MHV strains demonstrates that the N protein of strains of MHV which induce fulminant hepatic favor is responsible for enhanced transcription of the fgl2 prothrombinase gene. These studies may provide significant insights into the viral pathogenesis of human diseases such as hepatitis B and C in which core antigen (nucleocapsid protein) influences disease activity.

Redox potentiometry of the heme centers of DorC identified five components (n = 1) with midpoint potentials of −34, −128, −184, −185, and −276 mV. Despite the low redox potentials of the heme centers, DorC was reduced by duroquinol and was oxidized by dimethyl sulfoxide reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1998163989,"In Madin-Darby canine kidney D<sub>1</sub>cells extracellular nucleotides activate P<sub>2Y</sub> receptors that couple to several signal transduction pathways, including stimulation of multiple phospholipases and adenylyl cyclase. For one class of P<sub>2Y</sub> receptors, P<sub>2Y2</sub> receptors, this stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and increase in cAMP occurs via the conversion of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>)-generated arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandins (<i>e.g.</i> PGE<sub>2</sub>). These prostaglandins then stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, presumably via activation of prostanoid receptors. In the current study we show that agents that increase cellular cAMP levels (including PGE<sub>2</sub>, forskolin, and the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol) can inhibit P<sub>2Y</sub> receptor-promoted AA release. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 blocks this effect, suggesting that this feedback inhibition occurs via activation of PKA. Studies with PGE<sub>2</sub>indicate that inhibition of AA release is attributable to inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and in turn of P<sub>2Y</sub> receptor stimulated PLA<sub>2</sub> activity. Although cAMP/PKA-mediated inhibition occurs for P<sub>2Y</sub>receptor-promoted AA release, we did not find such inhibition for epinephrine (α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic) or bradykinin-mediated AA release. Taken together, these results indicate that negative feedback regulation via cAMP/PKA-mediated inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase occurs for some, but not all, classes of receptors that promote PLA<sub>2</sub> activation and AA release. We speculate that receptor-selective feedback inhibition occurs because PLA<sub>2</sub>activation by different receptors in Madin-Darby canine kidney D<sub>1</sub> cells involves the utilization of different signaling components that are differentially sensitive to increases in cAMP or, alternatively, because of compartmentation of signaling components."
https://openalex.org/W2031243098,"Certain corals are rich natural sources of prostaglandins, the metabolic origin of which has remained undefined. By analogy with the lipoxygenase/allene oxide synthase pathway to jasmonic acid in plants, the presence of (8R)-lipoxygenase and allene oxide synthase in the coral Plexaura homomallasuggested a potential metabolic route to prostaglandins (Brash, A.

In the present study, active preparations of G. fruticosa have been used to identify both types of arachidonic acid metabolism and specific inhibitors were used to establish the enzyme type involved in the prostaglandin biosynthesis.

Nagle D.G. Proteau P.J. Top. Curr. Chem. 1993; 167: 117-180Crossref Google Scholar). The most important representative in the field is the Caribbean gorgonian Plexaura homomalla, which contains the highest known concentration of prostanoids in Nature. The content of PGA21 and PGE2 esters in P. homomalla amounts to 2–3% of dry weight (2Weinheimer A.J. Spraggins R.L.

There have been proposals over the years that biosynthesis of prostaglandins in coral may occur by a route totally different from the vertebrate cyclooxygenase pathway (4Corey E.J. Ensley H.E.

Currently, despite the intensive studies and widespread occurrence of prostaglandins in corals, the mechanism of biosynthesis of these compounds has remained unresolved. This is mainly attributable to the inability of the coral preparations studied to form prostaglandinsin vitro (4Corey E.J. Ensley H.E. Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

Soc. 1987; 109: 289-290Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). P. homomalla and other Caribbean corals readily metabolize exogenous arachidonic acid via the (8R)-lipoxygenase pathway (6Brash A.R.

The product, (8R)-HPETE, is further converted into an allene oxide, a highly unstable epoxide (7Corey E.J. d'Alarcao M. Matsuda S.P.T. Lansbury P.T. Yamada Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 289-290Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Brash A.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1891-1892Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As one of the key properties of allene oxides is their ability to undergo cyclization to give cyclopentenone rings, this compound appeared to be a promising intermediate in the potential lipoxygenase pathway from arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (Scheme FS1,left side) (6Brash A.R.

This type of transformation has been observed in plants where allene oxide is an intermediate of biosynthesis of the five-membered carbon ring of the growth hormone, jasmonic acid (11Hamberg M. Gardner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In preparations of P. homomalla, however, the enzymatic cyclization of allene oxide to prostaglandins has not been realized (6Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Corey E.J. d'Alarcao M. Matsuda S.P.T. Lansbury P.T. Yamada Y. J. Am. Chem.

In 1993, we reported that the Arctic soft coral Gersemia fruticosa (Octocorallia, Alcyonacea,Nephtheidae) contains optically active natural prostaglandins PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, and 15-keto PGF2α (12Varvas K. Järving I. Koljak R. Vahemets A. Pehk T. Müürisepp A.-M. Lille Ü. Samel N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 3643-3646Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The content of prostaglandins of the Arctic coral (0.008% of dry weight) is several orders of magnitude lower than that of P. homomalla, but G. fruticosahas a significant ability to convert the exogenous arachidonic acid into optically active prostaglandins in vitro (12Varvas K. Järving I. Koljak R. Vahemets A. Pehk T. Müürisepp A.-M. Lille Ü. Samel N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 3643-3646Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our further work led to the isolation of the prostaglandin endoperoxide intermediate, PGG2, from G. fruticosaincubations (13Varvas K. Koljak R. Järving I. Pehk T. Samel N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 8267-8270Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is notable that it was the 15-hydroperoxy compound PGG2, not PGH2, that accumulated in short incubations even in the presence of peroxidase reducing substrates. The nature of the enzymes involved in this pathway is the subject of the present study. In vertebrates, prostaglandins are synthesized by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS) known also as cyclooxygenase. PGHS is a hemoprotein with two distinct catalytic activities: the cyclooxygenase activity involved in the formation of PGG2 from arachidonic acid, and the peroxidase activity, which catalyzes the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2 (14Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). There are two PGHS isozymes called PGHS-1 (constitutive) and PGHS-2 (inducible) (15Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). NSAIDs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin, directly target cyclooxygenase activity of both isozymes (14Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 16Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several selective PGHS-2 inhibitors have been developed to reduce the unfavored gastrointestinal side effects associated with the inhibition of PGHS-1 by traditional NSAIDs (17Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Hauser S.D. Rangwala S.H. Koboldt C.M. Seibert K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15810-15814Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 18Guo Q. Wang L.-H. Ruan K.-H. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19134-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase type enzymes have not been identified in nonvertebrate species, despite the detection of prostaglandins in various organisms. The existence of prostaglandins in plant tissue has also been reported (reviewed in Ref. 19Panossian A.G. Prostaglandins. 1987; 33: 363-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but there is evidence for the catalytic oxidation of arachidonic acid into PGF2α by one of the plant lipoxygenases (a non-heme iron dioxygenase) (20Bild G.S. Bhat S.G. Ramadoss C.S. Axelrod B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 21-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore remains unclear whether the lipoxygenase- or cyclooxygenase-related enzyme catalyzes prostaglandin synthesis inG. fruticosa. In the course of the present study, we discovered that preparations of G. fruticosa metabolize arachidonic acid to a number of additional metabolites, including those of the (8R)-lipoxygenase/allene oxide pathway. This enabled us to elucidate the possible relation of these arachidonic acid metabolites to the production of optically active prostaglandins in coral. Unlabeled arachidonic acid and biosynthetic prostaglandin standards were obtained as a generous gift from Kevelt (Tallinn, Estonia). [14C]Arachidonic acid was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; it was diluted with unlabeled arachidonic acid to the specific activity needed. Racemic HETE standards were prepared by vitamin E-controlled autooxidation (21Peers K.E. Coxon D.T. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1983; 32: 49-56Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The (8R,15S)-diHETE standard was prepared by incubation of arachidonic acid with the acetone powder of the coralP. homomalla followed by incubation of the resulting (8R)-HETE with soybean lipoxygenase (6Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tolfenamic acid and nimesulide were bought from Cayman Chemical. Aspirin, indomethacin and SnCl2 were purchased from Sigma.N,O-Bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, methoxylamine hydrochloride, and pyridine were obtained from Serva. The coral G. fruticosa was collected in the Gulf of Kandalaksha at a depth of 25–30 m and water temperature about 4 °C. The collected coral was frozen in liquid nitrogen within 5 min, transported on dry ice, and stored below −70 °C. The acetone powder of G. fruticosa was prepared by homogenization of 20 g of frozen coral with a Warning blender for 1 min at full speed in cold acetone (−20 °C). The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, the supernatant was decanted, and the procedure was repeated three times on the residual solids. The skeletal elements were removed from the mixture by swirling and decanting with cold acetone. The fine solids obtained were filtered and dried in a stream of argon at room temperature. The yield was 1–1.5 g of powder. The acetone powder was divided into aliquots and stored under argon at −70 °C. The enzyme preparations remained active for several months. 15 mg of the coral acetone powder was blended with 3 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 9, and preincubated for 5 min. The reaction was initiated with 0.4 μCi of [14C]arachidonic acid (final concentration, 100 μm) in ethanol solution. Incubations were performed at room temperature for 10 min, after which the incubation mixture was treated with SnCl2 (2 mg/ml), acidified, and the reaction products were extracted with three portions of ethyl acetate. When hydroperoxy compounds were studied, SnCl2 was omitted. The combined extracts were washed with brine, dried over potassium sulfate, and evaporated at reduced pressure to dryness. The residue was subjected to TLC analysis, and the radioactivity was monitored. The total recovery of radioactivity was about 60%. To trap the intermediates a mild reducing agent (SnCl2; final concentration, 0.5 mm) was added to the incubation mixture directly before the substrate. Incubations in the presence of SnCl2 were performed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8. For inhibition studies, the coral acetone powder was preincubated at room temperature for 5 min with various amounts of inhibitors added in a few microliters of ethanol. An equal amount of ethanol was added to the control. The reaction was initiated with 0.3 μCi of [14C]arachidonic acid (final concentration, 50 μm). The incubation was carried out for 10 min, followed by treatment with SnCl2. The products were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by TLC, and the radioactivity was monitored. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. TLC was performed using precoated plates (Silica Gel 60, 0.25 mm) from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). A solvent system (A) of benzene:dioxane:acetic acid (10:5:0.25, v/v/v) for separation of polar products and a solvent system (B) of diethyl ether:hexane:acetic acid (3:3:0.05, v/v/v) for separation of nonpolar products were used. For the product quantification, the TLC plates were cut into zones and extracted with methanol, and the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Authentic eicosanoid standards, used as markers, were visualized with an anisaldehyde spray reagent (22Kiefer H.C. Johnson C.R. Arora K.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 68: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For identification of the mono- and dihydroxy acids formed, products were separated initially by RP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm ODS column (25 × 0.46 cm) with a solvent system of methanol:water:acetic acid (80:20:0.01, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The uv spectra and the chromatograms at 205, 220, 235, and 270 nm were recorded using a Hewlett-Packard 1040A diode array detector, and the radioactivity was monitored on-line using a Radiomatic Instruments Flo-One detector. For structural characterization, the main radiolabeled peaks were methylated with ethereal diazomethane and purified by SP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm silica column (25 × 0.46 cm) and the solvent system of hexane:isopropyl alcohol:acetic acid (100:2:0.1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The steric analysis of the hydroxy products was carried out with the methyl ester derivatives by chiral-phase HPLC using a Chiralcel OB column (23Brash A.R. Hawkins D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Samples were methylated with diazomethane and purified by SP-HPLC or by TLC. The keto groups were derivatized with a 2% solution of methoxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 60 °C for 1 h. The hydroxyl groups were silylated by treatment with bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide:pyridine (2:1, v/v) at room temperature for 1 h, the solvent was removed, and the residue was dissolved in hexane. Positive-ion electron impact spectra were obtained using a Hitachi M 80-B mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV. Samples were run on an RSL fused silica capillary column (10 m × 0.53 mm) with temperature programming from 180 to 300 °C at 15°/min. [14C]Arachidonic acid was metabolized by G. fruticosa acetone powder to a complex mixture of oxygenated compounds. The products were separated by TLC in solvent systems A and/or B, followed by monitoring of the radioactivity. Typically, the reaction product pattern obtained with solvent system A consisted of the four well separated polar bands (about 19–25% of recovered radioactivity) co-migrated with natural mammalian prostaglandin standards and gave color reactions with anisaldehyde spray reagent characteristic of the corresponding prostaglandins (Fig.1 A). The prostaglandins PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, and 15-keto PGF2α formed from the exogenous arachidonic acid with theG. fruticosa acetone powder were characterized earlier by HPLC, GC-MS, 13C NMR, and optical rotation measurements in comparison with authentic standards (12Varvas K. Järving I. Koljak R. Vahemets A. Pehk T. Müürisepp A.-M. Lille Ü. Samel N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 3643-3646Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The main nonpolar products 8-KETE, 8-HPETE, and 8- hydroxy-9-ketoeicosatrienoic acid (20–22%), and unchanged arachidonic acid (30–35%) unresolved in the first solvent system were separated using solvent system B (Fig.1 B). When [14C]arachidonic acid was incubated with the coral acetone powder in the presence of a mild reducing agent to trap peroxy intermediates to the corresponding hydroxy compounds, TLC analysis with solvent system A showed three main bands (Fig.1 C). These products were completely separated by RP-HPLC (see Fig. 2 and text below). When identical oxygenations were carried out using a heat-inactivated coral enzyme (at 80 °C for 40 min), no detectable radioactive products were obtained.Figure 2RP-HPLC analysis of [14C]arachidonic acid metabolites formed in G. fruticosa incubations. [14C]Arachidonic acid (0.4 μCi; final concentration, 100 μm) was incubated with the coral acetone powder in the presence of the reducing agent SnCl2 (final concentration, 0.5 mm) at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction mixture was acidified, and the products were extracted with ethyl acetate. HPLC was carried out on a Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm ODS column with a solvent system of methanol:water:acetic acid (80:20:0.01, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; the solvent was changed into 100% methanol to elute arachidonic acid. The radioactivity was monitored on-line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to detect hydroperoxides, the TLC plates eluted in solvent system B were sprayed with the ferrous thiocyanate spray reagent. One compound with RF 0.52 showed a positive reaction. This compound was scraped from the plate, extracted with methanol and reduced with NaBH4 to get a slightly more polar product. The uv spectra of both unreduced and reduced compound had λ max at 235 nm, which is typical of a conjugated diene chromophore. The identity of the reduced compound as 8-HETE was confirmed by GC-MS analysis of the methyl ester Me3Si ether derivative. The mass-spectrum had characteristic ions at m/z 265 (base peak, represents cleavage of the C7–C8 bond); 375 (M−31); 391 (M−15), and a molecular ion at m/z 406. This arachidonic acid metabolite was identified in the band withRF 0.44 in solvent system B. The compound was scraped from the TLC plate and extracted with methanol. An aliquot of the extract was derivatized and analyzed by GC-MS. The mass spectrum of the methyl ester methoxime Me3Si ether derivative was identical to that of the 8-hydroxy-9-ketoeicosa-5,11,14-trienoic acid formed from arachidonic acid in P. homomalla incubations (6Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mass spectrum has characteristic ion fragments atm/z 243 (C1–C8), 310 (M − 141, loss of C1–C7), 420 (M − 31), 436 (M − 15), and 451 (M+). The reduction of the keto-hydroxy compound with NaBH4 led to the formation of two more polar diastereomers. The mass spectra of the methyl ester Me3Si ether derivatives of the two diastereomers gave the same prominent ions at m/z 243 (C1–C8), 345 (C1–C9), 355 (M − 141, loss of C1–C7), 481 (M − 15), and 496 (M+), which are characteristic of the spectra of the same derivative of 8,9-dihydroxyeicosa-5,11,14-trienoic acid. The isolation of α-ketol (the major product of nonenzymatic hydrolysis of unstable allene oxide), which shared 7–9% of total radioactivity, is indicative of the occurrence of an active allene oxide synthase in G. fruticosa. In addition to 8-HPETE and α-ketol, one more arachidonic acid metabolite, having about 10% of total radioactivity, was detected in the nonpolar region (RF 0.62 in solvent system B). The uv spectrum of this compound had λmax at 280 nm, which is characteristic of the conjugated dienone. The compound was identified as 8-KETE by its conversion into 8-HETE on treatment with NaBH4. The reduced compound comigrated with 8-HETE standard on TLC and had a uv absorbance maximum at 235 nm. The mass spectrum of the methyl ester Me3Si ether derivative of the reduced compound confirmed the identity as that of 8-HETE. In order to simplify product quantification in enzyme inhibition studies, the number of labeled oxygenated metabolites was diminished by the immediate reduction of the peroxy intermediates formed with a mild reducing agent, SnCl2, to the corresponding hydroxy compounds. Additionally, the prevention of hydroperoxy acids from further transformations allowed us to isolate several minor HETEs not detectable in the absence of SnCl2. The incubation products were examined by TLC and RP-HPLC. Typical profiles of the labeled metabolites formed are shown in Figs. 1 C and 2. The only prominent peak in the prostaglandin region had the retention time of 5.0 min, and it was co-chromatographed with PGF2α standard. The structural and stereochemical identity of the coral PGF2α with the mammalian's has been shown previously (12Varvas K. Järving I. Koljak R. Vahemets A. Pehk T. Müürisepp A.-M. Lille Ü. Samel N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 3643-3646Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The second peak had the retention time of 7.2 min and co-chromatographed with authentic (8R,15S)-diHETE. Furthermore, the uv spectrum of the compound from peak 2 had λmax of 268 nm and shoulders at approximately 258 and 278 nm, which were similar to those of authentic (8R,15S)-diHETE. GC-MS analysis of the methyl ester Me3Si ether derivatives confirmed the identity of this compound as 8,15-diHETE. The spectra had prominent ions at 173 (cleavage of C14–C15 bond), 243 (cleavage of C8–C9 bond), 353 (cleavage of C7–C8 bond), 423 (M − 71, loss of C16–C20), 404 (M − 90), 463 (M − 31), 479 (M − 15), and 494 (M+). The retention time of the peak 5 was identical to that of authentic 8-HETE. Moreover, the chromatogram showed two radioactive peaks, 3 and 4, with the retention times of 16.5 and 17.4 min corresponding to those of authentic 15-HETE and 11-HETE, respectively. The uv spectra of the material of peaks 3, 4, and 5 were typical of conjugated diene chromaphores and had λmax near 235 nm. The identity of the products to 8-, 11-, and 15-HETE was confirmed by co-chomatography of their methyl ester derivatives with the respective standards on SP-HPLC. The products were subjected to GC-MS analysis as methyl ester Me3Si ether derivatives. Peak 3 had a spectrum identical to that of the corresponding derivative of authentic 15-HETE. Characteristic ion fragments were observed at m/z values of 173 (C15–C20); 225 (M − 181, loss of C1–C10); 335 (M − 71, loss of C16–C20), and 391 (M − 15). Peak 4 was identified as 11-HETE, with characteristic ion fragments at m/z values of 225 (base peak, cleavage of the C10–C11 bond), 316 (M − 90), 375 (M − 31), 391 (M − 15), and 406 (M+). Peak 5 had a mass spectrum identical to that of the corresponding derivative of authentic 8-HETE. The enantiomeric composition of the products was determined by chiral-phase HPLC of their methyl ester derivatives (23Brash A.R. Hawkins D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The uv chromatograms monitored at 235 nm showed that 15-HETE was predominantly in the 15S conformation (93.6%), 11-HETE consisted mainly of R-enantiomer (89%), and 8-HETE was mostlyR-enantiomer (96.5%) (Fig.3). The effect of typical mammalian cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, indomethacin, and tolfenamic acid) was tested against the product formation in coral G. fruticosa. Usually, 0.5 mm SnCl2 was included in the incubation mixture. Experiments with indomethacin and tolfenamic acid indicated that the influence of SnCl2 on the enzyme inhibition was not considerable. Tolfenamic acid was found to be the most potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis among the drugs tested. The IC50values were estimated to be 0.45 μm in the presence of the reducing agent and 0.65 μm when SnCl2 was omitted. 5 μm tolfenamic acid decreased the prostaglandin formation by 90% in both cases. The IC50 values for indomethacin were determined to be between 10 and 20 μm. Dose-response curves for inhibition of coral enzymes by tolfenamic acid and indomethacin are shown in Fig. 4,A and B, respectively. The irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor, aspirin, was found to inhibit the prostaglandin forming activity in coral with the IC50values of 0.6 mm. As in case of mammalian cyclooxygenases, aspirin inhibited the coral enzyme in a time-dependent manner. For inhibition of the enzyme with 200 μm aspirin, the half-life (t 1/2) was approximately 25 min; with 300 μm aspirin, t 1/2 was about 10 min. The dose-response curves and the time course for inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by aspirin are shown in Fig. 4,C and D, respectively. Furthermore, NSAIDs blocked the (11R)-HETE synthesis in a dose-dependent manner to 50% of initial activity. The amount of (15S)-HETE was too low to determine whether this product was inhibited or not, but the accumulation of 15-HETE following aspirin treatment of the coral enzyme was not observed. The selective inhibitor of PGHS-2, nimesulide, was found to be a poor inhibitor of prostaglandin catalyzing enzyme in coral and did not affect the prostaglandin synthesis even at very high concentrations up to 1 mm. In side by side incubations, these high concentrations of nimesulide completely blocked the activity of mammalian PGHS-1 (ram seminal vesicle cyclooxygenase) for which it is aless potent inhibitor than it is for PGHS-2. The (8R)-lipoxygenase/allene oxide synthase pathway was not blocked by NSAIDs. Otherwise, the formation of 8-HETE even increased with increasing concentrations of NSAIDs (Fig. 4, A–C). The results of this study show that the acetone powder of G. fruticosa converts exogenous arachidonic acid into a complex mixture of oxygenation products. One dominating group of metabolites is formed via the (8R)-lipoxygenase/allene oxide synthase and the other via the cyclooxygenase pathway. This is the first report of both biosynthetic capabilities in the same organism. Products of the (8R)-lipoxygenase pathway consist of (8R)-HPETE, 8-KETE, and α-ketol. When incubations were performed in the presence of a mild reducing agent, only (8R)-HETE was formed, confirming that 8-KETE and α-ketol are formed from 8-HPETE as a common hydroperoxide intermediate. Notably, although the co-incubation with a reducing agent blocked the allene oxide pathway (α-ketol synthesis), it did not eliminate the prostaglandin biosynthesis in the same incubations. We also isolated and identified 8-HETE as an endogenous component of G. fruticosa. Thus,G. fruticosa is different from P. homomalla and the other g"

W., Minamisawa, S., Price, R. L., Becker, K. D., Hickey, R., Ross, J., Jr., and Chien, K. R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 1252–1256). As gene dosage of some myofibrillar proteins can affect muscle function, we have analyzed heterozygous mutants in depth. Ventricles of heterozygous mutants displayed a 50% reduction in mlc-2v mRNA, yet expressed normal levels of protein both under basal conditions and following induction of cardiac hypertrophy by aortic constriction. Heterozygous mutants exhibited cardiac function comparable to that of wild-type littermate controls both prior to and following aortic constriction. There were no significant differences in contractility and responses to calcium between wild-type and heterozygous unloaded cardiomyocytes. We conclude that heterozygous mutants show neither a molecular nor a physiological cardiac phenotype either at base line or following hypertrophic stimuli. These results suggest that post-transcriptional compensatory mechanisms play a major role in maintaining the level of MLC-2v protein in murine hearts. In addition, as our mlc-2v knockout mutants were created by a knock-in of Cre recombinase into the endogenous mlc-2v locus, this study demonstrates that heterozygous mlc-2v cre knock-in mice are appropriate for ventricular specific gene targeting. Our previous study of homozygous mutants of the ventricular specific isoform of myosin light chain 2 (mlc-2v) demonstrated that mlc-2v plays an essential role in murine heart development (Chen, J., Kubalak, S.

Mechanisms by which these proteins are assembled remain largely unknown. The genetic approach of inactivating genes encoding specific sarcomeric proteins has been used to understand the role of stoichiometry in sarcomeric assembly. One important issue is the gene dosage effect of these proteins on muscle organization and function.Drosophila heterozygous mutants with one functional copy of either actin or myosin heavy chain (MHC)1 gene have dysfunctional flight muscle, cannot fly, and have abnormal sarcomeric structure (1Beall C.J. Sepanski M.A. Fyrberg E.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mutants display a 50% reduction in either actin or MHC protein, respectively. Interestingly, the sarcomeric structure of muscle from double heterozygous mutants with single copies of both actin and MHC genes is less abnormal than muscle from either of the single heterozygous mutants. Consequently, double heterozygotes are capable of weak flight (1Beall C.J. Sepanski M.A. Fyrberg E.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data indicate that variations in sarcomeric protein stoichiometry can affect myofibrillar organization and function. Recently, similar studies have been performed in mouse knockout models. Heterozygous α-MHC knockout mice have ∼50 and 25% reductions in α-MHC mRNA and protein, respectively, compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous mice have impaired cardiac function and abnormal sarcomeric organization (2Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Boivin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). On the other hand, heterozygous α-tropomyosin knockout mice display a 50% reduction in mRNA but similar levels of α-tropomyosin protein compared with wild-type littermates and have no detectable cardiac abnormalities (3Blanchard E.M. Iizuka K. Christe M. Conner D.A. Geisterfer L.A. Schoen F.J. Maughan D.W. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,4Rethinasamy P.

However, to date, no studies have been performed with these mutant mice to examine the consequences of the heterozygous state on cardiac function under conditions that induce hypertrophy.Myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2), the regulatory myosin light chain, plays an essential role in vertebrate smooth muscle contraction (5Allen B.G.

However, a recent gene targeting study has revealed a selective requirement for the ventricular specific isoform of mlc-2 (mlc-2v) in embryonic murine heart function (12Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Minamisawa S. Price R.L. Becker K.D. Hickey R. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1252-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Homozygous mlc-2v mutant embryos die at approximately embryonic day 12.5. The null mutants have a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Ultrastructural analysis revealed defects in sarcomeric assembly. These data indicate thatmlc-2v plays an important role in cardiac function and myofibrillogenesis during mammalian heart development. Moreover, it has been shown that missense mutations in the human MLC-2v gene result in a rare form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (13Poetter K. Jiang H. Hassanzadeh S. Master S.R. Chang A. Dalakas M.C. Rayment I. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). However, there are no data to distinguish whether the disease results simply from “loss” of function (gene dosage) or an alternative mechanism.Drosophila has a single mlc-2 gene, and homozygous mlc-2 mutants are embryonic lethal. Heterozygous mutants can survive, but cannot fly due to dysfunctional flight muscles that display abnormal sarcomeric structure (14Warmke J. Yamakawa M. Molloy J. Falkenthal S. Maughan D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1523-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These heterozygous mutants display a 50% reduction in mlc-2 mRNA with a 25% reduction in MLC-2 protein compared with wild-type lit4termates. To determine whether mlc-2v exhibits a similar gene dosage effect in mammalian hearts, we have performed in-depth analyses of heterozygous mlc-2v mutant mice.Furthermore, we created the original mlc-2v knockout mice (12Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Minamisawa S. Price R.L. Becker K.D. Hickey R. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1252-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) by a knock-in of Cre recombinase into the endogenousmlc-2v locus to achieve two goals: 1) to understand the physiological importance of mlc-2v in mammalian hearts and 2) to use the heterozygous mlc-2v cre knock-in mice for ventricular cardiomyocyte-specific gene targeting, as described by Chen et al. (15Chen J. Kubalak S. Chien K. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1943-1949PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that heterozygous mlc-2v cre knock-in mice are indistinguishable from wild-type mice in all aspects and display normal levels of MLC-2v protein despite a 50% reduction in mRNA. Thus, we have validated the potential utility of themlc-2v cre knock-in system as a valuable approach for ventricular restricted gene targeting.DISCUSSIONThere were two main goals for this study: 1) to determine whethermlc-2v exhibits a gene dosage effect in mammalian heart and 2) to evaluate the validity of utilizing mlc-2v cre knock-in mice for ventricular specific gene targeting. Our previous study revealed that mlc-2v null mutants are embryonic lethal at ∼12.5 post coitum due to cardiac dysfunction and exhibit abnormal sarcomeric assembly (12Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Minamisawa S. Price R.L. Becker K.D. Hickey R. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1252-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which suggests thatmlc-2v plays an essential role in cardiac function and myofibrillogenesis during development. However, this study has shown that, although heterozygous mlc-2v mice display a 50% reduction in mlc-2v mRNA levels, they exhibit no reduction in endogenous MLC-2v protein levels. Heterozygous mice have neither a molecular nor a physiological cardiac phenotype either at base line or following hypertrophic stimuli. These results suggest that, due to post-transcriptional regulation, a singlemlc-2v allele is sufficient to produce normal levels of MLC-2v protein and to maintain normal sarcomeric function and development in mouse heart. In addition, our results provide the first evidence that this post-transcriptional regulation can operate following induction of cardiac hypertrophy. In a transgenic approach by other investigators, a 10-fold overexpression of mlc-2vmRNA in murine ventricle failed to increase expression of MLC-2v protein (22Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that mlc-2v is strictly regulated at the post-transcriptional level in murine heart.A similar post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism has been observed for α-tropomyosin, where overexpression of α-tropomyosin mRNA or the presence of a single α-tropomyosin allele does not affect normal levels of α-tropomyosin protein in murine heart (3Blanchard E.M. Iizuka K. Christe M. Conner D.A. Geisterfer L.A. Schoen F.J. Maughan D.W. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Rethinasamy P.

These data may suggest that haploinsufficiency is not a causative mechanism for human hypertrophic cardiomyopathies that result from mutations inMLC-2v (13Poetter K. Jiang H. Hassanzadeh S. Master S.R. Chang A. Dalakas M.C. Rayment I. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) or in α-tropomyosin (23Thierfelder L. Watkins H. MacRae C. Lamas R. McKenna W. Vosberg H.P. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 701-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). However, whether similar post-transcriptional regulation of these myofibrillar proteins is operative in human heart is currently unknown. In contrast to these results with MLC-2v and α-tropomyosin, heterozygous α-MHC knockout mice, in which cardiac function is impaired, display ∼50 and 25% reductions in α-MHC mRNA and protein, respectively. These results suggest that two MHC alleles are necessary and that post-transcriptional regulation cannot maintain normal protein levels in murine hearts (2Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Boivin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Another compensatory mechanism has been demonstrated in cardiac α-actin knockout mice. Cardiac α-actin heterozygous mutants exhibit increased expression of various actin isoforms to compensate for reduced cardiac α-actin protein expression (24Kumar A. Crawford K. Close L. Madison M. Lorenz J. Doetschman T. Pawlowski S. Duffy J. Neumann J. Robbins J. Boivin G.P. O'Toole B.A. Lessard J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4406-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In heterozygous mlc-2v mutants, this type of compensatory mechanism involving other isoforms does not seem to be activated, as our data showed that there was no detectable MLC-2a protein in adult ventricles of heterozygous mlc-2v mutants. These results indicate that post-transcriptional controls play a major role in determining overall sarcomeric protein stoichiometry under conditions of increased or decreased mRNA levels.There is only one mlc-2 gene in Drosophila. Interestingly, heterozygous mlc-2 mutants can survive but cannot fly due to dysfunctional flight muscles, which display abnormal sarcomeric structure. Heterozygous mutants display a 50% reduction in mlc-2 mRNA with a 25% reduction in MLC-2 protein (14Warmke J. Yamakawa M. Molloy J. Falkenthal S. Maughan D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1523-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, mlc-2 exhibits a gene dosage effect in Drosophila indirect flight muscle. Similar results have also been shown in Drosophila heterozygous mutants with one functional copy of either actin or MHC gene (1Beall C.J. Sepanski M.A. Fyrberg E.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mechanisms regulating myofibrillar protein expression are specific for each gene locus in a species-dependent manner.Gene targeting and transgenesis are strong tools for understanding thein vivo function of a gene of interest. However, a disrupted gene sometimes results in embryonic lethality, which makes it difficult to undertake further studies, particularly for genes associated with heart development (15Chen J. Kubalak S. Chien K. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1943-1949PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sucov H.M. Dyson E. Gumeringer C.L. Price J. Chien K.R. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Moreover, conventional gene targeting may not determine whether a given phenotype is due to gene ablation in a particular cell type, if the targeted gene is expressed in diverse cell types. Conditional knockout and transgenesis strategies can overcome these limitations (26Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kuhn R. Betz U.A. Muller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). mlc-2v knockout mutants were created by a knock-in strategy to insert the Cre recombinase coding sequence into the endogenous mlc-2v locus (12Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Minamisawa S. Price R.L. Becker K.D. Hickey R. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1252-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The mlc-2vgene is the earliest marker of ventricular specification during murine cardiogenesis. Thus, the mlc-2v cre knock-in mice can be used for ventricular specific conditional gene targeting. Recently, we achieved ventricular cardiomyocyte-specific gene targeting of the retinoid X receptor α gene by crossing heterozygousmlc-2v cre knock-in mice with mice homozygous for a “floxed” retinoid X receptor α gene (15Chen J. Kubalak S. Chien K. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1943-1949PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory and others have been creating other ventricular specific knockout mice by crossing our mlc-2v cre knock-in mice with various mouse lines containing floxed alleles of interest (27Hirota H. Chen J. Betz V.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of utmost importance to fully characterize the heterozygous mlc-2v cre knock-in mice, as all of these conditional knockout mice will be heterozygous at themlc-2v locus. This study has demonstrated thatmlc-2v cre knock-in mice do not exhibit apparent cardiac phenotypes either at base line or following a hypertrophic stimulus. Thus, we conclude that the mlc-2v creknock-in system is a valid approach for further ventricular specific knockout strategies to explore molecular mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy and heart development.

Drosophila has a single mlc-2 gene, and homozygous mlc-2 mutants are embryonic lethal. Heterozygous mutants can survive, but cannot fly due to dysfunctional flight muscles that display abnormal sarcomeric structure (14Warmke J. Yamakawa M. Molloy J. Falkenthal S. Maughan D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1523-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These heterozygous mutants display a 50% reduction in mlc-2 mRNA with a 25% reduction in MLC-2 protein compared with wild-type lit4termates. To determine whether mlc-2v exhibits a similar gene dosage effect in mammalian hearts, we have performed in-depth analyses of heterozygous mlc-2v mutant mice. Furthermore, we created the original mlc-2v knockout mice (12Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Minamisawa S. Price R.L. Becker K.D. Hickey R. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1252-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) by a knock-in of Cre recombinase into the endogenousmlc-2v locus to achieve two goals: 1) to understand the physiological importance of mlc-2v in mammalian hearts and 2) to use the heterozygous mlc-2v cre knock-in mice for ventricular cardiomyocyte-specific gene targeting, as described by Chen et al. (15Chen J. Kubalak S. Chien K. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1943-1949PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that heterozygous mlc-2v cre knock-in mice are indistinguishable from wild-type mice in all aspects and display normal levels of MLC-2v protein despite a 50% reduction in mRNA. Thus, we have validated the potential utility of themlc-2v cre knock-in system as a valuable approach for ventricular restricted gene targeting. DISCUSSIONThere were two main goals for this study: 1) to determine whethermlc-2v exhibits a gene dosage effect in mammalian heart and 2) to evaluate the validity of utilizing mlc-2v cre knock-in mice for ventricular specific gene targeting. Our previous study revealed that mlc-2v null mutants are embryonic lethal at ∼12.5 post coitum due to cardiac dysfunction and exhibit abnormal sarcomeric assembly (12Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Minamisawa S. Price R.L. Becker K.D. Hickey R. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1252-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which suggests thatmlc-2v plays an essential role in cardiac function and myofibrillogenesis during development. However, this study has shown that, although heterozygous mlc-2v mice display a 50% reduction in mlc-2v mRNA levels, they exhibit no reduction in endogenous MLC-2v protein levels. Heterozygous mice have neither a molecular nor a physiological cardiac phenotype either at base line or following hypertrophic stimuli. These results suggest that, due to post-transcriptional regulation, a singlemlc-2v allele is sufficient to produce normal levels of MLC-2v protein and to maintain normal sarcomeric function and development in mouse heart. In addition, our results provide the first evidence that this post-transcriptional regulation can operate following induction of cardiac hypertrophy. In a transgenic approach by other investigators, a 10-fold overexpression of mlc-2vmRNA in murine ventricle failed to increase expression of MLC-2v protein (22Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that mlc-2v is strictly regulated at the post-transcriptional level in murine heart.A similar post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism has been observed for α-tropomyosin, where overexpression of α-tropomyosin mRNA or the presence of a single α-tropomyosin allele does not affect normal levels of α-tropomyosin protein in murine heart (3Blanchard E.M. Iizuka K. Christe M. Conner D.A. Geisterfer L.A. Schoen F.J. Maughan D.W. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Rethinasamy P.

These data may suggest that haploinsufficiency is not a causative mechanism for human hypertrophic cardiomyopathies that result from mutations inMLC-2v (13Poetter K. Jiang H. Hassanzadeh S. Master S.R. Chang A. Dalakas M.C. Rayment I. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) or in α-tropomyosin (23Thierfelder L. Watkins H. MacRae C. Lamas R. McKenna W. Vosberg H.P. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 701-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). However, whether similar post-transcriptional regulation of these myofibrillar proteins is operative in human heart is currently unknown. In contrast to these results with MLC-2v and α-tropomyosin, heterozygous α-MHC knockout mice, in which cardiac function is impaired, display ∼50 and 25% reductions in α-MHC mRNA and protein, respectively. These results suggest that two MHC alleles are necessary and that post-transcriptional regulation cannot maintain normal protein levels in murine hearts (2Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Boivin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Another compensatory mechanism has been demonstrated in cardiac α-actin knockout mice. Cardiac α-actin heterozygous mutants exhibit increased expression of various actin isoforms to compensate for reduced cardiac α-actin protein expression (24Kumar A. Crawford K. Close L. Madison M. Lorenz J. Doetschman T. Pawlowski S. Duffy J. Neumann J. Robbins J. Boivin G.P. O'Toole B.A. Lessard J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4406-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In heterozygous mlc-2v mutants, this type of compensatory mechanism involving other isoforms does not seem to be activated, as our data showed that there was no detectable MLC-2a protein in adult ventricles of heterozygous mlc-2v mutants. These results indicate that post-transcriptional controls play a major role in determining overall sarcomeric protein stoichiometry under conditions of increased or decreased mRNA levels.There is only one mlc-2 gene in Drosophila. Interestingly, heterozygous mlc-2 mutants can survive but cannot fly due to dysfunctional flight muscles, which display abnormal sarcomeric structure. Heterozygous mutants display a 50% reduction in mlc-2 mRNA with a 25% reduction in MLC-2 protein (14Warmke J. Yamakawa M. Molloy J. Falkenthal S. Maughan D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1523-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, mlc-2 exhibits a gene dosage effect in Drosophila indirect flight muscle. Similar results have also been shown in Drosophila heterozygous mutants with one functional copy of either actin or MHC gene (1Beall C.J. Sepanski M.A. Fyrberg E.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mechanisms regulating myofibrillar protein expression are specific for each gene locus in a species-dependent manner.Gene targeting and transgenesis are strong tools for understanding thein vivo function of a gene of interest. However, a disrupted gene sometimes results in embryonic lethality, which makes it difficult to undertake further studies, particularly for genes associated with heart development (15Chen J. Kubalak S. Chien K. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1943-1949PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sucov H.M. Dyson E. Gumeringer C.L. Price J. Chien K.R. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Moreover, conventional gene targeting may not determine whether a given phenotype is due to gene ablation in a particular cell type, if the targeted gene is expressed in diverse cell types. Conditional knockout and transgenesis strategies can overcome these limitations (26Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kuhn R. Betz U.A. Muller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). mlc-2v knockout mutants were created by a knock-in strategy to insert the Cre recombinase coding sequence into the endogenous mlc-2v locus (12Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Minamisawa S. Price R.L. Becker K.D. Hickey R. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1252-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The mlc-2vgene is the earliest marker of ventricular specification during murine cardiogenesis. Thus, the mlc-2v cre knock-in mice can be used for ventricular specific conditional gene targeting. Recently, we achieved ventricular cardiomyocyte-specific gene targeting of the retinoid X receptor α gene by crossing heterozygousmlc-2v cre knock-in mice with mice homozygous for a “floxed” retinoid X receptor α gene (15Chen J. Kubalak S. Chien K. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1943-1949PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory and others have been creating other ventricular specific knockout mice by crossing our mlc-2v cre knock-in mice with various mouse lines containing floxed alleles of interest (27Hirota H. Chen J. Betz V.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of utmost importance to fully characterize the heterozygous mlc-2v cre knock-in mice, as all of these conditional knockout mice will be heterozygous at themlc-2v locus. This study has demonstrated thatmlc-2v cre knock-in mice do not exhibit apparent cardiac phenotypes either at base line or following a hypertrophic stimulus. Thus, we conclude that the mlc-2v creknock-in system is a valid approach for further ventricular specific knockout strategies to explore molecular mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy and heart development.

Previous results indicated that a treatment of T67 cells with the combination of LPS plus IFNγ, by affecting NOS-I activity, also inhibited NO production in a very short time. Here, we report that under basal conditions, a NOS-I protein of about 150 kDa was weakly and partially tyrosine-phosphorylated, as verified by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Furthermore, LPS plus IFNγ increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I, with a concomitant inhibition of its enzyme activity. The same effect was observed in the presence of vanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatases. On the contrary, genistein, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I, enhancing its enzyme activity. Finally, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we have observed that a suboptimal induction of NOS-II mRNA expression in T67 cells was enhanced by vanadate (or l-NAME) and inhibited by genistein. Because exogenous NO has been found to suppress NOS-II expression, the decrease of NO production that we have obtained from the inactivation of NOS-I by LPS/IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation provides the best conditions for NOS-II expression in human astrocytoma T67 cells.

NO synthase(s) constitutive Ca2+-dependent NOS isoform lipopolysaccharide interferon-γ Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester polymerase chain reaction Nitric oxide is a major messenger molecule that is generated by a family of enzymes, termed NO synthases (NOS) (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Stuehr D.J.

Persichini T. Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E. Caldarera C.M. Sogos V. Lauro G.M. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26731-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), suggesting an involvement of physiological NO levels, as produced by cNOS, in preventing the accidental or unfavorable induction of NOS-II expression. Paradoxically, in cell types (e.g. astroglial cells) expressing both constitutive and inducible NOS, the induction of the latter should be a rare event, unless the NO produced by constitutive NOS is preventively and quickly down-regulated. In this respect, we have further demonstrated that in human astroglial cells,Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFNγ), two common inducers of NOS-II expression (7Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), elicited a decrease in NO synthesis. This effect was mediated by a very fast inhibition of NOS-I activity, without affecting the NOS-I mRNA transcription (8Colasanti M. Cavalieri E. Persichini T. Mollace V. Mariotto S. Suzuki H. Lauro G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7582-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Here, we used human astrocytoma T67 cells, as an astroglial model, for a better understanding of the biochemical mechanism of the fast NOS-I inactivation and successive NOS-II induction. In this respect, we hypothesize that the rapid inhibition of NOS-I activity by NOS-II inducers (i.e. LPS plus IFNγ) in astroglial cells may be mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsNω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Serotype 0127:B8) were obtained from Sigma (Milan, Italy). Human recombinant interferon-γ (IFNγ) was supplied by Biogen SA (Geneva, Switzerland; specific activity, 2 × 107 IU mg protein−1) andl-2,3,4,5-[3H]arginine by Amersham. Recombinant rat neuronal NOS was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).MethodsPreparation of Astrocytoma CellsHuman astrocytoma T67 cells were obtained from explant of III WHO gemistocytic astrocytoma and were characterized in our laboratory, as described previously (9Lauro G.M. Di Lorenzo N. Grossi M. Maleci A. Guidetti B. Acta Neuropathol. 1986; 69: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisFor the immunoprecipitation of NOS-I, T67 cells (1 × 106cells/sample) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and equal amounts of proteins were incubated with an anti-NOS-I polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), diluted 1:30, for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added, and the mixture was incubated for additional 30 min. After three washes, the samples were boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and blotted to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and incubated for 2 h, with the anti-NOS-I polyclonal antibody being diluted (1:1000) in the blocking buffer. After extensive washing, a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added. In some experiments, a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (RC20 from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy).Assay of Astrocytoma NOS ActivityNOS activity was estimated by measuring the conversion ofl-2,3,4,5-[3H]arginine tol-2,3-[3H]citrulline according to the modification of the method described by Bredt and Snyder (10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 human astrocytoma T67 cells were homogenized with Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (5-mm blade) for 60 s in 200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For Ca2+-dependent activity, after centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), an aliquot of the supernatant was added to a reaction mixture of a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 nm[3H]arginine, 1 μm arginine, 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm EDTA, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 1 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μm FAD, 0.1 mm (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-biopterin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For Ca2+-independent activity, 1.2 mm CaCl2 and 1 μg/ml calmodulin were omitted from and 1 mm EGTA was added to the reaction mixture. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.4 ml (1:1) of slurry of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Bio-Rad, Na+ form) in 50 mmHEPES, pH 5.5. and after 15 min of shaking, radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. The enzyme activity was linear up to 15 min of incubation. Specific enzyme activity was calculated as pmol of citrulline formed in 1 min by 1 mg of protein.

Whole RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT)12–18 as primer. PCR was carried out withTaq DNA polymerase in an automatic DNA thermal cycler (GeneAmp 2400, Perkin-Elmer). NOS-II cDNA amplification was obtained as described previously (6Colasanti M. Persichini T.

The bands so obtained were quantified with Fluor-STM MultImager (Bio-Rad). In addition, the NOS-II-amplified DNA fragment was purified after gel extraction (using Qiaquick gel extraction kit, purchased from Qiagen GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany). The nucleotide sequence was determined using the AmpliCycleTM sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) by direct cycle sequencing with Taq DNA polymerase and 35S-labeled dCTP according to the manufacturer's instructions. As expected, we found that the nucleotide sequence of the PCR product from T67 cells displayed 99% identity with NOS-II cDNA (from 3131 to 3580) of human hepatocytes (GenBankTM accession number L09210). The mRNA for the constitutive glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was examined as the reference cellular transcript. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA amplification products (195 base pairs) were present at equivalent levels in all cell lysates. The reaction was performed using specific primers as described elsewhere (13Genis P. Jett M. Bernton E.W. Boyle T. Gelbard H.A. Dzenko K. Keane R.W. Reswnick L. Mizrachi Y. Volsky D.J. Epstein L.G.

Cavalieri E. Persichini T. Mollace V. Mariotto S. Suzuki H. Lauro G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7582-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that in endothelial cells, the rapid inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent NOS activity (e.g.NOS-III) seems to be associated with the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue(s) of the enzyme (14Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27237-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Here, we have evaluated the tyrosine phosphorylation state of NOS-I protein in human astrocytoma T67 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a NOS-I protein from the soluble fractions of T67 cell homogenates was evidenced. The molecular mass was about 150 kDa, as was that from recombinant rat neuronal NOS, used as a positive control. Moreover, under basal conditions, NOS-I protein immunoprecipited from T67 cells was weakly and partially tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1 B,lane 1). When T67 cells were treated with LPS (10 μg/ml) plus IFNγ (1000 units/ml) for 30 min, tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I was enhanced (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The same effect, even more marked, was observed in the presence of vanadate (1 mm for 2 h), an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Moreover, a pretreatment with vanadate for 2 h was able to increase LPS/IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I (Fig.1 B, lane 4). On the contrary, preincubation of both LPS/IFNγ-treated and untreated T67 cells with an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, genistein (1 mm for 2 h), completely abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 6, respectively).As described previously, homogenates of unstimulated T67 cells exhibited a basal NOS-I activity (8Colasanti M. Cavalieri E. Persichini T. Mollace V. Mariotto S. Suzuki H. Lauro G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7582-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The elimination of free Ca2+ by EGTA (1 mm) from the reaction mixture almost totally abolished this activity (Fig.2), confirming that the isoform of the enzyme was Ca2+-dependent. To verify the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation state of NOS-I on its enzyme activity, we used genistein, which decreases the tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I protein (Fig. 1). In this respect, a preincubation of T67 cells with 1 mm genistein for 2 h enhanced basal NOS-I activity (Fig. 2), the weak, constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme being likely reduced. On the contrary, a 30-min treatment of T67 cells with LPS (10 μg/ml) plus IFNγ (1000 units/ml), which increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I protein (Fig. 1), strongly inhibited NOS-I activity (Fig. 2). When LPS/IFNγ-stimulated T67 cells were preincubated with 1 mm genistein for 2 h, NOS-I activity was completely restored to reach the same effect as obtained with genistein alone (Fig. 2). Also, the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in modulating NOS-I activity was confirmed using vanadate, which increased tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I protein (Fig. 1 B). In this respect, the treatment of T67 cells with vanadate alone (1 mm for 2 h) reduced the basal level of NOS-I activity, in the same manner as LPS plus IFNγ (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on NOS-I activity in human astrocytoma T67 cells. Homogenates of unstimulated T67 cells exhibited a basal NOS activity (control). The presence of EGTA (1 mm) in the assay mixture abolished this activity, demonstrating that the enzyme isoform was a Ca2+-dependent NOS. A 30-min treatment of T67 cells with LPS (10 μg/ml) plus IFNγ (1000 units/ml) strongly inhibited NOS-I activity. A preincubation (for 2 h) of LPS/IFNγ-stimulated T67 cells with 1 mmgenistein, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, completely restored LPS/IFNγ-decreased NOS-I activity. A pretreatment (for 2 h) of T67 cells with 1 mm vanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, reduced the basal level of NOS-I activity in T67 cells. Values are expressed as the percentage of NOS activity versus untreated T67 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Taken together, our results suggest that the balance between a native and a tyrosine-phosphorylated form as well as the enzymatic activity of NOS-I can be controlled by the activity of protein-tyrosine kinase(s) and phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase(s). Moreover, by affecting tyrosine phosphorylation, NOS-II inducers (e.g. LPS and IFNγ) quickly inhibit NOS-I activity, thereby providing the best conditions for NOS-II induction. To verify this hypothesis, we have analyzed the effect of the tyrosine phosphorylation on NOS-II mRNA expression as induced by suboptimal concentrations of LPS plus IFNγ in human astrocytoma T67 cells. As shown in Fig.3, incubation of T67 cells with a suboptimal concentration of LPS (10 μg/ml) plus IFNγ (100 units/ml) for 8 h induced a less pronounced NOS-II mRNA expression (lane 2) than observed in the treatment with the optimal concentration of LPS (10 μg/ml) plus IFNγ (1000 units/ml) (lane 3). When T67 cells were incubated with the suboptimal concentration of LPS plus IFNγ, a NOS inhibitor l-NAME (1 mm) caused a NOS-II mRNA overexpression (see lane 6), indicating that a rapid NOS inactivation facilitated the induction of NOS-II expression. The present results are in agreement with our previous reports indicating that NO exerts a suppressive effect on NOS-II expression (6Colasanti M. Persichini T. Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E.

On the other hand, when T67 cells were treated with the suboptimal concentration of LPS plus IFNγ, preincubation (for 2 h) with 1 mm vanadate, which enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I (Fig. 1 B) causing a NOS-I inhibition (Fig. 2), induced a NOS-II mRNA overexpression (Fig. 3,lane 4). Our observations are in agreement with previous results indicating a requirement for protein-tyrosine kinase activation as part of the process of NOS-II induction in several cell types (17Akarasereenont P.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C208-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this may reflect the need to switch off cNOS enzyme activity.As a whole, our results confirm our previous reports suggesting that a change in endogenous NO levels may be a key factor in regulating the induction of NOS-II expression in human astrocytoma cells as well as in rat neutrophils (8Colasanti M. Cavalieri E. Persichini T. Mollace V. Mariotto S. Suzuki H. Lauro G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7582-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Mariotto S. Cuzzolin L. Adami A. Del Soldato P. Suzuki H. Benoni G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1105-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this respect, affecting the NOS-I tyrosine phosphorylation, NOS-II inducers (e.g. LPS and IFNγ) elicit a rapid inactivation of the enzyme, leading to a decrease of basal NO levels (8Colasanti M. Cavalieri E. Persichini T. Mollace V. Mariotto S. Suzuki H. Lauro G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7582-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings can explain how NOS-II inducers are able to provide the best conditions for the induction of NOS-II expression, thereby resolving an apparent paradox. Nitric oxide is a major messenger molecule that is generated by a family of enzymes, termed NO synthases (NOS) (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 2Moncada S. Higgs A. Furchgott R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 137-142PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nathan C. J. Clin.

Biol. 1998; 2: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).1 There are at least three distinct isoforms of NOS; two enzymes (NOS-I and NOS-III, also called cNOS) are constitutively expressed in neurons, endothelial cells, and glial cells, and one inducible NOS (NOS-II) is expressed after stimulation with endotoxin and/or cytokines in a number of cells including macrophages, neutrophils, hepatocytes, and glial cells. Recently, we have reported that in human microglial cells, which do not express cNOS, low concentrations of exogenous NO suppressed the induction of NOS-II expression (6Colasanti M. Persichini T. Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E. Caldarera C.M. Sogos V. Lauro G.M. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26731-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), suggesting an involvement of physiological NO levels, as produced by cNOS, in preventing the accidental or unfavorable induction of NOS-II expression. Paradoxically, in cell types (e.g. astroglial cells) expressing both constitutive and inducible NOS, the induction of the latter should be a rare event, unless the NO produced by constitutive NOS is preventively and quickly down-regulated. In this respect, we have further demonstrated that in human astroglial cells,Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFNγ), two common inducers of NOS-II expression (7Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), elicited a decrease in NO synthesis. This effect was mediated by a very fast inhibition of NOS-I activity, without affecting the NOS-I mRNA transcription (8Colasanti M. Cavalieri E. Persichini T. Mollace V. Mariotto S. Suzuki H. Lauro G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7582-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we used human astrocytoma T67 cells, as an astroglial model, for a better understanding of the biochemical mechanism of the fast NOS-I inactivation and successive NOS-II induction. In this respect, we hypothesize that the rapid inhibition of NOS-I activity by NOS-II inducers (i.e. LPS plus IFNγ) in astroglial cells may be mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsNω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Serotype 0127:B8) were obtained from Sigma (Milan, Italy). Human recombinant interferon-γ (IFNγ) was supplied by Biogen SA (Geneva, Switzerland; specific activity, 2 × 107 IU mg protein−1) andl-2,3,4,5-[3H]arginine by Amersham. Recombinant rat neuronal NOS was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).MethodsPreparation of Astrocytoma CellsHuman astrocytoma T67 cells were obtained from explant of III WHO gemistocytic astrocytoma and were characterized in our laboratory, as described previously (9Lauro G.M. Di Lorenzo N. Grossi M. Maleci A. Guidetti B. Acta Neuropathol. 1986; 69: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisFor the immunoprecipitation of NOS-I, T67 cells (1 × 106cells/sample) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and equal amounts of proteins were incubated with an anti-NOS-I polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), diluted 1:30, for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added, and the mixture was incubated for additional 30 min. After three washes, the samples were boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and blotted to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and incubated for 2 h, with the anti-NOS-I polyclonal antibody being diluted (1:1000) in the blocking buffer. After extensive washing, a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added. In some experiments, a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (RC20 from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy).Assay of Astrocytoma NOS ActivityNOS activity was estimated by measuring the conversion ofl-2,3,4,5-[3H]arginine tol-2,3-[3H]citrulline according to the modification of the method described by Bredt and Snyder (10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 human astrocytoma T67 cells were homogenized with Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (5-mm blade) for 60 s in 200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For Ca2+-dependent activity, after centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), an aliquot of the supernatant was added to a reaction mixture of a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 nm[3H]arginine, 1 μm arginine, 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm EDTA, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 1 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μm FAD, 0.1 mm (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-biopterin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For Ca2+-independent activity, 1.2 mm CaCl2 and 1 μg/ml calmodulin were omitted from and 1 mm EGTA was added to the reaction mixture. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.4 ml (1:1) of slurry of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Bio-Rad, Na+ form) in 50 mmHEPES, pH 5.5. and after 15 min of shaking, radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. The enzyme activity was linear up to 15 min of incubation. Specific enzyme activity was calculated as pmol of citrulline formed in 1 min by 1 mg of protein. Values are expressed as the percentage of NOS activity versus untreated T67 cells. Protein concentration in the samples was determined by the method of Bradford (11Bradford M.M. Anal.

Deletions in the 5′ regions of three different transcription initiation sites from pea, soybean, andOenothera identified a crucial AT-rich sequence element (AT-Box) comprising nucleotide positions −14 to −9 relative to the first transcribed nucleotide. Transversion of the AT-Box sequence to comple- mentary nucleotide identities results in an almost complete loss of promoter activity, suggesting that primary structure rather than a simple accumulation of adenines and thymidines in this region is essential for promoter activity.

Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 294-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic origin of the organellar DNAs implies that cis-elements engaged in the expression of the organellar genetic information might be similar to the respective control structures of modern bacteria. Such a similarity is indeed found in chloroplasts, where several components of the genetic system show a close structural and functional relationship to their prokaryotic counterparts (2Sugita M. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Many chloroplast promoters for instance resemble the −10/−35-type promoters of contemporary prokaryotes. These promoters serve as cis-elements for a largely chloroplast encoded eubacteria-like RNA polymerase. Another, nuclear encoded polymerase initiates transcription at a second less well described class of promoters (3Maliga P.

In mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae a 9-base-pair-long highly conserved cis-element is found at each of the about 20 transcription initiation sites. This nonanucleotide motif autonomously supports efficient transcription initiation in vitro, with enhanced promoter activity depending on the presence of a purine at position +2 and a pyrimidine at +3. In Xenopus laevis mitochondria an eight-nucleotide-long cis-element drives bi-directional transcription initiation at two different locations. A 15-bp1 consensus motif is sufficient for basal promoter activity in mammalian mitochondria, while maximal promoter function depends on additional upstream sequence elements (10Tracy R.L. Stern D.B.

While an A-rich upstream domain contributes significantly to the maizeatp1 promoter function, such a domain appears not to be required for the cox3 promoter activity in the same species (18Rapp W. Lupold D.S. Mack S. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Caoile A.G.F.S. Stern D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4055-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial promoters in dicot plant species display a somewhat larger conserved sequence element compared with those found in monocots. Inspection of sequences adjacent to transcription initiation sites of several bona fide dicot promoters revealed a conserved nonanucleotide motif (5′(−7)-CRTAAGAGA(+2)-3′, CNM), which covers the first two transcribed nucleotides (20Binder S. Marchfelder A. Brennicke A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Functional studies, however, showed that this motif per seis not sufficient for the function of the pea atp9 promoterin vitro and that additional sequences are required (21Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have now determined these additional sequence requirements and report that essential promoter sequences require specific nucleotide identities within an 18-nucleotide region between positions −14 and +4 relative to the transcription initiation site. 5′ progressively deleted fragments of pea atp9, soybean atp9, and Oenothera rpl5 promoter region were amplified by PCR using Pfupolymerase in buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Stratagene). PCR conditions, primer pairs, and DNA templates were as follows. Peaatp9 promoter region (patp9): dp+355 and one of the oligonucleotides dp-16, dp-14, dp-12, dp-10, and dp-7 using patp9SK630 as template (21Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); soybean atp9 promoter region: Rev and one of the oligonucleotides GM-D-7, GM-D-10, GM-D-12, GM-D-14, and GM-D-16 using clone satp9XR482 as DNA template (21Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); Oenothera rpl5promoter region: OL5–3 and one of oligonucleotides L5/dp-7, L5/dp-10, L5/dp-13, L5/dp-14, and L5/dp-7 using aBamHI/HindIII clone comprising theOenothera rpl5 gene and its 5′-flanking sequences. 2Hoffmann, M., Dombrowski, S., Guha, C., and Binder, S. (1999) Mol. Gen. Genet., in press. DNA fragments were amplified with 40 cycles of 1 min at 90 °C, 1 min at 50 °C (pea atp9), 40 °C (soybean atp9), and 45 °C (Oenothera rpl5), respectively, and 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products were ethanol-precipitated and digested with the respective restriction enzymes and DpnI to remove the template DNA. After separation in agarose gels DNA fragments were cloned betweenBamHI and KpnI (patp9 and satp9) andBamHI and HindIII (orpl5) restriction sites of pBluescript vectors. For substitutions in the 3′-flanking region of the peaatp9 conserved nonanucleotide motif inverse PCR was performed with oligonucleotides LS-5–1 and LS-3–1 for clone LS-1 and LS-5–2 and LS-3–2 for mutant LS-2 on patp9SK630 and patp9SK630 Δ-172 clones as templates, respectively. Partial digestion byPstI resulted in variations of the inserted sequences. Due to cloning artifacts during construction of LS-2 an XbaI site was used for linearization instead of KpnI with construct LS-1. Primer pairs TVAT-u and atp9-decad (A/T TM), patp9–1u and patp9–1d (TM-1), patp9–2u and patp9–2d (TM-2), patp9–3u and patp9–3d (TM-3), and patp9–2uwt and patp9–2d (TM-2′) were used in the inverse PCRs for transversion of nucleotide identities within the pea atp9AT-Box, the CNM, and the 3′-flanking sequences, respectively. Inverse PCRs were exclusively performed with Klentaq polymerase (CLONTECH) in a buffer supplied by the manufacturer with 35 cycles under the following conditions: 1 min 94 °C, 1 min 46 °C (TM mutants) and 50 °C (LS mutants), respectively, and 4 min at 68 °C. After PCR the template DNA was removed by digestion with DpnI, the DNAs were separated on agarose gels and the respective fragments were ligated at 15 °C for at least 16 h. All DNA templates used in the experiments described in this report are controlled by restriction digests and complete sequence analysis. Sequences of all oligonucleotides used are available on request. About 18 pmol of each MP oligonucleotide (MP sense: 5′-ATAATAGCATAAGAGAAG-3′ and the respective antisense oligonucleotide) were denatured for 30 s at 80 °C, incubated for 20 min at 28 °C, and slowly adapted to room temperature in a total volume of 10 μl. Prior to ligation into the SmaI andEcoRV sites in pBluescript and the SnaBI site of a clone containing the pea rps14/cob spacer region, ∼9 pmol of double-stranded MP oligonucleotides were concatemerized in the presence of 12% (v/v) polyethylene glycol, 50 nmol ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 units of T4 DNA ligase. 5 μl of the concatemerized MP oligonucleotides were then cloned into pBluescript vectors and a rps14/cob clone in the presence of 0.05 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 11% (v/v) polyethylene glycol, and 10 units of T4 DNA ligase in a total volume of 15 μl. Enrichment of pea mitochondrial lysates and in vitro transcription reactions were performed as described previously (21Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Between 23 and 47 μg of lysate were used in standard assays with 100 ng of template DNA quantified both photometrically and on agarose gels. Standard methods in molecular biology were performed following Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, New York1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was done with Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeling kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cy5-labeled sequencing products were detected on line with an ALF express sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Initial studies of the mitochondrial pea atp9promoter in a homologous in vitro transcription system had confirmed the functional importance of the nonanucleotide between nucleotides −7 and +2, which is conserved between several promoters. In addition the analysis of clones containing 5′-deleted promoter regions suggested that crucial sequence information for the function of this promoter is located between nucleotide positions −25 and −8 relative to the 5′ end of the nascent transcript (21Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify the functional requirements within this region, a series of deletion clones was constructed and assayed in the in vitro transcription system. While constructs with deletions upstream of positions −25, −21, and −16 contain full promoter function, the initiation activity is significantly reduced in construct Δ-12 and completely lost in mutant Δ-7 (data not shown). For further resolution of the nucleotide requirements in the comparatively AT-rich region between positions −16 and −7, the mitochondrial sequences were deleted in smaller steps (Fig. 1, upper part). While promoter function is not impaired in constructs Δ-16 and Δ-14, activity is entirely lost in deletion clones Δ-10 and Δ-7. Partial transcription initiation activity is again observed with clone Δ-12. Independent reruns of these experiments, which were calibrated by the addition of T7 RNA polymerase-generated transcripts to the in vitro transcription assays, confirmed that the reduced amount of run-off products originated from decreased intrinsic promoter activity of this template and not from a selective loss of in vitrogenerated RNAs during the assays (Fig. 1, lower part,T7(161 Nt)). These functional analyses demonstrate that sequences extending up to nucleotide position −14 are sufficient and necessary to support transcription initiation at the peaatp9 promoter in vitro. To gain more information about the general significance of 5′ sequences in other dicot promoters, analogous deletion studies were carried out with the soybean atp9 and the Oenothera rpl5 promoters, respectively. In the assays with soybean constructs no functionally required sequences are lost upon deletion upstream of position Δ-14, but promoter activity is seriously reduced in clone Δ-12 (Fig.2). In Oenothera rpl5 deletion constructs no significant differences in transcription efficiencies were found between Δ-17, Δ-14, and Δ-13. Promoter activity is, however, completely abolished in deletions Δ-10 and Δ-7 in both soybean atp9 and Oenothera rpl5 promoters. In summary these results support the conclusion that the promoter portions downstream of nucleotide position −14 are generally sufficient and also necessary to drive transcription at mitochondrial promoters of dicot plants. This region with a high content of adenines and thymidines, which is already conspicuous in the sequence alignment of several dicot promoters, has been accordingly designated AT-Box (21Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The high content in adenosines and thymidines in the above described 5′ regions between nucleotides −14 and −8 of the mitochondrial promoters in dicot plants suggests a function of these sequences in loosening or melting of the DNA strands during the initiation process. To determine whether this concentration of A and T nucleotides per se or whether sequence specificity is important, adenosine and thymidine residues in this particular region of the pea atp9 promoter were transverted to the respective complementary nucleotides (Fig.3, upper part). The melting temperatures of the mutated and the wild type promoter regions were calculated to differ by only 0.6 °C, and thus comparable initiation efficiencies are expected if the function of this segment is confined to access strand opening of the DNA. However, in vitrotranscription assays with the mutated and wild type templates revealed that initiation is almost completely abolished by the transverted nucleotides (Fig. 3, lower part). Semiquantitatively repeated assays confirmed the significant reduction of the promoter activity. The faint signal is only visible upon long exposures, which indicates the residual promoter function to be less than 1% of the wild type activity. This observation suggests that sequences rich in adenosines and thymidines per se do not support promoter function and that this promoter segment contributes to the sequence-specific interaction(s) between the promoter and the transcriptional apparatus in dicot plant mitochondria. Insertions of 1, 3, 5, or 11 guanosine nucleotides between the AT-Box and CNM also almost completely abolished promoter function. Since promoter activity is not restored even when the distance between the two parts corresponds to a complete helix turn, the AT-Box and CNM appear to be interdependent in function (data not shown). Analogous to the definition of the 5′ border of different dicot promoters, their 3′ extent was investigated with the pea atp9 transcription initiation site. Two 8-bp segments ranging from +3 to +10 (LS-1) and from +11 to +18 (LS-2) were replaced by 15- and 14-bp insertions of alien sequences, respectively. In vitro transcription assays with both templates indicate that the exchanged sequences are not important for promoter activity at leastin vitro (data not shown). To extend this analysis further upstream into the conserved nonanucleotide motif, in three clones segments between nucleotides −3 to +2 (TM-1), +3 to +7 (TM-2), and +8 to +12 (TM-3) were transverted to the respective complementary sequences (Fig. 4 A,upper part). The correct transcripts of 355 nucleotides obtained with construct TM-3 confirmed that the region downstream of position +8 does not participate in transcription initiation in vitro. The ability to initiate transcription is however completely lost in mutants TM-1 and TM-2 (Fig. 4 A,lower part). While the loss of promoter activity in TM-1 can be explained by the disruption of the CNM, the inactivity of mutant TM-2 contradicts the relatively normal promoter activity observed with construct LS-1. To clarify these apparently inconsistent results, an additional mutant was generated, in which nucleotides +5 to +7 were transverted (Fig. 4 B, TM-2′, upper part). While in vitro transcription assays with constructs LS-1 and TM-2 confirmed the previous results, mutant TM-2′ does retain promoter activity. In summary these results show that sequences extending into transcribed regions up to nucleotide position +4 are sufficient and at least partially required to drive plant mitochondrial transcription in vitro. The above results of the functional analysis of the 5′ and 3′ regions of the pea atp9promoter imply that transcription should be initiated at an 18-bp sequence segment (−14 to +4) irrespective of 5′- and 3′-flanking regions. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (MP) representing such a mitochondrial promoter was cloned into three different sequence contexts and tested for transcription initiation (Fig.5). The MP oligonucleotides integrated into the SmaI and EcoRV restriction sites of the pBluescript multiple cloning sites show the same full promoter activity as the respective control template with this sequence in its wild type context (pS and pE, Fig. 5, A andB). Two 18-mer promoter sequences inserted in tandem into theEcoRV restriction site yield two transcription products differing by 18 nucleotides in length (pEx2, Fig.5 B). No specific transcription product is observed with the pBluescript vector alone clearly correlating transcription initiation with the integrated MP oligonucleotide(s). Insertion of the MP oligonucleotide into a SnaBI site within the pearps14/cob spacer region confers transcription initiation to this region where no promoter is observed in vivo and in vitro in the wild type sequence (data not shown). These results conclusively demonstrate that the sequence from −14 to +4 represents a fully functional di- cot plant mitochondrial promoter autonomous of adjacent sequences. The functional analyses of several promoters by deletions and transversions 5′ and 3′ to the transcription start sites show that 18 nucleotides from −14 to +4 are essential and sufficient for transcription in vitro. Insertion of the 18mer DNA segment confirms its fully competent promoter function independent of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. This comprehensive analysis thus identifies extension and structure of such a promoter. To evaluate the experimental results, the respective regions of eleven promoters from dicot plants were reinvestigated for conserved structures (Fig. 6). Only transcription initiation sites were included in this comparison, which have been unambiguously identified as such by primer extension (in vivo) and in vitro capping and/or in vitrotranscription analysis (in vitro) (12Brown G.G.

Thalheim C. Brennicke A. Binder S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar).2Most striking features within this 18-mer promoter sequence are the CNM (−7 to +2) and the upstream AT-Box (−14 to −8). Although the apparently noncanonic nucleotide identities separate these two motifs, the in vitro analyses do not support individual functions of these different promoter portions. The promoter sequence rather appears to function as a single element, in which most nucleotides are involved in sequence-specific interaction with the RNA polymerase and/or additional transcription factor(s). Deletions in the 5′ portion of three different promoters from three dicot plant species consistently show that functional sequences maximally extend to position −14. Transcription initiation at the Oenothera rpl5 construct Δ-13 occurs with an efficiency equal to clone Δ-14. This experimental result and the observation that the adenosine at position −14 is less conserved between different promoters (36%) suggest that this nucleotide position may not be crucial for the activity of all of these promoters (Figs. 1, 2, and 6). Speculations that the AT-Box may only be necessary to facilitate melting of the DNA strands are rendered highly unlikely by the almost complete loss of activity in the transverted AT-Box mutant. This sequence dependence is reflected in the high conservation at positions −13 (73% A), −12 (82% A), −11 (91% A), and −10 (73% T) within this promoter segment. These observations strongly support this part of the promoter to be involved in sequence-specific interaction with the transcription apparatus, which does of course not exclude a parallel positive influence of these AT-rich sequences on melting of the DNA strands. The increased promoter activity in constructs Δ-14 relative to Δ-16, which is reproducibly observed in independent experiments with both pea and soybean atp9 constructs, suggests that sequences upstream of position −14 may somehow modulate promoter strength. Thus substitution of nucleotide identities with negative impact on promoter activity could result in a positive effect, a phenomenon, which has to be investigated in detail by site-directed mutagenesis at these particular nucleotides. Adenosines in positions −12 to −10 have been observed to also influence the activity of the maize atp1 promoter. Substitution of the −12 A by a T or C considerably reduced the amount of run-off transcripts (between 30 and 50%) of the wild type level (18Rapp W. Lupold D.S. Mack S. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These similarities between the 5′ regions of the maizeatp1 and the dicot promoters investigated here may indicate analogous promoter structures and recognition mechanisms. In the maizecox3 promoter the respective segment was, however, found to have only a minor role in transcription initiation in vitrosuggesting major differences of sequence requirements between individual promoters in this plant species (19Caoile A.G.F.S. Stern D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4055-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Alignment and sequence comparisons of transcription initiation sites determined by in vitro capping studies identified the 5′-CRTA-3′ tetranucleotide to be conserved between monocot and dicot plant species. Consequently this motif was assigned an important role in promoter function (15Covello P.S. Gray M.W. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Nakazono M. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Plant Sci. 1995; 105: 227-234Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Various in vitro promoter studies, however, showed that deviations are accepted in the first two positions of this tetranucleotide in both plant subdivisions (18Rapp W. Lupold D.S. Mack S. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,26Yan B. Pring D.R. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).2 The small size of the motif and the relaxed sequence constraints indicate that other nucleotides must be essential for promoter function. In addition to the importance of the upstream AT-Box, the nucleotides downstream of the 5′-CRTA-3′ contribute significantly to promoter function. This is highlighted by the complete lack of initiation in the transversion mutant TM-1, in which the second half of the nonanucleotide sequence downstream of the 5′-CRTA-3′ motif is altered. The theoretical consensus deduced in the sequence comparison shows that this promoter segment contains three nucleotide positions at −2 (G), +1 (G), and +2 (A), which are 100% conserved in all compared dicot promoters. Furthermore, two adenosine residues are found at −3 and −1 with a frequency of 82%. This indicates that the 5′-CRTA-3′ motif, although present in almost all mitochondrial promoters in seed plants, only represents a small fraction of the nucleotides contributing more or less equally to the promoter function. The identification of the nonanucleotide motif had already shown that the conserved promoter core extends beyond the transcription start site. Nucleotide transversions now show that the transcribed promoter portion actually extends even further downstream, as far as nucleotide positions +3 and/or +4. Here the actual requirements on nucleotide identity may be relaxed, since not all substitutions downstream of position +2 interfere with successful transcription initiation (Fig. 5). The differing results obtained with constructs LS-1 and TM-2 may be due to the particular nucleotide identities inserted at positions +3 and +4, these being a guanosine at +3 in LS-1 and a thymidine residue in the respective position in TM-2. Although guanosine or thymidine residues are found in this position in some other promoters, at least one purine is found conserved at +3 or +4 in all wild type promoter sequences. Since TM-2 contains only pyrimidines in these positions, the loss of promoter activity of this construct could be due to the total absence of purine here. The precise requirements of nucleotide identities in these positions have to be determined by site-directed mutagenesis. The analysis of the pea atp9 transcription initiation site now shows that a mitochondrial promoter in a dicot plant covers an 18-bp sequence, which corresponds to about two helix turns. This promoter appears to act in its entirety as recognition site for components of the transcription apparatus. This may include one or two proteins, which could, similar to transcription factors in mammalian, yeast, and Xenopus mitochondria, direct a promoter-specific attachment of the RNA polymerase (10Tracy R.L. Stern D.B. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. J. Biol.

Genet. 1996; 13: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two proteins that bind to this promoter have recently been enriched; however their direct participation in the transcription initiation process remains to be shown (29Hatzack F. Dombrowski S. Brennicke A. Binder S. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All involved proteins must be in very close proximity, since contact is made with the 18-bp promoter sequence, which is rather short to accommodate attachment sites for several different proteins, particularly considering that the RNA polymerase itself already has a molecular mass of more than 100 kDa (7Hedtke B. Börner T. Weihe A. Science. 1997; 277: 809-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,30Weihe A. Hedtke B. Börner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2319-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mode by which the transcriptional apparatus identifies a promoter sequence is at present unclear, but can be refined with the results presented here. The equal efficiencies with which transcription is initiated at the tandemly repeated promoters exclude an access of the proteins by scanning the DNA with a 5′ to 3′ processivity, since such an access would result in a preferential transcription initiation at the first promoter of this construct (Fig. 5). Thus, promoter recognition in plant mitochondria rather appears to involve a homing approach of one or more of the participating proteins. The sequence requirements of mitochondrial promoters in dicot plants defined here now provide a base toward the identification of the components involved in transcription initiation. Furthermore, this refined promoter sequence will allow rapid identification of other mitochondrial promoters in this plant subdivision, e.g. in the complete sequence of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome (22Dombrowski S.

Farkas A. Theopold U. Meyer H.E. Lindholm D. Nassel D.R. Hultmark D. Friedrich P. Insect Biochem. Mol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5626-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the archaebacterium Sulfobus acidocaldarius (SAV) (14Confalonieri F. Marsault J. Duguet M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating that p97 is an ancient protein and implying a fundamental role(s) for this protein within cells. Purified p97 is a soluble, ringlike hexameric complex with each monomeric subunit containing two copies of the AAA domain. This complex is the active Mg2+-dependent ATPase, which is sensitive to the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (10Peters J.M. Walsh M.J. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 15Zhang L. Ashendel C.L. Becker G.W. Morre D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The significance of these structural and biochemical features for the cellular function of p97 has not yet been firmly established. Data from diverse origins have implicated p97 in a remarkable number of cellular processes. In S. cerevisiae, genetic analysis has shown that conditional mutants in the yeast CDC48 gene, namedcdc48–1, arrest in mitosis as large budded cells with elongated nuclei spanning the mother-daughter junction (11Moir D. Stewart S.E. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1982; 100: 547-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p97 has been proposed to function in homotypic membrane fusion events, including fusion of the endoplasmic reticulum (16Latterich M. Frohlich K.U. Schekman R. Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and the reassembly of Golgi cisternae from vesicles and tubules generated by treatment with specific drugs (17Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or mitotic cytosol (4Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Using the Golgi reassembly assay, p97's fusion-promoting activity has recently been shown to be dependent upon a stoichiometric association with a cytosolic protein termed p47 (18Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Protein interaction studies have also revealed that p97 binds to clathrin in a stoichiometric complex, suggesting a role for p97 in the endocytic cycle (19Pleasure I.T. Black M.M. Keen J.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). p97 has been shown to physically associate with Ufd3p, a protein that is involved in the regulation of free cellular ubiquitin in yeast (20Ghislain M. Dohmen R.J. Levy F. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4884-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and to copurify with the mammalian 26 S proteasome (21Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in these same experimental systems, immunodepletion or inactivation of p97 severely compromised ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of experimental substrates in vitro and in vivo (20Ghislain M. Dohmen R.J. Levy F. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4884-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar,21Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Despite the abundance of clues provided by these investigations, a common functional link relating these varied observations remains to be established, and thus the precise cellular role(s) of p97 is still obscure. To begin to understand the physiological role of p97 in mammals, we have initiated an analysis of p97 structure and function in mouse. Here we present the first description of the genomic structure of the p97 gene and a likely processed pseudogene. We also identify an upstream region that acts as a functional basal promoter and potential regulatory elements, and describe a pattern of p97 expression in mouse embryos and adults that suggests an unexpected degree of regulated expression and subcellular localization in both proliferating and differentiated tissues. A λDASH II genomic library (kindly provided by R. Mortenson, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) prepared from 129 SVJ mouse spleen was screened with a random primed 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the mouse p97 coding region spanning amino acids 2–141. Approximately 9 × 105 plaques were screened on charged nylon filters by hybridizing the p97 probe overnight at 42 °C in 1% SDS, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 50% deionized formamide, 2.5× Denhardt's, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured calf thymus DNA. Several positive clones were identified and rescreened in two additional rounds. Phage DNA was isolated and analyzed by restriction digestion and Southern blot. Restriction fragments spanning the relevant phage clones were subloned into pBSII (Stratagene) for further analysis. Purified phage DNA from three unique clones was used to determine the chromosomal location of the mouse p97 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Briefly, metaphase spreads were prepared using standard cytogenetic techniques from mouse diploid cultures and cell lines. Phage DNA was labeled with biotin dUTP by nick translation (Bionick, Life Technologies, Inc.). The labeled probe was combined with mouse Cot-1 DNA and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC, and 1% Tween 20, pH 7.0. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating slides in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin. Slides were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma) and analyzed with a Zeis Axioscop microscope. p97 subclones were sequenced with gene-specific primers using the ABI dye termination kit (Perkin Elmer). Primers were designed on the basis of the published mouse p97 cDNA sequence (22Egerton M. Ashe O.R. Chen D. Druker B.J. Burgess W.H. Samuelson L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Alignment of cDNA and genomic DNA sequence was performed by using the GCG analysis suite (version 9.0). Genomic DNA was prepared from mouse spleen using standard protocols. Restriction-digested DNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed, depurinated in 0.25 m HCl, denatured, and transferred in 0.4 m NaOH to charged nylon (GeneScreen Plus, NEN Life Science Products). Membranes were rinsed in 2× SSC, dried, and hybridized according to the manufacture's protocol. Blots were washed with 1% SDS and 0.5× SSC at 55 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The transcription start site of the p97 gene was determined by primer extension assay using two different end-labeled antisense oligonucleotides (primer 1: 5′-CCGGGGCTGGACTCGCTGAAGCGG-3′; primer 2: 5′-CTCTCGCTTCCTCCCAGGGGCACC-3′). Total RNA from mouse embryonic fibroblasts was isolated with RNAzol (Biogenesis) and divided into poly(A)+ and poly(A)− pools using oligo(dT) affinity beads (Oligotex, Qiagen). The assay was performed using standard protocols. Briefly, radiolabeled oligonucleotide was mixed with approximately 10 μg of each RNA pool and denatured for 90 min at 65 °C in 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and primer extension was initiated by addition of 10 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μg/ml actinomycin D, 0.15 mm dNTPs, and 150 units of Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 60 min. Products were separated on 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. The precise location of the transcription start site was determined by comparison to dideoxy sequencing reactions carried out using the same oligonucleotides. Three fragments containing 147 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and additionally either 410, 1434, or 3000 bp of 5′-flanking sequence were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and ligated in both orientations with respect to the predicted transcription start site into a promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL2-basic, Promega). The pGL2-control plasmid (Promega), which utilizes the SV 40 promoter/enhancer to initiate luciferase transcription, was used as a positive control. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The day before transfection, cells were split into six-well plates. On the next day, cells were transfected in triplicate with 5 μg of test plasmid using SuperFect (Qiagen). To control for transfection efficiency, an expression plasmid containing a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene was cotransfected (2 μg) with test plasmids (23Shima D.T. Kuroki M. Deutsch U. Ng Y.S. Adamis A.P. D'Amore P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3877-3883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined as described previously (24Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and used to normalize luciferase assay values. Luciferase activity in cell extracts was assayed 48 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Anti-p97 antibodies N2 and N5 were raised in rabbit against two bacterially expressed fusion proteins consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to fragments of mouse p97 (N2: amino acids 2–186; N5: amino acids 200–461). The antibodies were affinity-purified using full-length recombinant His-tagged p97 and were shown to uniquely recognize p97 in Western blot analyses of rat liver homogenate (data not shown). Immunohistochemical results obtained using N2 or N5 were indistinguishable. For analyses, samples were fixed in 3% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and dewaxed. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched, and sections were incubated with purified antibodies (0.5 μg/ml). Binding was detected by subsequent incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody and streptavidin-coupled peroxidase, followed by development with diaminobenzidine. In adult tissues, counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Samples were fixed and prepared as for immunostaining. Specific localization of p97 mRNA was accomplished by in situ hybridization using an antisense riboprobe synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase using 35S-UTP (∼ 800 Ci/mmol; Amersham, UK). The linearized template consisted of a 500-bp fragment of the mouse p97 3′-untranslated region within the plasmid backbone of pSP73. The 3′-untranslated region of sequence used to produce the riboprobe did not show significant homology to any other known gene sequences in the nucleotide data base (GenBank version 109.0). The methods for pretreatment, hybridization, washing, and dipping of slides in Ilford K5 for autoradiography were basically as described by Senior et al., for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (25Senior P.V. Critchley D.R. Beck F. Walker R.A. Varley J.M. Development. 1988; 104: 431-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications (26Poulsom R. Longcroft J.M. Jeffery R.E. Rogers L. Steel J.H. Eur. J. Histochem. 1998; 42: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of hybridizable mRNA in all compartments of the tissues studied was established in near serial sections using an antisense β-actin probe. Sections were examined under conventional or reflected light darkfield conditions (Olympus BH2 with epi-illumination) that allowed individual autoradiographic silver grains to be seen as bright objects on a dark background. To investigate the genomic structure of the mouse p97 gene, we used a probe spanning the N-terminal region of the protein to isolate three unique clones from a λ phage library. Southern blot analysis on digested phage DNA using probes spanning different regions of the published cDNA (22Egerton M. Ashe O.R. Chen D. Druker B.J. Burgess W.H. Samuelson L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was performed to further characterize the isolated clones. Two clones, designated λ1 and λ2, extended 20 and 15.6 kb, respectively, and overlapped by 3.7 kb. λ2 spanned the 5′ end and λ1 the 3′ end of the p97 cDNA sequence (Fig.1 a). A third clone, designated λ3, extended 14 kb and appeared to encompass the whole p97 coding region based on Southern blot analysis; however, initial analyses revealed that restriction patterns within the p97 coding sequence of λ3 and λ1/2 differed (Fig. 1 a). A more detailed physical map of the different p97 clones was assembled by performing single and double digestions with various restriction enzymes, and Southern blot analysis using radiolabeled probes spanning the published cDNA of p97. Comparison of the physical maps of total genomic and λ clone DNA revealed that p97 is not a single copy gene; in Southern blot analyses, we consistently found two restriction fragments in the total genomic DNA hybridizing to a p97 specific probe. One fragment corresponded to a similarly sized fragment in λ1/2, while the second fragment corresponded to a fragment in λ3, strongly suggesting the presence of two different p97 loci (results for λ2 versus λ3 are shown in Fig. 1 b). The presence of two mouse p97 loci had recently been proposed based on interspecies backcross mapping and polymerase chain reaction analysis (27Hoyle J. Tan K.H. Fisher E.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 778-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the isolated λ clones as probes confirmed this genetic analysis. The overlapping clones λ1 and λ2 reside on mouse chromosome 4 at position B2, while clone λ3 resides on chromosome X at position C-D (data not shown). The genomic structure of both genes was further characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. Analysis of the gene present in λ1/2 revealed that it was interrupted by 16 introns, and all exon-intron borders corresponded to consensus splicing signals, except the exon 14/intron 14 boundary (Fig.2 a). Exons were on average 150 bp in size, and both nucleotide-binding cassettes (2Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar) were located in single exons, exon 7 and exon 13. Intron sizes were estimated with polymerase chain reaction analysis using exon-specific primers. The location of exons relative to the restriction map was established by nucleotide sequencing of restriction sites proximal to exons, and restriction digestion analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA of the subclones (Fig. 1 a). Alignment of nucleotide sequences of λ3 to the published mouse cDNA (22Egerton M. Ashe O.R. Chen D. Druker B.J. Burgess W.H. Samuelson L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) revealed that this gene contained the complete coding region of p97 without disrupting introns. Several mutations were identified, including a substitution of Val207 to Ile and a deletion of Gln569, Ala570, Ala571, Pro572, and Cys573. A polyadenylation signal and a poly(A) stretch were found in the region corresponding to the 3′ end of the published cDNA. Each end of the gene was flanked by a direct repeat of 8 nucleotides. The structure of the gene encoded by λ3 had all the hallmarks expected of a processed pseudogene (designated herein as ψp97) (28Vanin E.F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 253-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), implying that the gene does not encode a functional product, as reported for many other pseudogenes (29Richardson M.P. Braybrook C. Tham M. Moore G.E. Stanier P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 206: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, alignment of data base cDNA sequences for p97 gene counterparts in organisms ranging from archaebacteria to mouse demonstrated that all cDNA encoded the amino acid sequence AP (found at positions 571–572 in the mouse protein), which was present in the discontinuous p97 gene (λ1/2), but which was deleted in ψp97 (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, we tentatively concluded that ψp97 most likely represents a non-functional processed pseudogene, rather than a second, independently evolved, intronless and active p97 gene. Thus, we focused our attention on the further characterization of the p97 gene locus represented by λ1/2, which appeared to encode the functional p97 mRNA. To identify the transcription start site, primer extension assays were performed. Based on the 5′ end nucleotide sequence of the p97 cDNA and the region of deviation between the p97 gene and its pseudogene, two antisense primers were designed to map the 5′ end of the p97 gene. The oligonucleotides were annealed to either purified poly(A)+ RNA or poly(A)− RNA as negative control. After reverse transcription and denaturing gel electrophoresis, a single major product was identified for each primer extension reaction. The precise transcription start site, designated +1, was determined by comparison of the migration of the products with a sequencing reaction using the same primers which were run in parallel on the gel (results for primer 1 are shown in Fig.3). A consensus mRNA-CAP site resided at the identified transcription start, thus supporting the mapping data. Both primers also gave rise to a low abundance extension product, which may correspond to a minor transcription start at position +33 (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the putative transcription initiation region demonstrated the absence of a consensus TATA sequence for RNA polymerase II-initiated transcription. Instead, an initiator element (Inr) TCTGA+1CT surrounding the predicted transcription start site, a CCAAT box at position −40, and GC-rich regions at position −80 to −150 were identified, thus revealing a common core organization found in TATA-less promoters (Fig.4) (30Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the 5′-flanking region of the p97 gene can initiate basal transcription, a fragment containing 3000 bp of the flanking nucleotide sequence and additionally 147 bp of the 5′-untranslated region of the gene was inserted in both orientations into a luciferase reporter construct and assayed for activity in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Fusion of p97 sequence to the reporter gene in the appropriate orientation resulted in approximately 75-fold increase of luciferase activity when compared with either promoterless luciferase constructs or constructs in which p97 sequence was fused in the opposite transcriptional orientation (Fig.5). Deletion of 1566 bp from the 5′ end of the promoter fragment resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in reporter activity, whereas deletion of 2590 bp resulted in activity similar to that of the full-length fragment, implying that the minimal sequence necessary for basal transcription of the p97 gene in HeLa cells maps to approximately −1 to −410 with respect to the transcription start site. Comparison of the activity of the p97 promoter fragments to an assayed construct containing the SV 40 promoter/enhancer, which was used as positive control, revealed that the p97 promoter was a relatively powerful transcriptional initiator, with p97 promoter sequences yielding 50–75% of the activity measured for the viral promoter/enhancer. The fragment containing 1434 bp of the 5′-flanking region initiated transcription of the reporter gene more efficiently than the 3000-bp fragment, indicating that potential repressor elements may reside further upstream of the basal promoter. However, more detailed studies will be required to identify the components involved in regulating transcription of the p97 gene. To provide clues about the gene regulation and potential function of p97 in vivo, we investigated the distribution of p97 protein in adult and embryonic mouse tissues by immunohistochemical staining using affinity purified antisera (see “Materials and Methods”). For adult tissue, the immunohistochemical analysis clearly showed that p97 was widespread in most investigated tissues (results from the small intestine, liver, testis, and kidney are shown in Fig. 6and summarized in Table I). However, the degree of staining between different cell types or cell differentiation states within a given tissue showed exceptional heterogeneity. This type of heterogeneity was not observed in an analysis performed in parallel for the Golgi apparatus structural protein giantin, which displayed a relatively uniform distribution in virtually all cells within the tissues examined. 2D. T. Shima and C. Ruhrberg, unpublished observation. An example of the differential expression of p97 could be observed in the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 6 a). Whereas within the villi the epithelial cells were largely positive in the cytoplasm and nucleus, the crypts, including the stem cell-rich proliferative zone, were mostly negative. Interestingly, other tissues rich in mitotic cells, such as the epidermis and the proliferative zone of the hair bulb, often showed little or no staining for p97 (data not shown).Table ISummary of the localization of p97TissueCell typeNucleusCytoplasmSmall and large intestineCryptsProliferative zone−−Bottom+/−+/−Villi++++++TestisInterstitial cells++Basal epithelial cells+/−++Suprabasal epithelial cells+++++Spermatozoa−+/−LiverHepatocytes++/−+Kupffer cells−−Bile duct cells++++KidneyTubule cells++++Glomerula cells+/−+/−SpleenLymphocytes−−Megakaryocytes+++Dorsal skinFibroblasts++Endothelial cells−−Epidermal cells++Hair bulbProliferative zone−−Outer root sheath++++PancreasAcinar cells+/−+/−BrainNeurons+/−+/−Expression levels of p97 in adult mouse tissues examined by immunohistological methods are scored from (−) to (+++); cell-to-cell heterogeneity of p97 levels was observed within given tissue, herein indicated with (+/−).

Subcellular p97 levels are indicated. As with the small intestine, cells within the liver exhibited heterogeneity in the levels of p97 protein. Yet, in contrast to the uniform cytoplasmic and nuclear staining observed in the intestinal villi, hepatocytes often showed relatively weak cytoplasmic staining and strongly positive nuclei (Fig. 6 b). Interestingly, however, nuclear staining was not seen in all hepatocytes (arrowhead in b′). Kupffer cells were consistently negative (arrow in b′), whereas the cells of the bile duct were strongly positive in both cytoplasm and nucleus (arrow in b). In testis (Fig.6 c), the interstitial cells were uniformly stained with a relatively strong cytoplasmic and a weak nuclear signal (arrowhead); however, in the seminiferous tubules, differential staining was observed between basal and suprabasal populations, suggesting heterogeneity in p97 expression during different stages of spermatogenesis. Differential levels of p97 were also observed within the kidney (Fig. 6 d). Immunohistochemical analysis of variously staged mouse embryos also revealed a widespread, but non-uniform pattern of p97 protein expression. Wholemount stainings from 9.5 and 10.5 dpc embryos suggested expression of p97 within most regions of the developing embryo, with specific elevations within the emerging limb buds, tail bud, branchial arches, and somites (Fig.7, a and b). Furthermore, immunostaining of sectioned embryos and comparison to parallel hematoxylin and eosin sections revealed that highly elevated levels of p97 were present within one layer of the somites, most likely the myotome (Fig. 7, d and e). Limb buds exhibited moderate levels of p97 throughout the mesenchyme, but higher levels of staining in a subset of cells within the apical ectodermal ridge and surface epithelium (d"

Expression of this deletion mutant in the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3 resulted in the induction of growth factor-independent proliferation. Parental 32Dcl3 cells proliferated only in the presence of exogenous murine IL-3 (mIL-3), while 32Dcl3 cells transfected with the long form of the human PRLR were able to proliferate in response to mIL-3, ovine prolactin, or human PRL. Cells expressing the Δ178 deletion mutant contained numerous phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in the absence of stimulation with either mIL-3 or ovine prolactin. Growth factor stimulation increased the number of proteins phosphorylated and the intensity of phosphorylation. These proteins included constitutively phosphorylated Janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, and SHC. Activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2) were observed in unstimulated 32Dcl3 cells expressing the Δ178 mutant. Likewise, transfection of Nb2 cells with the Δ178 deletion mutant induced growth factor-independent proliferation and constitutive activation of Janus kinase 2, ERK1, and ERK2. In addition to the induction of a growth factor-independent state, the expression of the Δ178 deletion mutant also suppressed the apoptosis that occurs when 32Dcl3 cells are cultured in the absence of growth factors such as IL-3. These data suggest that the constitutive activation of the PRLR can be achieved by deletion of the ligand binding domain and that this mutation leads to the oncogenic activation of the receptor as determined by the ability of the receptor to induce growth factor-independent proliferation of factor-dependent hematopoietic cells.

Dimerization of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases leads to the activation of their intrinsic kinases, phosphorylation of the receptor molecules themselves, and the subsequent activation of secondary signaling molecules. Members of the cytokine receptor superfamily lack intrinsic kinase activity; however, several different tyrosine kinases become activated following ligand binding. These kinases phosphorylate the receptors as well as numerous other substrates, leading to the activation of many of the same signaling pathways that lie downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. Cytokine receptors generally activate two classes of tyrosine kinases: one or more members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases as well as one or more members of the srcfamily of tyrosine kinases. Janus kinases are directly responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of a class of transcription factors referred to as STATs1 (1Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5007) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, which family of tyrosine kinases are required for the activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase cascade or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Given the critical role of these receptors in regulating cellular proliferation, it is not surprising that mutations that result in their constitutive activation are also oncogenic. At least four constitutively activated transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases have been transduced by oncogenic retroviruses: v-Erb B, v-Fms, v-Kit, and v-Ros. Erb-B, c-Fms, and c-Kit represent the receptors for epidermal growth factor, colony-stimulating factor-1, and stem cell factor, respectively (2Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes G. Scrace G. Totty N.

To date, only a single cytokine receptor has been discovered to be transduced by an oncogenic retrovirus; the v-mpl oncogene in the murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus is a truncated version of the receptor for thrombopoietin (13Wendling F.

Activating mutations have also been described in two other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily: the erythropoietin receptor and the βc subunit (β common subunit) of the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (16Longmore G.D.

The current study was undertaken to determine whether deletion of the extracellular domain of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) would lead to its constitutive activation and the ability to induce growth factor-independent proliferation of factor-dependent hematopoietic cell lines. In this report, we demonstrate that the deletion of a 178-amino acid region of the extracellular domain of the PRLR resulted in its constitutive activation and the induction of growth factor-independent proliferation. The constitutive phosphorylation of multiple proteins including JAK2, STAT5, and SHC was observed in addition to growth factor-independent activation of MAP kinase. Although previous studies by Gourdou et al. (22Gourdou I. Gabou L. Paly J. Kermabon A.Y. Belair L. Djiane J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that deletion of a region of the extracellular domain of the rabbit PRLR resulted in the constitutive activation of the receptor as determined by the PRL-independent activation of β-casein transcription, these investigators did not demonstrate the activation of any signaling molecules, the induction of growth factor-independent proliferation, or the suppression of apoptosis. Our results are discussed in the context of signal transduction by the PRLR and its role in oncogenesis. The 32D clone 3 (32Dcl3) cell line was obtained from Dr. Joel Greenberger (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) (23Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries K.C. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and it was maintained as described by Anderson and Jorgensen (24Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant murine IL-3 was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products, Inc. (Bedford, MA). Human and ovine PRL (Lots AFP-3855A and AFP-10677C, respectively) were obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (Rockville, MD). Recombinant human PRL (rhPRL) was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA) or R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The 32D/hPRLR and 32DΔ178 cell lines were generated by introducing the plasmid DNAs of interest into the 32Dcl3 cell line with a Cell-Porator (1,000 V/cm at 800 microfarads) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Electroporation chambers used had a 0.4-cm gap between the electrodes, and cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that was at room temperature without any additional supplements . Both the hPRLR and the Δ178 deletion mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which contains the neomycin resistance marker as a dominant selectable marker. Following electroporation, the cells were cultured in the presence of IL-3 for 2–3 days, and the transfected cells were selected by the addition of 1.0 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). G418-resistant cells were allowed to expand with IL-3 for 3 days, after which the drug was removed. Cells were then cultured in oPRL in the case of the 32D/hPRLR or in the absence of any growth factors in the case of 32DΔ178 cells. Single cell clones were then isolated following growth of the cells at limiting dilution in semisolid media containing 0.6% SeaPlaque agarose (FMC Corp., Freeport, ME). Isolated colonies were picked from soft agar, expanded in liquid culture, and used in the described experiments. The Nb2 cell line was obtained from Lee-Yuan Yu-Lee, and the cells were maintained as described previously (25Hunter S. Koch B.L. Anderson S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transfected clones of Nb2 cells were produced in an identical manner to that described above. A cDNA clone of the human PRLR was obtained from Paul Kelly (INSERM, Paris, France). The full-length cDNA was removed by digesting the plasmid withEcoRI, gel-purifying the 2,556-base pair insert, and inserting the DNA into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The Δ178 deletion mutant was created by digesting the full-length cDNA with both BglII and NcoI, filling in the overhangs with Klenow DNA polymerase (Life Technologies), and religating the plasmid DNA. This results in the deletion of 534 base pairs, corresponding to a deletion of 178 amino acids. Deletion of the desired fragment was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The complete cDNA fragment containing this deletion was removed by digestion with EcoRI and cloned into theEcoRI site of pcDNA3. Correct orientation of the cDNA insert in pcDNA3 was confirmed by diagnostic restriction enzyme analysis and by DNA sequence analysis from both ends of the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3. The FLAG epitope tag was added to the C-terminal end of the hPRLR and the Δ178 deletion mutant cDNAs using polymerase chain reaction. The upstream primer used in this reaction was 5′-TGTGCTTGGAATTCCCCG-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-CCGAATTCGGGTCACTTGTCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAGTCGTGAAAGGAGTG-3′. RNA was isolated from each cell line using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Twenty micrograms of total cellular RNA were size-separated in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The resolved RNAs were electrotransferred to Nytran (Schleicher and Schuell), and the RNAs were cross-linked to the membrane with a Stratagene Stratalinker (La Jolla, CA). 32P-Labeled probes to the hPRLR and to GAPDH were prepared by random priming in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 800 Ci/mmol). The rat GAPDH cDNA clone was originally obtained from Dr. Kenneth Marcu (State University of New York at Stony Brook). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar, 26Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells to be immunoprecipitated were cultured overnight in McCoy's 5A media supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped serum (HyClone; Orham, UT) to reduce the background level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Cells were then resuspended in media containing 100 units/ml recombinant murine IL-3, 100 nm (2.23 μg/ml) ovine PRL, or 0.5–1.0 μg/ml rhPRL for the indicated periods of time. Cells were lysed in either radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) or extraction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Both lysis buffers were supplemented with 100 units/ml aprotinin (Calbiochem). Agarose-conjugated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, rabbit anti-JAK2, and rabbit anti-ERK1/2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Unconjugated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was the generous gift of Brian Druker (Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR). Rabbit anti-SHC (catalogue no. S14630) and a monoclonal antibody directed against SHC (catalogue no. S14620) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-ACTIVE MAP kinase, a polyclonal antibody directed against the activated version of ERK2 that shows some cross-reaction with activated ERK1, was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit anti-STAT5 antiserum was the gift of Andrew Larner (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and a monoclonal antibody directed against STAT5 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Scientific Imaging Systems-Kodak (New Haven, CT), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma, and rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Preparation of the monoclonal antibody directed against the β-subunit of the murine IL-3 receptor has been described (27Burton E.A. Hunter S. Wu S.C. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16189-16195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was conducted as described by Anderson et al. (26Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the ECL system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells (32Dcl3, 32DΔ178, and 32D/hPRLR) were resuspended in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with or without growth factors as indicated. The number of viable cells was determined at the different time points by counting the number of cells that excluded trypan blue. Cells (20 × 106) were washed two times with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of cold membrane lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1 mmsodium orthovanadate and 100 units/ml aprotinin. Cells were broken by passage through a 31-gauge needle and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The supernatant fraction was then centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm, 4 °C to obtain a membrane fraction. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of membrane lysis buffer and passed once again through a 31-gauge needle. Membrane proteins (100 μg) were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon membranes, and immunoblotted using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or rabbit anti-FLAG probe polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of DNA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml RNase A, 4 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. DNAs were extracted from cell lysates with 400 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) mix. The salt concentration was raised to 0.25 m sodium acetate, and the DNA was precipitated by the addition of 1 ml of 100% EtOH. Following incubation at −20 °C, the DNAs were pelleted and then resuspended with 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA) with 20 μg/ml RNase A. DNAs were quantitated spectroscopically, and DNA fragmentation was examined by running 10 μg of DNA on a 1.5% agarose gel. Mutation or deletion of the ligand binding domain of numerous cytokine receptor family members has been shown to result in their constitutive activation (7Gonda T.J. D'Andrea R.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 355-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this would also hold true for the PRLR, a region of the extracellular domain of the hPRLR was deleted, and the ability of this deletion mutant to induce growth factor-independence was assessed. A cDNA clone of the hPRLR was digested with BglII and NcoI, resulting in a loss of 178 amino acids in the extracellular domain of the receptor. These restriction sites were chosen because they were unique restriction sites, they allowed removal of the majority of the extracellular ligand-binding domain, they retained the WSXWS motif, and they maintained the proper reading frame when the overhangs were filled and religated. This deleted version of the hPRLR will be referred to as hPRLRΔ178 or Δ178. The region of the hPRLR deleted is indicated in Fig. 1. The cDNAs of both the wild type hPRLR and the hPRLRΔ178 mutant were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. Both DNA molecules were introduced into the growth factor-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and G418-resistant clones were isolated and expanded for use in the described studies. The 32Dcl3 cell line is absolutely dependent upon the presence of an exogenous source of mIL-3 for proliferation and viability (28Metcalf D. Blood. 1985; 65: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cultured in the absence of IL-3 for 12–16 h, one can detect DNA fragmentation typical of cells undergoing apoptosis, and by 48–60 h no viable cells remain. Cells transfected with the hPRLR construct (32D/hPRLR cells) were capable of proliferating in mIL-3, hPRL, or oPRL; however, the parental 32Dcl3 cells only proliferated in mIL-3. In contrast, cells transfected with the hPRLRΔ178 mutant (32DΔ178) were capable of proliferating in the absence of an exogenous growth factor. Single cell-derived clones of both 32D/hPRLR and 32DΔ178 cells were obtained by plating the cells in semisolid media containing the appropriate growth factors and picking individual colonies for expansion in liquid media. A second set of constructs was made in which the FLAG epitope tag was added to the C-terminal end of the hPRLR and the Δ178 deletion mutant. All studies reported in this paper used these single cell-derived clones expressing either the untagged or FLAG-tagged molecules. Identical results were obtained with both the untagged and FLAG-tagged molecules; however, the majority of the data shown below was generated using cells expressing the untagged molecules. The proliferation of 32Dcl3, 32D/hPRLR, and 32DΔ178 cells were examined in media supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, media supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum and 10% WEHI-3 conditioned media (a source of IL-3), or media supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum and 200 ng/ml oPRL (Fig.2). All three cell lines proliferated in media supplemented with WEHI-3 conditioned media; by 72 h, the cell number of each cell line rose from 4 × 106 cells to approximately 25–35 × 106 cells. There was no significant difference in the proliferation rate of cells transfected with either hPRLR or the Δ178 mutant of the hPRLR (Fig.2 A). When cultured in media containing 7.5% fetal calf serum but lacking mIL-3, only the 32DΔ178 cells increased in number; the number of viable 32Dcl3 cells decreased, while the number of viable 32D/hPRLR cells remained approximately the same (Fig. 2 B). We suspect that the serum used in this study must have contained low levels of PRL, since the 32D/hPRLR cells remained viable, while the 32Dcl3 cells died during the first 3 days in culture. The 32D/hPRLR cells die after 5–6 days in culture in the absence of exogenously provided PRL (data not shown). We suspect that low levels of PRL present in fetal calf serum might support the viability of 32D/hPRLR cells for longer than that of the 32Dcl3 cells, which require IL-3 for proliferation and viability. Examination of the growth of the same cells in media supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum plus 200 ng/ml oPRL revealed that the parental 32Dcl3 cells decreased in number, while both the 32DΔ178 and the 32D/hPRLR cells increased in number (Fig.2 C). The results shown are an average of three different studies. Similar data were obtained with five different independent clones of each cell type. Expression of the hPRLR or the Δ178 deletion mutant in the transfected 32Dcl3 cells was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). Twenty micrograms of total cellular RNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, the separated RNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane, and the blot was probed with either a probe for the human PRLR cDNA or a GAPDH cDNA probe to demonstrate equal loading of the gel. Although there was no RNA species detected in the parental 32Dcl3 cells, a single species of RNA was detected in the cells transfected with either the hPRLR or the Δ178 expression vector (Fig.3 A). Five clones of cells that were transfected with the FLAG-tagged hPRLR molecule had equivalent amounts RNA detected with the hPRLR probe (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–5). The five clones of 32Dcl3 cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged Δ178 deletion mutant had similar amounts of RNA detected with the PRLR probe; however, it appeared that there was less RNA than in the cells expressing the hPRLR molecule (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7–11). The differences in the sizes of the RNAs observed in the 32D/hPRLR versus the 32DΔ178 cells were consistent with the size of the deletion that had been introduced into the hPRLR cDNA molecule. Reprobing the blot in Fig. 3A with the GAPDH probe revealed that roughly equal amounts of RNA were loaded in all but the 32Dcl3 cell sample (Fig. 3 B). There clearly was more GAPDH RNA present in lane 6, indicating that more 32Dcl3 cell RNA was loaded in the gel shown in Fig. 3. To demonstrate the presence of the hPRLR and Δ178 proteins in the transfected cells analyzed by Northern blot analysis, we used immunoblot analysis with an anti-FLAG epitope tag monoclonal antibody. In Fig. 3 C, the expression of the hPRLR protein in the transfected cells is demonstrated. A membrane fraction was isolated from these 32Dcl3 and 32D/hPRLR cells, 100 μg of membrane protein was resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis, and the blot was subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Clones 6, 9, and 10 of the 32D/hPRLR cells appeared to have nearly equivalent levels of the hPRLR protein, while clones 7 and 8 appeared to have lower levels of the hPRLR protein (Fig. 3 C, lanes 13–17). We were also able to detect expression of the Δ178 protein in transfected cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 D). Whole cell lysates of 32DΔ178 cells were prepared and were precleared with an irrelevant antibody (a monoclonal antibody directed against the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor) (27Burton E.A. Hunter S. Wu S.C. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16189-16195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on an SDS gel. Immunoblotting was with an unconjugated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Approximately equal amounts of the Δ178 protein were present in all four clones analyzed, although clone 12 might have slightly less protein (Fig. 3 D, lanes 19–22). The sizes of the proteins detected in the different cell lines were consistent with that expected. Since different approaches were used to detect the presence of the FLAG-tagged protein molecules in the two different cell types, we cannot directly compare the amount of Δ178 protein with that of the hPRLR. For reasons that we do not understand at this time, we were not able to detect the hPRLR by immunoprecipitating whole cell lysates, nor were we able to detect the Δ178 protein in membrane fractions prepared from 32DΔ178 cells (data not shown). Stimulation of the PRL-responsive Nb2 cell line has been shown to result in the phosphorylation of multiple proteins on tyrosine residues, including the receptor itself (29Rui H. Djeu J.Y. Evans G.A. Kelly P.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24076-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of cellular proteins was examined in cells expressing the hPRLRΔ178 mutant by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis. The pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was examined following stimulation of 32Dcl3, 32D/hPRLR, and 32DΔ178 cells with either mIL-3 or oPRL for 0, 5, or 15 min. Stimulation of either 32Dcl3 or 32D/hPRLR cells with mIL-3 resulted in the rapid appearance of proteins with molecular masses corresponding to 120–150, 95, 52, 46, and 42 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3and 7–9). The 120–150-kDa region includes many different proteins including the β-subunit of the IL-3 receptor (30Isfort R.J. Stevens D. May W.S. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A homolog of this kinase with 90% amino acid sequence identity was also found in T. pyriformis. Both kinases contain 11 subdomains typical of protein kinases. Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted amino acid sequences resemble those of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), especially p38 and stress-activated protein kinase which are known to be involved in various stress responses. However, it should be noted that the tyrosine residue in the normally conserved MAPK phosphorylation site (Thr-X-Tyr) is replaced by histidine (Thr226-Gly-His228) in thisMAPK-related kinase (MRK). The recombinant MRK expressed in Escherichia coliphosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP) and became autophosphorylated. However, the mutated recombinant protein in which Thr226 was replaced by Ala lost the ability to phosphorylate MBP, suggesting that Thr226 residue is essential for kinase activity. The MRK mRNA transcript in T. thermophila increased markedly upon temperature downshift from 35 to 15 °C (0.8 °C/min). Interestingly, osmotic shock either by sorbitol (100–200 mm) or NaCl (25–100 mm) also induced mRNA expression of the MRK in T. pyriformis. In addition, the activity of the kinase as determined by an immune complex kinase assay using MBP as a substrate was also induced by osmotic stress. This is the first demonstration of a MAPK-related kinase in the unicellular eukaryotic protozoanTetrahymena that is induced by physical stresses such as cold temperature and osmolarity.

In the natural environment Tetrahymena is subjected to fluctuations in temperature, pH, amounts of nutrients, and concentration of dissolved gases. Changes in environmental conditions have profound effects on the activities of the cell at the physiological, morphological, and biochemical levels (1Hill D.L. The Biochemistry and Physiology of Tetrahymena. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar, 2Elliott A.M. Biology of Tetrahymena. Dowden, Hutchinson & Ross, Inc., Stroudsburg, PA1973Google Scholar). For example, Tetrahymena cells adapt to cold environments by increasing the amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids, thus maintaining proper membrane fluidity (3Nozawa Y. Thompson Jr., G.A. Levandowsky M. Hunter S.H. Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa. 2. Academic Press, New York1979: 275-338Google Scholar, 4Thompson Jr., G.A. Nozawa Y. Kates M. Manson L.A. Biomebranes, Membrane Fluidity. 12. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1984: 397-432Google Scholar). This is accomplished by an increase in fatty acid desaturase activity in response to a downshift in temperature (5Nozawa Y. Umeki S. Aloia R.C. Physiological Regulation of Membrane Fluidity. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 239-257Google Scholar, 6Umeki S. Nozawa Y. Plattner H. Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology of Membranes, Membrane Traffic in Protozoa. 2B. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1993: 447-465Google Scholar). We have recently cloned the gene encoding Δ9 fatty acid desaturase that is involved in this process and demonstrated that its mRNA expression is increased in response to cold (7Nakashima S. Zhao Y. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, at present the signal transduction mechanism by which this response occurs is not clearly understood. Differential display (8Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 9Ito T. Kito K. Adati N. Mitsui Y. Hagiwara H. Sakaki Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4965-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) are two potentially useful methods to detect altered gene expression in complex RNA populations. In both methods, differential gene expression can be detected relatively easily as differences in the intensities of cDNA fragments following PCR amplification and electrophoretic separation on a gel. To this end, we have used the differential display method to analyze mRNA expression following temperature downshift of Tetrahymena thermophila. In the present study we successfully identify an mRNA which is expressed in response to cold stress. By homology analysis, its predicted amino acid sequence was found to be similar to those of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (11Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C.

Expression of this MAPK-related kinase (MRK) gene and kinase activity was also enhanced by osmotic stress inTetrahymena cells. We will discuss its possible roles in response to environmental stress. Restriction enzymes and other nucleic acid modifying enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, Toyobo, and Nippon gene. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Takara.

Commun. 1991; 175: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. O. Numata (University of Tsukuba, Japan). T. thermophila was axenically cultivated at 35 °C with constant shaking (90 strokes/min) in a medium containing 2% protease peptone, 0.2% yeast extract, and 0.5% dextrose. Cells were exposed to temperature downshift to 15 °C at a rate of 0.8 °C/min, as described previously (7Nakashima S. Zhao Y. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Umeki S. Fukushima H. Watanabe T. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 101-107Google Scholar). T. pyriformis was cultured at 28 °C. Total RNA was prepared from T. thermophila by the guanidine thiocyanate method (24Chirgiwn J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonalad R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA (0.2 μg) was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, GT15MN (M = A, C or G; N = A, C, G, or T) oligo(dT) primer (1 μm) and dNTP mixture (20 μm each) at 42 °C for 60 min. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), recovery, and reamplification of cDNAs obtained were performed as described previously (8Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 9Ito T. Kito K. Adati N. Mitsui Y. Hagiwara H. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Reverse transcriptase products from 20 ng of total RNA were amplified by PCR in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 unit of Taq polymerase, 0.5 μm arbitrary primer (AP-1 ∼ AP-10), 0.5 μm of the same GT15MN oligo(dT) primer used for reverse transcription, dNTP (2 μm), and [α-35S]dCTP (10 μCi). PCR reactions were carried out for one cycle of 3 min at 94 °C, 5 min at 40 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 2 min at 40 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C (15 min for the last cycle). The amplified cDNAs were separated on 6% denaturing sequence gels followed by autoradiography. cDNA bands specifically amplified in cold-adapted Tetrahymena cells were excised from the gels and eluted by boiling. The eluted DNA was reamplified by PCR using the same set of primers and its nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy nucleotide termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) using Sequenase. Homology search was performed using the BLAST algorithm (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institute of Health (Bethesda, MD), and DNA analysis program DNASIS. Amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the pT7Blue T-vector. One of the cDNA fragments tentatively designated number 23 was subjected to further analysis. T. thermophila and T. pyriformis λgt10 cDNA libraries (21Takemasa T. Takagi T. Kobayashi T. Konishi K. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2514-2517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Edamatsu M. Hirono M. Takemasa T. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were screened by plaque hybridization using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The cDNA inserts of positive phage clones were digested withEcoRI and then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluscriptII plasmid. Size-fractionated unidirectional deletion of the insert was performed using exonulcease III and mung bean nuclease (7Nakashima S. Zhao Y. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Amino acid alignment was performed using the computer program ClustalX (27Higgis D.G. Sharp P.H. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 5: 151-153Google Scholar). A phylogenic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (28Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Results of the molecular phylogenic analysis were analyzed by the PHYLIP software package (29Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared according to the method described by Gall (30Gall J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3078-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.5 mEDTA, 1% SDS at 55 °C for 1 h, and subjected to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. About 10 μg of DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases (BamHI, EcoRI,HindIII, KpnI, PstI, SalI,XbaI, and XhoI) and the resultant fragments were separated using a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA fragments were transferred to GeneScreen Plus membrane and fixed by baking at 80 °C for 2 h. The membrane was then probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe generated from the cloned DNA. The blots were then visualized by exposure of Kodak X-Omat film. For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus filters. Northern hybridization was performed as follows. After prehybridization for 4 h at 42 °C in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 1m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, Denhardt's solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Ficoll 400, and 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone), filters were incubated with 32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 42 °C. Probe was made by random primer labeling using the Multiprime DNA labeling system according to the manufacture's protocol. Filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03m trisodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS at 45 °C for 30 min and in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min, and exposed to Kodak O-Xmat AR film. The density of each band was measured by a densitometer (Atto, Densitograph, Tokyo, Japan). In order to express T. pyriformis MRK in Escherichia coli orSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the codons TAA and TAG, which are recognized as glutamine in Tetrahymena (21Takemasa T. Takagi T. Kobayashi T. Konishi K. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2514-2517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Horowitz S. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2452-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Cupples C.G. Pearlman R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5160-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), were first mutated to the universal glutamine codons CAA and CAG, respectively, by in vitro mutagenesis as reported (33Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Substitution of Thr226 by Ala was also performed byin vitro mutagenesis. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing with the dideoxy nucleotide termination method. TheT. pyriformis MRK cDNAs were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated proteins in E. coli. For experiments usingS. cerevisiae, cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pNV7s (34Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nomoto S. Yasuda H. Reed S.I. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The peptide RLRELFIEEIKRYH, corresponding to the COOH-terminal peptide of MRK was synthesized and conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits and affinity purified against the peptide conjugated to Sepharose 6B. Tetrahymena proteins were extracted in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm Na2MoO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (100 μg/400 μl) was mixed with 5 μg of the purified antibody and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to the tubes and incubation was continued for another 1 h. The precipitate was washed three times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and twice in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA. Kinase reactions were performed in 20 μl of a buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 0.5 mg/ml MBP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Phosphorylated MBP was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The bands on the autoradiogram were quantified by an image analyzer (Atto Densitograph, Atto, Tokyo). The wild type (Thr226) and mutant (Ala226) recombinant MRKs were generated as GST fusions in E. coli NM522 by incubating with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The expressed proteins were purified as described above or with glutathione-Sepharose, and essentially the same results were obtained with both purification methods. The activities of GST-conjugated MRKs were measured with MBP as a substrate, as described above. Tetrahymena proteins were extracted as described above. Extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 9% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. Blocking was performed in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skimmed milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were probed with antibodies against the COOH-terminal peptide of MRK. Detection was performed with the ECL system. Protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay using BSA as a standard. S. cerevisiae hog1Δ mutant strain TM232 and a plasmid pJB30 containing theHOG1 gene were described elsewhere (12Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 35Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Yeasts were transformed with plasmids and transformants were selected as described previously (36Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The transformants were tested for growth in the presence of 1 m sorbitol at 30 °C for 2 days. RNA was extracted from T. thermophila cells grown at 35 °C and cells harvested at 1 h after shifting to 15 °C. These RNA samples were subjected to differential display analysis using 10 arbitrary primers (AP-1 ∼ AP-10) and two anchored primers (GT15MG and GT15MA). Approximately 1,500 bands ranging from 100 to 400 base pairs in size were successfully amplified. Most of the bands did not display significant changes in intensity between the cells cultured at 35 °C and 15 °C, but several bands did show differences (data not shown). Differential expression of these latter mRNAs was confirmed by Northern blot analysis using the cDNA fragments as probes. A cDNA fragment (number 23, 348 base pairs) amplified with GT15MA and AP-7 recognized about 1.7 kilobase pairs mRNA which was markedly expressed in cells shifted to 15 °C. Using this cDNA fragment as a probe, a T. thermophila λgt10 cDNA library (21Takemasa T. Takagi T. Kobayashi T. Konishi K. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2514-2517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Edamatsu M. Hirono M. Takemasa T. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was screened and the full-length cDNA was isolated. Its counterpart in T. pyriformis was also obtained by screening a T. pyriformis λgt10 cDNA library (21Takemasa T. Takagi T. Kobayashi T. Konishi K. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2514-2517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Edamatsu M. Hirono M. Takemasa T. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the same probe. The entire nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1. An open reading frame encodes a protein of 430 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 49 kDa in both T. thermophila and T. pyriformis. Their deduced amino acid sequences showed 90% identity and contained 11 conserved amino acid domains (I-XI) characteristic of protein kinases (37Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences with the NIH Protein Bank data base using blastx search (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar) revealed that they were similar to MAPKs (Fig. 2). The deduced amino acid sequence of T. thermophila gene showed 40% sequence identity with human ERK1 (11Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), 39% with Arabidopsis thaliana ATMPK3 (17Mizoguchi T. Hayashida N. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Kamada H. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), 39% with Nicotinia tabacum NTF3 (18Wilson C. Eller N. Gartner A. Vicente O. Heberle-Bors E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 38% with yeast HOG1 (12Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), and 38% with human p38 (13Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the amino acid sequences of MAPKs are divergent between subdomains VII and VIII. Subdomains VII and VIII are separated by a gap of 6 amino acids in p38 and HOG1. However, this gap is 8 amino acids in JNK and 12 amino acids in ERK. In Tetrahymena, this gap covers 57 amino acids. In addition, the Tetrahymenakinase has another gap between subdomains IX and X. Whereas most of the MAPKs consist of a total of 360 ∼ 380 amino acids (11Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), these additional amino acids between VII and VIII, and IX and X make the Tetrahymena proteins larger than most of the MAPKs. A phylogenic tree, constructed by the neighbor-joining method, showed that Tetrahymena kinase is more closely related to the stress-activated MAPKs such as p38 and JNK/SAPK than to the ERKs (Fig.3). Members of the MAPK family possess three conserved residues Thr-X-Tyr in the subdomain VIII and are enzymatically activated by phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues therein (38Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 39Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). However, in Tetrahymena Thr is conserved but Tyr is replaced by His. The partial sequence of a gene described as a “Plasmodium falciparum MAPK-like protein” found in the NIH Protein Bank data base (GenBank accession numberX98689) also has a His at the corresponding position (Thr-Ser-His). Based on these sequence comparisons we designate thisTetrahymena kinase as a MRK. Southern blot hybridization was performed in order to ascertain whether only a single homolog of this MRK is present in Tetrahymena. Genomic DNA (10 μg) fromT. pyriformis was digested with restriction endonucleases and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nylon membrane, the membrane was probed with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled starting DNA clone (number 23, as above). A single band was recognized in each lane under high-stringency conditions (data not shown).Figure 2Sequence comparison of 11 conserved kinase domains of the two Tetrahymena MRK and other MAPK family kinases.

By screening a mammalian cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid cloning technique, we isolated a ubiquitin-homology protein, DAP-1, which specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic death domain of TNF-R1. Sequence analysis reveals that DAP-1 shares striking sequence homology with the yeast SMT3 protein that is essential for the maintenance of chromosome integrity during mitosis (Meluh, P. B., and Koshland, D. (1995) Mol. Biol. Cell 6, 793–807). DAP-1 is nearly identical to PIC1, a protein that interacts with the PML tumor suppressor implicated in acute promyelocytic leukemia (Boddy, M. N., Howe, K., Etkin, L. D., Solomon, E., and Freemont, P. S. (1996) Oncogene 13, 971–982), and the sentrin protein, which associates with the Fas death receptor (Okura, T., Gong, L., Kamitani, T., Wada, T., Okura, I., Wei, C. F., Chang, H. M., and Yeh, E. T. (1996) J. Immunol. 157, 4277–4281). The in vivo interaction between DAP-1 and TNF-R1 was further confirmed in mammalian cells. In transient transfection assays, overexpression of DAP-1 suppresses NF-κB/Rel activity in 293T cells, a human kidney embryonic carcinoma cell line. Overexpression of either DAP-1 or sentrin causes apoptosis of TNF-sensitive L929 fibroblast cell line, as well as TNF-resistant osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS. Furthermore, the dominant negative Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) protein blocks the cell death induced by either DAP-1 or FADD. Collectively, these observations highly suggest a role for DAP-1 in mediating TNF-induced cell death signaling pathways, presumably through the recruitment of FADD death effector.

Two types of TNF receptors were identified: TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, with approximate molecular masses of 60 and 80 kDa, respectively. TNF-R1 has diverse biological activities including the induction of apoptosis and NF-κB/Rel activation (5Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). These biological activities are mediated by several TNF-receptor associated signaling proteins. Among these, the TNF-receptor associated death domain protein (TRADD) (5Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar, 6Hsu H.

The TNF-receptor associated factors (TRAFs) transduce cell proliferation and survival signals through the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, AP-1, and NF-κB/Rel transcription factors (6Hsu H.

In particular, TRAF2 was shown to be essential for c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, but not NF-κB/Rel, activation and regulates lymphocyte proliferation and survival (14Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A.

These include NF-κB/Rel activation (25Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,26Stancovski I. Baltimore D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Recently, many proteins with homology to ubiquitin were identified. These ubiquitin-homology (UbH) proteins constitute an expanding protein family with diverse biological activities. For instance, RAD23 is involved in DNA excision repair (30Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), SIII p18 elongin protein is necessary for efficient transcription elongation (31Garrett K.P.

Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar), and sentrin is one of the Fas death receptor associated proteins (4Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). Another yeast UbH protein, Smt3p, is involved in centromere stability during mitosis (1Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated by Johnson et al.(2Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) that the activation of Smt3p can be activated by two enzymes with homology to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1. Activation of Smt3p by the E1-like enzymes leads to cleavage and exposure of the diglycine residues near the carboxyl-terminal, which permit conjugation of Smt3p to the protein substrates. Although activation of the UbH protein pathway occurs in a similar fashion to that of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathways, they remain distinct in that activation of the UbH proteins, such as Smt3p, results in substrate conjugation instead of protein degradation. This distinction suggests that these parallel pathways are likely to be regulated independently. It remains obscure as to how these UbH proteins are regulated in response to external stimuli and whether some of these UbH proteins are associated with receptor-signaling mechanisms, such as the TNF receptor system. Due to the diversity of TNF biological activities, it is conceivable that multiple intracellular molecules are involved in its signal transduction. Here, we report the identification of a novel UbH protein, DAP-1, which specifically interacts with the death domain of TNF-R1 and can trigger programmed cell death in a variety of cell lines. All TNF-R1-pEG202 constructs containing various portions of TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pEG202 vector so that the TNF-R1 cytoplasmic fragment was in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain (32$$Google Scholar, 33Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Constructs A, B, C, and D encode peptides corresponding to amino acids 207–333, 207–403, 261–425, and 334–425 of the TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain, respectively. The HeLa cDNA library, kindly provided by Dr. Roger Brent, was generated by cloning cDNA into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of PJG4–5 vector in fusion with the LexA transcription activation domain (32$$Google Scholar, 33Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DAP-1, sentrin, and FADD cDNAs were subcloned into theXbaI and HindIII sites of the CDM8 expression vector with the hemagglutinin tag (HA tag) at the NH2terminus of the cDNAs. The FADD-DN-CD2 and pBMN-LacZ expression constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Yongwon Choi (Rockefeller University) and Garry Nolan (Stanford University), respectively. The pCMV-LacZ construct contains β-galactosidase gene under the regulation of CMV promoter. To evaluate any intrinsic transcription activity of the four bait constructs, the bait plasmids TNF-R1/pEG202(his+) were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid PSH18–34/LacZ(ura+) into yeast strain EGY48, by Me2SO and heat shock method (32$$Google Scholar, 33Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Transfectants were plated on Glu/CM-Ura,-His drop out plates, and incubated at 30 °C overnight. For each construct, 12 colonies were streaked onto Glu/CM-Ura,-His dropout plates. Colonies were lifted onto nylon filter, soaked in Z buffer containing 1 mg/ml X-gal, and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min to monitor for color changes. Only construct D gave rise to white colonies (no intrinsic transcription activity). Constructs A–C gave rise to light blue colonies. TNF-R1-pEG202 construct D was utilized as the bait for screening interacting proteins in HeLa cDNA library following the published protocol with the following modification. Thirty milligrams of library plasmid, pJG4.5/cDNA(trp+), plus 2 mg of salmon sperm carrier DNA, were transfected into the yeast strain, EGY48(leu+) cells, which were already pretransformed with the bait construct, TNF-R1/pEG202(his+), and the reporter plasmid, pSH18–34/LacZ(ura+). Transfection was facilitated by 40% polyethylene glycol 4000, followed by 10% Me2SO. After incubation at 42 °C for 10 min, transfectants were plated on Gal/CM-His,-Ura-Trp-Leu plates and further incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. A total of 4 × 106 colonies from library transformations were screened on Glu/CM-His,-Ura-Trp-Leu plates. Next, blue colonies were plated onto the four-criteria plates: Glu/CM-His,-Ura-,Trp,-Leu; Gal/CM-His,-Ura-,Trp,-Leu; Glu/X-gal/CM-His,-Ura-,Trp; and Gal/X-gal/CM-His,-Ura-,Trp-plates. The positive clones were selected based on their ability to grow and turn blue on Gal/X-gal/CM-His-Ura-Trp plates, but not on Glu/X-gal/CM-His,-Ura-,Trp plates. The TNF-R1 interacting cDNA clones in yeast vector (pJG4.5/cDNA) were transformed into bacteria strain, KC8, and colonies were cultured in 10 ml of medium overnight at 30 °C prior to lysate preparation. Bacterial or cell pellets were lysed in 300 μl of 1 × RIPA buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, Triton X-100, SDS, deoxycholate, EDTA, pH 7, NaCl) at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein samples were resolved on 10% SDS acrylamide mini-gel (Bio-Rad mini-gel system) with 150 volts for 1 h and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by semi-drier apparatus (Bio-Rad) with 20 volts for 20 min. Membranes were blocked with 1 × TBST (0.05% Tween 20, 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0), 4% milk for 1 h, washed with 1 × TBST, and hybridized with anti-HA tag antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Following 3 × 10-min washes, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. The antibody-coated membrane was developed by ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed by autoradiography. Plasmid DNA in yeast was extracted by using 0.45-mm acid-washed glass beads. The soluble extracts were utilized to transform the bacteria strain, KC8, competent cells and plated on LB/Amp+ plates. Colonies were further streaked on LB/Amp±Trp dropout plates for plasmid DNA isolation using the Qiagen plasmid mini-prep kit. Sequencing analysis was performed by mixing 2 μg of plasmid DNA with 2 mm primer and 4.5 μl of premix sequencing reagents (containing Taq polymerase, nucleotides) included in the Applied Biosystems Dye Terminator Cycle DNA sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems 402080) and amplified for 28 cycles by polymerase chain reaction. The final polymerase chain reaction samples were applied to the Applied Biosystems automatic sequencer. A sequence homology search was performed by accessing to the National Institutes of Health BLAST data base. To generate the TNF-R1/GST construct, the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 334–425 of TNF-R1 region was subcloned in-frame with the GST fragment in the pEBG vector (34Liou H.-C. Sha W.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TNF-R1/GST and DAP-1/CDM8(HA tag) plasmids were cotransfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate transfection protocol described previously (34Liou H.-C. Sha W.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were plated on six-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. At that point, cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 0.1% of Nonidet P-40, after which 100 μl of glutathione beads were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C in rotary motion for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 buffer, boiled in SDS sample loading buffer, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using the anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies. The 293T cells were transiently cotransfected, in triplicates, with either 0.6 or 0.9 μg of DAP-1/CDM8 plasmids with 0.3 μg of IgκB-luciferase reporter construct (34Liou H.-C. Sha W.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pBMN-LacZ. Transfectants were plates on six-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were then lysed with 500 μl of luciferase cell lysis buffer. To normalize the transfection efficiencies among samples, an aliquot of each lysate was assayed for β-galactosidase activity by mixing 10 μl of lysate with 50 μl of LacZ buffer and 50 μl of o-nitrophenol-β-d-galactoside in 500 μl total final volume. Reactions proceeded at 37 °C for 10 min and were stopped with 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 prior to analysis by spectrophotometry at OD 420 nm. Normalized amounts of lysates (50–70 μl) were then incubated with 20 μl of luciferase substrate and analyzed by β counter. The test constructs, including DAP-1/CDM8, sentrin/CDM8, FADD/CDM8, FADD-DN-CD2, or in combination, were cotransfected with pCMV-LacZ reporter plasmid at 2:1 ratio into either L929, 293T, or U2OS cell lines. All transfections were performed by calcium phosphate method in triplicates in six-well plates with total 12 μg of DNA/well. Where indicated, some transfectants were treated with 10 ng of murine TNF-α at 3 h post-transfection. Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection and fixed with 0.02% glutardehyde in phosphate-buffered saline prior to incubation with the X-gal staining solution. Cells were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy. Several hundred to two thousand blue cells were counted depending upon the transfection efficiency. Wrinkled blue cells with condensed nuclei were scored as dead cells, whereas flat blue cells with intact morphology were scored as live transfected cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as 100 × (dead cell count/total transfected cell count). All transfections were repeated in at least three independent experiments. We utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate proteins that interact with the TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain (32$$Google Scholar, 33Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this system, the TNF-R1 DNA fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI andNcoI sites of the pEG202 plasmid, in which it produced a bait protein with LexA DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–222) at the NH2-terminal in fusion with the TNF-R1 cytoplasmic peptide at the COOH-terminal. The HeLa cDNA library was cloned into theEcoRI site of the pJG4.5 vector, which produced fusion proteins of the cDNA-derived peptide and the LexA transcription activation domain. Initially, several constructs encompassing the entire TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain were tested for any potential intrinsic transcription activity in the absence of the library plasmids (Fig. 1 A). One of the constructs containing amino acids 334–475 did not reveal basal transcription activity and was utilized as the bait for the screening. This bait contains the entire death domain and additional upstream 20 amino acids. Among 4 × 106 HeLa library cDNA clones screened using the bait, 34 colonies were scored positive for the two selection criteria: by their ability to grow in the leucine deficient medium and to turn blue in the presence of X-gal substrate (Fig. 1 B). Using dot blot hybridization, these 34 colonies were further categorized into seven distinct groups (data not shown), which we named death domain-associated proteins or DAPs. Fifteen of these 34 positive colonies (44%) correspond to DAP-1. To estimate the molecular weight of DAP-1 protein, three clones with variable DNA length, clone 3 (1.2 kb), clone 16 (1.5 kb), and clone 7 (1.7 kb), were further analyzed. In the original yeast extracts, DAP-1 clones encoded proteins with molecular masses of approximately 25–27 kDa (Fig. 2A). Since all these clones contain 10 kDa of the LexA DNA binding domain, their actual molecular masses are about 15–17 kDa. To further confirm the protein size, DAP-1 was inserted into the CDM8 mammalian expression vector with HA tag epitope attached at the 5′ end of the cDNA. These constructs were transfected into the human embryonic kidney carcinoma, 293T cell line. Transfectant lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody. In mammalian cells, clone 3 produced the protein of 15 kDa, whereas clones 7 and 16 express protein with molecular mass of 17 kDa (Fig. 2 B), consistent with previous molecular mass estimation in yeast extract. It was later evident that the molecular mass difference between clones 3 and 7/16 was the result of a 14-amino acid deletion at the NH2 terminus of clone 3. The variation may be due to a cloning artifact or differential spliced products from the DAP-1 gene. To test that DAP-1 is a gene product and not derived from a random sequence in the genome, Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA derived from HeLa and a murine B cell lymphoma cell line, WEHI 231. A 1.5-kb transcript was detected by radioisotope-labeled DAP-1 clone 7 probe (Fig. 2 C). This result confirms that DAP-1 is indeed derived from a mammalian gene transcript. DNA sequencing analysis of DAP-1 cDNA reveals an open reading frame that encodes proteins of 122 amino acids (clone 3) and 142 amino acids (clones 7 and 16), respectively (Fig.3 A). By searching BLAST and EST GenBankTM data bases, we identified several sequences with homology to DAP-1. DAP-1 is identical to the PML interacting clone 1 (or PIC1), which is part of the PML-containing multiprotein complexes that are frequently disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia (Fig.3 B) (3Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar). Except for the additional NH2-terminal 40 amino acids, DAP-1 and PIC1 are identical to the sentrin, a Fas receptor-associated protein (4Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). DAP-1 sequence is identical to the translated peptide sequence of SMT3C in the human EST data base and also has 55% identity (75% homology) to SMT3A and SMT3B EST sequences. DAP-1 reveals 52% identity (73% homology) to the Smt3p protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(Fig. 3 B). The yeast Smt3p gene product has been implicated in the modulation of chromatin stability during mitosis by regulating a centromere-binding protein, MIF2 (1Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DAP-1, PIC1 and SMTs, share a significant degree of homology to ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-homology proteins (see “Discussion”), but potential ubiquitin-like activities are yet to be determined. In addition to an association in yeast, we also demonstrate that DAP-1 can directly interact with TNF-R1 in mammalian cells. DNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain of TNF-R1 was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pEBG-GST, which contains the glutathione S-transferase (or GST) coding motif at the 5′ end of the cloning site. After cotransfection of TNF-R1/pEBG-GST and DAP-1/CDM8-HA tag into 293T cells, the cell lysates were applied to glutathione-agarose beads, to which TNF-R1-GST fusion protein and its associated proteins are expected to bind. The protein complexes retained in the beads were further analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and blotted with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.4, DAP-1 protein can coprecipitate with TNF-R1-GST fusion protein. The interaction was specific to TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain because DAP-1 protein did not coprecipitated with other GST fusion proteins containing irrelevant peptide motifs (data not shown). These data confirm an in vivo interaction of DAP-1 with TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain in mammalian cells under physiological condition. To investigate the influence of DAP-1 protein on TNF-R1-mediated NF-κB/Rel activation, we transfected DAP-1/CDM8, NFκB-luciferase reporter, and the pBMN-LacZ reporter constructs into 293T cells. An aliquot of each lysate was initially assayed for β-galactosidase activity to normalize the transfection efficiencies among samples. Normalized amount of lysate samples were then assayed for luciferase activity as a measurement of NF-κB/Rel transcription activity. As shown in Fig. 5, constitutive NF-κB/Rel activity in 293T cells was significantly reduced by overexpression of DAP-1. This result suggests that DAP-1 may play a negative role in the activation of NF-κB/Rel. We have attempted to address if DAP-1 has any effect on TNF-induced NF-κB activity by transfecting DAP-1 into 293T cells that were subsequently treated with TNF-α. As TNF-α induced nearly a 100-fold increase in NF-κB activity, this activity was not diminished by transient transfection of DAP-1 (data not shown). However, this is a technically challenging experiment given the limitation of transfection efficiency (less than 30%) but high inducibility of NF-κB by TNF in nearly all 293T cells. Thus, the portion of cells that contain κB-luciferase construct, but not the DAP-1 cDNA, would contribute to the surging luciferase activity which is not affected by DAP-1. To investigate whether DAP-1 can modulate apoptosis function of TNF-R1, the DAP-1/CDM8 and pCMV-LacZ plasmids (ratio 2:1) were cotransfected into the mouse fibroblast cell line, L929, which is extremely sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Half of the transfectants were treated with TNF-α 36 h postelectroporation. Cell death was quantified by counting β-galactosidase positive (blue-colored) cells with condensed nuclei under microscope after incubating in the X-gal buffer. DAP-1 alone induced 25–30% of cell death in L929 cells (Fig.6 A). Treatment of DAP-1-transfected cells with TNF-α only slightly enhances apoptosis to 35–40% (Fig. 6 A). Since there is no significant synergy between TNF-α and DAP-1, it suggests that DAP-1 and TNF-R1 may converge at common cell death pathways. As the blue nuclei condensed cells represent only a fraction of cells that are dying at the time of analysis, we also counted the total transfected viable cells to better estimate the effect of DAP-1 on cell death during the transfection process. By counting the total blue cells, DAP-1-transfected plates had 50–70% reduced cell number as compared with the control transfectants (Fig. 6 B). TNF-α treatment alone also resulted in similar reduction in total cell number. TNF induces the activation of caspases which eventually leads to programmed cell death. We therefore tested if DAP-1-mediated cell death is also due to the activation of caspase activity. DAP-1-transfected L929 cells were treated with either the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD peptide, or solvent (Me2SO) at 12 h posttransfection (35Andjelic S. Liou H.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 570-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). While DAP-1 alone induced 47% cell death, treatment of these transfectants with the Z-VAD peptide reduced the cell death to 22% (Fig. 7 A). This experiment thus indicated that DAP-1-induced cell death involves the activation of caspases. Previously, it was shown that sentrin, a Fas receptor-associated protein, protects BJAB cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis (4Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). Since DAP-1 and sentrin share 99% identity except for the additional 40 amino acids in the NH2 terminus of DAP-1, we compared these two proteins in our transfection assay system. As clearly demonstrated in Fig. 7A, sentrin alone also induced significant"

While GM2 has GalNAcβ1→4Gal linkage, 6′-GM2 has GalNAcβ1→6Gal linkage (Ishida, H., Ito, Y., Tanahashi, E., Li, Y.-T., Kiso, M., and Hasegawa, A. (1997) Carbohydr. Res. 302, 223–227). We have studied the enzymatic susceptibilities of GM2 and 6′GM2, as well as that of the oligosaccharides derived from GM2, asialo-GM2 (GalNAcβ1→4Galβ1→ 4Glcβ1–1′Cer) and 6′GM2. In addition, the conformational properties of both GM2 and 6′GM2 were analyzed using NMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics computation. In sharp contrast to GM2, the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac of 6′GM2 were readily hydrolyzed by β-hexosaminidase A and sialidase, respectively, without GM2 activator. Among the oligosaccharides derived from GM2, asialo-GM2, and 6′GM2, only the oligosaccharide from GM2 was resistant to β-hexosaminidase A. Conformational analyses revealed that while GM2 has a compact and rigid oligosaccharide head group, 6′GM2 has an open spatial arrangement of the sugar units, with the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac freely accessible to external interactions. These results strongly indicate that the resistance of GM2 to enzymatic hydrolysis is because of the specific rigid conformation of the GM2 oligosaccharide.

It has been shown that the terminal GalNAc in GM2 is resistant to β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), and that a specific protein cofactor, GM2 activator, is required to assist the hydrolysis (1Li Y.-T. Mazzotta M.Y. Wan C.-C. Orth R. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7512-7515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hectman P. LeBlank D. Biochem.

The reason for the resistance of GM2 to Hex A is still an enigma. We have shown that, in addition to the GalNAc, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the Neu5Ac in GM2 also requires GM2 activator protein (11Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In GM2, both the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac are linked to the Gal to form GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)-Galβ-, a branched trisaccharide (GM2-epitope). We have rationalized that the resistance of the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac in GM2 to enzymatic hydrolysis may be because of the specific rigid structural conformation of the GM2-epitope and that GM2 activator may interact with the GM2-epitope to make the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac accessible to Hex A and sialidase, respectively (11Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To show that this is the case, we have recently synthesized a GM2 analog, 6′GM2 (GalNAcβ1→6(Neu5Acα2→3)-Galβ1→4GlcCer), in which the GalNAc is linked β1→6 to the Gal (12Ishida H. Ito Y. Tanahashi E. Li Y.-T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 302: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here, we report that, in sharp contrast to GM2, the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac in 6′GM2 were readily hydrolyzed by Hex A and clostridial sialidase, respectively, independent of GM2 activator protein. NMR analysis and molecular mechanics computation revealed that the trisaccharide head group of 6′GM2 is much more flexible than that of GM2. Our results provide the structural basis for the resistance of the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac in GM2 to enzymatic degradation. GM2 was isolated from the brain of a Tay-Sachs patient according to the published method (13Svennerholm L. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1972; 6: 464-474Google Scholar). Asialo-GM2 (GA2) was prepared from GM2 by mild acid hydrolysis (14Svennerholm L. Månsson J.-E. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 740-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hex A (33.3 units/mg) from human liver was prepared according to our previous report (1Li Y.-T. Mazzotta M.Y. Wan C.-C. Orth R. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7512-7515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 6′GM2 was chemically synthesized (12Ishida H. Ito Y. Tanahashi E. Li Y.-T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 302: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides OM2, 6′OM2, and OA2 were prepared by the removal of ceramide moieties from GM2, 6′GM2, and GA2 using ceramide glycanase (15Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following were obtained from commercial sources: precoated silica gel-60 TLC plates, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); GM3, Matreya; sialyllactose, lactose, type X clostridial sialidase, (CD3)2SO, and D2O, Sigma; and Chelex-100 resin, Bio-Rad. For enzymatic hydrolysis of the GalNAc from glycolipids or from the oligosaccharides derived from glycolipids, each reaction mixture contained 8 nmol of the substrate and the specified amount of Hex A, as indicated in each figure, in 100 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for the preset time. For hydrolysis of the Neu5Ac from the glycolipids, 8 nmol of GM2 or 6′GM2 was incubated with 10 units of clostridial sialidase in the presence or absence of 5 μg of GM2 activator protein (11Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 100 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation, each reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and analyzed by silica gel-60 thin layer chromatography. The solvent system used for developing the glycolipids was chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8) and that for the oligosaccharides was n-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (2:1:1). The plate was sprayed with the diphenylamine reagent (16Harris G. MacWilliam I.C. Chem. Ind.(London). 1954; : 249Google Scholar) and heated at 110 °C for 15 min to reveal oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. Quantitative results on the % hydrolysis of substrates were obtained from the scanning of the TLC plates using Scan Jet 2C/ADF scanner (Hewlett Packard) and the NIH Image 1.41 program. Five mg of 6′GM2 were dried under vacuum and were dissolved in 0.5 ml of (CD3)2SO or (CD3)2SO/D2O (20:1) under a stream of nitrogen. To overcome signal broadening of OH groups, such as the Neu5Ac OH8, Gal OH2, and GalNAc OH6, the sample was passed through a Chelex-100 column (0.5 × 2.5 cm, pH 6) before analysis. This procedure allowed the detection of the Neu5Ac OH8 proton as a typical sharp signal at low fields (6.15 ppm), but caused the loss of other OH signals. To complete the assignment, about 4 mg of 6′GM2 in 2 ml of water was dialyzed against 2 mm EDTA, followed by water, and then passed through a Chelex-100 column at pH 7.0. This treatment furnished the GalNAc OH6 and Gal OH2 resonance at 5.16 and 4.35 ppm, respectively, while it caused the loss of the previously assigned OH2 of Glc. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, on a Bruker AM500 spectrometer and analyzed on a X32 Bruker satellite station equipped with standard Bruker UXNMR software.1H-1H and 1H-13C two-dimensional spectra were acquired as 2048 × 512 and 2048 × 256 matrices, respectively, with 64 scans pert 1 point and processed after zero filling in F1 dimension and appropriate window function multiplication. Proton inter- and intra-residual contacts were evaluated by NOE experiments in the rotating frame ROESY (17Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 207-213Google Scholar) with a spin lock pulse strength of 2.6 kH applied at one end of the spectrum to avoid scalar transfer (18Acquotti D. Poppe L. Dabrowski J. von der Lieth C.W. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7772-7778Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Farmer II, B.T. Brown L.R. J. Magn. Res. 1987; 72: 197-202Google Scholar). Temperature was varied in the range of 305–323 K and mixing time between 100–200 ms. The experiments were conducted on both the D2O-exchanged and not-exchanged samples as well as the samples before and after the treatments. Cross-peak volumes were transformed into proton-proton distances r, under the hypothesis of the 1/r 6 NOE dependence and using internal calibration on Glc, Gal, GalNAc H1/H3, and H1/H5 distances, and on Glc H1/H2 when accessible. Distances from four experiments were averaged to give the reported values. To achieve reliable comparisons between the oligosaccharide structure of 6′GM2 and GM2, parallel NMR analyses were conducted on GM2 and 6′GM2. All calculations were performed using the MacroModel/Batchmin package (20Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Crossref Scopus (3924) Google Scholar) (version 5.5) on an O2 SGI workstation and the AMBER* sugar force field (21Senderowitz H. Still W.C. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 1427-1438Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) augmented by modified neglect of diatomic differential overlap (MNDO)-derived parameters for the anomeric torsion of sialic acid (22Bernardi A. Raimondi L. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 3370-3377Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To simplify the computational problem, all calculations on 6′GM2 were run on the methyl derivatives. The calculations were carried out using the generalized born/surface area (GB/SA) water solvation model (23Still W.C. Tempczyk A. Hawley R. Hendrickson T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 6127-6129Crossref Scopus (3335) Google Scholar) of MacroModel. This model treats the solvent as an analytical continuum starting near the van der Waals surface of the solute and uses a dielectric constant of 78 for the bulk water and 1 for the molecule. Extended nonbonded cut-off distances were used. Thus, all calculations were run with a van der Waals cut-off of 8.0 Å and an electrostatic cut-off of 20.0 Å. The conformational searches were carried out using the pseudo systematic variant (SUMM) (24Goodman J.M. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 1110-1117Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar) of the Monte Carlo (MC)/energy minimization procedure (25Chang G. Guida W.C. Still W.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 4379-4386Crossref Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The search proceeded by a pseudo systematical alteration of the torsion angles of a starting structure (a minimum energy conformation), thus, a new geometry was generated and energy minimized. This process produced a new minimum energy conformation, which in turn was tested for duplication with previously found conformations. The procedure, therefore, alternated random changes of coordinates (MC), which allowed wide sampling of the potential energy surface, and energy minimization. This MC/energy minimization procedure has been proven to be among the most effective methods for finding nearly all conformations of flexible molecules with low energy. All the anomeric torsion ϕ, ϕC and ψ, the C5-C6 ω torsion, the side chain C6−C7 and C8−C9torsion of the Neu5Ac residue, and the C−N bonds were used as explicit MC variables. Energy minimization was performed using the Truncated Newton Conjugate Gradient (TNCG) procedure (26Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1987; 8: 1016-1024Crossref Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and was terminated either after 200 iterations or when the energy gradient RMS fell below 0.1 kJ/mol Å. All conformers that differed from the global minimum energy conformation by no more than 50 kJ/mol were saved, and comparison was made only on the heavy atoms to avoid duplicate conformations. Thus, only the global minimum for each conformer was retained, independent of the OH conformations. After addition of explicit H atoms on the sugars, they were further subjected to energy minimization to reduce the energy gradient RMS to 0.01 kJ/mol Å. Fifty four conformers with minimum energy that differed from the global minimum energy conformation by no more than 10 kJ/mol were found. Among them, 15 were contained within 4 kJ/mol and 37 within 8 kJ/mol from the global minimum. The enzymatic susceptibilities of GM2 and 6′GM2 were examined, and the results are shown in Fig.1. While the GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Galβ- in GM2 is resistant to Hex A (Fig. 1 A, a), the GalNAcβ1→6(Neu5Acα2→3)Galβ- in 6′GM2 is readily hydrolyzed by Hex A without the assistance of GM2 activator protein (Fig.1 A, b). We subsequently examined the susceptibility of the Neu5Ac in 6′GM2 to clostridial sialidase, and the result is shown in Fig. 1 B. The hydrolysis of the Neu5Ac in GM2 by clostridial sialidase required the assistance of GM2 activator, whereas the Neu5Ac in 6′GM2 could be readily hydrolyzed by clostridial sialidase in the absence of GM2 activator protein. These results clearly indicate that the mutation of the GalNAc linkage in GM2 from GalNAcβ1→4Gal to GalNAcβ1→6Gal affects not only the enzymatic susceptibility of the GalNAc but also that of the Neu5Ac which is linked to C3 of the Gal in both gangliosides. The quantitative comparison on the hydrolyses of GM2 and 6′GM2 by human Hex A in the presence or absence of GM2 activator protein is presented in Table I. Under our assay conditions, GM2 was not hydrolyzed by Hex A in the absence of GM2 activator. The resistance of GM2 to Hex A has been widely recognized. However, in the presence of the activator protein, GM2 became susceptible to Hex A. In contrast, 6′GM2 was readily hydrolyzed by Hex A without GM2 activator protein. To obtain a comparable level of the hydrolysis for both substrates, it was necessary to use only 0.06 units of Hex A for 6′GM2 hydrolysis and 0.25 units of the enzyme for GM2 hydrolysis (see TableI). This suggests that 6′GM2 is a better substrate for Hex A. Moreover, in the presence of the activator protein, the hydrolysis of 6′GM2 increased only 5–10%. These results indicate that GM2 activator protein does not stimulate the two substrates equally. Thus, GM2 activator protein has a specific stimulatory effect on the hydrolysis of GM2 by Hex A.Table IHydrolysis of GM2 and 6′GM2 by human Hex A in the presence of GM2 activatorIncubation time% Hydrolysis of GM2aIt was necessary to use the reduced amount of Hex A for the hydrolysis of 6′GM2 since 6′GM2 was much more readily hydrolyzed than GM2.% Hydrolysis of 6′GM2aIt was necessary to use the reduced amount of Hex A for the hydrolysis of 6′GM2 since 6′GM2 was much more readily hydrolyzed than GM2.−Activator+Activator−Activator+Activatormin5013.824.923.010021.046.149.320042.158.468.030080.959.468.3Each assay contained 8 nmol of GM2 or 6′GM2 with or without 1 μg of GM2 activator in 100 μl of 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6.

Open table in a new tab Each assay contained 8 nmol of GM2 or 6′GM2 with or without 1 μg of GM2 activator in 100 μl of 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. For the hydrolysis of GM2, 0.25 unit of Hex A was used. For the hydrolysis of 6′GM2, 0.06 unit of Hex A was used. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for a preset time as indicated, and the percent hydrolysis of the substrate was determined from the TLC plate using a Scan Jet 2C/ADF scanner (Hewlett-Packard). To eliminate any possible influence by the ceramide moiety of the glycolipids on the enzymatic hydrolysis of the GalNAc residue, the ceramide residue was removed from the glycolipids, GM2, 6′GM2 and GA2, to yield the oligosaccharides OM2, 6′OM2 and OA2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, both 6′OM2 and OA2 were readily hydrolyzed by Hex A alone. In contrast, OM2 was completely resistant to Hex A. Similarly, the Neu5Ac of 6′OM2, but not that of OM2, was susceptible to clostridial sialidase (results not shown). Inclusion of GM2 activator protein in the reaction mixture did not alter the above results because this activator protein requires the lipid moiety of the substrate to exert its stimulatory activity. These results further support that the resistance of GM2 to Hex A and clostridial sialidase is because of the rigid carbohydrate structure of GM2-epitope. To understand the conformation/function relationship of GM2 and 6′GM2, we have also investigated the conformational properties of these two gangliosides by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics computation, applying an MC conformational search. As shown in Fig.3 A, the pattern of interresidual NOE interactions detected on GM2 is consistent with a single prevalent spatial arrangement of the GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Gal- trisaccharide. In particular, because of the interaction of the GalNAc with the Neu5Ac residue (Fig.3 A), the GalNAc-Gal bond shows a limited flexibility. Such a conformational restriction is confirmed by the MC calculation (Figs.4 and 6 A) and is in agreement with the previous results on the conformation of GM2-oligosaccharide (27Sabesan S. Bock K. Lemieux R. Can. J. Chem. 1984; 62: 1034-1045Crossref Google Scholar).Figure 4The ϕ, ψ maps of the GalNAc-Gal glycosidic bond. The lowest energy conformations within 8 kJ/mol from the global minimum of the MC conformational searches performed on the methyl derivatives of the oligosaccharides of GM2 (GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Galβ1→4GlcβOMe) and 6′-GM2 (GalNAcβ1→6(Neu5Acα2→3)Galβ1→4GlcβOMe) are shown. Glycosidic angles ϕ, ψ maps of GM2 (○) and 6′GM2 (●) are defined as follows: for GM2, ϕ = GalNAcH1-GalNAcC1-O1-GalC4, ψ = GalNAcC1-O1-GalC4-GalH4; for 6′GM2, ϕ = GalNAcH1-GalNAcC1-O1-GalC6, ψ = GalNAcC1-O1-GalC6-GalC5. The GalNAc-Gal glycosidic bond of GM2 appears to populate a single well at ϕ, ψ 30°, 20°, which is in agreement with the experimental data shown in Fig. 3. In contrast, a marked flexibility is observed around the GalNAc-Gal glycosidic bond of 6′GM2. The GalNAc anomeric torsion ϕ appears to be well defined around 45°, but the Gal C6-O6 bond is freely switching from the two conformations at ψ −90° (global minimum shown in Fig.6 B) and ψ +70° (1.2 kJ/mol above the global minimum shown in Fig. 6 C). Another conformer of the Gal C6-O6 bond which has energy higher than 8 kJ/mol appears around ψ +180°.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6The spatial arrangements of the oligosaccharide moieties in GM2 (A) and 6′GM2 (B and C). Representative conformers are shown for GM2 and 6′GM2 as calculated by molecular mechanics. Conformers are taken from the lowest energy conformations within 8 kJ/mol. The computational results were validated by comparing the calculated distances with the experimental (NOE-derived) values. The calculated distances were obtained as r = 〈ri −6〉−1/6 where 〈ri −6〉 is the Boltzmann average of ri −6 of the individual conformations within 10 kJ/mol from the global minimum. The GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Galβ1- trisaccharide of GM2 shows one preferred spatial arrangement which is defined by a number of experimentally detected interactions (arrows). The GalNAcβ1→6(Neu5Acα2→3)Galβ1- of 6′GM2, on the contrary, shows a fairly “opened” spatial arrangement, with the GalNAc-Gal bond sampling the two conformations as shown in Fig. 4. The conversion of GM2 to 6′GM2 dramatically alters the spatial disposition of the Neu5Ac residue because of the loss of its interactions with the GalNAc that exists in the very compact GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Galβ1- trisaccharide structure of GM2. The significantly more populated conformation found in GM2 is at ϕ,ψ −160°, −25°, whereas in 6′GM2 the lower energy is at ϕ,ψ −70°, +10° (gauche conformation).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In sharp contrast, a considerable spatial flexibility is found for the GalNAc residue of 6′GM2. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the NOE interactions across the GalNAcβ1→6Gal linkage of 6′GM2 consist uniquely of the contacts between the anomeric proton of the GalNAc and the two protons on the C6 of the Gal; the intensities of the two interactions are almost equal. Another important interresidual interaction detected on the GalNAc of 6′GM2 is between the GalNAc-NH and the Glc-OH3 (Fig. 3 B). Fig.5 shows that these three contacts cannot be achieved simultaneously in a single conformation. The MC analysis suggests that they arise from the average of two conformations of the GalNAcβ1→6Gal linkage at ϕ, ψ 45°, −90°, and 45°, +70° (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 also shows how the ψ −90° conformers give rise to the GalNAcNH-GlcOH3 and GalNAcH1-GalH6′ contacts, whereas the ψ +70° conformers generate the GalNAcH1-GalH6 cross-peaks. The distances calculated by Boltzmann averaging (28Rutherford T.J. Spackman D.G. Simpson P.J. Homans S.W. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of the MC conformations in Fig. 5 agree well with the experimental data (see legend to Fig. 5). The interresidual interactions between the Neu5Ac and the Gal protons in 6′GM2 are centered on the side chain of the Neu5Ac, showing the contacts of Neu5Ac-H8 and -OH8 with Gal-H3 (Fig. 3 B). These contacts are not detected in the trisaccharide GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Gal- of GM2, or in the same trisaccharide found in GM1, GD1a, and GalNAc-GD1a (17Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The conformations of these gangliosides are highly restrained at the Neu5Ac-Gal glycosidic bond in an antiperiplanar conformation with the side chain of the Neu5Ac interacting with the GalNAc residue. This is not the case for 6′GM2. The interactions of Neu5Ac-H8 and -OH8 with GalH3 in 6′GM2 suggest that the most populated conformation of the Neu5Ac-Gal bond in this ganglioside is a gauche conformation. The MC calculations corroborate and strengthen the results of NMR analyses and also enable comparison of the lowest energy conformations of the oligosaccharide moieties of GM2 (Fig.6 A) and 6′GM2 (Fig. 6,B and C). The conformational studies of 6′GM2 and GM2 reveal that the modification of the GalNAc linkage in GM2 from β1→4Gal to β1→6Gal dramatically alters the dynamics of the sugar chain. The overall effect of this modification is to give the oligosaccharide head group of 6′GM2 an “open” spatial arrangement (Fig. 6, Band C) in which the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac residues are freely accessible to external interactions. Indeed, it has been shown that a flexible ligand has a lower affinity to its receptor than a rigid ligand fitting perfectly to the binding site. However, a flexible ligand with a high degree of mobility can increase the rate of association (32Homans S.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The above results clearly show that the specific trisaccharide structure of GM2-epitope in which the GalNAcβ1→4 and the Neu5Acα2→3 are both linked to the penultimate Gal residue can render the GalNAc and the Neu5Ac resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis. The disruption of this rigid structure by mutating the GalNAcβ1→4Gal linkage to GalNAcβ1→6Gal makes the GalNAc susceptible to Hex A and the Neu5Ac to sialidase. A well known example where the linkage mobility is closely associated with the ganglioside-protein interactions is that of GD1a ganglioside. GD1a is a disialoganglioside whose structure can be regarded as having an extension of the sugar chain of GM2 by adding an extra Neu5Acα2→3Galβ- disaccharide to the C3 of the GalNAc. It is widely known that, of the two Neu5Acα2→3Galβ- linkages in GD1a, only the external one is susceptible to sialidase. The inner Neu5Acα2→3Galβ- linkage of GD1a is part of the trisaccharide in GM2, which is very rigid because of the presence of a “blocking” GalNAc residue. The external Neu5Acα2→3Galβ- linkage, absence of the “blocking” GalNAc residue, is more flexible and fluctuates between two limiting conformations (31Acquotti D. Cantu L. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the susceptibility of the Neu5Ac in GD1a to sialidase is associated with the dynamics of the Neu5Acα2→3Galβ- linkage. Although complex carbohydrates have been recognized as information rich molecules, functions expressed by complex carbohydrate chains are still not readily decipherable as those of proteins and nucleic acids. The primary structure of a complex carbohydrate chain includes the sugar sequence, the anomeric configurations of the sugar units, and the linkages of the two adjacent sugar residues. It is not difficult to understand that the anomeric configuration of a sugar residue can profoundly affect physicochemical and biological properties of a sugar chain. However, the effect of a single sugar linkage on the overall physicochemical and biological properties of a sugar chain is still not well appreciated. Our results show that the biological properties of a sugar chain can be expressed through the specific linkage of the sugar chain. Our investigation through chemical mutation of sugar linkages provides an explanation for the resistance of GM2 to enzymatic degradation. We thank Drs. A. D. French, S. J. Landry, and K. Maskos for critical review of the manuscript and helpful discussions."

We have also shown that human apo(a) injected into the tail vein of control mice undergoes degradation as reflected by the appearance of immunoreactive fragments in the plasma and in the urine of these animals. To define whether either or both of these enzymes may be responsible for the in vivo apo(a) cleavage, we injected intravenously MMP-12−/−, NE−/− mice and litter mates, all of the same strain, with either lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), full-length free apo(a), or its N-terminal fragment, F1, obtained by the in vitro cleavage of apo(a) by NE. In the plasma of Lp(a)/apo(a)-injected mice, F1 was detected in control and NE−/− mice but was virtually absent in the MMP-12−/− mice. Moreover, fragments of the F1 type were present in the urine of the animals except for the MMP-12−/− mice. These fragments were significantly smaller in size than those observed in the plasma. All of the animals injected with F1 exhibited small sized fragments in their urine. These observations provide evidence that, in the mouse strain used, MMP-12 plays an important role in the generation of F1 from injected human Lp(a)/apo(a) and that this fragment undergoes further cleavage during renal transit via a mechanism that is neither NE- nor MMP-12-dependent. Thus, factors influencing the expression of MMP-12 may have a modulating action on the biology of Lp(a).

Chem. 1992; 38: 2244-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), several reports have demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive apo(a)1 in human urine. Particularly significant were the studies by Mooseret al. (2Mooser V. Seabra M.C. Abedin M. Landschulz K.T. Marcovina S. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) who by combining chemical and immunochemical techniques provided evidence that urinary apo(a) was represented by fragments derived from its N-terminal region. When, following purification, these urinary fragments were injected intravenously into mice, they were excreted in the urine without an apparent change in size. The same authors also reported the presence in the plasma of apo(a) fragments unattached to apoB100. Upon their intravenous injection into mice, these fragments were rapidly excreted in the urine as smaller sized components (3Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results were interpreted to indicate that the apo(a) fragments in human plasma are derived from Lp(a)/apo(a) and are in turn the source of the apo(a) fragments in the urine. Unanswered in those studies was the underlying cause of the apo(a) fragmentation as well as the site or sites for its occurrence. We reported previously that limited in vitroproteolysis of apo(a), by either pancreatic or leukocyte elastase, is attended by the cleavage at the Ile3520-Leu3521bond located in the linker domain between kringles IV-4 and IV-5 (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This cleavage generates two main fragments, one representing the N-terminal domain, F1, and the other the C-terminal domain, F2. When these two fragments were separately injected intravenously into mice, F1 but not F2 was rapidly excreted in the urine (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to examine whether the cleavage site on apo(a) was limited to serine proteases such as pancreatic and leukocyte or neutrophil elastase (NE) or could also apply to other inflammatory enzymes. Among them we considered matrix matalloproteinases (MMPs), which are metallo-dependent enzymes involved in the homeostasis of the extracellular matrix and also shown to play an important role in the atherosclerotic process (6Galis Z.S.

In this work, we directed our attention to macrophage metalloelastase, also referred to as MMP-12, which was first identified as an elastolytic metalloproteinase secreted by inflammatory macrophages (14Banda M.J. Werb Z. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 560-569Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and structurally defined (15Shapiro S.D. Griffin G.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M.

This enzyme has a broad substrate specificity for matrix macromolecules such as fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and proteoglycans (17Chandler S. Cossin J. Lury J. Wells G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the current study, we now show that MMP-12 cleaves apo(a) in vitro and also provide evidence that, in the mouse strain used, it is involved in the generation of F1 in vivo. Human leukocyte elastase (EC 3.4.21.37) was purchased from Sigma. Antiserum to purified preparations of apo(a), Lp(a), and LDL were raised in the rabbit and affinity purified as described previously (18Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Lp(a) were shown to be devoid of immunoreactivity to LDL and plasminogen; anti-LDL was unreactive to apo(a). Mice deficient in NE (NE−/−) or MMP-12 (MMP-12−/−) in a pure 129/Svj background were generated by targeted disruption of either the NE or MMP-12 gene in RW4 embryonic stem cells as described previously (19Belaaouaj A.

Shapiro S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). All mice were housed in individual cages under normal light. The evening before the experiment, the animals were given a 10% sucrose solution to drinkad libitum in place of water. The following morning the mice were anesthetized with Metafane prior to the injection into the tail vein of 25–250 μg of either Lp(a), apo(a), or fragment F1 in a volume of 100 μl. The mice were then placed in metabolic cages, given access to standard lab chow and 10% sucrose solution to drink. Blood samples were withdrawn from the orbital vein into heparinized hematocrit tubes at the specified time points and immediately iced. Urine was collected at 0–3, 3–5, and 5–24 h. ELISA quantitation, sensitive to < 0.0015 mg/dl of apo(a), was performed on the urine samples to determine the levels of apo(a)-reacting material. These results indicated to what degree the sample was to be concentrated for electrophoretic detection. The latter was estimated to be > 0.03 mg/dl. The urine was concentrated in Amicon Centriprep filters. The subjects used for the preparation of Lp(a) and LDL were healthy donors with plasma Lp(a) protein levels in the range of 15–43 mg/dl determined as described previously (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmapheresis was performed in the Blood Bank of the University of Chicago. All of the subjects used in the study gave a written informed consent. The steps for Lp(a) isolation were carried out immediately after blood drawing using the procedure outlined below. We used an additional five subjects for studying the apo(a) fragments in their plasma and urine. These were also healthy subjects with a known phenotype and genotype. Their plasma Lp(a) protein levels varied between 1 and 12 mg/dl, and the apo(a) size isoforms varied between 350 and 550 kDa. In each subject, 4-h urine samples were collected, centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm, and either used fresh or frozen immediately at −80 °C. Before use, they were concentrated 200-fold in microconcentrators (Amicon Corp. Beverly, MA). All of the subjects used in the study gave a written informed consent. To prevent lipoprotein degradation, the plasma obtained by plasmapheresis was adjusted with 0.15% EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, 10,000 units/liter aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lp(a) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation and lysine-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (21Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purity of the product was assessed by mobility on precast 1% agarose gels (Ciba-Corning, Palo Alto, CA) and Western blots of SDS-PAGE, utilizing anti-Lp(a) and anti-apoB100. The LDL preparations used in this study were isolated at density of ∼1.030–1.050 g/ml by sequential flotation as described previously (22Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To prevent lipoprotein degradation, the plasma obtained by plasmapheresis was adjusted with 0.15% EDTA, 0.01% NaN3,10,000 units/liter aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Apo(a) phenotyping was performed on isolated apo(a) samples by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-Lp(a) (23Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mobility of the individual apo(a) bands was compared with isolated apo(a) isoforms of known molecular weights (21Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For apo(a) genotyping, DNA plugs were prepared from blood mononuclear cells and subsequently fractionated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and the blots were developed with an apo(a)-specific probe essentially as described earlier (24Lackner C. Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Rahmig T. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Apo(a) was isolated from Lp(a) essentially as described previously (23Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, Lp(a), 1 mg/ml protein, was incubated with dithioerythritol at a final concentration of 1.5–2 mm. ε-amino caproic acid to a final concentration of 100 mm was then added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h under nitrogen gas. After dialysis against 10 mmPO4 buffer, an equal volume of 60% sucrose in the same buffer was added and the resulting mixture placed into a TLA 100.3 titanium rotor and spun in a table top TL100 ultracentrifuge at 10 °C, 412,160 × g for 18 h. After centrifugation, the top 0.5-ml fraction contained LDL free of apo(a), [Lp(a−)], and unreacted Lp(a). The bottom 1.0 ml fraction contained free apo(a) in pure form. The latter was stored in the sucrose solution at −80 °C. These fragments were the products of the limited proteolysis of apo(a) by purified human leukocyte elastase essentially as described previously (5Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme (1 unit = 1 nm p-nitrophenol/s fromN-1-Boc-l-Ala p-nitrophenol ester) was diluted 1000-fold in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmNaCl, pH 8.0. One microliter of the diluted enzyme was incubated per 7.5 μg of Lp(a) or LDL protein or 15 μg of apo(a) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 20 min at 22 °C. After digestion, the fragments were purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE (4 and 4–12% polyacrylamide) was performed on a Novex system (Novex, San Diego, CA) for 1.5 h at constant voltage (120 V) at 22 °C. The samples were prepared by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer which consisted of 94 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1% SDS and 2m urea with or without 3% β-ME. Immediately after electrophoresis, the gels were placed onto Immobilon-P sheets (Millipore Corp.) that were previously wetted with a buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, pH 8.9. Blotting was performed on a horizontal semi-dry electroblot apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) at 0.8–1 mA/cm2 for 45 min at 22 °C. After electroblotting, the Immobilon-P sheets were blocked in PBS containing 5% non-fat dry powdered milk and 0.3% Tween 20 followed by incubation with anti-apo(a) or anti-apoB100 antibody. The blots were washed and incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG. Subsequently, the blots were developed with the ECL Western Detection Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Apo(a) digests (30–50 μg) were electrophoresed under reducing conditions as outlined above. After electrophoresis, the gels were electroblotted onto Immobilon PSQ sequence grade membranes (Millipore Corp.) as described above in the immunoblotting section. The blots were rinsed in distilled water, stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (0.025% in 40% methanol), and destained with 40% methanol. Reduction with DTT and alkylation with iodoacetamide was performed directly on the PSQ membrane which was then subjected to automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A unit using procedures recommended by the manufacturer. All sequencing procedures were carried out in the core laboratory of the Macromolecular and Structural Analysis Facility at the University of Kentucky. Lp(a) and LDL protein were quantitated by a sandwich ELISA essentially as described previously (18Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that anti-Lp(a) IgG was used as the capture antibody and anti-apoB100 IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as the detection antibody. For the ELISA quantitation of apo(a), anti-apo(a) IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as the detection antibody. Subsequently, an extinction coefficient (ε278 = 1.31 ml mg−1 cm−1) was established for apo(a) in the 30% sucrose solution. Protein determinations were performed by the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. Mouse recombinant MMP-12 was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (15Shapiro S.D. Griffin G.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4664-4671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active enzyme was incubated with human Lp(a)/apo(a) (final concentration, 0.2 mg/ml apo(a)) at varying weight ratios of protein to enzyme (25, 50, and 100:1, P:E) at 37 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35, 0.02% NaN3. After 18 h of incubation, samples were removed, EDTA (final concentration 50 mm) was added to stop the reaction, and SDS-PAGE was performed under unreduced and reduced conditions. The ability of MMP-12 to hydrolyze Lp(a) was assessed at varying weight ratios of apo(a) to enzyme using anti-apo(a) and anti-apoB100 immunoblots of 4% SDS-PAGE. Fig.1 A shows the digestion patterns of Lp(a) after an 18-h incubation at 37 °C, under unreduced conditions, probed with anti-apo(a) (left) or anti-apoB100 antibodies (right). The level of digestion of apo(a) and apoB100 increased as a function of enzyme concentration (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 to 5, left andright panels). Notably, in the left panel, bands marked with an arrow decreased in intensity as the enzyme concentration increased. Three other bands of major intensity were also present (left panel), one of which exhibited a mobility corresponding to F1. Immunostaining of the same gels with anti-apoB100 (right panel) showed that a large proportion of the products of apoB100 hydrolysis in the Lp(a) particle comigrated with bands corresponding to the apo(a) immunostained ones in the left panel. On the reduced gels, there were two major bands that migrated at an apparent mass of 220 and 170 kDa (Fig.1 B, lanes 2–4, left panel). The mobilities of these bands corresponded to fragments F1 and F2 previously reported (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The band corresponding to F1 migrated with a slower mobility on reduced gels than under unreduced conditions, likely because of the effect of the reducing agent on the conformation of the fragment. Immunostaining of the reduced gels with anti-apoB100 (Fig. 1 B, right panel) showed that the gel pattern was essentially the same as observed in the unreduced gel (Fig. 1 A, right panel). When apo(a) was digested with MMP-12, the pattern was the same as shown in Fig. 1 B left panel for Lp(a) under reduced conditions. The results suggest that apo(a) in Lp(a) was cleaved at a single site producing two major fragments, F1 and F2, the latter covalently linked to truncated forms of apoB100. The partial amino-terminal sequences of F1 and F2 obtained by MMP-12 digestion of Lp(a) and apo(a) are shown in Fig.2. By aligning these sequences with those of apo(a), using the program CLUSTAL W, we located the cleavage site at the Asn3518-Val3519 bond in the linker region between kringles IV-4 and IV-5. These fragments correspond to the N- and C-terminal domain of apo(a) containing kringles IV-1 to IV-4 (N-terminal), and IV-5 through IV-10, kringle V, and the protease region (C-terminal). Because apoB100 was also digested by MMP-12, it was of interest to determine whether the fragments remained on the surface of the Lp(a) particle or formed separate lipoprotein species, each consisting of various truncated forms of apoB100 disulfide linked to F2. To this end, MMP-12-digested Lp(a) was electrophoretically separated on native nondenatured polyacrylamide gels that were immunostained with anti-apo(a) and anti-apoB100 (Fig. 3). Digested Lp(a) exhibited two bands (lane 4), one of which also stained with anti-apoB100 (lane 8). The band with the faster mobility in lane 4 corresponded to F1. In turn, when LDL was digested with MMP-12, the pattern was the same as for undigested LDL (compare lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, we interpreted these results to show that 1) MMP-12 hydrolyzes both apo(a) and apoB100 components of Lp(a); 2) the hydrolytic products consist of apo(a) fragment F1 and a miniLp(a) particle in which the C-terminal region of apo(a), fragment F2, is covalently linked to truncated forms of apoB100; and 3) the apoB100 fragments remain on the surface of the particle, whereas the N-terminal fragment of apo(a), F1, is released. We examined, on anti-apo(a) immunostained blots of reduced 4% SDS-PAGE, plasma samples from mice bled 3 h after intravenous injection of either Lp(a), apo(a), or F1. The electrophoretic pattern of the plasma samples after injection of apo(a) into NE−/− and control mice (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and3) contained bands corresponding to full-length apo(a) and fragments thereof, one migrating in the position of F1, indicating that a fragmentation process had occurred in vivo. In contrast, the 3-h plasma sample of MMP-12−/− mice exhibited a major band corresponding to full-length apo(a) along with some minor bands of low immunostaining intensity but none with the mobility of F1 (lane 4). The electrophoretic patterns, under reduced conditions, of the plasma from mice injected with Lp(a) (data not shown) were comparable with those shown in Fig. 4 A,lanes 2 to 4. The banding pattern of plasma after injection of F1 (Fig.4 A, lanes 6–8) was similar among all of the mice and resembled the injected material (lane 5). All the patterns contained a major band at 220 kDa and other bands of minor immunostaining intensity in the range of 200–135 kDa. The electrophoretic pattern of the plasma of all the mice remained unaltered at each time point after injection, although the intensity of these bands, including the major F1 band, decreased with time (data not shown). We examined the urine of mice, collected 24 h after injection of either Lp(a), apo(a) or F1, by anti-apo(a) immunostained blots of reduced 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE. The urinary patterns of apo(a) after injection into NE−/−and control mice were comparable (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3 ) and showed a broad spectrum of bands including those migrating at 110, 81, 57, and 33 kDa. In contrast, the urine from MMP-12−/− mice was devoid of bands (lane 4), even after concentrating the urine 3-fold more than that of either the NE−/− or control mice. In turn, the electrophoretic pattern of the urine from all of the mice injected with F1, contained fragments (lanes 6–8) that were smaller in size than the injected material (lane 5) and similar to those observed in NE−/− and control mice injected with full-length apo(a) (lanes 2 and 3). To rule out artifactual contributions to the formation of fragments, the collected urine samples from injected mice were incubated at 37 °C overnight and compared with freshly collected urine kept on ice. Western blot analysis showed no formation of new fragments. In addition, no new fragments were observed when the urine of a control uninjected mouse was incubated with intact Lp(a) or its derivatives. These results provide evidence that F1 is the component of apo(a) targeted for renal excretion and that in our mouse model, this fragment is generated by the action of MMP-12 on apo(a). All subjects studied exhibited similar results in terms of electrophoretic band patterns. A representative fresh plasma sample is shown in Fig. 4 A,lane Hu. In addition to intact apo(a), there were at least three other bands, one of which corresponded to the mobility of F1. In terms of urine, the pattern of apo(a) fragments (Fig. 4 B,lane Hu) was comparable with those of controls and NE−/− mice injected with apo(a) or Lp(a) and to all mice injected with fragment F1. Our studies have shown that, in vitro, MMP-12 cleaves human apo(a) at the Asn3518-Val3519 bond located in the linker between kringles IV-4 and IV-5. This bond is immediately upstream of the Ile3520-Leu3521bond that we previously showed to be the site of cleavage by either pancreatic or leukocyte elastase (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reason for the high substrate specificity by the elastases and MMP-12 is unclear. One plausible explanation is that the linker between kringles IV-4 and IV-5, contrary to the other linkers of apo(a), is unglycosylated as predicted on the basis of sequence analysis (25McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). It is of note that the proximity of the bond sites cleaved by NE and MMP-12, results in the generation of two main fragments of a nearly equal size. One of the interesting aspects of our current studies was the observation that Lp(a)/apo(a)-injected MMP-12−/−, contrary to the NE−/− mice, had virtually no immunodetectable fragments in their plasma and none in their urine. Yet, the MMP-12−/− mice were able to excrete in the urine intravenously injected F1. These observations when coupled with the finding that MMP-12 was able to cleave in vitro, apo(a), strongly suggest that in the mouse, this enzyme was responsible for the generation of F1 from injected human apo(a). The results also suggest that the kidney has a recognition site for free F1 but not when it is a component of a full-length apo(a). The reason for the selective recognition of F1 by the kidney is unclear. Both size (about 200 kDa) and high degree of glycosylation (about 30% by weight) of F1 speak against a simple filtration process as suggested by Mooser et al. (3Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A receptor mechanism is a more likely possibility. However, our knowledge about receptor(s) that specifically recognize Lp(a)/apo(a) is not firmly established. An involvement by the VLDL receptor in the recognition of apo(a) has been recently suggested (26Argraves M.K. Kozarsky K.F. Fallon J.T. Harpel P.C. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2170-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Based on the current findings, it would be of interest to determine whether F1 is a ligand for this receptor. It is important to note that, in all of the animals injected with either Lp(a)/apo(a) or F1, the urinary fragments, if present, were comparable in size and smaller than those in the plasma, suggesting that in our mouse strain neither NE nor MMP-12 was involved in the second step degradation by the kidney perhaps by additional MMPs. In this regard MMP-2 and 9 have been reported in the renal tissue (27Piedagnel R. Murphy G. Ronco P.M. Lelongt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1614-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Lelongt B. Trugnan G. Murphy G. Ronco P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A question that was not specifically addressed in the current studies was the site(s) of the first step of apo(a) fragmentation generating F1. The plasma appears to be an unlikely source based on the findings by Mooser et al. (2Mooser V. Seabra M.C. Abedin M. Landschulz K.T. Marcovina S. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and our own (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showing that neither mouse nor human plasma has the capacity to cleave, in vitro, Lp(a)/apo(a). Moreover, any MMP-12 activity in the plasma would be neutralized by circulating tissue inhibitors of MMP, at least under physiological conditions. A more likely possibility is that the apo(a) fragments are generated at tissue sites by the action of MMPs secreted by macrophages unopposed by local tissue inhibitors of MMP. Because F1 and F2 are generated in vitro by the action of both NE (5Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and MMP-12 on apo(a), one has to ask why only F1 was present in the plasma of the NE−/− and control mice injected intravenously with apo(a). This may be because of the fact that F2 but not F1 binds to matrix macromolecules such as fibrinogen and fibronectin (4Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as exemplified by our recent findings on the proteoglycan decorin (29Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Zhu L. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23856-23865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, F1, for which no ligand has been identified thus far (30Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), once formed at tissue sites would be free to diffuse and return to the blood stream by a reverse flow process. The current studies invite the question as to whether the results on the murine models may apply to man. It is of interest to note that mouse MMP-12 has a high degree of homology with its human counterpart (16Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the apo(a) fragments that are spontaneously present in the plasma of human subjects are of a similar size as those found in the plasma of mice injected with human apo(a) (2Mooser V. Seabra M.C. Abedin M. Landschulz K.T. Marcovina S. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also as shown by the current results in Fig. 4. In addition, the urine of human subjects has been shown previously (2Mooser V. Seabra M.C. Abedin M. Landschulz K.T. Marcovina S. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in this study to contain apo(a) immunoreactive fragments which are smaller in size than those in the plasma, suggesting that the human kidney is involved in the second step of degradation of apo(a). However, despite these similarities more direct documentation is needed to establish that MMP-12, or other MMPs, are involved in the fragmentation of apo(a) in human subjects. In summary, our results have shown that MMP-12 cleaves apo(a) in the linker region between kringles IV-4 and IV-5 and also provide evidence from mouse models that such a cleavage may account for the generation in the plasma of F1, which is subsequently degraded by the kidney. The emerging notion that the generation of F1 may be controlled by the activity of MMP-12, suggests that the activity of this enzyme may play an important role in the pathobiology of Lp(a). We thank Dr. Yasushi Kataoka for valuable help in the intravenous injections of apo(a) and derivatives into NE and MMP-12-deficient mice and their respective litter mates."

Dexamethasone-induced conformational changes were characterized by two resistant proteolysis fragments of 30 and 27 kDa. Although dexamethasone binding affinity was only slightly altered by the I747T substitution (Roux, S., Térouanne, B., Balaguer, P., Loffreda-Jausons, N., Pons, M., Chambon, P., Gronemeyer, H., and Nicolas, J.-C. (1996) Mol. Endocrinol. 10, 1214–1226), higher dexamethasone concentrations were required to obtain the same proteolysis pattern. This difference was less marked when proteolysis experiments were conducted at 0 °C, indicating that a step of the conformational change after ligand binding was affected by the mutation. In contrast, RU486 binding to the wild-type receptor induced a different conformational change that was not affected by the mutation. Analysis of proteolysis fragments obtained in the presence of dexamethasone or RU486 indicated that the RU486-induced conformational change affected the C-terminal part of the ligand binding domain differently. These data suggest that the ligand-induced conformational change occurs via a multistep process. In the first step, characterized by compaction of the ligand binding domain, the mutation has no effect. The second step, which stabilizes the activated conformation and does not occur at 4 °C, seems to be a key element in the activation process that can be altered by the mutation. This step could involve modification of the helix H12 position, explaining why the conformation induced by RU486 is not affected by the mutation.

Binding of the specific hormone induces a cascade of different molecular events, leading to an activated GR that can, after DNA binding, regulate gene transcription by interacting with the transcriptional machinery. Transcriptional activation is achieved through activation functions with the major transactivation function AF-1 located within the N-terminal domain and the weak ligand-dependent transactivation function AF-2 in the C-terminal hormone binding domain (for reviews and references see Refs.8Simons Jr., S.S.

In contrast, we recently described a mutant (substitution of human GR isoleucine 747 by a threonine, hereafter referred to as I747T) with no significant alteration of ligand binding affinity but which required higher dexamethasone concentrations than the wild-type GR (wt GR) to induce reporter gene transactivation (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation is located just before the H12 helix. It has been proposed that modification of helix H12 positioning upon agonist binding generates a surface for interactions with various coactivators, whereas the conformation of the apo-receptor and the antagonist-receptor complex does not permit these interactions (for reviews and references see Refs. 43Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar and 44Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). As the I747T mutation alters the transactivation function of the receptor without modifying ligand-receptor interactions, we assumed that the dynamics of the transconformation process were modified. In this study, we used partial proteolysis to analyze the conformation of the wt GR and the mutant I747T before and after agonist and antagonist binding. Dexamethasone and trypsin (type XIII) were purchased from Sigma. RU486 was a gift from Roussel Uclaf (Romainville, France). RainbowTM14C-methylated protein molecular weight markers were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech as well as the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection reagents (Les Ulis, France).l-[35S]Methionine (>1000 mCi/mm) was obtained from ICN; TNTT7 reticulocyte lysate system and RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor were from Promega (Charbonnieres, France), and ENTENSIFY was from NEN Life Science Products. The GR polyclonal antibody P-20 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (TEBU, Le Perray en Yvelines, France). Plasmid wt human GR containing the open reading frame of the wild-type GR as well as the ΔA/B wt GR and the mutant I747T have been previously described (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids containing coding sequences of mouse GR (pSV2Wrec) and three mutants (M758A/L759A, E761A, and I762A/I763A) were obtained from the laboratory of Professor M. G. Parker (11Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). To place them under the control of the T7promoter, XbaI-BglII fragments containing the coding sequences were excised, blunted, and subcloned into the bluntedEcoRI site of pSG5 (45Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids (pSG5-GR) were transcribed and translated with the TNTT7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 1 h at 30 °C. Pretreatment of labeled translation mixtures was performed for 10 min at room temperature with vehicle or ligand (conserved in ethanol, dried, and re-suspended in 50% (v/v) PEG300, 1% of the total reaction volume). Limited trypsinization was performed by the addition of 1 μl of protease solution (trypsin dissolved in water) to aliquots (5 μl) of the hormone-treated receptor mixture (final trypsin concentrations 5 to 100 μg/ml). Incubations with protease were conducted for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by cooling in ice. 20 μl of SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. The proteolysis products were separated on a 0.75-mm thick SDS 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in methanol (30%, v/v), acetic acid (10%, v/v), treated with ENTENSIFY, and vacuum-dried at 70 °C for 45 min. Autoradiography was performed overnight. In vitrosynthesized 35S-wt GR or I747T were incubated for 10 min at 20 °C with 10−7m dexamethasone followed by an additional incubation with ATP (10 mm) and NaCl (0.4m) for 15 min (activation step). An equal volume of water was added for the unactivated controls. Samples were layered on top of a 5–20% sucrose gradient prepared in TEG buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Gradients were centrifuged in a VTi 65.2 rotor at 4 °C for 2 h at 65,000 rpm. Aldolase (see Fig. 4, A, 7.9 S), bovine serum albumin (see Fig. 4, BSA, 4.6 S), and myoglobin (see Fig. 4,M, 2 S) were used as external sedimentation markers. Three-drop fractions were collected by piercing the bottom of each tube. The collected fractions were analyzed on a 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. The band corresponding to the 94-kDa fragment was densitometrically scanned by image analysis (Optilab, Graftek, France) and quantified. A limited proteolysis experiment was conducted with the in vitro 35S-synthesized wt GR proteins. After SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel), the protein fragments were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed using the rabbit polyclonal antibody P-20 directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 750–769 mapping at the C-terminus of the human GR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative analysis of proteolytic fragments was performed by gel scanning with a Fujix film imaging plate. Photo-stimulated photon for each band were determined on a Fujix Bas 1000PC and expressed as a percentage of the full-length receptor photo-stimulated photon. To analyze changes in wt and I747T GR conformation induced by dexamethasone binding, in vitro produced receptors were incubated with 10−5m dexamethasone, then limited trypsinization was performed, and the resulting proteolysis fragments were analyzed (Fig. 1). At low trypsin concentrations (5 and 10 μg/ml; lanes 2–3, respectively), similar proteolysis patterns were obtained for wt GR (Fig.1 A) and I747T GR (Fig. 1 B) with a main 30-kDa fragment. At 25 μg/ml trypsin concentration (lane 4), 2 fragments, 30- and 27-kDa, were obtained for both receptors. At 50 μg/ml trypsin concentration (lane 5), the abundance of the 30-kDa species decreased to the benefit of 27-kDa species. The 27-kDa fragment became predominant for both receptors. The 30- and 27-kDa fragments contained all or part of the LBD, as previously reported for various nuclear receptors because they were also obtained with a ΔA/B-GRwt and were recognized by a specific antibody directed against the C-terminal region of this domain (data not shown). Further proteolysis experiments were performed using various dexamethasone concentrations (10−9 to 10−5m), and the intensities of the proteolytic fragments were quantified. Values obtained for both fragments were added and presented as a percentage of the intensity of the full-length receptors (Fig.2). At 5 μg/ml trypsin concentration (Fig. 2 A), fragments generated from wt GR had the same intensity as fragments generated from I747T GR, indicating that at this trypsin concentration both receptors were similarly protected. Because more than half of the methionine residues were located in the C-terminal part of the receptor, we assumed that at 10−7–10−6m dexamethasone concentration 100% of both GRs would be converted into a more compact structure. These results are consistent with the similar dexamethasone affinities reported for wt GR and I747T (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). At higher trypsin concentrations (10, 25, and 50 μg/ml; Fig. 2, B,C, and D, respectively), the maximal level of protection for the wt GR was within the same order of magnitude and was reached regardless of the trypsin concentration used at the same dexamethasone concentrations (10−7–10−6m). In contrast, for the mutant at these trypsin concentrations (10, 25, and 50 μg/ml. Fig. 2, B,C, and D, respectively), there was a lower protection level for both fragments. I747T required higher dexamethasone concentrations to achieve the same extent of protection as noted for the wt GR. Because the affinity for dexamethasone was not drastically affected by the mutation, these results suggested that this mutation could affect the transconformational process induced by dexamethasone binding. In vitroactivation of GR is a temperature- and ligand-dependent process (46Denis M. Poellinger L. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Nature. 1988; 333: 686-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in nonactivating conditions, ligand binding to the receptor appears sufficient to induce a structural modification detectable by proteolysis (22Kuil C.W. Berrovoets C.A. Mulder E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27569-27576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 47Simons S.S.J. Sistare F.D. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14493-14497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus compared the proteolytic pattern of the wt and I747T GR after incubation with 10−7or 10−5m dexamethasone concentrations at 0 °C, a temperature that inhibits the activation process, or at room temperature. This incubation was followed by trypsin treatment performed for 1 h at 0 °C, conditions in which the unliganded wt or I747T GR were totally digested. The percentage of 30- and 27-resisting fragments obtained for vehicle alone, dexamethasone × 10−7m, or dexamethasone × 10−5m are given in Fig.3. The maximum level of protection (i.e. maximal intensity of the 30- and 27-kDa fragments) was obtained for the wt GR after incubation with a 10−5m dexamethasone concentration at 0 °C or with a 10−7m concentration at 20 °C (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the maximum level of protection for I747T, similar to that obtained with wt GR, was reached only after incubation with a 10−5m dexamethasone concentration at 20 °C (Fig. 3 B) (45 ± 5% versus 50 ± 4%, respectively). These results suggest that a step in the ligand-induced conformational change occurring at room temperature was drastically altered. The similar level of protection obtained for both receptors at 10−5m suggests that higher dexamethasone concentrations could maintain a protected conformation even in the absence of any activation process. It was previously reported that transformation of GR by ligand binding into a transcriptionally activated form is accompanied by the release of Hsp from the receptor (48Denis M. Gustafsson J.A. Wikstrom A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18520-18523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Sanchez E.R. Meshinchi S. Tienrungroj W. Schlesinger M.J. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that alteration of Hsp release from I747T could account for the shifted ligand-induced conformational change. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a ligand-independent removal of Hsp using high NaCl and ATP concentrations, a treatment known to remove Hsp from receptors (50Smith D.F. Schowalter D.B. Kost S.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and analyzed the sedimentation profile of the mutant and wt GR on sucrose gradient. NaCl and ATP treatment was efficient to remove Hsp from the wild type and mutant GR as evidenced by the decrease in the sedimentation coefficient for both receptors (9–10 S versus6–7 S) (Fig. 4). When proteolysis experiments of liganded wt and mutant GR were performed after ATP/NaCl treatment, protection of the fragments was not markedly affected (Fig. 5, Aand B, respectively; compare lanes 2–3 withlanes 5–6). Taken together, these results showed that hsp release was not altered by the mutation and that hsp dissociation was not involved in the shifted ligand-induced conformational change. Previous experiments showed that RU486 presents a similar antagonistic activity with wt and I747T GR (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the conformation of I747T after RU486 binding, we performed proteolysis experiments on translated wt or I747T receptors treated with 10−7m RU486 concentration. A similar proteolysis pattern was obtained for both receptors (Fig.6). At 10 μg/ml trypsin concentration, a 30-kDa fragment was obtained (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 7). Proteolysis with 25 μg/ml trypsin (lanes 3 and 8) decreased the amount of the 30-kDa fragment and increased the amount of the 27-kDa fragment. These two main species were split off into two slightly different additional fragments (∼29.5 and 27.5 kDa). At 50 μg/ml trypsin concentration (lanes 4 and 9), these resistant fragments were obtained as well as an additional 25-kDa fragment, with the smallest species (27 and 25 kDa) being the most abundant. At higher trypsin concentration (100 μg/ml, lanes 5 and 10), the 25-kDa fragment was the main fragment. These proteolysis fragments, except for the 25-kDa species, were recognized by the antibody directed against the 750–769 amino acid sequence (data not show). After treatment with various RU486 concentrations (10−9–10−6m), quantification of main fragments (30-, 27- and 25-kDa) led to indistinguishable protection curves for wt GR and I747T (data not shown), regardless of the trypsin concentrations applied. RU486 concentrations required to obtain half-maximal protection of each fragment are reported in Table I. The same RU486 concentration (≈10−8m) was sufficient to convert wt GR and I747T to a trypsin-resistant form. These results led us to conclude that the RU486-induced conformational change was not affected by the mutation and differed from that induced by an agonist.Table IRU486 concentration required to observed half-maximal protection of each resisting fragment for wt GR and I747Twt GRI747T30-kda fragment, 10 μg/ml3 × 10−9 m3 × 10−9 m27-kda fragment, 50 μg/ml4 × 10−9 m3 × 10−9 m25-kda fragment, 100 μg/ml5 × 10−9 m6 × 10−9 mProtection of each resisting fragment is quantified as described in Fig. 2.

Open table in a new tab Protection of each resisting fragment is quantified as described in Fig. 2. RU486 concentration sufficient to half-maximal protection of each resisting fragment is determined graphically. In this study, we investigated the involvement of ligand-induced conformational changes in the previously described shifted transcriptional activity of the GR mutant I747T. This mutation drastically alters the ligand specificity for transactivation but not for binding (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). Conformational changes observed after ligand binding are assumed to induce a decrease in the accessibility of cleavage sites within the receptor molecule, which can be easily detected by modifications of proteolysis patterns. In agreement with previous reports (20Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zheng Z. Allan G.F. Thaller C. Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 47Simons S.S.J. Sistare F.D. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14493-14497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that dexamethasone-induced conformational changes of the wild-type GR (wt) were characterized by two resistant proteolytic fragments (30 and 27 kDa), whose respective intensities were related to the trypsin concentration used in the assay. We also found that protection of these fragments was dependent on the dexamethasone concentration used (Fig. 2). At 10−7–10−6m, the wt GR was totally converted to a resistant conformation. Although dexamethasone binding was sufficient to protect the mutant I747T from low trypsin concentration digestion (5 μg/ml; Fig. 2 A), a 25–50-fold higher dexamethasone concentration was required to protect the 30- and 27-kDa fragments against high trypsin levels (Fig. 2, B, C, and D). The shift in the dose-response curve for proteolysis protection of I747T was in agreement with the shift in the transcriptional response curve previously reported (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that at high dexamethasone concentrations, similar protection and transactivation activity levels were reached for I747T and wt GR (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). After cortisol binding, only submaximal protection of these fragments was obtained with the mutant (data not shown), in accordance with the results of a previous study showing submaximal stimulation of a reporter gene (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). It should be also noted that I747T presented an affinity for dexamethasone or cortisol within the same order of magnitude as that obtained for the wt GR (42Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Loffreda-Jausons N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, GR proteins synthetized with rabbit reticulocyte lysate had the same binding affinity as the native protein expressed in cells (51Denis M. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6005-6008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Hollenberg S.M. Weinberger C. Ong E.S. Cerelli G. Oro A. Lebo R. Thompson E.B. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1985; 318: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 53Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This suggests that the relative affinity of the receptor for the ligand was not directly responsible for the shifted protection curve. Similarly, AF-2 activation domain mouse GR mutants, which are unable to transactivate at concentrations up to 10−5m dexamethasone without modification of ligand binding affinity (11Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), were also unable to generate the same proteolysis pattern as the wt (data not shown). Taken together, the data presented here indicated that the ability of GR to activate transcription was not only dependent on its ability to bind its ligand, i.e. it was also correlated with the ligand binding-induced conformational change of GR characterized by increasing protection of the 30- and 27-kDa species at high trypsin concentrations. This resistance to trypsin digestion might be relevant to a stabilization of an efficient conformation by high dexamethasone concentrations. As a similar protection level was obtained for I747T and the wt GR at 0 °C, it is likely that a step in the ligand-induced conformational change occurring at room temperature and probably associated with the stabilization of the conformation was impaired or drastically modified for the mutant. Moreover, our experiments showed that no impaired hsp90 dissociation was involved in the shifted protection curve for the mutant. As reported for the progesterone receptor (20Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (23Couette B. Fagart J. Jalaguier S. Lombes M. Souque A. Rafestin-Oblin M.-E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the conformational change might have occurred within the heterooligomeric structure, thus inducing hsp release, and is not a consequence of an altered hsp dissociation. Taken together these data suggested that acquisition of a transcriptionally efficient conformational change is a multistep process with a dynamic dimension (Fig.7). An intermediary complex would first be generated by ligand binding (Fig. 7 A, step 1). The second step, occurring rapidly at room temperature, would convert the intermediary complex into a more stable conformational state, corresponding to the transcriptionally efficient conformation (step2). We hypothesized that the activated receptor could be stable enough to exist in a transient unliganded activated form (step3). Taking into account the observation that the I747T substitution has little effect on affinity, we propose that this substitution does not affect intermediary complex formation (Fig.7 B; step 1) but alters the stability of the activated receptor conformation. High ligand concentrations are required to permit a rapid ligand reassociation to the unstable activated receptor and so permit conservation of a sufficient concentration of efficient conformation to transactivate. Interestingly the Tyr-537 mutation within the ER (corresponding to Phe-749 for human GR) confers constitutive activity (54Weiss K. Ekena K. Thomas J. Lazennec G. Katzenellenbogen B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1338-1398Google Scholar), probably by affecting the specific stabilization of active aporeceptor conformation (55Carlson K.E. Choi I. Gee A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Conversely, a destabilizating effect of mutation I747T in GR might induce an unstable active conformation. Moreover, the mutation occurring at the same position in the androgen receptor (Val-889) in the case of nearly complete androgen insensitivity (56De Bellis A. Quigley C.A. Marschke K.B. El-Awadys M.K. Lane M.V. Smith E.P. Sar M. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 57Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could also imply destabilization of the active conformation, because this mutant showed a slight increase in its dissociation rate, with a drastic modification of EC50 in transactivation assays. As mentioned by the authors, an increase in denaturation could also be involved because dissociation of the ligand could lead to rapid receptor denaturation because of instability of the activated conformation. High ligand concentrations, by increasing the ligand association rate, could protect against receptor denaturation and are required to obtain full activity. Contrary to that observed with dexamethasone, the RU486 binding-induced conformation characterized by three main resistant fragments (30-, 27-, and 25-kDa species) was not affected by the mutation. Western blot experiments using a specific antibody recognizing a C-terminal epitope indicated that the RU486-induced conformational change affected the C-terminal tail of the GR differently (data not shown). Similar results were recently reported with rat GR (29Modaress K.J. Opoku J. Xu M. Sarlis N.J. Simons S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23986-23994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The H12 helix, which contains this region (for reviews and references, see Ref. 58Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), lies outside the LBD body after RU486 binding, rendering it accessible to proteases. A recent crystallographic analysis of the ligand binding domain of ER in the presence of the antagonist raloxifen revealed that H12 helix can adopt a distinct antagonist position (18Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Ohlan L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Because (i) the position of the C-terminal tail of the LBD was the major difference between dexamethasone- and RU486-induced conformational changes and (ii) the mutation altered only the structural modifications induced by agonist binding, we postulated that the second step of the agonist conformational change process especially involves the positioning of the H12 helix. Mutation of isoleucine 747, which is located in the loop between helix H11 and H12, might alter the displacement of H12. It has been postulated that folding back of the H12 helix after agonist binding generates a surface for interactions with various co-activators correlated with a functional AF-2 activity (for reviews and references, see Refs. 43Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar and 44Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These co-activators could act, as proposed by Henttu et al. (59Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), as bridging proteins between the receptor and the basal transcriptional machinery, and they are likely involved in stabilization of the conformation. In contrast, most of these coactivators are unable to interact with receptors after RU486 binding (60Halachmi S. Marden E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M.

Cell. 1988; 54: 199-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations in the loop between helix H11 and H12 could specifically alter the conformation process induced by agonist binding, probably by altering the position of H12 helix, and this positioning is affected differently depending on the amino acids. The analysis of the transactivation function correlated with the analysis of the receptor sensitivity to proteolysis could be a powerful strategy to investigate the involvement of each amino acid of the H11-H12 loop in the ligand-induced conformational change.

https://openalex.org/W2025407400,"The FX electron acceptor in Photosystem I (PS I) is a highly electronegative (E m = −705 mV) interpolypeptide [4Fe-4S] cluster ligated by cysteines 556 and 565 on PsaB and cysteines 574 and 583 on PsaA in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. An aspartic acid is adjacent to each of these cysteines on PsaB and adjacent to the proline-proximal cysteine on PsaA. We investigated the effect of D566PsaB and D557PsaB on electron transfer through FX by changing each aspartate to the neutral alanine or to the positively charged lysine either singly (D566APsaB, D557APsaB, D566KPsaB, and D557KPsaB) or in pairs (D557APsaB/D566APsaB and D557KPsaB/D566APsaB). All mutants except for D557KPsaB/D566APsaB grew photoautotrophically, but the growth of D557KPsaB and D557APsaB/D566APsaB was impaired under low light. The doubling time was increased, and the chlorophyll content per cell was lower in D557KPsaB and D557APsaB/D566APsaB relative to the wild type and the other mutants. Nevertheless, the rates of NADP+photoreduction in PS I complexes from all mutants were no less than 75% of that of the wild type. The kinetics of back-reaction of the electron acceptors on a single-turnover flash showed efficient electron transfer to the terminal acceptors FA and FB in PS I complexes from all mutants. The EPR spectrum of FX was identical to that in the wild type in all but the single and double D566APsaB mutants, where the high-field resonance was shifted downfield. We conclude that the impaired growth of some of the mutants is related to a reduced accumulation of PS I rather than to photosynthetic efficiency.

Cubane ([4Fe-4S]) clusters are 1-electron carriers that function between two of the three oxidation states, 2+/1+ or 3+/2+ (for review, see Ref. 1Berg J. Holm R. Spiro T.G. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.New York, NY1982: 1-66Google Scholar). The midpoint potentials of the near-geometrically identical [4Fe-4S] clusters are modulated by different protein environments and can range from +350 to −705 mV (versus H2). One of the lowest potential redox-active iron-sulfur clusters is FX 1(E m = −705 mV) (2Chamorovsky S.K. Cammack R. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1982; 4: 195-200Google Scholar), which functions as an intermediate electron acceptor in PS I. FX is a relatively rare form of an interpolypeptide [4Fe-4S] cluster, where two cysteine ligands are provided by PsaA and two cysteine ligands are provided by PsaB (3Golbeck J.H. Cornelius J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 16-24Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Høj P.B. Møller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14292-14300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EPR spectral properties of FX are unusual in that the average of the g-values 2.096, 1.853, and 1.757 is lower than in typical low potential cubane clusters, and its line widths are broad relative to the other two [4Fe-4S] clusters (FA and FB), which serve as the terminal electron acceptors in PS I. The EPR spectrum of FX shows a low temperature optimum (∼8 K) and a relatively high microwave half-saturation power (P 1/2 > 200 mW at 8 K), which indicates an efficient spin relaxation mechanism (5Evans M.C.W. Sihra C.K. Cammack R. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is not known which features of the protein are responsible for conferring the unusual redox and spectroscopic properties to FX. Unlike the non-heme iron that bridges the two subunits of the quinone-type reaction centers (represented by Photosystem II and the reaction centers of purple bacteria) and that does not participate in the electron transfer, FX serves as an indispensable component of the electron transfer chain of PS I (6Moenne-Loccoz P. Heathcote P. Maclachlan D.J. Berry M.C. Davis I.H. Evans M.C.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10037-10042Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). According to our current understanding, light-induced electron transport between the PS I-bound cofactors follows a linear path: P700 (Chla dimer) → A0 (Chl a monomer) → A1 → FX ([4Fe-4S] cluster) → FA ([4Fe-4S] cluster) → FB ([4Fe-4S] cluster). P700, A0, A1, and FX are located on the PsaA/PsaB reaction center heterodimer, and FA and FB are located on an extrinsic, ferredoxin-like protein termed PsaC (for review, see Ref.8Golbeck J. Bryant D. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 83-177Crossref Google Scholar). A comparison of the FX domain among eukaryotes and prokaryotes shows that the cysteine ligands on PsaB are located in a nearly invariant region of 100 amino acids that surround and include helices VIII and IX (8Golbeck J. Bryant D. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 83-177Crossref Google Scholar) (helices j (or j′) andk (or k′) in current nomenclature (9Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)). An additional interesting feature of FX is that an aspartate residue is adjacent to each conserved cysteine on PsaB (PCDGPGRGGTCD) and adjacent to the proline-proximal cysteine on PsaA (PCDGPGRGGTCQ). According to the 4.5-Å electron density map, the FX cluster is located just inside the membrane region of the stromal side of two membrane-spanning α-helices. Even though the low potential FX cluster operates between the +2 and +1 oxidation states, a more comprehensive view incorporates the charge of the four cysteine thiolate ligands, [[4Fe-4S](S-Cys)4]−3/−2, whereupon the overall charge on the FX cluster can be considered to increase from −2 to −3 on reduction. There is a high electrostatic price paid for stabilizing a charge in the normally low protein dielectric, and such highly charged sites are usually located on the surface of proteins. Since FX is located just within the membrane phase, one explanation of its low reduction potential is that the charge is destabilized due to the low dielectric medium. A second explanation for its low reduction potential is that the cysteine-proximal aspartic acid residues may be deprotonated in the membrane (although there are no experimental data to support this point), and they may be positioned so that they interact electrostatically with the negatively charged iron-sulfur clusters. It follows that the additional work to move an electron into this environment would translate to a lower reduction potential of FX. Substitutions of these aspartates with amino acids differing in charge may alter the reduction potential and hence the efficiency of electron transfer through FX. The effects of ligand substitution on the properties of a variety of iron-sulfur clusters were recently reviewed (10Moulis J.M. Davasse V. Golinelli M.P. Meyer J. Quinkal I. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 2-14Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The ability to substitute oxygen for sulfur ligands has been demonstrated in PS I reaction centers by substitution of serines for the cysteine ligands to FX with serines in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This change did not prevent the assembly of PS I or the low temperature photoreduction of FA or FB (11Smart L.B. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mixed-ligand [4Fe-4S] clusters in the FX site of C565SPsaB and C556SPsaB (12Warren P.V. Smart L.B. McIntosh L. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were found to be relatively inefficient in transferring electrons from A1 to FA/FB (13Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Smart L.B. Schulz R. McIntosh L. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1544-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies showed that although serine could serve as a potential ligand, the stability of the cluster and the efficiency of electron transfer were decreased relative to the wild type. The FX region has also been altered inChlamydomonas reinhardtii using site-directed mutagenesis. Among the findings were that the proline-cysteine motif on PsaB in this organism is not essential for assembly of the PS I reaction center (14Webber A.N. Gibbs P.B. Ward J.B. Bingham S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the reaction center polypeptides PsaA and PsaB do not accumulate in the D562NPsaB and R566EPsaB mutants (15Rodday S.M. Webber A.N. Bingham S.E. Biggins J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6328-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); and the D576LPsaA mutant fails to grow photoautotrophically (16Hallahan B.J. Purton S. Ivison A. Wright D. Evans M.C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the conserved cysteine-adjacent aspartate acid residues play a role in modulating electron transfer through FX, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change each cysteine-proximal aspartic acid residue on PsaB ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to the positively charged amino acid lysine (D566KPsaB and D557KPsaB) and to the neutral amino acid alanine (D566APsaB and D557APsaB). Because D566APsaB showed a large change in the EPR spectrum of FX, we combined two single-site mutants to create the double-site mutants alanine/alanine (D557APsaB/D566APsaB) and lysine/alanine (D557KPsaB/D566APsaB). We measured photoautotrophic growth, chlorophyll content, electron transfer throughput from cytochrome c 6 to ferredoxin and flavodoxin, efficiency of electron transfer to FA/FB on a single-turnover flash, and EPR spectral properties of FX in the single and double aspartate mutants. Oligonucleotides were designed to effect the desired change in the coding sequence of psaBwhile also destroying or adding a restriction site. Site-directed mutations were made with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech in vitro mutagenesis system. Incorporation of mutations was verified by restriction mapping and by DNA sequencing, and the mutated variations of pLS3531 (11Smart L.B. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were then used to transform strain ΔB-RCPT. Spectinomycin-resistant colonies were selected under light-activated heterotropic growth conditions as described (17Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell growth rates, oxygen evolution rates, and chlorophyll content in the whole cells were determined as described (18Yu J. Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8032-8039Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For large-scale culture, wild-type and mutant cells were grown under light-activated heterotropic growth conditions in carboys with 15 liters of BG-11 medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose. In the case of mutants, the medium was supplemented with spectinomycin (20 mg ml−1; Sigma). After harvesting with a Sorvall continuous flow rotor (DuPont), the cells were stored in BG-11 medium with 15% (v/v) glycerol at −95 °C. For oxygen evolution measurements, the light from a slide projector was passed through a copper sulfate solution and filtered with a red cutoff filter (λ > 640 nm), providing saturating photon flux density of 480 μmol m−2 s−1. PS I-mediated oxygen uptake rates were determined using the isolated thylakoid membranes as described (11Smart L.B. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were isolated fromSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 according to the procedure described (19Yu J. Smart L.B. Jung Y.-S. Golbeck J. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were broken in buffer containing 20 mm MES, pH 7.2, 800 mm sucrose, and a protease inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a prechilled Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) in 10 cycles, where one cycle consists of a 45-s on-period and a 10-min off-period. After removing the unbroken cells by low speed centrifugation, the membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. The membranes were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3; frozen in liquid nitrogen with 10% (v/v) glycerol; and stored at −95 °C until use. PS I complexes were prepared using a protocol described (20Golbeck J.H. Song P.S. CRC Handbook of Organic Photochemistry and Photobiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1407-1419Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Membranes were solubilized in 1% n-dodecyl b-d-maltoside (DM) (Calbiochem) at 4 °C for 1 h at a Chl concentration of 1 mg ml−1. Trimeric PS I complexes were isolated from the lower green band after sucrose density (0.1–1.0m sucrose) ultracentrifugation of the solubilized membrane suspension for 24 h at 4 °C. The isolated PS I complexes were dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; resuspended in the same buffer containing 15% (v/v) glycerol and 0.03% DM; frozen as small aliquots in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −95 °C. EPR studies were performed using a Bruker ECS-106 X-band spectrometer with a standard-mode resonator (ST 8615) that had either a grid or a quarter-wave stub for light entry. Cryogenic temperatures were maintained with a liquid helium cryostat and an ITC-4 temperature controller (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, United Kingdom). The microwave frequency was measured with a Hewlett-Packard 5340A frequency counter, and the magnetic field was calibrated using DPPH (α,α′-diphenyl-β-picryl hydrazil) as the standard. Sample temperatures were monitored by a calibrated thermocouple located 3 mm beneath the bottom of the quartz sample tube and referenced to liquid nitrogen. Samples were illuminated with a 150-watt xenon arc source (Model 66057, Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT) passed through 5 cm of water and a heat-absorbing color filter to remove the near-IR light. Samples used for EPR measurements contained 1 mg ml−1 Chl, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, and 30 μm DCPIP in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3. Samples requiring reduced FAand FB were suspended to 1 mg ml−1 Chl in 250 mm glycine, pH 10.5, prior to the addition of 50 mm sodium hydrosulfite. Differential EPR spectra of FX were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of a sample treated in darkness with sodium hydrosulfite at pH 10.5 (to reduce FA and FB) from a sample that was treated identically, but frozen during illumination to additionally reduce FX. The resonances observed between 340 and 360 mT are derived from FA and FB, most likely due to less than quantitative dark reduction with hydrosulfite (the narrow line widths of FA and FB tend to exaggerate their apparent spin concentration relative to the broader line widths of FX). Computer simulations of EPR spectra were performed using WINEPR SimFonia Version 1.25 (Bruker EPR), where the g-values were obtained by visual best-fit comparison with the experimental data. Transient absorbance changes of P700 at 826 nm (ΔA 826) were measured in the microseconds to tens-of-seconds time domain with a laboratory-built double-beam spectrophotometer as described previously (21Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Samples for optical experiments were suspended under anaerobic conditions at 50 μg ml−1 Chl in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3, with 4 μm DCPIP, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, and 0.03% DM. The photocurrents generated by UDT PIN-10D photodiodes were converted to photovoltages using 1-kOhm resistors and amplified using an EG&G Model 113A differential amplifier with a high frequency roll-off of 300 kHz and a gain of 10. The signal was fed to a Model 11A33 plug-in and digitized using a Tektronix DSA601 digital signal analyzer. Excitation was provided by 10-ns flashes from a frequency-doubled, Q-switched Nd-YAG laser (DCR-11, Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA) at 50-s intervals at flash energies of 16 mJ or 200 μJ. Each trace was recorded as 16–20 averages. The ΔA 826 decay curves were fitted to the sum of several exponentials with a base line using the Marquardt algorithm in Igor Pro Version 3.1 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Following deconvolution, each individual component was plotted with a vertical offset relative to the next component (with a longer lifetime) or the base line, the offset being equal to the amplitude of the latter component. Forward electron transfer between FX, FB, and FA is difficult to measure by optical spectroscopy because the broad S → Fe charge transfer bands are highly similar for all three iron-sulfur clusters. However, the efficiency of forward electron transfer from P700 to FA/FB (i.e. the number of electrons leaving P700 that arrive at FA and FB) can be determined indirectly by measuring the relative contributions of the back-reactions of A1−, FX−, and [FA/FB]− with P700+. In a previous study (21Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we measured the lifetimes of these back-reactions in PS I complexes devoid of particular acceptors using two independent techniques, near-IR absorbance difference spectroscopy of P700+(ΔA) and photovoltage (Δψ) generated by PS I complexes incorporated into liposomes. In wild-type PS I complexes suspended in medium with a relatively slow electron donor (reduced DCPIP), P700+ should be reduced by FA– or DCPIP, whereas faster kinetics with lifetimes shorter than several milliseconds represent those centers that have lost the terminal iron-sulfur clusters (FA and FB) during the isolation. In chemically prepared P700-FX cores, the major contribution to ΔA and the Δψ decay shows lifetimes of ∼400 μs and 1.5 ms (21Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In PS I complexes isolated from a PsaC-less in vivo mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the major contribution to ΔA 700 decay also shows biphasic kinetics with similar lifetimes of ∼300 μs and 1.05 ms; a point-by-point difference spectrum of the PsaC deletion mutant in the blue shows that the two kinetic phases are identical, with a bleaching from 400 to 500 nm and a broad peak at 430 nm characteristic of the weak S → Fe charge transfer bands of an iron-sulfur protein (19Yu J. Smart L.B. Jung Y.-S. Golbeck J. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In a P700-A1 core devoid of FX, FB, and FA, the major contribution to ΔA in the near-IR decays bi-exponentially with life times of 10 and 110 μs (21Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Yang F. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2029-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A point-by-point difference spectrum of the P700-A1 core shows that the two kinetic phases are identical, with an absorbance increase from 340 to 410 nm characteristic of the 1-electron reduction of a quinone (27Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Yang F. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2029-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Faster kinetics should also be observed in the case of a decreased efficiency of electron transfer to the terminal iron-sulfur clusters. At the same time, the decay of an antenna chlorophyll triplet (3Chl) generated at high excitation energies may also contribute to kinetics in the tens-of-microseconds time domain. Therefore, the efficiency of electron transfer from P700 to FA/FB can be compared between different preparations at identical chlorophyll concentration by calculating the contribution of kinetic components with life times longer than 5–10 ms to the overall absorbance change of P700 measured in the near-IR upon a saturating flash. The resulting values are depicted byhorizontal arrows pointing to the absorbance change axis in Figs. 2 and 3. The Chl a/P700 ratio was calculated based on this absorbance change. The differential extinction coefficient of P700 at 826 nm equal to 5800 cm−1 (28Brettel K. Golbeck J.H. Photosynth.

Yu L. Golbeck J.H. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The measurement was made by monitoring the rate of change in the absorption of flavodoxin at 467 nm. Rates of flavodoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction were measured in the same medium, except for the addition of 0.5 mmNADP+, 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol, and 0.8 mspinach ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (Sigma) and lowering the MgCl2 concentration to 10 mm. Rates of ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction were measured under the same conditions, except for the substitution of 5 μm spinach ferredoxin (Sigma) for 15 μmflavodoxin. Flavodoxin was purified from a strain of Escherichia coli containing the Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002isiB gene (23Mühlenhoff U. Kruip J. Bryant D.A. Rögner M. Sétif P. Boekema E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-25. Cytochrome c 6 was isolated from Spirulina maxima as described (24Lojero C.G. Krogmann D.W. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rates of NADP+ reduction were measured by monitoring the rate of change in the absorption of NADPH at 340 nm. The measurements were performed using a modified Cary 219 spectrophotometer with appropriate narrow band slit and interference filters to protect the photomultiplier from the actinic light. The sample was illuminated from two opposite sides using two banks of high intensity, red (∼670 nm) light-emitting diodes (LS1, Hansatech Ltd.). The light intensity incident on the sample was saturating at the chlorophyll concentration used. Mutant cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were tested for their ability to grow on BG-11 plates with and without supplemental glucose. Doubling times and chlorophyll/cell ratios were determined using mid-log phase liquid cultures grown photoautotrophically upon bubbling with air (TableI). All single aspartate mutant strains had the ability to grow mixotrophically with supplemental glucose at rates close to the wild-type strain. Strains D566APsaB, D566KPsaB, and D557APsaB grew photoautotrophically at wild-type rates at light intensities ranging from 2.5 to 60 μE m−2 s−1. Strain D557KPsaB either did not grow or grew extremely slowly at 2.5 μE m−2 s- 1 (and the colonies were much smaller), but it grew at wild-type rates at 5.5 and 11 μE m−2 s−1. At the higher light intensities of 20 and 60 μE m−2 s−1, however, D557KPsaB again grew more slowly than the wild type. The chlorophyll content of the whole cells of the single aspartate mutants was similar to that of the wild type, except for D557KPsaB, which had about two-thirds of the wild-type chlorophyll content per cell (Table I). Whole chain oxygen evolution rates of light-activated heterotrophic grown cells of the single aspartate mutants were within 20% of those of the wild type, except for D557KPsaB, for which the rates were somewhat lower. The rates of methyl viologen-mediated O2 uptake by thylakoid membranes of the single mutants were likewise similar to or slightly reduced compared with the wild-type rates. The amounts of PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE polypeptides assayed by Western blotting were about the same in the wild type and the single aspartate mutants on a chlorophyll basis (25Schulz R. Smart L.B. Yu J. McIntosh L. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. 2. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 119-122Google Scholar). The ability to grow photoautotrophically, to accumulate chlorophyll, and to evolve O2 at rates comparable to the wild type indicates accumulation of high levels of PS I and PS II in the single aspartate mutants.Table ICharacteristics of whole cells, thylakoid membranes, and PS I complexes of wild-type and mutant strains.StrainCharacteristics of whole cells and thylakoid membranesRates in isolated PS I complexesCell doubling time, hRate of whole chain O2evolution by cellsaPer Chl content (in μmol mg−1h−1) measured upon illumination at the rate of 60 μE m−2s−1.Relative chlorophyll content in cellsbmg OD730−1 liter−1.Rate of PS I-mediated O2 uptake by thylakoidsaPer Chl content (in μmol mg−1h−1) measured upon illumination at the rate of 60 μE m−2s−1.Flavodoxin reductionFlavodoxin-mediated NADP+reductionFerredoxin-mediated NADP+ reductionWild-type16.15323.254210580299397D566A18.86362.854020600264336D566K20.1NDcND, not determined; NPG, no photoautotrophic growth.3.212600560240294D557A18.64923.112870580240408D557K27.83361.922840500240360D557A/D566A32.86732.03ND520280400D557K/D566ANPG633dSince this mutant does not grow photoautotrophically, this number was determined using light-activated heterotrophic grown cells.0.96dSince this mutant does not grow photoautotrophically, this number was determined using light-activated heterotrophic grown cells.ND580280400All rates shown are averages of three or more independent measurements.a Per Chl content (in μmol mg−1h−1) measured upon illumination at the rate of 60 μE m−2s−1.b mg OD730−1 liter−1.c ND, not determined; NPG, no photoautotrophic growth.d Since this mutant does not grow photoautotrophically, this number was determined using light-activated heterotrophic grown cells.

Double aspartate mutant strains grew mixotrophically with supplemental glucose at rates close to the wild-type strain except for D557KPsaB/D566APsaB, which grew at all but the highest tested light intensity of 60 μE m−2s−1. We noted that both double mutant strains bleached early when grown mixotrophically between light intensities of 7.5 and 22 μE m−2 s−1. Strain D557APsaB/D566APsaB grew slowly photoautotrophically, but D557KPsaB/D566APsaBfailed to grow photoautotrophically at all light intensities ranging from 2.5 to 60 μE m−2 s−1. The chlorophyll content of the photoautotrophically growing cells of D557APsaB/D566APsaB was about two-thirds of that of the wild type (Table I). Whol"
https://openalex.org/W2006076332,"The NAD-dependent malic enzyme from<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate to pyruvate and CO<sub>2</sub>. Transcription of the <i>S. pombe</i> malic enzyme gene, <i>mae2</i>, was studied to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of the gene. No evidence for substrate-induced expression of <i>mae2</i> was observed in the presence of 0.2% l-malate. However, transcription of<i>mae2</i> was induced when cells were grown in high concentrations of glucose or under anaerobic conditions. The increased levels of malic enzyme may provide additional pyruvate or assist in maintaining the redox potential under fermentative conditions. Deletion and mutation analyses of the 5′-flanking region of the <i>mae2</i>gene revealed the presence of three novel negative<i>cis</i>-acting elements, URS1, URS2, and URS3, that seem to function cooperatively to repress transcription of the <i>mae2</i>gene. URS1 and URS2 are also present in the promoter region of the<i>S. pombe</i> malate transporter gene, suggesting co-regulation of their expression. Furthermore, two positive <i>cis</i>-acting elements in the <i>mae2</i> promoter, UAS1 and UAS2, show homology with the DNA recognition sites of the cAMP-dependent transcription factors ADR1, AP-2, and ATF (activating transcription factor)/CREB (cAMP response element binding)."
