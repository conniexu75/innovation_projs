https://openalex.org/W1979093531,"THE analysis of phenomena such as the ‘pseudomotor reactions’ or the ‘paradoxical pupillary dilation’ has revealed that structures deprived of their normal nerve supply show a supersensitivity to chemical stimuli. In 1939 Cannon formulated the law of denervation: “When in a series of efferent neurones a unit is destroyed, an increased irritability to chemical agents develops in the isolated structure or structures, the effect being maximal in the part directly denervated”. In their recent monograph on “The Supersensitivity of Denervated Structures”1, Cannon and Rosenblueth have discussed various factors which might be responsible for the sensitization of cells after degenerative section of their efferent nerve supply, such as inactivity, suppression of the release of chemical mediators, or removal of some kind of ‘trophic’ influence of nerves on the cells."

https://openalex.org/W2162778447,"CONSIDERABLE work has been done in the field of thyroid physiology; but the role of the thyroid in male fertility needs further clarification, since extremely variable results have been observed, due, it is believed, to species and breed differences, age and stage of sexual development, dose and duration of the hormone administration, plane of nutrition and environmental temperature. With the previous work in view, an attempt has been made to study the effects of known levels of thyroid stimulation and inhibition, under natural environmental conditions, upon the gonads, that is, on spermatogenesis, the development and secretory activity of the interstitial cells, accessory male organs, sex behaviour and semen evaluation of the growing male rabbit and the ram at various stages of sexual development."

https://openalex.org/W2051087365,"Ramsey and Street1, working on single muscle fibres, concluded that relaxation in skeletal muscle was active. Prof. A. V. Hill2 has conclusively shown that relaxation in skeletal muscle is passive. We stimulated the frog's rectus abdominis with potassium salts and acetylcholine and did not find any active relaxation. In unstriated muscle relaxation is active under some conditions and passive under others3–5. In unstriated muscle there would appear to be two cycles: in one, the energy for contraction is derived from chemical stores; in the other, the energy for contraction is derived from energy previously stored in the structure. Striated muscle appears to possess the former cycle only. This, we think, is the fundamental difference between the two kinds of muscle."

Recent work also suggests that a gene (pl) modifying the frequency of manifestation of polydactyly is located in this region, possibly between A and pa. Mrs. Wallace2, also working in this Department, determined a linkage of the order of 25 per cent recombination between fidget (fi) and Danforth's short tail (Sd). About the same time, Carter and Gruneberg3 ascertained a linkage of about 33.5 per cent recombination between fidget and agouti. Earlier work, both at Cambridge and at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory, Bar Harbor, showed indications of a loose linkage (about 40 per cent recombination) between A and Sd. Thus there was clear evidence of a second series of loci in the order A—fi—Sd."

https://openalex.org/W2068464536,"WHEN a single shock is applied to a muscle it contracts and relaxes; at constant length its tension rises and then falls, and under constant load it shortens and then lengthens. It has long been debated whether relaxation is an active or a passive process, whether lengthening after shortening is due to some positive internal activity, or merely to the effect of the external load in drawing the muscle out as its active contractile state disappears and its resting plasticity returns. Several independent observations (see ref. 1) favour the second view: (1) no heat is produced in relaxation, except such as can be attributed to the mechanical energy of the falling load; (2) over a wide range of lengths less than the normal length in the living animal, a resting muscle after relaxation shows a small but measurable tension; and (3) over this range of lengths the mechanical latent period (the interval between stimulus and onset of contraction) is practically constant. The latent period is an extremely sensitive index of ‘slack’, for shortening, particularly at shorter lengths, is relatively slow. If the muscle, or its fibres, or its ultimate contractile linkages, lengthened after a previous contraction, the slack would have to be taken up after the next stimulus and the latent period would be greatly extended."

https://openalex.org/W1990434165,"THERE are at present two groups of enzymes in mammals which hydrolyse acetylcholine: the first hydrolyses acetylcholine and acetyl-β-methylcholine and is found primarily in nervous tissue and red blood cells; the second group hydrolyses acetylcholine and benzoylcholine and is found in the serum and tissues of some animal species. Characteristic of this last group is the enzyme in human serum. In addition, there is one other related enzyme or group of enzymes which hydrolyses benzoylcholine but not acetylcholine. This was first noted and labelled benzoylcholinesterase by Sawyer1, and was reported by us as occurring in rabbit serum2."
https://openalex.org/W2032191271,"IN the course of extensive studies on the metabolic products formed by the higher fungi, mainly of the class Basidiomycetes, grown on synthetic media, we examined a sample of decayed Eucalyptus regnans wood discovered at the Australian Newsprint Mills, Boyer, Tasmania, in 1944. From this mass of rotted wood encompassed with mycelial hyphae, the acetyl derivative of a monobasic acid has been isolated. On hydrolysis this acetate (m.p. 256–257° ; [α]20D + 35.8° (c, 3.1 in pyridine); found: C, 75.9; H, 10.1 per cent; molec. wt. (Rast), 455; C29H46O4 requires C, 76.0; H, 10.1 per cent; molec. wt. 458) gave rise to the parent acid (m.p. 293°, [α]17D + 35.6° (c, 1.4 in pyridine); found: C, 77.9; H, 10.5; C27H44O3 requires C, 77.9; H, 10.6 per cent), which appears to be a C27- and not the more usual C30- type of the triterpene group, examples of which are known to occur in naturally grown Polyporos betulinus Fr.1."

At 20° C., the temperature at which the strain is kept, the females will take their first blood meal three days after emergence, will oviposit two to three days later and require a further blood meal before they will oviposit again. The duration of the life-cycle is four to five weeks."

https://openalex.org/W1963917000,"A REVIEW of the available literature on the subject of wool biology shows that practically no systematic work has been done so far on the role of various hormones on wool growth. Since the thyroid hormone regulates about 40 per cent of the energy metabolism in sheep and the growth of wool is influenced by the plane of nutrition1, as well as by other factors, an investigation was undertaken of the effects of varying levels of thyroidal stimulation or inhibition on wool growth in the growing sheep."
