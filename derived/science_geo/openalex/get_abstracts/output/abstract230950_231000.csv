https://openalex.org/W2074740541,"A major cause of aging is thought to result from the cumulative effects of cell loss over time. In yeast, caloric restriction (CR) delays aging by activating the Sir2 deacetylase. Here we show that expression of mammalian Sir2 (SIRT1) is induced in CR rats as well as in human cells that are treated with serum from these animals. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) attenuated this response. SIRT1 deacetylates the DNA repair factor Ku70, causing it to sequester the proapoptotic factor Bax away from mitochondria, thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Thus, CR could extend life-span by inducing SIRT1 expression and promoting the long-term survival of irreplaceable cells."
https://openalex.org/W2143618447,We show the anisotropic selective growth of gold tips onto semiconductor (cadmium selenide) nanorods and tetrapods by a simple reaction. The size of the gold tips can be controlled by the concentration of the starting materials. The new nanostructures display modified optical properties caused by the strong coupling between the gold and semiconductor parts. The gold tips show increased conductivity as well as selective chemical affinity for forming self-assembled chains of rods. Such gold-tipped nanostructures provide natural contact points for self-assembly and for electrical devices and can solve the difficult problem of contacting colloidal nanorods and tetrapods to the external world.
https://openalex.org/W2019310225,"Psychologists and economists have long appreciated the contribution of reward history and expectation to decision-making. Yet we know little about how specific histories of choice and reward lead to an internal representation of the ""value"" of possible actions. We approached this problem through an integrated application of behavioral, computational, and physiological techniques. Monkeys were placed in a dynamic foraging environment in which they had to track the changing values of alternative choices through time. In this context, the monkeys' foraging behavior provided a window into their subjective valuation. We found that a simple model based on reward history can duplicate this behavior and that neurons in the parietal cortex represent the relative value of competing actions predicted by this model."
https://openalex.org/W2156600512,"During succession, ecosystem development occurs; but in the long-term absence of catastrophic disturbance, a decline phase eventually follows. We studied six long-term chronosequences, in Australia, Sweden, Alaska, Hawaii, and New Zealand; for each, the decline phase was associated with a reduction in tree basal area and an increase in the substrate nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, indicating increasing phosphorus limitation over time. These changes were often associated with reductions in litter decomposition rates, phosphorus release from litter, and biomass and activity of decomposer microbes. Our findings suggest that the maximal biomass phase reached during succession cannot be maintained in the long-term absence of major disturbance, and that similar patterns of decline occur in forested ecosystems spanning the tropical, temperate, and boreal zones."
https://openalex.org/W2040733706,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the major water channel in the brain, expressed predominantly in astroglial cell membranes. Initial studies in AQP4-deficient mice showed reduced cellular brain edema following water intoxication and ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that AQP4 deletion would have the opposite effect (increased brain swelling) in vasogenic (noncellular) edema because of impaired removal of excess brain water through glial limitans and ependymal barriers. In support of this hypothesis, we found higher intracranial pressure (ICP, 52+/-6 vs. 26+/-3 cm H2O) and brain water content (81.2+/-0.1 vs. 80.4+/-0.1%) in AQP4-deficient mice after continuous intraparenchymal fluid infusion. In a freeze-injury model of vasogenic brain edema, AQP4-deficient mice had remarkably worse clinical outcome, higher ICP (22+/-4 vs. 9+/-1 cm H2O), and greater brain water content (80.9+/-0.1 vs. 79.4+/-0.1%). In a brain tumor edema model involving stereotactic implantation of melanoma cells, tumor growth was comparable in wild-type and AQP4-deficient mice. However, AQP4-deficient mice had higher ICP (39+/-4 vs. 19+/-5 cm H2O at seven days postimplantation) and corresponding accelerated neurological deterioration. Thus, AQP4-mediated transcellular water movement is crucial for fluid clearance in vasogenic brain edema, suggesting AQP4 activation and/or up-regulation as a novel therapeutic option in vasogenic brain edema."
https://openalex.org/W2015884353,"Understanding gene expression requires the ability to follow the fate of individual molecules. Here we use a cellular system for monitoring messenger RNA (mRNA)expression to characterize the movement in real time of single mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) in the nucleus of living mammalian cells. This mobility was not directed but was governed by simple diffusion. Some mRNPs were partially corralled throughout the nonhomogenous nuclear environment, but no accumulation at subnuclear domains was observed. Following energy deprivation, energy-independent motion of mRNPs was observed in a highly ATP-dependent nuclear environment; movements were constrained to chromatin-poor domains and excluded by newly formed chromatin barriers. This observation resolves a controversy, showing that the energetic requirements of nuclear mRNP trafficking are consistent with a diffusional model."
https://openalex.org/W2151012390,"The molecular mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, although reactive oxygen species are thought to have an important role. NRF2 is a transcription factor that protects cells and tissues from oxidative stress by activating protective antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. We hypothesized that NRF2 protects lungs from injury and fibrosis induced by bleomycin, an anti-neoplastic agent that causes pulmonary fibrosis in susceptible patients. To test this hypothesis, mice with targeted deletion of Nrf2 (Nrf2-/-) and wild-type (Nrf2+/+) mice were treated with bleomycin or vehicle, and pulmonary injury and fibrotic responses were compared. Bleomycin-induced increases in lung weight, epithelial cell death, and inflammation were significantly greater in Nrf2-/- mice than in Nrf2+/+ mice. Indices of lung fibrosis (hydroxyproline content, collagen accumulation, fibrotic score, cell proliferation) were significantly greater in bleomycin-treated Nrf2-/- mice, compared with Nrf2+/+ mice. NRF2 expression and activity were elevated in Nrf2+/+ mice by bleomycin. Bleomycin caused greater up-regulation of several NRF2-inducible antioxidant enzyme genes and protein products in Nrf2+/+ mice compared with Nrf2-/- mice. Further, bleomycin-induced transcripts and protein levels of lung injury and fibrosis markers were significantly attenuated in Nrf2+/+ mice compared with Nrf2-/- mice. Results demonstrated that NRF2 has a critical role in protection against pulmonary fibrosis, presumably through enhancement of cellular antioxidant capacity. This study has important implications for the development of intervention strategies against fibrosis."

Although the major signaling pathways have been unraveled, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying network remains elusive. We have translated here the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the death-receptor-activated caspase cascade into a mathematical model. A reduction down to the apoptotic core machinery enables the application of analytical mathematical methods to evaluate the system behavior within a wide range of parameters. Using parameter values from the literature, the model reveals an unstable status of survival indicating the need for further control. Based on recent publications we tested one additional regulatory mechanism at the level of initiator caspase activation and demonstrated that the resulting system displays desired characteristics such as bistability. In addition, the results from our model studies allowed us to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population.

In addition, the results from our model studies allowed us to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population. Apoptosis is a genetically defined major form of programmed cell death enabling the organism to remove unwanted cells, e.g. during embryonal development and after immune responses, to select educated immune cells and to eliminate virally infected and transformed cells (1Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). Enhanced or inhibited apoptotic cell death can be involved in severe pathological alterations, including developmental defects, autoimmune diseases, neurodegeneration, or cancer. Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways can be distinguished, although partly employing overlapping signal transduction pathways. A hallmark of the ongoing apoptotic process is the activation of a family of aspartate-directed cysteine proteases, the caspases. Caspases are produced as proenzymes and become activated upon cleavage (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Activation of caspases finally dismantles the cells via the cleavage of important regulatory and structural proteins and enables phagocytic removal of the dying cell (4Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). A simplified outline of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis induction after death receptor stimulation is depicted in Fig. 1. Mathematical modeling and systems theory can provide valuable tools to get insight into complex dynamical systems, to test hypotheses, and to identify weak points (5Kitano H. Nature. 2002; 420: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 6Csete M.E. Doyle J.C. Science. 2002; 295: 1664-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Previous modeling approaches in apoptosis focused on the extrinsically triggered pathways, resulting in complex models (7Fussenegger M. Bailey J.E. Varner J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Schöberl B. Gilles E.D. Scheurich P. Yi T.-M. Hucka M. Morohashi M. Kitano H. Proceedings of the International Congress of Systems Biology, Pasadena, CA, November 4–7, 2001. Omnipress, Madison, WI2001: 158-167Google Scholar). The model parameters were fitted to data derived from cell population studies showing caspase activation in a range from 30 min to several hours. These models can describe and nicely illustrate certain aspects of the signal transduction pathway. However, more recent experimental results performed at the single cell level show that the majority of caspases are activated within a very short time interval (<15 min) (9Rehm M. Dussmann H.

Obviously, the single cell level is relevant for a mechanistic understanding. With the focus on receptor-induced apoptosis, we used Monte Carlo methods to look for parameter domains that enable an appropriate description of apoptosis induction in a single cell (model based on Fig. 1, data not shown). The obtained results revealed an unexpected responsiveness of the system toward minute initiator caspase activation if required to act rapidly. This behavior of the model was caused by the caspase cascade that represents the main signaling route in so-called type I cells (13Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1, yellow background). We therefore translated the current picture of the extrinsically triggered caspase cascade in a very elementary form into a mathematical model enabling a thorough investigation through the application of analytical methods. Our results showed that within large parameter ranges, including values from the literature, this straightforward model structure is unable to appropriately describe the expected behavior that can be deduced from experimental data. We then showed a way of extending our model structure to reconcile these observed differences and presented a model now able to describe key characteristics like a fast execution phase and bistability. In addition, results from our model studies show a way to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population in terms of understanding and modeling. The Mathematical Model—For each reaction considered under “Results” one reaction rate can be deduced (v1–v13). The cleavage reactions (1, 2, and 4) are treated as being irreversible, and it is assumed that the intermediary cleavage products (“enzyme-substrate complexes”) only achieve very low levels and can thus be eliminated as reasonable estimations that have been confirmed by simulation experiments (data not shown). The reaction rate equations are deduced according to the law of mass action, which we here consider prior to other kinetic approaches, like Michaelis-Menten kinetics, although theoretical considerations show that the results would be very similar in our case. From this, molecular balances can be derived for each considered molecular species resulting in a system of ordinary differential equations (see Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Two different model structures are considered in greater detail during this study. The basic model includes the reactions 1–10 and translates into the Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (not including v11 in Equation 2). The extended model hypothesis includes all reactions and translates into the complete equation system where v1 = k1[C8*]·[C3], v2 = k2[C3*]·[C8], v3 = k3[C3*]·[IAP] – k–3[iC3* ∼ IAP], v4 = k4[C3*]·[IAP], v5 = k5[C8*], v6 = k6[C3*] v7 = k7[iC3* ∼ IAP], v8 = k8[IAP] – k–8, v9 = k9[C8] – k–9, v10 = k10[C3] – k–10, v11 = k11[C8*]·[BAR] – k–11[iC8* ∼ BAR], v12 = k12[BAR] – k–12, and v13 = k13[iC8* ∼ BAR].d[C8]dt=−v2−v9(Eq. 1) d[C8*]dt=v2−v5(−v11)(Eq. 2) d[C3]dt=−v1−v10(Eq. 3) d[C3*]dt=v1−v3−v6(Eq. 4) d[IAP]dt=−v3−v4−v8(Eq. 5) d[C3*~IAP]dt=v3−v7(Eq. 6) d[BAR]dt=−v11−v12(Eq. 7) d[C8*~BAR]dt=v11−v13(Eq. 8) The models were implemented in both Matlab (for simulation experiments) and Mathematica (for analytical analysis). Initial Conditions, Parameters, and Units—The average concentrations in an unstimulated cell (i.e. initial conditions) of caspase 8 and 3 were quantified in HeLa cells to be 130,000 and 21,000 molecules/cell, respectively, using quantitative Western blot analyses. 1T. Eissing, H. Conzelmann, E. D. Gilles, F. Allgöwer, E. Bullinger, and P. Scheurich, unpublished data. The average concentration of IAP(s) 2The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; BAR, bifunctional apoptosis regulator; CARP, caspase 8- and 10-associated RING proteins; Cn, pro-caspase n; Cn*, activated caspase n. was estimated to be 40,000 molecules/cell. Other reported concentrations are 30, 200, and 30 nm for caspase 8, caspase 3, and XIAP, respectively (14Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M.

Estimating a cell volume of 1 picoliter shows that 600 molecules/cell = 1 nm. Accordingly, these values are roughly in the same order of magnitude and were used as initial concentrations. The other compounds were considered not to be present in the absence of a stimulus. In the extended model, the concentration of the newly introduced molecule BAR was assumed to be 40,000 molecules/cell. We consider the unit molecules/cell more illustrative for cellular concentrations than the unit molar, but on the other hand we prefer and use units such as m–1 s–1 for the Km/kcat ratios. Table I lists the parameters as used in the “single set” simulations (unless indicated otherwise). The respective values are also provided in more common units (in brackets). For the reactions 3 and 5–10 the parameter values were taken from literature as stated in the text. The respective references are summarized in Table II. For the reactions 1, 2, and 4 values were chosen that are in accordance with the desired kinetics and the requirement for bistability (as deduced from bifurcation analyses). The values for reaction 11 were fixed under the assumption of a similar binding affinity as reported for reaction 3. The values for the reactions 12 and 13 represent estimated turnover rates.Table ISimulation parametersValueUnitValueUnitk15.8·10-5 (5.8·105)cell·min-1·mo-1 (m-1 s-1)k-10k210-5 (105)cell·min-1·mo-1 (m-1 s-1)k-20k35·10-4 (5·106)cell·min-1·mo-1 (m-1 s-1)k-30.21 (0.035)min-1 (s-1)k43·10-4 (3·106)cell·min-1·mo-1 (m-1 s-1)k-40k55.8·10-3 (120)min-1 (min)k-50k65.8·10-3 (120)min-1 (min)k-60k71.73·10-2 (40)min-1 (min)k-70k81.16·10-2 (60)min-1 (min)k-8464 (1.3·10-11)mo·cell-1·min-1 (m·s-1)k93.9·10-3 (180)min-1 (min)k-9507 (1.4·10-11)mo·cell-1·min-1 (m·s-1)k103.9·10-3 (180)min-1 (min)k-1081.9 (2.3·10-12)mo·cell-1·min-1 (m·s-1)k115·10-4 (5·106)cell·min-1·mo-1 (m-1 s-1)k-110.21 (0.035)min-1 (s-1)k1210-3 (693)min-1 (min)k-1240 (1.1·10-12)mo·cell-1·min-1 (m·s-1)k131.16·10-2 (60)min-1 (min)k-130 Open table in a new tab Table IIUnstability rangesk+mink+maxk-Explanations and refs.m-1 s-1m-1 s-1m-1 s-1v13·1045·106NoIn vitro KM/kcat = 106m-1 s-1 (14Stennicke H.R.

A consecutive elimination of variables leads to a polynomial in C3*, whose solutions present the steady state concentrations of C3* from which the steady state concentrations of the other molecular species can be derived. The life steady state can be factored out leaving a quadratic equation of the general form ax2 + bx + c = 0 for the basic model and a fourth-order polynomial for the extended model. The quadratic formula was used to construct the green (b2 = 4ac; saddle-node bifurcation manifold) and the blue (–b/a = 0) area in Fig. 3. Interestingly, the coefficient c is the same as the coefficient c derived in the stability analysis (see below). Stability Analysis—For the life steady state one can construct the characteristic polynomial det(λI – A) = 0. Here, det refers to the determinant, λ represents the eigenvalues, I represents the identity matrix, and A represents the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the life steady state. For the non-linear ordinary differential equation system to be locally (asymptotically) stable, all eigenvalues need to have negative real parts. The Hurwitz criterion provides conditions for stability based on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. The most restrictive for the basic model is that the coefficient c (below) is positive, which was also used to construct the red area shown in Fig. 3 (transcritical bifurcation manifold). The stability of the steady states other than the life steady state were evaluated numerically, c = k5(IAP k3k7 + k6(k7 + k–3)) – C3 C8 k1k2(k7 + k–3). Deriving an Input Distribution—We assume a population behavior as depicted in Fig. 5A, which can be interpreted as a probability distribution. We further assume that 100% of caspase activation corresponds to 100% cell death, i.e. caspase 3 becomes significantly activated in every cell within the population. Furthermore, based on the simulations of the deterministic single cell model described in Fig. 4, we can describe the maximal caspase 3 activation as a function of C8* input. Hereby we assume the maximal caspase activation to define the time point of cell death. This correlates the stochastic time point of cell death to a stochastic input signal for the single cells within a population. From the original distribution of Fig. 5A we thus obtain a distribution of cell death probability as a function of input activation. The corresponding probability density function can be derived by differentiation as shown in Fig. 5B.Fig. 4Bistable behavior of the extended model. Simulation experiments with varying inputs (initial C8* concentrations) and C3* over time as output are shown. Above a certain input threshold (∼75 molecules of C8*) the system becomes fully activated, whereas subthreshold activation results in recovery. The two stable steady states can be envisioned, with the life steady state corresponding to the blue area and the apoptotic steady state corresponding to the green area achieved after longer time periods.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Biology of the Model System—The type I cell-like (13Scaffidi C.

As a model input we use a pulse of activated caspase 8, which is produced by the death-inducing signaling complex formed at the membrane after death receptor stimulation (16Lavrik I. Krueger A.

Activated caspase 3 binds to and is inactivated by XIAP, here for simplicity termed IAP, as cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 also have the capacity to block caspase 3, although with less efficiency (22Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 23Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). IAP-bound activated caspase 3 may form a pool (Reaction 3), but, in parallel, IAP molecules can be cleaved by the activated caspase 3 (Reaction 4).

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activated caspases, as well as activated caspase 3 complexed with IAPs, are continuously degraded and pro-caspases and IAPs are subjected to a turnover (Reactions 5–10, degradation and turnover reactions detailed under “Experimental Procedures”). We thus obtain a system of six ordinary differential equations as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Bistability and Apoptosis—Several signal transduction pathways governing cell fate decisions have experimentally and theoretically been shown to display a bistable behavior (25Ferrell J.E. Xiong W. Chaos. 2001; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 26Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 27Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Bistability is also an obvious and mandatory property of the apoptotic machinery, as the status “alive” must be stable and resistant toward minor accidental trigger signals (i.e. “noise”) (28Tyson J.J. Chen K.C. Novak B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Also, caspases are known to possess zymogenicity (18Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and partial activation is observed in some physiological processes (29Newton K. Strasser A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, if the apoptotic initiation signal is beyond a certain threshold, the cell must irreversibly enter the pathway to develop apoptosis. In the following, we use this information in a reverse engineering manner (6Csete M.E. Doyle J.C. Science. 2002; 295: 1664-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) and take bistability as an “essential condition” to evaluate possible models with respect to this expected behavior. The Basic Model Shows an Unstable Life Steady State— Solving the equation system of our basic model under steady state conditions reveals three steady states. One of these, the “life steady state,” corresponds to the initial conditions in which the system remains without an external trigger, i.e. without initial caspase 8 activation. This was expected because our model parameters defining the new synthesis of molecules had been chosen to balance their degradation, and additional influences were neglected. The stability of the steady state provides information about the system behavior close to that steady state, indicating the response to very minor activating input signals. If the steady state is stable, the system will return to its original steady state, provided the perturbations are small enough, which is a situation expected for our model. The stability of a steady state can be evaluated using the Hurwitz criterion, which is well established in systems theory (see “Experimental Procedures”). The point where the stability properties change, i.e. the bifurcation point, provides insight into the qualitative system behavior for certain parameter ranges. We introduced fixed parameter values for all reaction rates except for Reaction 1 (Table I) and found that the life steady state is only stable for k1 values below ∼3.2 × 103m–1 s–1, a value more than 300 times lower than reported in literature (14Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 18Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (the situation is illustrated in Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the bifurcation point (red area) in dependence of three parameter classes with fixed ratios in each class. The parameter combination that can be deduced from literature (Fig. 3, yellow dot) is far away from those combinations enabling a stable life steady state (Fig. 3, below the red area). To further confirm our results, we conducted several million simulations with small inputs and random sets of parameters taken from the parameter ranges shown in Table II. All combinations resulted in significant caspase activation with very small input signals (i.e. an unstable life steady state), although the onset time varied greatly (data not shown). Bistability within a Small Parameter Domain—The two additional steady states besides the life steady state provide further information. Theoretically, one additional steady state within the positive concentration range is sufficient to achieve bistability (because phenomena other than an unstable steady state could separate the two stable steady states). However, in our model this configuration is only possible above the red area in Fig. 3 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and for that setting the life steady state is unstable. Accordingly, bistability is only possible if both additional steady states are within the positive concentration range (Fig. 3, above the blue area). Another restriction is imposed by our biological system, because the solutions must contain real numbers (Fig. 3, above the green area). Thus, bistability is only possible in a very restricted parameter area far away from values reported in literature (Fig. 3, yellow dot). In accordance with general considerations on this topic (25Ferrell J.E. Xiong W. Chaos. 2001; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 30Angeli D. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Sontag E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) the feedback from caspase 3 onto caspase 8 is necessary for bistability (data not shown). IAPs and Their Cleavage—Interestingly, by and large the stability of the life steady state seems to be independent of the IAP cleavage reaction (Fig. 3). This is not expected and indeed dynamic simulations show that, upon faster IAP cleavage, the onset of caspase activation is achieved more rapidly for parameter combinations where the life steady state is unstable (data not shown). However, for parameter combinations where the life steady state is stable, a slower reaction stabilizes the life steady state by enlargement of its area of attraction (globally stable without this reaction). This can be explained by the fact that we assumed higher concentrations of IAPs than that of caspase 3 to make a conservative estimation concerning the stability of the life steady state. If we assume lower numbers of IAP molecules, we can achieve bistability (which would also require the turnover of IAPs not to exceed that of caspases significantly) even in the absence of this cleavage reaction. However, the parameters in which a stable life steady state is possible would be even further away from those values reported in literature (data not shown). Together, the model indicates that the IAP cleavage reaction is important for a decisive switching. Further analysis of the model reveals that apoptosis can only proceed after the IAP pool is exhausted, as otherwise most of the active caspase 3 molecules become neutralized (data not shown). As the binding of active caspase 3 to IAPs is a reversible reaction, a slower degradation of the complexes would elevate the levels of free active caspase 3 and therefore promote apoptosis. Thus, our results also argue for the view of IAPs as altruistic proteins sacrificing themselves to prevent cell death (31Ditzel M. Meier P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 449-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In our investigations we did not change the initial concentrations to restrict the number of free parameters. However, in the mathematical formulas it can be seen that changing a parameter value has similar effects as changing an initial concentration, and so we have indirectly evaluated these influences as well. Bistability through Model Extension—An inherent problem of the described basic model of caspase activation is that relatively fast activation kinetics must be realized to be consistent with parameter values from literature and observations in various experimental setups (9Rehm M.

The small GTPases H-Ras, K-Ras4B (referred to here as K-Ras), and N-Ras participate critically in the control of complex networks of signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death (1Bar-Sagi D.

Ras proteins can control diverse cellular behaviors because of the ability of all Ras isoforms to activate a common set of effectors, including Raf-1, PI3-K RalGEFs, phospholipase Cϵ, RIN, and Tiam-1 (1Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 2Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar, 3Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 4Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of how Ras output is coordinated and how each Ras isoform selects its set of effectors remains limited. Nonetheless, a number of experiments have demonstrated that the cellular context and the type of Ras isoform are important determinants of the Ras signal output. First, it was observed that in mice, knockout of K-Ras, but not of H-Ras or N-Ras, is lethal to embryos, suggesting that the Ras isoforms might have distinct biological functions (8Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Pellicer A. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies showed that Ras regulation of matrix metaloproteinase-2 transcription was abolished in K-Ras but not in N-Ras knockout fibroblasts (10Liao J. Wolfman J.C. Wolfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31871-31878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Second, earlier experiments showed that activated Ras elicits transformation in immortal rodent cells but induces cell senescence in primary rodent cells (11Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar). Third, the types of effectors required for Ras transformation of rodent cells were found to differ from those required in human cells (12Hamad N.M. Elconin J.H. Karnoub A.E. Bai W. Rich J.N. Abraham R.T. Der C.J. Counter C.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2045-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). An analogous distinct effector-type requirement was documented in PC-12 cells, in which Raf and PI3-K signaling promote cell cycle arrest, whereas RalGEF signaling promotes cell proliferation (13Goi T. Rusanescu G. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1731-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Last is the observation that activated K-Ras in human pancreatic tumor cell lines does not correlate with persistent activation ERK (14Yip-Schneider M.T. Lin A. Barnard D. Sweeney C.J. Marshall M.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms that allow Ras proteins to select their effectors and to elicit diverse biological effects. Recent experiments have provided new insights into mechanisms that can promote selectivity of Ras signaling. These studies show that H-Ras and K-Ras proteins are localized in distinct microdomains in the cell membrane that could confer specificity to the Ras signal (3Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 6Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.J. Hancock J.F. Nat.

Reports have also documented the localization of Ras in intracellular compartments (16Jiang X. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Chiu V.K.

Deeds L. Faller D.V. Chen C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5775-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), where Ras targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi activated distinct effectors (17Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson 2nd, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that specificity of Ras signaling can be achieved by regulation of the activity of Ras effectors (19Rusanescu G. Gotoh T. Tian X. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another important sign that Ras signaling selectivity can be achieved at the level of Ras-effector interactions comes from the observation that galectin-1, discovered originally as a β-galactoside-binding protein (20Lahm H. Andre S. Hoeflich A. Fischer J.R. Sordat B. Kaltner H. Wolf E. Gabius H.J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), interacts with activated H-Ras and K-Ras proteins and diverts the Ras signal toward Raf-1 and away from PI3-K (21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 22Elad-Sfadia G. Haklai R. Ballan E. Gabius H.J. Kloog Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37169-37175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments that H-Ras(G12V) pulls down significantly more galectin-1 than K-Ras(G12V) (22Elad-Sfadia G. Haklai R. Ballan E. Gabius H.J. Kloog Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37169-37175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that interactions of galectin-1 with H-Ras-GTP and with K-Ras-GTP are not identical. We wondered whether K-Ras or H-Ras isoforms might find another intracellular galectin partner that would elicit a different pattern of Ras membrane interactions, effector utilization, or both. Herein, we demonstrate that galectin-3 acts as a specific binding partner of activated K-Ras and that this interaction promotes strong K-Ras activation of PI3-K and Raf-1 as well as attenuation of ERK activation. Plasmids and Constructs—We cloned the entire coding sequence of human galectin-3 cDNA from total RNA of macrophage 4437 cells using the forward primer 5′-TATAGAATTCAAATGGCAGACAATTTTTCGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TATAGAATTCGATTATATCATGGTATATGAAGC-3′ in an reverse transcription-PCR amplification system (ACCESS RT-PCR; Promega). The 756-bp PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and then cloned into the NotI site of pCDNA3 (pc-Gal-3). We prepared galectin-3 130-bp antisense RNA corresponding to the 5′ end of galectin-3 by PCR using the pcDNA3-galectin-3 vector, the forward primer described above, and the reverse primer 5′-TAT AGG ATC CAT GGC CCC AGG ATA GGA AGC C-3′.

The orientation and sequence of the galectin-3 sense and antisense vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblotting—We co-transfected 1.5 × 106 COS-7 cells with 1.5 μg of DNA. The cells were transfected with plasmid DNA coding for galectin-3 (0.75 μg) along with plasmid DNAs coding for H-Ras(G12V) (0.75 μg), H-Ras(wt) (0.09 μg), K-Ras(G12V) (0.375 μg), K-Ras(wt) (0.375 μg), N-Ras(wt) (0.21 μg), or N-Ras(G13V) (0.21 μg). The different amounts of plasmid DNAs coding for the Ras isoforms were chosen to obtain equal levels of Ras expression. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection (22Elad-Sfadia G. Haklai R. Ballan E.

We also transected cells with 0.15 μg of DNA encoding K-Ras(G12V) alone or together with 2.85 μg of DNA encoding galectin-3 complemented with 3 μg of pcDNA3. Otherwise, cells were transfected with 6 μg of galectin-3 AS or DNA encoding galectin-3 for the determination of their impact on endogenous Ras-GTP, PI3-K activity, or Raf-1 activity. In addition, cells were transfected with 3.0 μg of DNA encoding p120RasGAP and 3.0 μg of pcDNA3, or 3.0 μg of DNA encoding galectin-3 and 3.0 μg of pcDNA3, or 3.0 μg of DNA encoding p120RasGAP and 3.0 μg of DNA encoding galectin-3 or 6.0 μg of pcDNA3 (vector control). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were starved of serum for 24 h, then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times and lysed and subjected to determination of total GFP-Ras (∼54 kDa), GFP-Ras-GTP, ERK, or phospho-ERK essentially as detailed earlier (21Paz A.

Confocal Microscopy—In these experiments, cells were co-transfected with GFP-Ras and pcDNA3-gal-3, fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked (30 min) with 2% bovine serum albumin and 200 μg/ml goat γ-globulin. Cells were labeled with galectin-3 Ab by successive incubations (each 45 min, 22 °C) with 1 μg/ml anti-galectin-3 Ab, 5 μg/ml biotin-goat anti rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), and 0.5 μg/ml Cy3-streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Each incubation was followed by three extensive washes. Background staining was obtained on samples from which galectin-3 Ab was omitted. Dual fluorescence digital images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope fitted with fluorescein and rhodamine filters (21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics) was used to analyze and quantify the extent of galectin-3 translocation to the cell membrane. Galectin-3 Is a Specific Binding Partner of Activated K-Ras— Galectin-1 and -3 seem to be the most abundant galectins in human tumors (27Camby I. Belot N. Rorive S. Lefranc F. Maurage C.A. Lahm H.

We therefore suspected that galectin-3 might be a reasonable candidate as a Ras-binding partner. We first used a previously designed cross-linking/two-step gel procedure in an attempt to detect Ras/galectin-3 complexes (21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This procedure uses a reducible cross-linker, and the cross-linked Ras adducts are first separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. To release Ras and its putative binding partner from the complexes, slowly migrating Ras adducts are extracted from the gel in the presence of the reducing reagent dithiothreitol (DTT). The individual proteins are then resolved by a second SDS-PAGE step (21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We used fibroblasts that stably express the activated GTP-bound H-Ras(G12V), K-Ras(G12V), or N-Ras(G13V) (21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and exhibit significant amounts of endogenous galectin-3 (Fig. 1A). Membranes of these Ras-transformed cells were subjected to the cross-linking/two-step gel procedure. The first gel was sliced, and from each slice proteins corresponding to gel migration of 34–43 kDa, 43–57 kDa, or 57–90 kDa were extracted under reducing conditions using DTT (immunoblots of the first gels are not shown). Three equal aliquots of the extracts were then separated by a second SDS-PAGE step followed by immunoblotting with either pan anti-Ras Ab or anti-galectin-3 Ab. The third sample was immunoblotted with anti-galectin-1 Ab (21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar) for comparison. This procedure enabled us to determine whether the 21-kDa Ras proteins and the 34-kDa galectin-3 protein were present in complexes of higher Mr and released from them by DTT. Consistent with previous experiments, we found that H-, K-, and N-Ras were present in the more slowly migrating protein complexes of the first gel (Ref. 21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Galectin-3 and galectin-1 were detected in slowly migrating H-Ras(G12V) and K-Ras(G12V) complexes as well (Fig. 1A). In addition, larger amounts of galectin-1 were released from H-Ras(G12V) complexes than from K-Ras(G12V) complexes (Ref. 21Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). On the other hand, significantly larger amounts of galectin-3 were released from slowly migrating (43–57 kDa and 57–90 kDa) adducts of K-Ras(G12V) than from H-Ras(G12V) adducts (Fig. 1). The galectin-3 immunoreactive band at 34–43 kDa (Fig. 1A) is too small to account for Ras/galectin-3 complexes and seems to correspond to the free 34-kDa galectin-3 protein. However, the 43–57-kDa complexes, from which both the 21-kDa Ras and the 34-kDa galectin-3 were released by DTT, could account for Ras/galectin-3 complexes as their apparent Mr values correspond to the expected sum of their molecular masses (55 kDa). This latter finding pointed to the possible existence of a heterocomplex of K-Ras(G12V) and galectin-3. The Ras/galectin-3 adducts at the highest range (57–90 kDa) might represent high order complexes. It is noteworthy that only very small amounts of galectin-1 or -3 were released from 43–57-kDa or 57–90-kDa adducts of N-Ras(G13V) (Fig. 1A). This suggests that N-Ras(G13V) may not interact with galectin-1 or -3. On the other hand, it is possible that high order galectin-3 complexes that did not enter the first gel were formed in the N-Ras(G13V) cells, reducing the levels of free galectin-3 available for interactions with N-Ras(G13V). Consistent with the second possibility is the observation that no 34–43-kDa galectin-3 immunoreactive band was detected in the N-Ras(G13V) expressing cells (Fig. 1A). Together, these findings suggest that galectin-3 might interact directly with activated K-Ras. Preferential galetin-3/K-Ras interactions, however, may not be conclusively deduced from these experiments because of the the significant excess of galectin-3 in the K-Ras-expressing cells. This possibility was further examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cells that express comparable amounts of galectin-3. Preferential Co-immunoprecipitation of Galectin-3 with Activated K-Ras—To further examine the possibility that K-Ras interacts with galectin-3, we used co-immunoprecipitation assays, which are independent of the cross-linking procedure. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with galectin-3 together with K-Ras(wt), K-Ras(G12V), H-Ras(wt), H-Ras(G12V), N-Ras(wt), and N-Ras(G13V). The wild-type Ras isoforms were included in these experiments to examine whether interaction of galectin-3 with K- or H-Ras depends on their GDP/GTP states. Lysates of the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with pan anti-Ras Ab followed by immunoblotting with anti-galectin-3 or anti-Ras Ab. Results of a typical experiment (Fig. 1B) demonstrate that galectin-3 co-immunoprecipitated with K-Ras(G12V) from lysates of K-Ras(G12V)/galectin-3 co-transfectants. At comparable levels of expression of Ras and galectin-3 (Fig. 1B, left), only small amounts of galectin-3 co-immunoprecipitated with K-Ras(wt), H-Ras(wt), H-Ras("

https://openalex.org/W2007265276,"Exposure of naïve B cells to the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and/or antigen leads to a state of ""priming,"" in which subsequent aggregation of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules induces the mobilization of calcium ions and cell proliferation. However, it is not clear how critical this priming is for immune responses or how it is normally induced in vivo. Injection of mice with the commonly used adjuvant alum led to priming of splenic B cells and to the accumulation in the spleen of a previously unknown population of IL-4-producing, Gr1+ cells. These cells and IL-4 were both required for in vivo priming and expansion of antigen-specific B cells, as well as for optimal production of antibody. These studies reveal a key role for a previously unknown accessory myeloid cell population in the generation of humoral immune responses."

Peripheral blood from 85 AMD patients and 105 subjects without AMD (controls), as well as ocular tissue from 40 pathological sections with AMD and two normal eye sections, were screened for V249I and T280M, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CX3CR1. An increased prevalence, with the highest odds ratio of 3.57, of the I249 and M280 carriers was found among the AMD cases as compared with the controls. When comparing CX3CR1 expression in the archived eye sections, CX3CR1 transcripts were not detectable in the maculae of AMD eyes bearing T/M280; however, transcripts were detected in the maculae of normal eyes bearing T/T280 or T/M280 as well as in the AMD maculae bearing T/T280. Furthermore, lower CX3CR1 protein expression was observed in the maculae of AMD eyes bearing T/M280 compared with the controls bearing T/T280. The I249 and M280 alleles result in a lowered number of receptor binding sites and a decreased ligand affinity. Our data suggest that a decrease, caused by sequence variation and/or lower CX3CR1 expression, in CX3CR1-induced cellular activities could contribute to AMD development."

Mus81-deficient mice and cells were hypersensitive to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C but not to γ-irradiation. Remarkably, both homozygous Mus81 –/– and heterozygous Mus81 +/– mice exhibited a similar susceptibility to spontaneous chromosomal damage and a profound and equivalent predisposition to lymphomas and other cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2002753297,"Mammalian Drp1 is a dynamin-like GTPase required for mitochondrial fission. Although it exists primarily as a cytosolic homo-tetramer in vivo, it can also self-assemble into higher order structures on the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is required for proper mitochondrial division. Functional studies and sequence comparisons have revealed four different structural domains in Drp1, comprising N-terminal GTP-binding, middle, insert B, and C-terminal GTPase effector (GED) domains. Here we describe an intramolecular interaction within Drp1 between the GED and the N-terminal GTP-binding and middle domains. A point mutation (K679A) within the C-terminal GED domain inhibits this intramolecular association, without affecting the formation of Drp1 tetramers or the intermolecular associations among isolated C-terminal domains. Mutant Drp1 K679A exhibits impaired GTPase activity, and when overexpressed in mammalian cells it decreases mitochondrial division. Sedimentation experiments indicate that the K679A mutation either increases Drp1 complex formation or, more likely, decreases complex disassembly as compared with wild-type Drp1. Taken together, these data suggest that the C-terminal GED domain is important for stimulation of GTPase activity, formation and stability of higher order complexes, and efficient mitochondrial division.

In many cases, detailed analyses have been performed to characterize the domains involved in assembly and cooperative GTPase stimulation of these proteins. Most appear to have an N-terminal GTP-binding domain, a middle assembly domain, a short insert (in dynamin, a pleckstrin homology domain), and a C-terminal assembly domain dubbed the “GTPase effector domain” (GED). 1The abbreviations used are: GED, GTPase effector domain; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; CBP, calmodulin-binding protein; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. In the case of the dynamin, guanylate-binding protein, and Mx proteins, an intramolecular domain association has been identified, with the GED domain folding back to interact with the GTP-middle domains (18Prakash B. Praefcke G.J.K. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Schumacher B. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

The GED domain is critical for not only assembly of higher order complexes but also for cooperative stimulation of GTPase activity. In fact, the significance of the intramolecular backfolding of the GED domain of dynamin has been emphasized by studies suggesting that it functions as an intramolecular GTPase-activating protein (24Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 25Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Also, the conservation of amino acid residues within this region has led to the extension of the intramolecular GTPase-activating protein concept to other dynamin-like GTPases such as yeast Dnm1p (26Fukushima N.H. Brisch E. Keegan B.R. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2756-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A major area of controversy is whether members of the dynamin superfamily act as regulatory GTPases or are involved directly as mechanoenzymes in severing membranes (4Sever S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Praefcke G.J.K. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Studies have evaluated effects of mutations in highly conserved Arg and Lys residues within the C-terminal GED domain in dynamin but with conflicting results for both endocytosis and GTPase activity (24Sever S.

The effects of similar mutations on mitochondrial division have also been evaluated in the yeast Dnm1p protein (26Fukushima N.H. Brisch E. Keegan B.R. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2756-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the interactions as well as the functional and structural roles of the GED domain of mammalian Drp1 remain unclear. Here we investigate the inter- and intramolecular associations of the mammalian Drp1 GTPase, focusing on the role of the C-terminal GED domain of Drp1 in self-interactions, GTPase activity, and mitochondrial morphology. DNA Constructs—Complementary DNAs for full-length Homo sapiens Drp1 (GenBank™ accession number AB006965) or C- and N-terminal deletions were generated by PCR using PfuTurbo™ DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with EcoRI ends added and cloned into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pGW1 (29Blackstone C.

Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). N-terminal c-Myc (EQKLISEEDL, single-letter amino acid code) or HA epitope tags (YPYDVPDYA) were engineered into pGW1 after an initiator methionine residue where indicated (29Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R.

For yeast two-hybrid tests, Drp1 deletion constructs were produced by PCR amplification using PfuTurbo™ polymerase, incorporating EcoRI restriction sites for subcloning in-frame into pGAD10 or pBHA (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ method (Stratagene) and confirmed in each construct by DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence. Antibodies—Affinity-purified antipeptide antibodies against Drp1 (amino acids 511–526; acetyl-NIEEQRRNRLARELPSC-amide; number 2457) were prepared commercially in rabbits (BioSource, Hopkinton, MA), with the terminal cysteine added to facilitate coupling. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA-probe (Y-11) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Yeast Two-hybrid Tests—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously using the L40 yeast strain, with selection by HIS3 and β-galactosidase induction (29Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interactions were semi-quantified based on growth on -His/Leu/Trp plates supplemented with 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and time for colonies to turn blue in X-gal filter lift assays at room temperature, with similar results obtained in at least three experiments (29Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—COS-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected as described previously (29Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 100 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added (37 °C, 30 min) before fixation. About 24–36 h following transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After several washes with PBS, they were incubated with ice-cold acetone for 10 min. After several more washes, they were incubated in blocking buffer (3% horse serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc epitope antibodies or rabbit anti-Drp1 antibodies (number 2457) were added at 1 μg/ml for 1 h in blocking buffer at 25 °C. Where indicated, the anti-Drp1 antibodies were preadsorbed with immunogenic or control peptides (10 μm) prior to use. After several washes with blocking buffer, Alexa Fluor 488 and/or Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibodies (1:200; Molecular Probes) were added for 30 min. After several washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted using Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Single focal plane images were acquired with either a Zeiss LSM-510 or Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope. For determination of mitochondrial morphology, a blinded observer classified the predominant mitochondrial morphology in mock, Myc-Drp1 wild type, Myc-Drp1 K38A, or Myc-Drp1 K679A transfected COS-7 cells at 24–36 h after transfection as either wild-type/fragmented, elongated tubules, or clumped/aggregated. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with PBS, then solubilized with 1.0% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA in PBS, and clarified by centrifugation (130,000 × g,60 min). The extract (100 μg of protein) was incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal HA probe antibodies (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) precoupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma-Aldrich), and the beads were washed four times with 1.0% Triton X-100 in PBS. For immunoblotting, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels and then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (29Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Gel Exclusion Chromatography—Wild-type or mutant Myc-Drp1-expressing COS-7 cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and clarified by centrifugation (130,000 × g, 30 min). The soluble extract was applied to a FPLC Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min in 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-Myc antibodies. Protein standards (Amersham Biosciences and Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS were applied to the column to generate a standard curve, from which the native molecular weights of wild-type or mutant forms of Myc-Drp1 were calculated. GTPase Activity Assays—The cDNAs for wild-type and mutant Drp1 were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pCAL-n-EK for the production of calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) fusion proteins (Stratagene). CBP-Drp1 fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) expressing full-length CBP-tagged wild-type Drp1, Drp1 K679A, or Drp1 K38A as described previously (30Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified CBP-Drp1 fusion proteins were dialyzed against assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction mixture for the GTPase assay included 2.3 μm dialyzed CBP-Drp1 protein with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and 165 nm [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in assay buffer. Samples of the reaction mixtures were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose on polyester TLC plates (Sigma-Aldrich) at various time points. Guanine nucleotides were separated by ascending chromatography in 1.0 m formic acid and 1.2 m LiCl. The [32P]GDP and [32P]GTP spots were identified, and the intensities were quantified using phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). GTPase activity was expressed as the ratio of GDP to total guanine nucleotides (GDP + GTP) at each time point. All of the data points represent the averages of at least three independent experiments ± standard deviation. Sedimentation Assay and Chemical Cross-linking—COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant Myc-Drp1 constructs as described above. The cells were washed several times, lysed, and then harvested in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 50 mm NaCl. The membrane fraction was pelleted for 1 h at 120,000 × g; the supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 300,000 × g for 1 h. Equal proportions of the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies (0.2 μg/ml). For chemical cross-linking studies, transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed; the post-nuclear supernatant was then incubated with 0.25–1.0 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce) in PBS for 2 h on ice. After the reactions were quenched with 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), the proteins were resolved on Criterion 4–15% acrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted. We generated polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies against the human Drp1 protein (number 2457), and used these to determine the localization of endogenous Drp1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1). Punctate staining is found distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, panel A1), often localizing to mitochondrial tubules (Fig. 1, panels A1–A3). In some cases, isolated Drp1-positive puncta are evident at sites of mitochondrial constriction, likely representing sites of subsequent mitochondrial division (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Preadsorption of the antibodies with the immunogenic peptide completely eliminated Drp1 staining, but the same concentration of a control peptide did not (data not shown). Because the Drp1 foci in Fig. 1 might represent higher order structures of Drp1 and, by analogy with other dynamin superfamily members, it is likely that formation of higher order Drp1 complexes is critical for mitochondrial division, we systematically evaluated the domain determinants of self-association in Drp1 using yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2). Two domains that are important for self-association of Drp1 have previously been described, ADH1 and ADH2 (31Shin H.-W. Takatsu H. Mukai H. Munekata E. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2780-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using more recent nomenclature (1van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Fukushima N.H. Brisch E. Keegan B.R. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2756-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), these are within the GTP-binding and neighboring middle domains (GTP-middle) and the C-terminal α-helical GED, respectively (Fig. 2A). Insert B is found between these domains (Fig. 2A) and is the site of variations in Drp1 sequence generated through alternative mRNA splicing (8Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Howng S.-L. Sy W.-D. Cheng T.-S. Lieu A.-S. Wang C. Tzou W.-S. Cho C.-L. Hong Y.-R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), using yeast two-hybrid tests we found that multiple different deletion constructs of Drp1 containing a single association domain (e.g. GTP-middle) interact robustly with deletion constructs containing the other association domain (e.g. GED) but much less or not at all with larger constructs containing both. For instance, the GTP-middle-containing fragment Drp1(1–489) interacts far more strongly with GED-containing fragments Drp1(502–736) and Drp1(637–736) than with full-length Drp1(1–736), which contains both GTP-Middle and GED domains (Fig. 2B). Also, Drp1(502–736) interacts weakly with full-length Drp1, although it interacts strongly with Drp1(1–489). Taken together, these and other results detailed in Fig. 2B indicate that the intramolecular (i.e. cis) interaction between GTP-middle and GED is favored over the intermolecular (i.e. trans) interaction in these assays. In addition to this robust intramolecular interaction, there is also evidence for intermolecular interactions of Drp1. In agreement with previous studies (26Fukushima N.H. Brisch E. Keegan B.R. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2756-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Shin H.-W. Takatsu H. Mukai H. Munekata E. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2780-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), full-length Drp1(1–736) exhibits a strong intermolecular self-interaction (Fig. 2B). Multiple different N-and C-terminal deletion constructs bind to full-length Drp1, although much more weakly than the full-length protein does to itself, suggesting that multiple domains may be involved in these intermolecular interactions. The C-terminal GED domain interacts with itself, albeit weakly, an interaction reminiscent of those reported for other members of the dynamin superfamily including dynamin, yeast Dnm1p, and MxA (2Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 24Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L.

We further assessed the interdomain, intramolecular interactions of Drp1 using cultured COS-7 cells transfected with combinations of full-length Drp1(1–736), Drp1(502–736), and Drp1(1–489) differentially tagged with N-terminal HA or Myc epitopes. We confirmed that full-length HA-Drp1(1–736) associates with full-length Myc-Drp1(1–736) by co-immunoprecipitation studies with anti-HA antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2C), in agreement with the yeast two-hybrid results. In contrast, Drp1(502–736) could not be co-immunoprecipitated with full-length Drp1(1–736), even though it did bind to Drp1(1–489) (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results and indicate a preference for intramolecular interaction of the two Drp1 association domains, GTP-middle and GED. Thus, although intermolecular associations may be more labile with fragments of the Drp1 protein, the intramolecular interactions are more robust. Drawing upon the results of yeast two-hybrid tests and co-immunoprecipitation studies presented in Fig. 2, the dimeric Drp1 inter- and intramolecular interactions are postulated to be highly reminiscent of those in dynamin dimers (lacking the C-terminal proline-rich domain) reported by Zhang and Hinshaw (23Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) using cryo-electron microscopy. We evaluated the effects of a GED mutation in Drp1 K679A that is at a position previously shown to be important for dynamin function (24Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and that is highly conserved in a number of dynamin-like GTPases (Fig. 3A). A striking effect of the K679A mutation is that it strongly inhibits the interaction of the GED-containing Drp1(502–736) and Drp1(637–736) fragments with Drp1(1–489), the latter of which harbors the GTP-middle domain, in yeast two-hybrid tests (Fig. 3B). At the same time, it does not appear to alter the intermolecular associations between full-length Drp1(1–736) constructs or the weaker interactions between isolated GED domains (Fig. 3B). Thus, the K679A mutation may result in a more “open” state of Drp1 with altered intramolecular associations (Fig. 3C), but that still does not appear to alter the intermolecular associations in this system. To evaluate further the oligomerization of Drp1 we used FPLC gel exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking (Figs. 4 and 5). In cells overexpressing Myc-Drp1(1–736) and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, Myc-Drp1 elutes at a molecular weight of ∼395,000 following FPLC gel exclusion chromatography. This elution profile is not significantly affected by a previously characterized GTP-binding and GTPase-deficient mutation (K38A) nor by the K679A GED mutation (Fig. 4, B and C). Similarly, chemical cross-linking with the homo-bifunctional, amino-reactive cross-linker BS3 shows that each of these variants likely forms oligomers with prominent cross-linked products at ∼280 kDa (Fig. 5A), probably representing homo-tetramers as described previously for wild-type Drp1 using the cross-linker dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate) (31Shin H.-W. Takatsu H. Mukai H. Munekata E. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2780-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This result indicates that these mutations do not alter the oligomerization of Drp1. For each variant, larger products are also seen at ∼350 and ∼365 kDa, likely representing higher order structures. At the same time, the native Myc-Drp1(502–736) protein, containing insert B and GED domains, has a single elution peak at ∼204,000 kDa (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that it is able to self-associate. Also, the Myc-Drp1(502–736) fragment cross-links prominently as a dimer but also shows higher order cross-links (Fig. 5B). To investigate the possibility that endogenous Drp1 in the Myc-Drp1(502–736) overexpressing COS-7 cells may be binding Myc-Drp1(502–736) and contributing to these larger structures, we subjected cells co-transfected with Myc-Drp1(502–736) and full-length HA-Drp1(1–736) to chemical cross-linking with BS3. The cross-linked products for full-length HA-Drp1 highly resemble those shown in Fig. 5A for full-length Myc-Drp1 alone. Similarly, the cross-linked products for Myc-Drp1(502–736) in the co-transfected cells are essentially the same as those observed when Myc-Drp1"

The present study examined the impact of PEMF on angiogenesis, a process critical for successful healing of various tissues. PEMF increased the degree of endothelial cell tubulization (sevenfold) and proliferation (threefold) in vitro. Media from PEMF cultures had a similar stimulatory effect, but heat denaturation ablated this activity. In addition, conditioned media was able to induce proliferative and chemotactic changes in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fibroblasts, but had no effect on osteoblasts. Angiogenic protein screening demonstrated a fivefold increase in fibroblast growth factor beta-2 (FGF-2), as well as smaller increases in other angiogenic growth factors (angiopoietin-2, thrombopoietin, and epidermal growth factor). Northern blot analysis demonstrated an increase in FGF-2 transcription, and FGF-2 neutralizing antibody inhibited the effects of PEMF. In vivo, PEMF exposure increased angiogenesis more than twofold. We conclude that PEMF augments angiogenesis primarily by stimulating endothelial release of FGF-2, inducing paracrine and autocrine changes in the surrounding tissue. These findings suggest a potential role for PEMF in therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1997973656,"PolyADP-ribose-polymerase 1 is activated in neurons that mediate several forms of long-term memory in Aplysia . Because polyADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins is a response to DNA damage in virtually all eukaryotic cells, it is surprising that activation of the polymerase occurs during learning and is required for long-term memory. We suggest that fast and transient decondensation of chromatin structure by polyADP-ribosylation enables the transcription needed to form long-term memory without strand breaks in DNA."

In the particle mass regime from 10(-14) to 10(-7) kilograms, the spacecraft encountered regions of intense swarms of particles, together with bursts of activity corresponding to clouds of particles only a few hundred meters across. This fine-scale structure can be explained by particle fragmentation. We estimate that 2800 +/- 500 particles of diameter 15 micrometers or larger impacted the aerogel collectors, the largest being approximately 6 x 10(-7) kilograms, which dominates the total collected mass."

https://openalex.org/W2060699734,"3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2) is a steroid-metabolizing enzyme that is essential for adrenal production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Thus, HSD3B2 is expressed at high levels in the glomerulosa and fasciculata, where these steroids are produced. In contrast, the production of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate in the adrenal reticularis is inversely correlated with the expression of HSD3B2. The reasons for the zonal expression of HSD3B2 are not known but represent an important aspect in the biochemical zonation of the adrenal. Using microarray, real time reverse transcriptase-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and HSD3B2 promoter analysis, we demonstrate that the NGFIB family of nuclear hormone receptors plays a critical part in the regulation of HSD3B2 transcription and may play an important role in the functional zonation of the adrenal gland. Microarray analysis of cortisol- versus DHEA sulfate-producing adrenal tissue demonstrated that NGIFB paralleled expression of HSD3B2 with expression much higher in cortisol-producing adrenal tissue; this observation was also demonstrated using real time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. In addition, immunohistochemistry confirmed that within adult and fetal adrenal gland NGFIB expression paralleled expression of HSD3B2. Transient transfections into H295R adrenal cells demonstrated that NGFIB family members enhanced HSD3B2 reporter activity but had no effect on a 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17) promoter construct. Deletion and mutational analyses of the 5′-flanking region of the HSD3B2 gene identified a consensus NGFIB response element that bound NGFIB in mobility shift assays. Infection of cultured human adrenal cells with adenovirus-containing NGFIB increased cortisol production by 8-fold and increased expression of HSD3B2 mRNA 26-fold over that observed in mock-infected cells. In primary cultures of adrenal cells, ACTH, an activator of HSD3B2, rapidly induced expression of NGFIB. These results suggest that NGFIB plays a crucial role in adrenal zonation by regulating HSD3B2 gene transcription. 3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2) is a steroid-metabolizing enzyme that is essential for adrenal production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Thus, HSD3B2 is expressed at high levels in the glomerulosa and fasciculata, where these steroids are produced. In contrast, the production of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate in the adrenal reticularis is inversely correlated with the expression of HSD3B2. The reasons for the zonal expression of HSD3B2 are not known but represent an important aspect in the biochemical zonation of the adrenal. Using microarray, real time reverse transcriptase-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and HSD3B2 promoter analysis, we demonstrate that the NGFIB family of nuclear hormone receptors plays a critical part in the regulation of HSD3B2 transcription and may play an important role in the functional zonation of the adrenal gland.

These results suggest that NGFIB plays a crucial role in adrenal zonation by regulating HSD3B2 gene transcription. The enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2) 1The abbreviations used are: HSD3B2, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; NBRE, NGFIB response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; RIA, radioimmunoassay. is essential for the adrenal biosynthesis of miner-alocorticoids (aldosterone) and glucocorticoids (cortisol), but its expression is inversely associated with that of the adrenal androgens (DHEA) (1Mason J.I. Ushijima K. Doody K.M. Nagai K. Naville D. Head J.R. Milewich L. Rainey W.E. Ralph M.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). HSD3B2 catalyzes the oxidation and isomerization of 3β-hydroxy-5-ene (Δ5) steroids into 3-keto-4-ene (Δ4) steroids, thereby permitting the adrenal gland to synthesize progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone from their pregnenolone and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone precursors (2Simard J. de Launoit Y. Labrie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14842-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSD3B2 can compete with CYP17 for the metabolism of pregnenolone and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and thus influence the production of aldosterone versus cortisol or DHEA (3Conley A.J. Bird I.M. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). High HSD3B2 expression combined with low CYP17 activity will favor aldosterone synthesis and oppose cortisol and adrenal androgen synthesis. Conversely, low HSD3B2 expression coupled with high CYP17 activity will favor adrenal androgen production. The human adrenal produces DHEA at high levels within the fetal adrenal and in the zona reticularis of the adult adrenal. Both of these tissues express low levels of HSD3B2 protein and mRNA (4Wang W.

The lack of HSD3B2 expression in the fetal zone is directly correlated with the ability of that zone to secrete large amounts of the adrenal androgens DHEA and DHEA sulfate. The same correlation between relatively low levels of HSD3B2 and high levels of DHEA production is also present in the adult adrenal reticularis. Thus, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that regulate HSD3B2 expression would help in efforts to understand adrenal physiology. The present study was undertaken to examine the role of the NGFIB family of orphan nuclear receptors (nerve growth factor-induced clone B or NR4 subgroup) in the regulation of HSD3B2. The NGFIB family, which includes NGFIB (NR4A1), NURR1 (Nur-related factor 1 or NR4A2), and NOR1 (neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 or NR4A3) (12Committee Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 13Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), appears to play an important role in the coordinated regulation of the hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal axis (14Murphy E.P. Conneely O.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Wilson T.E. Mouw A.R. Weaver C.A. Milbrandt J. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell.

White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that adrenal expression of NGFIB (NR4A1) paralleled expression of HSD3B2. NGFIB also directly increased HSD3B2 gene transcription as shown using promoter constructs. Finally, NGFIB-containing adenovirus infection of adrenal cells stimulated endogenous HSD3B2 expression and cortisol production. The inverse correlation between adrenal androgen production and the expression of NGFIB and HSD3B2 appears to be a unifying link for the production of DHEA by the fetal adrenal and adult adrenal reticularis. Cell Culture—NCI-H295R (H295R) human adrenocortical tumor cells were maintained as previously described (18Bassett M.H. Zhang Y. Clyne C. White P.C. Rainey W.E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 28: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Jimenez P. Saner K. Mayhew B. Rainey W.E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4285-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Primary human adrenal cell cultures were prepared from normal adrenal gland that was decapsulated, minced into small pieces, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 0.1% collagen-ase. Digestion and mechanical dispersion were carried out for 1 h and 30 min at 37 °C with a final digestion of the dispersed cells in medium containing 0.01% DNase I. Following isolation, cells were either frozen or subcultured onto 60-mm culture dishes for subsequent steroid assay or real time RT-PCR. Fetal adrenal cells were isolated essentially as described (20Stankovic A.K. Dion L.D. Parker Jr., C.R. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1994; 99: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, 1% ITS (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), 10% cosmic calf serum, and antibiotics. Adrenal Tissues—For cell culture experiments, human adrenal glands were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (Philadelphia, PA). Midgestation human fetal adrenal tissues were obtained from Advanced Bioscience Resources in accordance with the Donors Anatomical Gift Act of the State of Texas; protocols were approved by the Human Research Review Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. For steroidogenic studies, glands were prepared as described above. Prior to real time analysis, total RNA was extracted from tissue, using the method of Chirgwin (21Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16657) Google Scholar), followed by DNase I treatment. For immunohistochemistry, tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Institutional Review Boards of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and at Tohoku University School of Medicine approved the use of human tissue. Steroid Analysis—Prior to treatments, primary adrenal cells were maintained overnight in low serum medium while fetal zone cells were kept in complete medium. Cells were incubated for 1, 6, or 24 h either under basal conditions, with ACTH (10 nm) or with ACTH plus the HSD3B2 inhibitor, trilostane (10 μm). The steroid content of experimental medium was determined using radioimmunoassay kits (Diagnostic System Laboratories, Webster, TX). Results of steroid assays were normalized to the cellular protein content in each well and expressed as pmol/mg cell protein. Where indicated, relative steroid levels were expressed as -fold over basal. Microarray Analysis—Pools of RNA from adult adrenal (n = 3) and fetal zone (n = 3) were hybridized to an Affymetrix human HG-U133A and B oligonucleotide two-microarray set containing more than 44,000 probe sets representing over 33,000 human genes. The arrays were scanned at high resolution using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 located at the University of Texas Southwestern Microarray Core Facility. Results were analyzed using GeneSpring version 6.1 software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) to identify genotypic differences between adult adrenal cortex and fetal zone cells. Hierarchical clustering algorithms were used to identify genes that exhibited similar expression patterns to HSD3B2 in order to identify candidate regulatory genes. RNA Extraction and Real Time RT-PCR—RNA extraction and real time RT-PCR were carried out as previously described (17Bassett M.H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with modifications. Primers and probes for real time RT-PCR were designed using the Primer Express computer program (Applied Biosystems) (Table I). HSD3B2 mRNA and 18 S rRNA were quantified using a TaqMan ribosomal RNA reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) and 10 μl of primer/probe mix. For HSD3B2, the final concentrations of primer and probe used were 0.4 and 0.2 μm, respectively. For 18 S, the final concentrations of primer and probe were 0.05 and 0.1 μm, respectively. Standard curve cDNA plasmids for NGFIB, NURR1, NOR1, and HSD3B2 were used to quantify transcript levels. As an internal standard, each individual sample was normalized to its 18 S ribosomal RNA content, and mRNA levels were expressed as amol/μg 18 S rRNA. Alternatively, in some experiments, relative gene expression was calculated by the ΔΔCt method. Briefly, the resultant mRNA was normalized to a calibrator; in each case, the calibrator chosen was the basal sample. Final results were expressed as n-fold difference in gene expression relative to 18 S rRNA and calibrator as follows: n-fold = 2–(ΔCt sample – ΔCt calibrator), where ΔCt values of the sample and calibrator were determined by subtracting the average Ct value of the transcript under investigation from the average Ct value of the 18 S rRNA gene for each sample.Table ISequences of primer and probe oligonucleotides used for real time RT-PCRGenePrimer (sense)Primer (antisense)ProbeHSD3B25′-GCGGCTAATGGGTGGAATCTA-3′5′-CATTGTTGTTCAGGGCCTCAT-3′5′-TGATACCTTGTACACTTGTGCGTTAAGACCCA-3′NR4A1 (NGFIB)5′-ATACACCCGTGACCTCAACCA-3′5′-TTCTGCACTGTGCGCTTGAA-3′NR4A2 (NURR1)5′-TTCGCCCCCGGTGAGT-3′5′-ATAGTCAGGGTTCGCCTGGAA-3′NR4A3 (NOR1)5′-TGCATGATGAATGCCCTTGT-3′5′-CCTGGTCAGTGGGACAGTATCTG-3′TR3 (NGFIB) (canine)5′-ACGCACCGGTGCCTTCGGCCA-3′5′-TTCTGTACTGTGCGCTTGAA-3′ Open table in a new tab Preparation of Reporter Constructs and Expression Vectors—The HSD3B2 (–963 bp) and CYP17 (–1124 bp) constructs used in this study were cloned into the promoterless pGL3Basic reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). HSD3B2 deletion constructs were prepared using available restriction sites (XhoI, p3B–963; NheI, p3B–585; BglII, p3B–345; HindIII, p3B–52) or by introduction of a KpnI site at the appropriate location by PCR (p3B–210, p3B–166, and p3B–101). For preparation of the NGFIB response element (NBRE)-1 mutant construct, the sequence 5′-AAAGGTCA-3′ (–131/–124) was changed to 5′-AgAatTCA-3′, which included an EcoRI site. Coding sequences for human steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), rat NGFIB, mouse NURR1, and rat NOR1 were subcloned into the pRC/RSV expression plasmid (Invitrogen). Transfection Assays—Transfection assays were carried out as previously described except that Transfast (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (18Bassett M.H. Zhang Y. Clyne C. White P.C. Rainey W.E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 28: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—H295R nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSA was carried out as described with certain modifications (18Bassett M.H. Zhang Y. Clyne C. White P.C. Rainey W.E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 28: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Binding was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.50g× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Rat NGFIB, mouse NURR1, and human SF-1 were prepared using an in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). The probe for EMSA, which was designed to include the NBRE-1 site in HSD3B2 (underlined), was as follows: 5′-AACCTAAAGGTCACTAT-3′. The probe for EMSA was double-stranded. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical analysis was performed employing the streptavidin-biotin amplification method as previously described (17Bassett M.H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for NGFIB (diluted 1:200) was purchased from Geneka Biotechnology Inc. (catalog no. 1600045). The polyclonal antibody for HSD3B2 (diluted 1:2,000) was described in detail (22Sasano H. Mason J.I. Sasano N. Nagura H. Endocr. Pathol. 1990; 1: 739-747Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For negative controls, normal rabbit or mouse IgG was used instead of the primary antibodies, and no specific immunoreactivity was detected in these sections. Histological identification of three zones of the human fetal adrenal was based on published criteria (23Lack E.E. Kozakewich H.P.W. Lack E.E. Pathology of the Adrenal Glands. Churchill Livingstone, New York1990: 1-74Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated Expression of NGFIB—A replication-defective human adenovirus vector, containing the coding region of canine NGFIB (also called TR3), was prepared as previously described (24Arkenbout E.K. de Waard V. van Bragt M. van Achterberg T.A.E.

Subconfluent fetal zone cells were infected at 3 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml in complete medium for 3 h. Infected cells were either treated with ACTH (10 nm) or simply harvested for RNA in order to measure HSD3B2 levels by real time RT-PCR. Additionally, after infection, steroid hormone levels in the cell culture medium were measured by RIA. Controls for this type of experiment included infections with a mock adenovirus construct, which lacked the coding region of NGFIB. Detection of incorporated NGFIB adenovirus was accomplished by monitoring the production of canine NGFIB by real time RT-PCR. Inhibition of HSD3B2 Enzyme Activity Promotes Adrenal Androgen Biosynthesis—In order to further characterize the role of HSD3B2 in adrenal androgen production, primary cultures of human adrenal cells were treated with ACTH in the presence and absence of trilostane an inhibitor of HSD3B2 enzyme activity. Following treatment, cortisol or DHEA(S) was measured in the medium by RIA and normalized to the amount of cell protein present. As seen in Fig. 1A, ACTH stimulated cortisol production (4.8-fold over basal) after 24 h of incubation, whereas inhibition of HSD3B2 activity completely blocked this stimulation. In contrast, when HSD3B2 activity was blocked by trilostane, ACTH-stimulated DHEA(S) production rose dramatically to 120-fold over basal levels after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 1B). ACTH alone stimulated a 6-fold increase in DHEA(S) synthesis following 24 h of incubation. The Expression Profile of the NGFIB Family of Transcription Factors Parallels That of HSD3B2—Despite the crucial role of HSD3B2 in adrenal steroidogenesis, the mechanisms regulating transcription of the HSD3B2 gene remain poorly defined. In order to identify potential transcription factors that might regulate HSD3B2 expression, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression patterns across fetal zone (a DHEAS-producing tissue) and adult (a cortisol-producing tissue) adrenal microarrays in order to identify genes with similar expression profiles to HSD3B2 (Fig 2A). Transcription factors that paralleled expression of HSD3B2 included the orphan nuclear receptors NGFIB, NURR1, and NOR; all four genes were inversely correlated with the ability of the tissues to produce DHEA. NGFIB exhibited 21.7-fold greater expression in adult than in fetal adrenal gland. Likewise, expression of NURR1 and NOR1 was greater in the adult adrenal (12- and 2.9-fold, respectively). NGFIB, along with NURR1 and NOR1, is a member of the NGFIB family of transcription factors and is prominently expressed in brain but present in most peripheral tissues including the adrenal (26Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bandoh S. Tsukada T. Maruyama K. Ohkura N. Yamaguchi K. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 9: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In order to begin an investigation into a potential role for NGFIB, NURR1, and/or NOR1 in the regulation of HSD3B2 transcription and to confirm our microarray results, we quantified mRNA expression of HSD3B2 along with each NGFIB family member in human adult and fetal adrenal glands by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). All values are expressed as amol of HSD3B2 or transcription factor/μg of 18 S RNA. HSD3B2 expression was high in adult (51.5 ± 14 amol/μg) but low in fetal (0.20 ± 0.06 amol/μg) adrenal. Expression of the transcription factor NGFIB paralleled expression of HSD3B2 with high levels in adult adrenal (10.8 ± 4 amol/μg) and low levels in fetal adrenal (0.24 ± 0.08 amol/μg). Comparatively low levels of NURR1 and NOR1 mRNA were detected in adult adrenal (0.69 ± 0.32 and 0.67 ± 0.34 amol/μg, respectively). Likewise, very low levels of NURR1 and NOR1 expression were observed in fetal tissue (0.004 ± 0.002 and 0.13 ± 0.066 amol/μg, respectively). Localization of NGFIB in the Fetal Adrenal Gland—HSD3B2 is present in the nuclei of the definitive and transitional zones of late gestation fetal adrenal gland, a time when cortisol is being produced at high levels, but is essentially absent from the fetal zone at this time (9Narasaka T. Suzuki T. Moriya T. Sasano H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 174: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the presence of HSD3B2 was correlated with the expression profile of NGFIB, we examined expression of both proteins in fetal adrenal sections using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3). The expression patterns of HSD3B2 and NGFIB were identical with marked immunoreactivity in the nuclei of the cells of the definitive and transitional zones but with weak or no staining in the cells of the fetal zone. A similar pattern of expression has been observed in adult adrenal with little or no HSD3B2 or NGFIB produced in the zona reticularis but with both proteins detected in the zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata (11Suzuki T. Sasano H. Takeyama J. Kaneko C. Freije W.A. Carr B.R. Rainey W.E. Clin. Endocrinol. 2000; 53: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Lu L. Suzuki T. Yoshikawa Y. Murakami O. Miki Y. Moriya T. Bassett M.H. Rainey W.E. Hayashi Y. Sasano H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that HSD3B2 and NGFIB are both expressed at low or undetectable levels in DHEA-secreting cells of the fetal zone and adult reticularis supports the hypothesis that NGFIB plays a role in HSD3B2 gene transcription. Comparing the Effects of the NGFIB Family of Orphan Receptors and SF-1 on the Transcriptional Activity of HSD3B2 and CYP17—The relative amounts of two steroidogenic enzymes, HSD3B2 and CYP17, have a direct effect on the relative level of mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, and adrenal androgen produced by the adrenal cortex. When the ratio of HSD3B2 to CYP17 is high, production of aldosterone can occur, whereas cortisol and androgen production are decreased. Conversely, a high CYP17 to HSD3B2 ratio favors androgen synthesis and inhibits aldosterone and cortisol production. SF-1 is an important regulator of CYP17 gene transcription and may regulate HSD3B2 as well (29Leers-Sucheta S. Morohashi K. Mason J.I. Melner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7960-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Hanley N.A. Rainey W.E. Wilson D.I. Ball S.G. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In order to compare the effects of the NGFIB family of orphan receptors, and also SF-1, in the transcriptional regulation of HSD3B2 and CYP17, we co-transfected H295R cells with HSD3B2 (p3B–963) or CYP17 (pC17–1124) promoter constructs along with expression plasmids containing the coding regions of NGFIB, NURR1, NOR1, or SF-1 (Fig. 4). The HSD3B2 promoter was activated by NGFIB (4-fold), NURR1 (5.1-fold), and NOR1 (3.2-fold). However, no significant difference over basal levels was observed when cells were co-transfected with SF-1. As expected, the CYP17 promoter was activated by SF-1 (15.4-fold). Conversely, the CYP17 reporter was not activated by NGFIB, NURR1, or NOR1, indicating that the NGFIB family members play no role in the regulation of the CYP17 gene. Thus, these branch-point enzymes in adrenal steroidogenesis, namely HSD3B2 and CYP17, are differentially regulated by two separate classes of transcription factors, the NGFIB family and SF-1, respectively. Identification of a Single NBRE by Deletion and Mutation Analysis—The NGFIB family of orphan nuclear receptors are rapidly induced early response genes that regulate gene transcription by binding to a consensus sequence (AAAGGTCA) called an NBRE (31Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 32Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Lau L.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In order to identify potential NBREs within the HSD3B2 gene promoter, a series of deletion constructs containing progressively shorter fragments of HSD3B2 5′-flanking DNA (p3B–963, p3B–585, p3B–345, p3B–210, p3B–166, p3B–101, and p3B–52) were prepared. These constructs were transiently transfected into H295R cells along with empty pRc/RSV expression plasmid (basal) or pRc/RSV expression plasmid containing the coding sequence of NGFIB. Fig. 5A illustrates the activity of all eight HSD3B2 reporter constructs under basal conditions or after co-transfection with NGFIB. NGFIB-stimulated reporter activity of the two constructs containing 5′-flanking sequences from –963 and –585 increased by 3.7- and 4.4-fold, respectively, above basal levels. Between –585 and –166 (constructs numbered –345, –210, and –166), basal levels of each transcript increased over that seen with the –963 construct, and NGFIB-stimulated HSD3B2 activity of these constructs ranged from 2.0-, 2.5-, and 2.1-fold above basal levels, respectively. Further deletion to –101 decreased NGFIB-stimulated HSD3B2 reporter activity to levels similar to those observed with the p3B-52 and the pGL3Basic vector, indicating the presence of at least one NGFIB-regulated cis-element between bases –166 and –52. Sequence analysis of the HSD3B2 gene promoter revealed the presence of a consensus NBRE at –131/–124 (Fig. 5B), herein named NBRE-1. In order to confirm the role of the putative NBRE-1 cis-element, it was mutated in the context of the full-length (p3B–963) HSD3B2 gene promoter. As shown in Fig. 5C, mutation of the NBRE-1 cis-element reduced NGFIB-stimulated HSD3B2 activity to the level observed with the p3B–52 reporter construct. Specific Binding of NGFIB, NURR1, and SF-1 to the NBRE-1 (–131/–124) cis-Element—In order to determine whether NGFIB, NURR1, and/or SF-1 interacted directly with the NBRE-1 (–131/–124) cis-element located within the HSD3B2 gene promoter, 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing this region were prepared and used in an EMSA. As seen in Fig. 6, the NBRE-1 probe bound in vitro prepared NGFI, NURR1, and SF-1 protein but did not bind in vitro prepared mock protein (protein prepared with empty pcDNA3.1 zeo expression vector). Additionally, the NBRE-1 element formed two specific protein-DNA complexes when incubated with two different H295R adrenal cell nuclear extract preparations (lanes 6 and 8). The complex designated C1 comigrated with the complex formed by in vitro translated NGFIB or NURR1, whereas C2 comigrated with the complex formed by SF-1. Formation of C1 and C2 were specifically inhibited by an excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide (lanes 7 and 9), indicating that the formation of both complexes was due to specific binding. ACTH Rapidly Induces Expression of NGFIB in Primary Cultures of Human Adrenal Cells—ACTH is a major regulator of HSD3B2 expression both in vivo and in vitro (7Doody K.M. Carr B.R. Rainey W.E. Byrd W.

https://openalex.org/W2171550165,"Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is a complex biological process that is orchestrated by several growth factors and components of the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin (FN) and its receptor the integrin alpha5beta1. Angiogenesis is a critical part of inflammation and wound repair, but the mechanism by which vascular proliferation and migration is regulated by inflammatory cells is not completely understood. We have previously shown that human neutrophil peptides (HNPs), also known as alpha-defensins, which are secreted in high concentrations when neutrophils are activated, bind specifically to FN in the extracellular matrix and inhibit plasminogen activation. Therefore, we asked whether HNPs act as a link between inflammation and angiogenesis. Alpha5beta1-mediated endothelial cell adhesion and migration to FN, both under control conditions and under stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were inhibited specifically and in a dose-dependent manner by HNPs, whereas endothelial cell adhesion and migration to other components of the extracellular matrix, such as vitronectin, collagen, or fibrinogen/fibrin were not. Consistent with this finding, HNPs bound to and promoted the binding of fibronectin to alpha5beta1 integrin in arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-independent manner. HNPs also completely inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation and induced apoptosis of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, HNPs inhibited capillary tube formation in three-dimensional fibrin-matrices as well as neovascularization in vivo in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay. Taken together, these data indicate that HNPs can regulate angiogenesis by affecting endothelial cell adhesion and migration in an FN-dependent manner as well as endothelial cell proliferation. These findings provide new insight into the role of inflammatory cells in angiogenesis and might provide a platform for developing a novel class of anti-angiogenesis drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1969604044,"A major point of regulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) function is through control of activation of the latent TGF-β complex, which consists of the latency associated peptide (LAP) secreted in non-covalent association with mature TGF-β. Activation involves proteolysis, dissociation, or altered binding of LAP. However, the mechanism by which LAP confers latency to TGF-β is poorly understood. Previously, we identified a conserved sequence near the N terminus of LAP as a site of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) binding to the latent complex. Now we show that expression of the TGF-β1-latent complex deleted in the TSP1 binding site (54LSKL) of LAP (ΔLSKL LAP) results in secretion of LAP, but not of mature TGF-β. ΔLSKL LAP also fails to bind soluble or immobilized TGF-β1. Consistent with an inability to bind the mature domain, ΔLSKL LAP is unable to confer latency to TGF-β, suggesting that the LSKL sequence is important, not only for TSP1 binding and activation, but also for binding to the mature domain. We identified the sequence 94RKPK in the receptor-binding region of mature TGF-β1 as the binding site for LAP. Peptides of the RKPK sequence bind LAP and inhibit LAP/TGF-β association. RKPK peptides also activate latent TGF-β, presumably by disrupting LAP-mature TGF-β interactions. These studies provide a molecular basis for both latency and activation by TSP1 through the LSKL sequence of LAP binding to the RKPK sequence of mature TGF-β.

Tight regulation of appropriate levels of TGF-β activity is critical for homeostasis as excessive TGF-β activity is a primary cause of fibrotic disease and TGF-β deficiencies are implicated in neoplasia and inflammation (4Dumont N. Arteaga C.L. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Branton M.H. Kopp J.B. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The major point of control of TGF-β activity is at the level of conversion of the latent precursor to the biologically active growth factor, a process termed activation (6Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). TGF-β is secreted as part of a latent complex consisting of an N-terminal latency-associated peptide (LAP) and the mature domain. LAP and TGF-β are the products of a single gene, which (after post-translational modifications and cleavage by furin convertase) remains non-covalently associated, forming the small latent complex (SLC) (7Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The SLC is secreted by cells as an inactive complex, and in some cases it is disulfide-bonded to the latent TGF-β-binding protein to form the large latent complex. LAP association with the mature domain is critical for latency, and agents that activate the latent complex disrupt the association of LAP with the mature domain either by proteolysis or denaturing the LAP or by altering the folding of LAP (7Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). It is known that LAP association is critical for expression of the mature domain as mutations that disrupt LAP-mature domain binding prevent secretion of the mature domain (8Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which LAP confers latency to mature TGF-β is largely unknown. Previously, we showed that thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) can activate latent TGF-β both in vitro and in vivo through specific molecular interactions (9Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

The KRFK sequence in the type 1 repeats of TSP1 binds to a conserved sequence (54LSKL) near the N terminus of LAP. Binding of TSP1 to LAP renders the LAP unable to confer latency (11Ribeiro S.M.

This LSKL sequence (amino acids 54-57) lies within a region of the LAP (amino acids 50-85) previously shown to be necessary for latency (8Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the LSKL sequence of LAP in latency and TGF-β activation, we examined the effect of LSKL mutations on the secretion of the SLC, LAP/TGF-β association, and the ability of LAP to confer latency to mature TGF-β. We now report that the LSKL sequence mediates LAP binding to the mature domain, and we have identified a sequence in the mature domain that binds the LAP through LSKL. These studies establish a molecular basis for both LAP induction of latency and TSP1-mediated activation. Cell Culture—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described (11Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were obtained from the ATCC (CRL-1650). TGF-β1 (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts were a generous gift of Dr. John Munger, New York University. Mink lung epithelial cells transfected with the TGF-β response element of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene promoter fused to firefly luciferase reporter gene were a generous gift from Dr. Daniel Rifkin, New York University (12Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and were cultured in the above medium, supplemented with 200 μg/ml G-418 (Invitrogen). Peptides—Peptides purified (>95% purity) and analyzed by mass spectrometry were purchased from AnaSpec, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Production of the FLAG-TGF-β Latent Complex—Full-length cDNA for human TGF-β1 latent complex (TGF-β and LAP) was a gift from Dr. Lalage Wakefield, National Institutes of Health (13Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Broz S. Jackson M. Levinson A.D. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using techniques similar to those reported by Wolfraim et al. (14Wolfraim L.A. Alkemade G.M. Alex B. Sharpe S. Parks W.T. Letterio J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 266: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we introduced a FLAG epitope at the N terminus of the mature cytokine after a 5-amino acid spacer, which separated it from the LAP cleavage site. The purified PCR product was then inserted according to manufacturer's instructions into the mammalian expression vector pEF6/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Resulting plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing at a DNA sequencing core facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Placement of the FLAG epitope at this site has been shown not to affect expression and function of active TGF-β (14Wolfraim L.A. Alkemade G.M. Alex B. Sharpe S. Parks W.T. Letterio J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 266: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using similar protocols, we expressed the construct in COS-1 cells and assayed for proper processing and secretion by immunoblot. In addition, the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter luciferase (PAIL) assay was used to verify latency and activation by heat, acid, and TSP1. Production of LAP-FLAG—Using the human TGF-β latent complex as a template, primers were designed to introduce a FLAG epitope/termination codon following the LAP coding sequence. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) as described above and sequenced for verification. LAP-FLAG protein expression in transfected COS-1 cells was confirmed by Western blot, and the ability to confer latency to active TGF-β was verified by the PAIL assay. Site-directed Mutagenesis and DNA Purification—Using FLAG-TGF-β and LAP-FLAG vectors as templates, primers were designed to produce site-specific mutations or deletions using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All mutant clones were verified by sequencing. Before transfection, all plasmids were produced, purified free of endotoxin, and concentrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Transfection, Cell Lysate, and Conditioned Medium Collection—Upon reaching 70% confluence in 6-well plates, COS-1 cells were washed in serum-free medium and transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) per the manufacturer's instructions in a final volume of 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with ITS supplement (Sigma). After 48 h, the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged free of cell debris, and stored for analyses. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged. The resultant cell lysate supernatant was stored at -80 °C until analysis. TGF-β1 (-/-) cells, 70% confluent on 6-well plates, were transfected overnight with 1 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE/Plus and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Wells were then washed with serum-free medium followed by the addition of 1 ml/well serum-free medium containing ITS. After 48 h, medium was collected, centrifuged free of cell debris, and stored. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes, grown to 70% confluence, and washed with serum-free medium. A final volume of 5 ml of serum-free medium was placed on the cells for 48 h, collected, centrifuged free of cell debris, and stored for analysis. Immunoblotting—Conditioned medium was added to 6× Laemmli sample buffer, and 50 μl final volume was separated by SDS-PAGE (4-20% gradient) under non-reducing conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by Bradford assay to determine total protein for loading of equal amounts of protein. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody, 12.5 μg of mouse anti-TGF-β (R&D Systems), or 2 μg of goat anti-human LAP (R&D Systems) overnight in 10 ml of TBST, 2.5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C. Membranes were washed (four 10-min washes in TBST) and then incubated for 45 min with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1/10,000 in 10 ml TBST, 2.5% nonfat dry milk. For anti-FLAG blots, the membrane was blocked overnight, washed, and incubated with 10 μg of anti-FLAG-M2-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in 10 ml of TBST for 45 min. Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were stripped between developments with Re-blot Plus (Chemicon). Densitometry was performed using the one-dimensional gel analysis function of NIH ImageJ. PAIL Assay for TGF-β Activity—TGF-β activity in conditioned medium was determined by an established bioassay using mink lung epithelial cells expressing the TGF-β response element of the PAI-1 promoter fused to luciferase as a reporter (12Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) was used to establish the standard curve. Total TGF-β levels were assayed in conditioned medium that had been heat-activated at 100 °C for 3 min and then diluted 1/5 in serum-free medium. Levels of active TGF-β were determined in medium diluted 1/5 that received no heat treatment. Where indicated, peptides were preincubated with medium for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were assayed in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation—To detect soluble protein-protein interactions, 500 μl of COS-1 conditioned medium expressing LAP-FLAG constructs was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 20 μl (final volume) of prewashed Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Resin was centrifuged and washed in Tris-buffered saline three times. The washed resin was incubated with 20 μl of 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.5, to release bound LAP-FLAG with associated TGF-β. The releasate was combined with 2.2 μl of 10× Tris-buffered saline and 6× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. In some experiments, peptides were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to addition of the affinity gel. Equal pull-down of LAP-FLAG was verified by FLAG immunoblot/densitometry. Negative controls included resin alone and resin incubated with empty vector conditioned medium (containing endogenous TGF-β). Phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 ng of recombinant TGF-β was used as a positive control. Modified Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—To detect immobilized protein-protein interactions, we developed a novel modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for these studies. Briefly, either biotin-tagged peptides (10 μg/ml) or biotinylated TGF-β (0.2 μg/ml) was incubated on preblocked neutravidin-coated plates overnight at 4 °C (Pierce). After three washes with TBST, conditioned medium containing LAP-FLAG constructs was added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with TBST, wells were incubated in 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 peroxidase conjugate in TBST. After five washes in TBST, wells were incubated for 30 min in OPD substrate (Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 1 n HCl, and absorbance was determined by a spectrophotometric plate reader (Bio-Tek). After background subtraction, the mean absorbance at 450 nm of triplicate wells was reported. In some experiments, conditioned medium was incubated with peptides for 45 min at 4 °C prior to addition to the wells. Biotin-tagged peptides were analyzed for equal binding to the plate by detection with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Samples were assayed in triplicate, and controls included wells with each reagent alone, wells with non-biotin-tagged peptides or non-biotinylated TGF-β and finally, to control for any effects of the FLAG epitope, wells with 5 μm FLAG peptide (Sigma) incubated with biotin-immobilized peptides or TGF-β were also included. Statistics—Significance was determined using paired, 2-tailed Student's t test. All error bars shown are mean ± standard deviation. Mutation of the LSKL Sequence of LAP Results in Impaired Secretion of Mature TGF-β—To ensure proper folding and post-translational processing, the recombinant SLC was expressed using mammalian expression systems. To distinguish the engineered latent complex from the endogenous latent complex secreted by COS-1 cells, the SLC was expressed with a FLAG tag inserted at the N terminus of the mature domain according to previously published approaches (14Wolfraim L.A. Alkemade G.M. Alex B. Sharpe S. Parks W.T. Letterio J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 266: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations of the LSKL (amino acids 54-57) site of LAP were introduced into the vector containing the expression sequence for FLAG-TGF-β latent complex (FLAG-TGF-β). These mutations (Fig. 1A) include a complete deletion of the LSKL sequence (ΔLSKL) and an alanine substitution for lysine at amino acid 56 (LSA56L). The latter substitution was used because peptides of the LSAL sequence do not inhibit TSP1-mediated TGF-β activation as do LSKL peptides (11Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These tagged constructs and the unmodified wild type latent TGF-β were expressed in COS-1 cells. Conditioned medium and cell lysates were analyzed for expression and secretion of the SLC by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). The unmodified TGF-β and the FLAG-TGF-β were both expressed and secreted. The resulting FLAG-TGF-β latent complex (Fig. 1A) was secreted as a latent molecule but retained its ability to be activated by heat, acid, and TSP1 (not shown). Introducing the LSA56L mutation into the LAP resulted in a 70% decrease (by densitometry) in secretion of the mature TGF-β domain as detected in immunoblots for both TGF-β and the FLAG epitope. The decrease was also confirmed by the lower levels of total TGF-β detected in the conditioned medium of cells expressing LSA56L FLAG-TGF-β, as compared with cells expressing unmodified FLAG-TGF-β. LAP secretion also appeared slightly reduced in LAP-modified SLC-expressing cells, although levels were still higher than in the empty vector control. The lack of secretion of tagged TGF-β in cells expressing the SLC with LSKL modifications was not the result of defective protein translation because cell lysates probed with anti-FLAG antibody showed FLAG-TGF-β precursors expressed in all FLAG-TGF-β latent complex construct-expressing cells. Protein processing and secretion appears intact because both recombinant LAP and endogenous TGF-β were secreted. Thus, mutation of the latent complex at the LSKL sequence of LAP results in impaired secretion of mature TGF-β. Mutation of the LSKL Sequence Impairs Association of LAP and TGF-β—To determine whether the impaired secretion of mature TGF-β in the SLC mutated in the LSKL sequence is because of altered binding between LAP and the mature domain, the ability of LAP to bind TGF-β was assessed. FLAG-tagged LAP constructs with mutations in the LSKL sequence, either LSA56L or ΔLSKL, were engineered and expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2A). The FLAG tag distinguishes engineered LAP from endogenous LAP. Conditioned medium from transfected COS-1 cells expressing wild type LAP-FLAG, LSA56L LAP-FLAG, or ΔLSKL LAP-FLAG was collected. Initially, the medium was assessed by immunoblotting and densitometry to confirm that the LAP-FLAG constructs were expressed equivalently (data not shown). Then, LAP-FLAG and mutants were isolated from the conditioned medium by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody coupled to resin. LAP-FLAG and mutants with associated endogenous TGF-β were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies to the FLAG tag or to mature TGF-β, respectively. The amounts of soluble LAP-FLAG isolated were equivalent for all the LAP-FLAG constructs (Fig. 2B). As expected, mature TGF-β was associated with the wild type LAP-FLAG (Fig. 2B); however, deletion of the LSKL sequence blocked association between LAP and mature TGF-β. The LSA56L LAP-FLAG similarly had significantly reduced TGF-β association (72% of wild type by densitometry normalized to LAP-FLAG). These results were not because of defective production of endogenous TGF-β, as PAIL assays of the conditioned medium showed equal levels of total (heat-activated) TGF-β secreted with each LAP construct (data not shown). To confirm these findings, an alternate approach was used to assess LAP-TGF-β binding. TGF-β1 (-/-) fibroblasts were transfected with the LAP-FLAG and LSKL-modified constructs. Equivalent secretion of LAP was confirmed by immunoblotting and densitometry. Analysis by PAIL assay confirmed lack of TGF-β activity in the conditioned medium (not shown). Biotinylated TGF-β1 was immobilized on a neutravidin-coated plate. Binding of LAP-FLAG to immobilized TGF-β1 was then assessed through detection of the FLAG epitope with an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to peroxidase. Unmodified LAP-FLAG had the highest level of binding to immobilized TGF-β (Fig. 2C). Binding to LSA56L LAP-FLAG was only partially reduced, which was consistent with the immunoprecipitation experiments. However, deletion of the LSKL sequence from LAP completely abrogated binding to TGF-β. The FLAG peptide control or conditioned medium from cells transfected with an empty vector did not bind TGF-β, indicating that LAP binding to TGF-β is specific. Thus, these studies show that the LSKL sequence in LAP is critical for binding to the mature domain of TGF-β. Mutation of the LSKL Sequence Impairs the Ability of LAP to Confer Latency—Because LSKL is necessary for LAP binding to mature TGF-β and LAP association with the mature domain is critical for latency, we asked whether the LSKL sequence is required for LAP induction of latency. To examine the effects of LSKL mutations on latency, COS-1 conditioned medium expressing LAP-FLAG constructs was assayed for the ability to inactivate 20 pm active TGF-β in the PAIL assay. As predicted, the LAP-FLAG construct in COS-1 conditioned medium reduced levels of active TGF-β (Fig. 3A). LSA56L LAP-FLAG also retained its ability to confer latency, though slightly impaired, which is consistent with its impaired binding to mature TGF-β. In contrast, ΔLSKL LAP-FLAG failed to confer latency as predicted from its inability to bind mature TGF-β. Conditioned medium from cells transfected with the empty vector had no effect on TGF-β activity. Finally, increasing amounts of active TGF-β1 were added to conditioned medium collected from TGF-β1 (-/-) cells transfected with the LAP constructs, and TGF-β activity was assessed by the PAIL assay (Fig. 3B). The results show that LAP-FLAG conferred latency and that LSA56L LAP-FLAG was slightly less effective in conferring latency. In contrast, ΔLSKL LAP-FLAG was unable to confer latency. These studies show that the LSKL sequence of LAP is important not only for binding to the mature domain but also for conferring latency and formation of the latent complex. The LSKL Sequence of LAP Recognizes the RKPK Sequence of Mature TGF-β—We next sought to identify the sequence in mature TGF-β recognized by the LAP LSKL sequence. Prior studies showed that the LSKL sequence binds to the KRFK sequence of TSP1 and that this interaction is necessary for TSP1-dependent TGF-β activation (11Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Reasoning that the LSKL sequence might bind a sequence that has a similar arrangement of basic and hydrophobic residues as KRFK, the amino acid sequence of mature TGF-β was scanned, and the sequence RKPK (amino acids 94-98), which lies in the type II receptor binding region (15Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was identified as a potential cognate of KRFK. To ascertain whether LAP binds the RKPK sequence, biotin-tagged RKPK and RKAK peptides were immobilized on neutravidin plates, and binding of LAP-FLAG protein in conditioned medium of TGF-β1 (-/-) cells was assayed by immunodetection of the FLAG epitope. LAP-FLAG bound to RKPK but not the control RKAK peptide (Fig. 4A). Binding of LSA56L LAP-FLAG to RKPK was reduced, and ΔLSKL LAP-FLAG showed no binding to the RKPK peptide. Serum-free medium containing the FLAG peptide did not bind RKPK, demonstrating that LAP-FLAG binding is not due to the FLAG epitope. RKPK peptides, but not the control peptides (RKAK and RPPK), also inhibited the association of immobilized biotinylated TGF-β1 and LAP-FLAG from TGF-β1 (-/-) conditioned medium (Fig. 4B). Association of LAP-FLAG with endogenous TGF-β in COS-1 conditioned medium was competitively blocked by increasing concentrations of RKPK peptide but not by RKAK or RPPK control peptides (Fig. 4C). Experiments were controlled for equal LAP-FLAG pull-down (anti-FLAG immunoblot). There was no association between anti-FLAG resin and endogenous TGF-β (empty vector conditioned medium). These data show that peptides containing the RKPK sequence bind LAP and inhibit association of LAP with mature TGF-β. RKPK Peptides Activate the TGF-β Latent Complex—Because RKPK prevents LAP from binding to mature TGF-β, the RKPK peptide is predicted to activate the latent complex, potentially through dissociation of the LAP from the mature domain. The ability of RKPK to activate endogenous latent TGF-β in conditioned medium from bovine aortic endothelial cells was measured in the PAIL assay (Fig. 5A). Control peptides (RKAK and RPPK) did not increase TGF-β activity above base-line levels. However, RKPK stimulated a dose-dependent increase in TGF-β activity. Peptides did not increase TGF-β activity when added to serum-free medium (not shown) or when added to active TGF-β (Fig. 5B), indicating that the ability of RKPK to increase TGF-β activity occurs through activation of the latent complex and not modulation of active TGF-β or cellular receptors. The ability of RKPK peptides to activate latent TGF-β is further supported by the observation that RKPK peptides, but not control peptides (RKAK), activate the purified recombinant TGF-β latent complex (Fig. 5C). Together, these data show that RKPK peptides activate both recombinant and cell-derived latent TGF-β, presumably by interfering with the ability of LAP to confer latency to the mature domain. Deletion of the RKPK Sequence Results in Loss of Secretion of TGF-β—It is known that the mature domain must be associated with the LAP to be secreted (13Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Broz S. Jackson M. Levinson A.D. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If the RKPK sequence is important for mature domain association with the LAP, then deletion of RKPK from the SLC should impair secretion of the mature domain as was observed when LSKL was deleted. FLAG-tagged SLC deleted in the RKPK sequence (FLAGTGF-β ΔRKPK) was made and expressed in COS-1 cells. Serum-free conditioned medium and cell lysates from these cells and from cells expressing ΔLSKL FLAG-TGF-β, FLAG-TGF-β, the unmodified SLC, and an empty vector were collected for analysis. No FLAG-tagged TGF-β was detected in the conditioned medium of cells expressing latent complex deleted in either the LSKL (ΔLSKL FLAG-TGF-β) or the RKPK (FLAGTGF-β ΔRKPK) sequences (Fig. 6), although LAP was detected in the conditioned medium. The absence of FLAG-tagged TGF-β in the conditioned medium is not due to a lack of protein expression, because protein was detectable in lysates of all cells expressing FLAG-tagged latent complex constructs. The lack of a detectable mature domain in the conditioned medium when either LSKL or RKPK is deleted is consistent with the base-line levels of TGF-β activity measured in the conditioned medium using the PAIL assay. However, it is possible that deletion of the RKPK sequence could also impair mature TGF-β binding to its receptors, as RKPK lies within the receptor binding region (15Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These studies provide further support for our conclusion that the RKPK sequence in the mature domain is important for binding to LAP and formation of the latent complex. These data show that the LSKL sequence of LAP is critical for proper formation and function of the latent TGF-β complex. Mutations of the LSKL sequence reduced binding of LAP to the mature domain and significantly impaired the ability of LAP to confer latency to mature TGF-β. We identified the sequence RKPK in the mature domain as a potential recognition sequence for LSKL. Peptides containing RKPK bound LAP and activated the latent complex. Finally, SLC constructs with deletions in either the RKPK sequence of the mature domain or the LSKL sequence of LAP resulted in loss of secretion of mature TGF-β, presumably because of impaired association of LAP with the mature domain. This is the first report to identify specific complementary sequences in the SLC that are critical for LAP/TGF-β association and latency. The LSKL sequence lies within the larger region (amino acids 50-85) previously identified to be important for latency and secretion of the mature domain (8Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in those studies, the site in the mature domain important for LAP association was not identified. The LSKL sequence is conserved in the three mammalian TGF-β isoforms, suggesting its broad importance for latency (11Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The LSKL sequence is also conserved across species for which the TGF-β sequence is known; purified simian β1-LAP deleted in LSKL is also unable to confer latency to mature TGF-β (data not shown). Finally, known inactivators of TGF-β1 (α2-macroglobulin and decorin) contain LSKL motifs, which could potentially associate with the RKPK sequence in the mature domain and inhibit activity. The LSA56L LAP mutation partially affected secretion of the mature domain but had only minimal effects on LAP binding to mature TGF-β and on the ability of LAP to confer latency. This was unexpected because peptides of this sequence do not disrupt TSP1-dependent activation by competing for TSP-LAP binding. It is possible that the LSAL sequence in the context of the SLC retains sufficient structure to mediate LAP interactions with the mature domain. The RKPK sequence is also conserved in the mature domain of TGF-β1 across mammalian species (15Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mammalian TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 contain similar conserved sequences, KTPK and RTPK, respectively. Although the ability of LSKL to bind these other motifs was not tested directly, previous studies showed that chimeric TGF-β1/β2 protein, with KTPKI substituted for RKPKV, associated with LAP and was secreted (15Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This same study identified that the RKPK sequence lies within a region important for binding to signaling receptors. It is conceivable that association of LSKL with RKPK would sterically prevent receptor binding. This is consistent with the known structure of TGF-β1, which shows that the RKPK sequence lies at the end of a largely extended β-structure (16Hinck A.P. Archer S.J. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Lucas R. Zhang B.L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8517-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, additional structural information for LAP and the latent complex will be needed to determine the proximity of the LSKL sequence to the RKPK site. These data also provide a molecular mechanism for TSP1-mediated TGF-β activation. Activation by TSP1 occurs through binding of the KRFK sequence of TSP1 to the LAP through its LSKL sequence (11Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that KRFK competes with the RKPK sequence in the mature domain for LSKL binding in the LAP, resulting in an altered interaction of the LAP and the mature domain. Control of TGF-β activity by post-translational activation of the latent complex is documented to be disregulated in many disease states (5Branton M.H. Kopp J.B. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 17Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8621-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). TGF-β activators are potentially useful in models of wound healing where TGF-β activity might be deficient (18Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Poczatek M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). On the other hand, natural TGF-β inhibitors (including LAP and the soluble type II TGF-β receptor) and small molecules (including peptides derived from TSP1) can potentially attenuate pathology in diseases from fibrosis to neoplasia (18Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Poczatek M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 19Zhang Y. McCormick L.L. Gilliam A.C. J. Investig.

Triangulation of 20 jets shows that 2 emanate from the nucleus dark side and 16 emanate from sources that are on slopes where the Sun's elevation is greater than predicted from the fitted triaxial ellipsoid. Seven sources, including five in the Mayo depression, coincide with relatively bright surface spots. Fitting the imaged jets, the spikelike temporal distribution of dust impacts indicates that the spacecraft crossed thin, densely populated sheets of particulate ejecta extending from small sources on the rotating nucleus, consistent with an emission cone model."
https://openalex.org/W2133845446,"In this study, we investigated the effects of estradiol on the proliferation of neonatal keratinocytes, the expression of estrogen receptor isoforms, and the signaling mechanisms by which estradiol mediates cell growth. We demonstrate that estradiol binds neonatal keratinocytes with high affinity (Kd=5.2nM) and limited capacity (Bmax of 14.2fmol/mg of protein), confirming the presence of estrogen binding sites. Using specific antibodies, we demonstrate that keratinocytes express both estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta. At physiological concentrations, estradiol up-regulates the level of ER-alpha receptors in keratinocytes and induces keratinocyte proliferation. The proliferative effect of estradiol requires the availability of functional estrogen receptors, as it is abrogated by anti-estrogen administration. Estradiol effect on keratinocyte proliferation is most likely mediated in part by activation of a nongenomic, membrane-associated, signaling pathway involving activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 and in part by the genomic signaling pathway through activation of nuclear receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2168882350,"We demonstrate two approaches that use the recently developed helium spin-echo technique to measure surface potential energy landscapes. For helium–lithium fluoride (100), we use the selective adsorption phenomenon to obtain the complete experimental band structure of atoms in a corrugated surface potential. For carbon monoxide–copper (001), we measure the diffusion-induced energy broadening in the scattered helium beam and extract properties of the adsorbate-substrate potential. The measurements are made possible by the resolution of our new spectrometer, which improves on existing resolution by three orders of magnitude. We show that it is possible to produce benchmark energy landscapes to assist evaluation and development of first-principles theory in the problematic van der Waals/weak chemisorption regime."
https://openalex.org/W2026045779,"Mutually exclusive splicing of exons 6A and 6B from the chicken β-tropomyosin gene involves numerous regulatory sequences. Previously, we identified a G-rich intronic sequence (S3) downstream of exon 6B. This element consists of six G-rich motifs, mutations of which abolish splicing of exon 6B. In this paper, we investigated the cellular factors that bind to this G-rich element. By using RNA affinity chromatography, we identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, the SR proteins ASF/SF2 and SC35, and hnRNP F/H as specific components that are assembled onto the G-rich element. By using hnRNP A1-depleted HeLa nuclear extract and add-back experiments, we show that hnRNP A1 has a negative effect on splicing of exon 6B. In agreement with in vitro data, artificial recruitment of hnRNP A1, as a fusion with the MS2 coat protein, also represses splicing of exon 6B ex vivo. In contrast, ASF/SF2 and SC35 activate splicing of exon 6B. As observed with other systems, hnRNP A1 counteracts the stimulating effect of the SR proteins. Moreover, cross-linking experiments show that both ASF/SF2 and SC35 are able to displace binding of hnRNP A1 to the G-rich element, suggesting that the binding sites for these proteins are overlapping. These data indicate that the G-rich sequence is a composite element that acts as an enhancer or as a silencer, depending on which proteins bind to them.

These data indicate that the G-rich sequence is a composite element that acts as an enhancer or as a silencer, depending on which proteins bind to them. Splicing is the process by which introns from premessenger RNAs are removed in eukaryotes. Pre-mRNA splicing takes place within the spliceosome, which is a large, highly dynamic complex composed of four small ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; nt, nucleotide(s). U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5) and multiple non-snRNP factors (1Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 13. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar, 2Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing questions that remains in RNA splicing is how the 5′ and 3′ splice sites are selected and paired together within large RNA sequences (3Black D.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar). This question takes on particular importance in alternative splicing, where the selection of certain splice sites is modulated depending on the developmental stage, on tissue differentiation, or on metabolic changes of the cells (3Black D.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that regulatory sequences within the pre-mRNA that lie outside the splicing signals play a crucial role in controlling the choice of splicing sites in a given cellular context (reviewed in Refs. 4Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar and 5Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Among these sequences are the splicing enhancers. These elements are found in a wide variety of metazoan pre-mRNAs, either within exons or introns. Purine-rich splicing enhancers (known as ESE) are a well characterized class of exonic splicing enhancers that mostly interact with specific subsets of SR proteins (reviewed in Refs. 6Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar and 7Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). SR proteins belong to a family of essential splicing factors that are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals and that are involved in both constitutive and regulated splicing events (reviewed in Refs. 8Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar and 9Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the function of SR proteins is to stimulate the recognition of weak upstream 3′ splice sites, by recruiting U2AF65/35, or to facilitate U1 snRNP binding to the 5′ splice site (reviewed in Ref. 4Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). It also has been proposed that ASF/SF2 bound to an ESE element antagonizes the function of hnRNP A1 bound to a juxtaposed exonic silencer element by impairing the propagation of cooperative binding of hnRNP A1 along the exon (10Zhu J. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Intronic splicing enhancers are another class of elements that have been identified in numerous pre-mRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 4Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). Analyses of intronic splicing enhancers reveal that most of them have a multipartite structure composed of several distinct motifs that are shared by different intronic splicing enhancers. It was first noticed that there is an enrichment in G triplets and quartets downstream of 5′ splice sites by computer analysis of human intronic sequences, and it was suggested that they play a role in the splicing process (11Engelbrecht J. Knudsen S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that G-rich motifs are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of numerous pre-mRNAs. Depending on their position within the pre-mRNA and on the proteins that bind to them, G-rich elements have been shown to function as enhancer or silencer elements. In the case of the cardiac troponin T pre-mRNA, it has been shown that multiple GGGGCUG intronic motifs are required to promote the recognition of the 6-nucleotide microexon 17 (12Carlo T. Sterner D.A. Berget S.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 342-353PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the binding of SF1 to these motifs extends the domain of the microexon, which facilitates exon recognition during early events of spliceosome assembly (13Carlo T. Sierra R. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3988-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The inclusion of the c-src N1 exon in neuronal cells requires an intronic regulatory element, named the downstream control element, that is made up of an array of individual motifs that bind to different proteins of the hnRNP family (14Chou M.-Y. Rooke N. Turck C. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Markovtsov V. Nikolic J.M. Goldman J.A. Turck C.W. Chou M.Y. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7463-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Within the downstream control element, a GGGGGCUG motif has been shown to activate splicing of the N1 exon through its interactions with hnRNP H and F (14Chou M.-Y. Rooke N. Turck C. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Min H. Chan R.C. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GUGGG motif at the 5′ end of the skeletal exon of the rat β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA acts as a negative regulator through its interaction with hnRNP H (17Chen C.D. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Several G tracts have been found in an intronic enhancer element that stimulate splicing of the thyroid hormone receptor gene (18Hastings M.L. Wilson C.M. Munroe S.H. RNA. 2001; 7: 859-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This element interacts with hnRNP H (18Hastings M.L. Wilson C.M. Munroe S.H. RNA. 2001; 7: 859-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Another class of G-rich motifs, which bears homology with the high affinity hnRNP A1 binding site UAGGGU, also is involved in the inhibition of splicing of various pre-mRNAs (19Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G.

Recent surveys of genomic human sequences that inhibit splicing have also identified several sequences enriched for G-triplets that are capable of promoting exon skipping (32Fairbrother W.G. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6816-6825Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Miriami E. Margalit H. Sperling R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we identified an intronic G-rich element downstream of exon 6B from the chicken β-tropomyosin gene that is thought to be essential for activating splicing between exons 6B and 7 (34Sirand-Pugnet P. Durosay P. Brody E. Marie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This sequence, called S3, contains several G triplets and quartets, which we have arbitrary divided into three elements. The RG1 element contains a GGGGCUG and an overlapping UGGGC motif. The RG2 element contains two AGGGU motifs flanking a GGGGA motif, and the RG3 element contains a UGGGGU motif (Fig. 1). Mutations of the six G motifs abolish the splicing of the intron downstream of exon 6B and inhibit spliceosomal assembly, suggesting that the G-rich element acts as an enhancer (34Sirand-Pugnet P. Durosay P. Brody E. Marie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the present work, we analyze the proteins that are assembled onto the S3 G-rich sequence by RNA affinity chromatography. We identify the proteins hnRNP A/B, hnRNP F/H, ASF/SF2, and SC35 as specific proteins associated with the S3 element. Depletion and add-back experiments combined with ex vivo analysis show that hnRNP A1 inhibits splicing of exon 6B. In contrast, ASF/SF2 and SC35 activate in vitro splicing of exon 6B. We demonstrate that hnRNP A1 counteracts the stimulatory effect of ASF/SF2 and SC35. In addition, we show that both ASF/SF2 and SC35 are able to displace bound hnRNP A1 on the S3 element. These data suggest that the G-rich intronic element shares overlapping or juxtaposed motifs that act as enhancer or silencer depending on the interacting proteins. Plasmid Constructions—All β-tropomyosin constructs were derived from a 1.7-kb chicken genomic clone spanning exons 4–7 (35Libri D. Lemonnier M. Meinnel T. Fiszman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2935-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pSma and pPmac constructs have been described previously (34Sirand-Pugnet P. Durosay P. Brody E. Marie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Clouet d'Orval B. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y. Sirand-Pugnet P. Brody E. Marie J. Science. 1991; 252: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The pPmac mtA1 construct was generated by PCR from the pPmac construct with sense primer 5′-AGAGCGCGCCGGGTTGACGGGAGCACGGTCCTTCACT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTAGAAGCTTGATTTCCT-3′. The PCR product was cleaved with BssHII and HindIII and inserted into the pPmac construct, which was cleaved with BssHII and HindIII. The pPmac tri-RG2 was made by cloning a synthetically prepared hybrid oligonucleotide 5′-CGCGCAGTGTTGAGTGGAGCAGT-3′ into the pPmac construct, which was cleaved with BssHII and PpuMI. The transcription template for 5–6A was made by replacing a PstI 6A fragment from 6BΔ4 (37Gallego M.E. Balvay L. Brody E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5415-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by a PstI 6A fragment from pSVK6AΔ4 in which the 5′ splice site of exon 6A has been mutated (38Balvay L. Libri D. Gallego M. Fiszman M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This mutation introduced a BamHI restriction site. Linearization of the construct by BamHI gave rise to the 5–6A transcript. The transcription template for S3 was obtained by cloning a synthetically prepared hybrid oligonucleotide 5′-GCTGGGGCTGGGCAGAGCGCGCAGGGTTGAGGGGAGCAGGGTCCTTCACTGGGGT-3′ flanked by EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites into a pGEM-3Z vector, which was cleaved with EcoRI and HindIII.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) were made by hybridizing two complementary oligonucleotides containing the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter (see the sequences in Fig. 3). The transcription templates for S3 mtA1 and S3 tri-RG2 were made by PCR from pPmac mtA1 and pPmac tri-RG2 constructs using a sense primer containing the SP6 RNA polymerase (5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATTCTGGGGCTGGGCA-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-CACCCCAGTGAAGGA-3′). For the transfection experiments, a β-tropomyosin minigene extending from exon 5 to exon 7 was cloned in the pcDNA 3 (+) vector to give pcDNA 980. Plasmid pcDNA 980–2MS2 was made by replacing a BssHII-PpuMI RG2 fragment of pcDNA 980 by a BssHII-PpuMI PCR fragment of pIII/MS2–1 containing the coat binding sites (gift from Dr. R. Breathnach). The coat expression vector pCI-MS2 and the hnRNP A1-coat fusion vector (gift from Dr. R. Breathnach) have been described (23Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.-C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription and Splicing Experiments—Capped pre-mRNAs were synthesized in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP as previously described (39Ruskin B. Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 317-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Transcripts were purified by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide/urea gels. Capped RNAs used as competitors in the splicing experiments were 3′-biotinylated as described elsewhere (40Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stévenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezançon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). S3 and mut S3 RNAs for affinity selection were transcribed without capping using a SP6 MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNAs were then biotinylated as described above. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were purchased from A. Miller (Computer Cell Center, Mons, Belgium) and prepared as described (41Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.R. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 42Abmayr S.M. Reed R. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Splicing reactions were performed with 20 fmol of 32P-labeled pre-mRNA in 10-μl reactions with 30% HeLa nuclear extract, except when indicated (36Clouet d'Orval B. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y. Sirand-Pugnet P. Brody E. Marie J. Science. 1991; 252: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Competitor RNA and recombinant proteins were added to the splicing reaction on ice prior to adding the labeled pre-mRNA. Reaction products were analyzed on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels except when indicated. RNA bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Splicing efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the mRNA value and the sum of the pre-mRNA value plus the mRNA value. For each RNA, the number of uracil residues was taken into account for the calculated splicing efficiency. RNA Mobility Shift Assays—RNA mobility shift assays were performed as described elsewhere (43Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Capped RNAs (20 fmol) were incubated under standard splicing conditions with 30% HeLa nuclear extract. The protein-RNA complexes were separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis in 4% acrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:1) using 0.5× TBE as the running buffer. In competition experiments, unlabeled S3 or mut S3 RNA were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C in the presence of 30% nuclear extracts prior to the addition of labeled S3 or mut S3 RNA. For gel shift assays, GST-A1 was cleaved by thrombin (44Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). RNA-hnRNP A1 complexes were formed by incubating 1 μl of hnRNP A1 (0–500 nm) in 10 μl of buffer D (12 mm Hepes, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 12% glycerol), 20 ng/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 2 units/μl RNasin, and 1 μl of labeled RNA (10 fmol) for 20 min at 30 °C. The complexes were run on a nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 80:1) containing 50 mm Tris-glycine, pH 8.3. The hnRNP A1 complexes were visualized on a PhosphorImager. RNA Affinity Chromatography, Mass Spectrometry Analysis, and Western Blotting—Coupling to streptavidin-agarose and affinity purification of protein complexes were performed as described elsewhere (45Expert-Bezancon A. Le Caer J.P. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16614-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first dimension was a nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE) using ampholytes 3.5–9.5 (46O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). The second dimension was a 7.5% PAGE (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). The selected proteins were visualized by silver staining or Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The protein spots were excised from the gel, digested in gel with trypsin, and identified by mass spectrometry (45Expert-Bezancon A. Le Caer J.P. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16614-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of affinity-selected proteins, 100 pmol of RNA bound to 25 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads were incubated with 500 μl of 30% HeLa nuclear extracts under splicing conditions without polyvinylalcohol and rotated 5 min at 30 °C. After washing, proteins were released from the beads by mixing twice in 66% glacial acetic acid and 33 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C and then proceeded as described elsewhere (45Expert-Bezancon A. Le Caer J.P. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16614-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proteins were dissolved in 250 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the following antibodies: anti-hnRNP A1 monoclonal antibodies 9H10 (a gift from Dr. G. Dreyfuss), anti-hnRNP F/H monoclonal antibodies 1G11 (a gift from Dr. G. Dreyfuss), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal peptide of hnRNP F (a gift from Dr. Black), monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal peptide of ASF/SF2 (a gift from Dr. J. Stévenin), monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal peptide of SC35 (a gift from Dr. J. Stévenin), and monoclonal antibody mAb 104 monoclonal antibodies (a gift from Dr. Roth). The bands were detected with the SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Pierce). Protein Purification—Total SR proteins from HeLa cells were prepared as described elsewhere (48Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). GST-hnRNP A1 (a gift from Dr. B. Chabot) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol described by the manufacturer. The untagged hnRNP A1 expression vector (pET9d) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the protein was purified as described (49Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins ASF/SF2 and SC35 expressed in baculovirus and purified from Sf9 cells were a gift from Dr. J. Stévenin (40Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stévenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezançon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-ASF/ SF2 ΔRS and GST-SC35 ΔRS proteins cloned into the pGEX vector were a gift from Dr. J. Stévenin (50Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA. 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Affinity Depletion of hnRNP A1—HnRNP A1 was depleted from HeLa nuclear extracts using a biotinylated oligonucleotide (TTAGGGTTAGGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG) coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads (50 μmol/100 μl of beads). The interaction between the oligonucleotide and the beads was for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with buffer D, 100 μl of nuclear extract were added (v/v), and the mix was rotated for 2hat4 °C. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatants were used as hnRNP A1-depleted extract. Mock-depleted nuclear extract was made in the same conditions but with the beads alone. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with monoclonal antibodies as described above. UV Cross-linking Experiments—32P-Uniformly labeled RNAs were synthesized with [α-32P]UTP and [α-32P]GTP as described above. 12.5 fmol of RNAs were incubated in a 12.5-μl reaction mixture containing 5% HeLa nuclear extracts under splicing conditions without polyvinyl-alcohol and the indicated amount of recombinant proteins. In competition experiments without nuclear extracts, 0.1 μg of tRNA were added as a nonspecific competitor. After a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the samples were irradiated on ice for 15 min in a UV (254 nm) Stratalinker and treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A and 10 units of RNase T1 at 37 °C for 30 min. The cross-linked proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by a PhosphorImager. Transfections and RNA Analysis—QM7 quail myogenic cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm diameter tissue culture dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4500 mg/liter d-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% chick serum. The next day, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of minigene DNA and 0.5 and 1 μg of coat or coat fusion hnRNP A1 expression vectors using FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Forty-eight hours later, RNA was harvested from cells using Tri Reagent™ (Sigma), treated by RQ1 DNase I, and analyzed by RT-PCR. Reverse transcription was performed with oligo(dT) and superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 60 min at 42 °C. PCR was carried out with one-twentieth of the RT reaction in 50-μl reactions with 0.3 μm primers, 200 μm dNTPs, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 2 units of Dynazyme Taq polymerase (Finnzyme). For β-tropomyosin, primers were T7 (5′-TACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAC-3′), 6A rev (5′-GCAATGAGGGATTTGAGGCTC-3′), 6B rev (5′-CAGCTCCTCCTCTAGGTCAC-3′), 6B sense (5′-TAAATGTGGTGACCTAGAGGAG-3′), and bovine growth hormone rev (5′-ACTAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′). For β-actin, primers were β-actin forward (5′-CATGTTTGAGACCTTCAACAC-3′) and β-actin reverse (5′-GTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAGCC-3′). Cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s (22 cycles for β tropomyosin minigene and 25 cycles for β-actin). PCR products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a PhosphorImager. The G-rich Regulatory Sequence Interacts with Specific Proteins—In a previous paper (34Sirand-Pugnet P. Durosay P. Brody E. Marie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we showed that the splicing of the intron downstream of exon 6B is stimulated by a G-rich intronic element (named S3). To test whether this element interacts with specific cellular factors, we performed splicing competition experiments with a pre-mRNA containing exon 6B/intron/exon 7 (Fig. 1A, pSma). The RNA used as a competitor contained the wild-type sequence from 21 to 73 nt down-stream of exon 6B (Fig. 1A). As a control, we used an RNA (named mut S3) in which the G-rich motifs had been mutated (Fig. 1A). The addition of 16 pmol of unlabeled S3 RNA dramatically decreased exon 6B to 7 splicing (Fig. 1B). After 2 h of incubation, splicing efficiency was reduced 3-fold as compared with that without an RNA competitor (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the addition of the same amount of the mut S3 RNA had no effect on or even slightly stimulated the splicing of exon 6B to 7 (Fig. 1B). Splicing inhibition was sequence-specific, because splicing of Adeno pre-mRNA was not affected by the addition of the S3 RNA competitor (data not shown). These results suggested that the stimulatory effect on exon 6B-7 splicing was mediated by cellular factors that specifically interacted with the G-rich element. This assumption was confirmed by gel retardation assays. Incubation of the S3 RNA under splicing conditions with a 30% nuclear extract resulted in a specific high molecular weight complex that did not form with the mut S3 RNA (Fig. 1C). Assembly of this specific complex was very rapid, since it was formed in the first minutes of incubation on ice (Fig. 1C). A faster migrating complex was also observed, whose mobility was approximately the same as the complex formed with the mut S3 RNA (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Raising the nuclear extract concentration to 60% did not modify the pattern of the protein complexes; nor did it alter their specificity (data not shown). In agreement with in vitro splicing experiments, the addition of an excess of unlabeled S3 RNA significantly reduced complex formation, whereas the addition of the same molar excess of unlabeled mut S3 RNA had no effect (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). Altogether, these results suggested that the G-rich element interacted with cellular factors in a sequence-specific manner. HnRNP A1 Is a Component of Regulatory Complexes That Binds to the S3 Element—To identify proteins that bind to S3, we used an RNA chromatography method. Biotinylated S3 RNA or its mutated version mut S3, were bound to streptavidin-agarose beads and incubated with 30% HeLa nuclear extracts under standard splicing conditions (45Expert-Bezancon A. Le Caer J.P. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16614-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since specific complexes assemble very rapidly, the incubation time was for 5 min at 30 °C. After washing, the purified complexes were eluted, and the proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with a nonequilibrium pH gradi"

Two hHARE isoforms (190 and 315 kDa) are present in sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes (Zhou, B., McGary, C. T., Weigel, J. A., Saxena, A., and Weigel, P. H. (2003) Glycobiology 13, 339–349). Here we report the specificity and function of the 190-kDa HARE, expressed without the larger isoform, in Flp-In 293 cell lines (190hHARE cells). Like the native protein, recombinant hHARE contains ∼25 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharides, binds HA in a ligand blot assay, cross-reacts with three anti-rat HARE monoclonal antibodies, and is inactivated by reduction. The 190hHARE cell lines mediated rapid, continuous 125I-HA endocytosis and degradation for >1 day. About 30–50% of the total cellular receptors were on the cell surface, and their recycling time for reutilization was ∼8.5 min. The average Kd for the binding of HA to the 190-kDa hHARE at 4 °C was 7 nm with 118,000 total HA binding sites per cell. Competition studies at 37 °C indicated that the 190-kDa hHARE binds HA and chondroitin better than dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfates A, C, D, and E, but it does not bind to heparin, heparan sulfate, or keratan sulfate. Although competition was observed at 37 °C, none of the glycosaminoglycans tested, except HA, competed for 125I-HA binding by 190hHARE cells at 4 °C. Anti-HARE monoclonal antibodies #30 and #154, which do not inhibit 125I-HA uptake mediated by the 175-kDa rat HARE, partially blocked HA endocytosis by the 190-kDa hHARE. We conclude that the 190-kDa hHARE can function independently of other hHARE isoforms to mediate the endocytosis of multiple glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, the rat and human small HARE isoforms have different glycosaminoglycan specificities and sensitivities to inhibition by cross-reacting antibodies.

Henriksen J.H. Degradation of Bioactive Substances: Physiology and Pathophysiology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 249-265Google Scholar), very high HA levels could occur locally, in lymph fluid, or in plasma. Therefore, efficient mechanisms for HA uptake and degradation are present in mammals to regulate the amount of HA present in a variety of physiological conditions (reviewed in Refs. 2Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar and 7Weigel P.H. Yik J.H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 341-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The endocytic clearance receptor for HA, which is designated HARE (HA receptor for endocytosis), is abundant in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes (8Zhou B.

Cell Res. 1983; 144: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and the protein was finally purified by Zhou et al. in 1999 (14Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Earlier studies using isolated rat LECs indicated that HARE mediates the binding and endocytosis of HA via the coated-pit pathway and that this receptor also recognizes and internalizes chondroitin sulfates (15Smedsrod B. Malmgren M. Ericsson J. Laurent T.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Raja R.H. McGary C.T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Unlike the rat HARE proteins, which have been studied extensively in isolated rat LECs, there have been no cellular studies of the human HARE proteins. Human LECs are not available commercially, and to date, no cell lines have been identified that express either the 190- or 315-kDa hHARE isoforms. Consequently, very little is known about the GAG specificity or function of human HARE. In both rat (14Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and human (10Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), two isoforms of HARE are present with molecular masses of 175 or 300 kDa and 190 or 315 kDa, respectively. The human ∼315-kDa HARE is a complex composed of two disulfide-bonded subunits of about 250 and 220 kDa, in a ratio of ∼2:1 (10Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, the small hHARE isoform contains a single subunit. All subunits in both hHARE isoforms, although they are different sizes, appear to be derived by proteolysis from the same precursor protein (9Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is Stabilin 2 (18Politz O. Gratchev A. McCourt P.A. Schledzewski K. Guillot P. Johansson S. Svineng G. Franke P. Kannicht C. Kzhyshkowska J. Longati P. Velten F.W. Johansson S. Goerdt S. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Full-length Stabilin 2 is a very large putative protein (2551 amino acids), whose synthesis and processing have not yet been fully elucidated. For example, it is not known if the largest subunit in the 315-kDa hHARE corresponds to full-length Stabilin 2 or to a truncated form of the protein. The small rat and human HARE proteins are not encoded directly by mRNA. We recently demonstrated (9Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the native small rHARE isoform contains the C-terminal 1431 residues of the predicted full-length protein and that this smaller HARE, when expressed in SK-Hep-1 cells in the absence of the large isoform, colocalizes with clathrin as expected for a coated-pit-coupled endocytic HA receptor (19Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The two rat HARE species, therefore, appear to be functionally independent isoreceptors for HA. In the present study, we have created an artificial spleen cDNA for the 190-kDa hHARE to assess its functionality and GAG specificity in stable cell lines. In addition to demonstrating that this smaller hHARE isoform can function as an endocytic, recycling receptor in the absence of the larger hHARE, we found that the human protein has slightly different specificity for various GAGs than the highly related rat 175-kDa HARE isoform. Unexpectedly, several anti-HARE mAbs showed very different reactivity with the rat and human recombinant HARE proteins and were able to block partially the internalization of HA by cells expressing the 190-kDa hHARE. Materials and Buffers—Na125I was from Amersham Biosciences, and 125I-HA was prepared as described previously (20Raja R.H. LeBoeuf R. Stone G. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using HA oligosaccharides (MW = 133,000 based on gel permeation chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering analysis), modified only at their reducing ends to contain covalently attached hexylamine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were from Charles River Labs. BSA Fraction V and fetal bovine serum were from Intergen Co. Collagenase was from Roche Applied Science. The preparation and characterization of mouse mAbs raised against the rat 175-kDa HARE were described previously (8Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Tris, SDS, ammonium persulfate, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, and SDS-PAGE standards were from Bio-Rad. Digitonin, from ACROS Organics, was prepared as a 25% (w/v) stock solution in Me2SO and then diluted into medium as required. Unless noted otherwise, other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. All GAGs (with the exception of heparin, which came from Sigma) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. The weight-average molecular masses (determined by gel permeation chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering analysis) for all but two of the GAGs were 14.2–38.8 kDa. The two exceptions were Chon (7.4 kDa) and CS-E (187.7 kDa). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. HBSS and PBS were prepared according to the Invitrogen catalog formulations. Z-buffer contains 60 mm dibasic sodium phosphate and 40 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. TBS contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl. TBST is TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Construction of hHARE Expression Vector—The 190-kDa hHARE coding region was amplified from pooled lymph node cDNAs (Marathon system; Clontech) using Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech), and gene-specific forward (5′-GGATCCTCCTTACCAAACCTGCTCATGCGG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGATCCCAGTGTCCTCAAGGGGTCATTG-3′) primers. The PCR product representing the artificial cDNA was then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using a 0.8% gel containing 0.002% crystal violet for visualization. The band was excised, gene-cleaned, ligated into pCR-XL-TOPO, and transformed into TOP10 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). Clones were selected and screened for the full-length insert by restriction digestion and PCR analysis, and a correct clone was used to prepare and isolate the expression vector. The hHARE cDNA was then cut out of the pCR-XL-TOPO plasmid and inserted into the BamHI site of pSecTag/FRT/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). This vector provides a κ light chain secretion signal fused at the N terminus of the hHARE reading frame and two epitope tags (V5 and His-6) fused at the C terminus of the gene product. After transformation into TOP10 E. coli cells, several clones were selected and size and orientation of the cDNA insert were verified. The complete sequences of promoter, fusion, and cDNA regions of the final clones were determined and confirmed to be correct. Selection and Characterization of Stable Transfectants Expressing the 190-kDa hHARE—Flp-In 293 cells (3 × 106; from Invitrogen) were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes the day prior to transfection. Cells in 10 ml of antibiotic-free medium were transfected by addition of 750 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 9 μg of pOG44 (which encodes the Flp-In recombinase), 1 μg of pSecTag-190hHARE, and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days post-transfection the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Due to the build-up of dead cells, the medium was changed every 2–3 days. Visible colonies were observed at days 10–14 and then isolated using cloning rings or collected directly with a plastic pipette tip. Isolated colonies were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes in 1.0 ml of DMEM with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. After a monolayer of cells had developed from each clone, the cells were scraped and suspended in 1.0 ml of fresh medium. One portion (100 μl) of cells was re-seeded and allowed to grow for subsequent procedures. Another 100 μl of cells was resuspended in DMEM plus 100 μg/ml Zeocin and allowed to grow for 1 week to test for Zeocin sensitivity. A third portion (400 μl) of cells was pelleted and resuspended in 4× Laemmli sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) to test for HARE protein expression by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. The Western blot was probed with anti-V5 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories; 1:5000 dilution) in TBST. The remaining 400 μl of cell suspension was pelleted and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Both the Zeocin and β-galactosidase tests indicate whether pSecTag-190-kDa hHARE was inserted correctly and uniquely into the Flp-In recombination site by the Flp-In recombinase encoded by pOG44. The recombinase is lost during subsequent cell divisions, because the encoding plasmid lacks an antibiotic selection gene. For the β-galactosidase assay, a clonal cell pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and 10 μl of cell lysate per well (in a 96-well plate) was combined with 20 μl of distilled deionized H2O, 70 μl of Z-buffer, and 20 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside in Z-buffer. After 15 min at 37 °C, the enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml 1 m sodium bicarbonate, and absorbance values were determined at 420 nm. Human embryonic kidney Flp-In 293 cells and 293 cells were included in each assay set as positive and negative controls, respectively. Stable clones with a single plasmid integrated into the correct, unique chromosomal site were those that demonstrated and maintained no detectable β-galactosidase expression, poor or no growth in DMEM containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin, normal cell morphology, and good HARE protein expression. Suitable clones were maintained in DMEM containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B and 8% fetal bovine serum. Western and Ligand Blot Assays—Western blotting was performed as described by Burnette (22Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cell lysates were mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), without reducing agent, to give final concentrations of 16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 0.01% bromphenol blue. After SDS-PAGE, the contents of the gel were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 10 V at 4 °C using 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS in a Genie blotter apparatus (Idea Scientific). For the ligand blot assay, the nitrocellulose membrane was treated first with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 2 h, or TBST overnight, and then incubated with 1–2 μg/ml 125I-HA in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mm EDTA without, or with, a 100- to 150-fold excess of nonlabeled HA (as competitor) to assess total and nonspecific binding, respectively (23Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Ritchie D. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was washed with TBST five times for 5 min each and dried at room temperature. Bound 125I-HA was detected by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MS or MR film exposed at –85 °C for 6–48 h. Nonspecific binding in this assay is typically <5%. For Western analysis, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS at 4 °C overnight either after the ligand blot assay (the membranes were rewet with TBST first) or directly after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer. The membrane was then incubated with anti-rat HARE mAbs (e.g. 1 μg/ml IgG) at 22 °C for 1 h, washed three times for 5 min each with TBST, and incubated with goat anti-mouse Ig-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was washed with TBST five times for 5 min each and incubated with p-nitro blue tetrazolium and sodium 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine for color development (Bio-Rad), which was stopped by washing the membrane with distilled water. 125I-HA Binding or Endocytosis Assays—Stably transfected 190-kDa hHARE cell lines were grown to confluence in DMEM containing 8% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B in tissue culture multiwell dishes (usually 24-well plates). The cells were washed with HBSS and incubated at 37 °C in fresh medium without serum for 30–60 min, the plates were then placed on ice, and the cells washed once or twice with HBSS prior to the experiment. Medium containing 1–2 μg/ml 125I-HA with or without the noted concentration of IgG or other GAG (as competitor) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated either on ice for 60 min to assess cell surface binding or at 37 °C to allow internalization of ligand. To assess HA binding by the total cell receptor population, 0.055% (w/v) digitonin was added to the medium to permeabilize the cells (24Weigel P.H. Ray D.A. Oka J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10253-10262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the noted times, the medium was removed by aspiration, the cells were washed three times with HBSS and lysed in 0.3 n NaOH, and radioactivity and protein content were determined. Values were normalized for cell protein content per well and are presented as cpm/μg of protein. In some cases, HA data are expressed as cpm or femtomoles per million cells. For Flp-In 293 cells, the mean protein content was determined to be 398 ± 85 μg of protein/106 cells (n = 6). 125I-HA Degradation Assay—Degradation of 125I-HA was measured by a cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation assay as described by McGary et al. (26McGary C.T. Yannariello-Brown J. Kim D.W. Stinson T.C. Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 50-μl samples of medium were mixed with 250 μl of 1 mg/ml HA in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Alternatively, 100-μl samples of cell lysate (in 0.3 n NaOH) were mixed with 47 μl of 0.6 n HCl, 28 μl of distilled water, and 125 μl of 2.0 mg/ml HA. After mixing at room temperature, 300 μl of 6% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride in distilled water was added, and the tubes were mixed by vortexing. After 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 22 °C for 5 min at 9000 rpm in an Eppendorf model 5417 microcentrifuge, using a swinging bucket rotor. A sample (300 μl) of the supernatant was taken for determination of radioactivity, and the remainder was removed by aspiration. The tip of the tube containing the precipitated pellet was cut off then put in a gamma counter tube, and radioactivity was determined. Degradation was measured as the time-dependent increase of nonprecipitable radioactivity. At least 80% of the total radioactivity was precipitable at the beginning of each experiment. General—Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). 125I radioactivity was measured using a Packard Auto-Gamma Counting system. Digital images were captured using an Alpha Innotech Fluorochem 8000. Images were taken into Corel Photo Paint (version 9.0) as JPG files, cropped and processed identically, and then transferred to Corel Draw (version 9.0) for annotation. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Molecular Biology Resource Facility. Expression of Recombinant Human 190-kDa HARE—We recently purified two hHARE proteins, of 190 and 315 kDa, from spleen extracts and then molecularly cloned a partial cDNA from pooled human lymph node and spleen that encoded part or all of the subunits in these two isoforms (10Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 190-kDa hHARE protein is not expressed from a unique mRNA, but rather is encoded by a 4383-bp region (1461 amino acids) at the 3′ end of the full-length Stab 2 coding region. To express the 190-kDa protein, we created an artificial cDNA for a recombinant 190-kDa hHARE in the pSecTag/FRT/V5/His-TOPO expression vector. For proper membrane orientation and trafficking to the cell surface, the pSecTag vector provides an immunoglobulin κ-chain secretion signal sequence fused at the N terminus of the protein. Transiently transfected Flp-In 293 cells expressed sufficiently high levels of the recombinant 190-kDa hHARE to mediate the specific binding and internalization of 125I-HA (Fig. 1). Compared with vector alone, cells transfected with hHARE cDNA internalized ∼4 times the amount of HA, and this uptake was completely blocked by unlabeled HA. Specific HA uptake, therefore, was ∼80% of the total. The potential advantage of using Flp-In 293 cells as the parental cell line for generation of stable cell lines expressing hHARE is that all clones should be virtually identical if the plasmid inserts at only the single unique chromosome site containing the engineered integration site. Correct integration at this site interrupts a β-galactosidase gene and a Zeocin resistance gene in the engineered site. Clones containing a single plasmid insertion at the correct engineered site are, therefore, hygromycin B-resistant, negative for β-galactosidase activity, and Zeocin-sensitive. If plasmid insertion occurs at other chromosome sites, rather than the correct engineered site, then clones will express β-galactosidase and be Zeocin-resistant. Out of 41 stably transfected clones that we selected and characterized, three (#9, #14, and #40) had no detectable β-galactosidase activity, were Zeocin-sensitive, and were judged to contain a plasmid insertion at the unique engineered site. A protein of the correct size for the 190-kDa hHARE was expressed in the three selected stable Flp-In 293 cell lines, and this protein bound 125I-HA with >98% specificity in a ligand blot assay following SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer (Fig. 2A). The 190-kDa hHARE protein expressed in Flp-In 293 cells had the characteristics previously found for native hHARE purified from spleen (10Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and expression of the 190-kDa hHARE did not alter the morphology of Flp-In 293 cells. The recombinant nonreduced protein was recognized in Western blots by the three anti-rHARE mAbs that cross-reacted with native hHARE (mAbs 30, 154, and 159) but not mAbs 28, 174, 235, and 467 (Fig. 2B, NR). Similarly, the reduced 190-kDa hHARE protein reacted with only mAbs 159 and 174 (Fig. 2B, R). Based on its HA-binding activity in these in vivo and in vitro assays, the recombinant hHARE protein appeared to be folded properly. Consistent with this interpretation, three other characteristics of the recombinant hHARE were identical to those of the native protein (10Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reduction of disulfide bonds resulted in slower migration of the 190-kDa hHARE in SDS-PAGE compared with the nonreduced protein (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 3, WB). Reduction of disulfide bonds also caused loss of HA-binding activity (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 3, AR). After treatment with endoglycosidase-F to release N-linked oligosaccharides, the recombinant protein migrated at a position corresponding to a loss of ∼25 kDa (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4, WB). The de-N-glycosylated hHARE protein was still able to bind HA in this ligand blot format (Fig. 2C, lane 4, AR). In addition, anti-V5 antibody recognition of the C-terminal epitope provided by the vector was suitable for immunoprecipitation (not shown). HA Binding and Internalization by Cells Expressing the 190-kDa hHARE—The specific binding of 125I-HA at 4 °C by stable cell lines was typical for a membrane-bound receptor; binding kinetics was hyperbolic and saturated after about 90 min (Fig. 3). Essentially no specific binding of 125I-HA occurred in the control cells transfected with empty vector, consistent with the absence of any significant HA receptor activity in 293 cells (Table I). Also, as found for other endocytic, recycling receptors (e.g. the asialoglycoprotein and mannose receptors), about 30–50% of the total cellular hHARE population was on the cell surface, and the remainder was intracellular. The native rHARE in isolated LECs is an active endocytic receptor that recycles so that HA can be continually internalized and delivered to lysosomes for degradation over a period of many hours to days (7Weigel P.H. Yik J.H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 341-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem.

Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of the recombinant 190-kDa hHARE to recycle, cells were allowed to internalize 125I-HA for 4 h, and the amount of specific HA uptake was calculated as the number of cell surface receptor equivalents.

Northern analysis of mRNA from human tissues and cell lines indicates that hSMP3 is expressed in most tissues, with the highest levels in brain and colon, but its mRNA is nearly absent from cultured human cell lines. Correspondingly, increasing expression of hSMP3 in cultured HeLa cells causes abundant formation of three putative tetramannosyl (Man4)-GPIs. Our data indicate that hSmp3p functions as a mannosyltransferase that adds a fourth mannose to certain Man3-GPIs during biosynthesis of the human GPI precursor, and suggest it may do so in a tissue-specific manner.

Many GPIs become covalently attached to the carboxyl termini of various secretory proteins and serve to anchor them to the exterior face of the plasma membrane (1McConville M.J.

GPIs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by stepwise addition of components to phosphatidylinositol. The end product of GPI synthesis is a “complete precursor” (5Sipos G. Puoti A.

Addition of Man-4 to trimannosyl-GPIs (Man3-GPIs) by the essential Smp3 mannosyltransferase is a mandatory step in yeast GPI precursor assembly which precedes the addition of the terminal EthN-P to Man-3 through which the GPI is ultimately attached to protein (23Grimme S.J.

Thus, it is probable that all yeast GPI transamidase substrates bear four mannoses. Conversely, studies of the synthesis of mammalian GPI precursors have uncovered little evidence that a similar pathway step occurs in mammals. The largest characterized mammalian GPI precursors and presumed GPI transamidase substrates contain only three mannoses (10Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E.

In this study, we show that the human Smp3 protein (hSmp3p), a sequence homolog of S. cerevisiae Smp3, is a candidate human GPI fourth mannosyltransferase. We demonstrate that hSmp3p is a resident ER protein that adds Man-4 to certain human Man3-GPIs in vivo during synthesis of GPI precursors. Our data suggest that the addition of Man-4 to both human and yeast GPIs occurs via similar mechanisms but that Man4-GPI formation is likely not necessary for transfer of GPIs to proteins in mammals. Our results also suggest that although the addition of Man-4 is rarely detectable in cultured cell lines, this modification may be more common in the cells of many human tissues. Materials—myo-[2-3H]Inositol (specific activity 15–20 Ci/mmol) and d-[2-3H]mannose (specific activity 20–30 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).

The smp3/gpi13-pGAL-GPI13 double mutant was transformed with p425-ScSMP3 or p425-PGK-hSMP3-HA to generate smp3/gpi13-pGAL-GPI13-p425-ScSMP3 and smp3/gpi13-pGAL-GPI13-pPGK-hSMP3-HA, respectively. Strains smp3::KANR-pGAL-ScSMP3-HA and smp3::KANR-pGAL-hSMP3-HA were made by transforming the smp3::KANR/SMP3 heterozygous diploid with pGAL-ScSMP3-HA or pGAL-hSMP3-HA, respectively. Diploid transformants were sporulated, asci were dissected, and haploid disruptants harboring a plasmid were identified by their ability to grow on YPGal medium containing 200 μg of G418/ml and SGal medium lacking uracil. Strains smp3-2-p416-ScSMP3 and smp3-2-p425-PGK-hSMP3-HA were made by introducing p416-ScSMP3 or p425-PGK-hSMP3-HA into the smp3-2(a) strain background, respectively. Expression of hSMP3 and ScSMP3 in S. cerevisiae—The expression vector p416-PGK was made by PCR amplifying a 501-bp fragment of the yeast PGK1 promoter and cloning it into the NotI-EcoRI sites of pRS416 (33Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Plasmid p416-PGK-hSMP3-HA, in which hSMP3-HA is expressed from the PGK1 promoter, was made by cloning PCR-amplified hSMP3-HA into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of p416-PGK. Plasmid p425-PGK-hSMP3-HA was created by subcloning a SacI-XhoI fragment containing the PGK1 promoter and hSMP3-HA from p416-PGK-hSMP3-HA into the SacI-XhoI sites of pRS425. Plasmid pGAL-hSMP3-HA, in which expression of hSMP3-HA is controlled by the glucose-repressible GAL10 promoter, was made by cloning hSMP3-HA into pMW20 (34Zieler H.A. Walberg M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Plasmids for yeast expression of ScSMP3 were constructed as follows. p425-ScSMP3 was made by cloning a 2.4-kb BglII-HindIII genomic fragment containing ScSMP3 and 513 bp of its native promoter from a YCp50-LEU2 library clone (library obtained from P. Hieter, University of British Columbia) into pRS425. A PCR-amplified fragment containing the ScSMP3 coding region, 513 bp of its native promoter, and 346 bp immediately downstream of its stop codon was cloned into pRS416 to make p416-ScSMP3. Yeast cells were transformed using lithium acetate (35Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection Conditions—HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and cultivated in minimum Eagle's medium (ATCC) or RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine, 100 IU of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transient transfection of cells for metabolic labeling experiments, 1.5–3 × 106 cells were plated/13.5-cm dish and transfected with FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) the next day. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24–48 h prior to labeling (see below). Stable hSMP3-expressing HeLa cell lines were made by transfecting HeLa cells in 60-mm dishes with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1-hSMP3-HA using FuGENE 6. Stable transfectants were selected in minimum Eagle's medium containing 500 μg of G418/ml. Expression of hSMP3, ScSMP3, and PIG-B in HeLa Cells—A human SMP3 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library using the primers 5′-CCGGAATTCATGCAGATCTGTGGATCCAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATAGGTTTCTTCCCCCAGCTCCACAAT-3′. The product, encoding hSmp3p with a carboxyl-terminal HA epitope, was cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). A human PIG-B cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human liver cDNA library using the primers 5′-GCTGGATCCGGGATGAGGAGGCCCCTAAGC-3′ and 5′-TTCCCTCGAGTCACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGAATTTCATCTTCATGTTGAATTTCC-3′. The product, encoding PIG-Bp with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope, was cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1. ScSMP3 was amplified from p416-Sc-SMP3 by PCR using the primers 5′-GTAGGATCCCCACCATGATGAGGTATCAATGG and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATATAGTAGTTCGATGGAGTACACTGT. The product, encoding ScSmp3p with a carboxyl-terminal HA epitope, was cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1. Immunolocalization Microscopy—Approximately 2 × 105 HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes. Cells were transfected with 1–2 μg of an expression plasmid and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 16–24 h, after which cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS and fixed in 5 ml of PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS then permeabilized in 5 ml of PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were washed three times with 5 ml of PBS and twice with 5 ml of PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with one of the following monoclonal primary antibodies in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin: 1 μg/ml anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), 4.9 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), 2 μg/ml anti-human golgin-97 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or 10 μg/ml anti-calreticulin (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were washed five times with 5 ml of PBS, then incubated with either an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG (1:500 dilution) or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution, Molecular Probes) secondary antibody in 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. In double staining experiments, this process was repeated using a second combination of primary and secondary antibodies. After antibody incubations, cells were subjected to three washes in 5 ml of PBS, after which coverslips containing immunostained cells were mounted onto glass slides in 6 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% N-propyl gallate and 80% glycerol and analyzed using a Nikon TE2000-U fluorescence microscope and SPOT software (Nikon, Melville, NY). In Vivo Radiolabeling of Lipids and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—[3H]Inositol labeling of lipids in t-s strains of S. cerevisiae was performed as detailed in Ref. 19Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. For [3H]inositol labeling of GPIs in the smp3::KanR/pGAL-ScSMP3-HA, smp3::KanR/pGAL-hSMP3-HA, and gpi13::KanR/pGAL-GPI13 backgrounds, cultures were grown in SGlyYE medium, then shifted to SGlcYE or SGalYE medium for 16 h and labeled with [3H]inositol for 2 h as described previously (19Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because smp3::KanR/pGAL-hSMP3-HA does not grow well in SGlyYE medium, SGalYE medium was used in its place. To radiolabel lipids of smp3-2/gpi13-pGAL-GPI13 harboring p425-ScSMP3 or p425-PGK-hSMP3-HA, cells were grown in SGlyYE medium at 25 °C, then shifted to SGlc medium for 16 h at 25 °C to repress GPI13. Cells were then maintained at 25 °C or shifted to 37 °C for 25 min to arrest smp3-2 before labeling with 15 μCi of [3H]inositol for 2 h. For in vivo labeling of GPI lipids in HeLa cells, ∼0.5–1 × 107 transfected cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 10 μg of tunicamycin/ml, and 100 μg of glucose/ml. [3H]Mannose was added to 25 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS and released from culture plates by incubation in 1 mm EDTA containing 0.25% trypsin at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were pelleted and washed with 10 ml of PBS. Radiolabeled lipids were extracted from both yeast and mammalian cells in chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3, v/v/v) and partitioned in 1-butanol as described previously (19Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled lipids were analyzed by separation on silica 60 TLC plates (EM Science, Darmstadt, Germany). TLC plates were pre-run in solvent A (chloroform:methanol: water, 65:25:4, v/v/v), after which lipids were separated in solvent B (chloroform:methanol:water, 10:10:2.5, v/v/v), solvent C (chloroform: methanol:water, 10:10:2.75, v/v/v), or solvent D (chloroform:methanol: water, 10:10:3, v/v/v). TLC-separated lipids were visualized by fluorography using a BioMax Transcreen LE intensifier screen and BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak) for 4–6 days. Enzyme Treatment of Human GPI Intermediates—[3H]Mannose-labeled GPI mannolipids were treated with PI-phospholipase C as described previously (19Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with 10 units of jack bean α-mannosidase (JBαM; Sigma) for 20 h at 37 °C in 3 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 Substitute (Sigma), or in 10% fetal bovine serum as a source of GPI-phospholipase D at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 Substitute. After enzyme treatment, lipids were partitioned in 1-butanol prior to TLC separation. To TLC purify H8 and M4A, [3H]mannose-labeled lipids from ∼2 × 108 HeLa cells transiently expressing hSMP3 were separated by TLC in solvent C. Silica from regions of the plate containing H8 and M4A was scraped into chromatography columns and the lipids eluted by sequential passage of 5 ml of solvent C, 5 ml of chloroform:methanol:water (10:20:7, v/v/v), and 5 ml of methanol:pyridine:water (2:1:1, v/v/v) through the silica. Eluted lipids were dried and treated with JBαM as described above. Northern Analysis—PCR was used to amplify a 429-bp probe spanning bases 74–503 of the human hSMP3 cDNA. To radiolabel the probe, 100 ng of the product was used as template in a second PCR containing a 1 μm concentration of each primer, 50 μm each dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.5 μm dATP, 10 pmol [α-32P]dATP, and 1 unit of platinum Pfx DNA polymerase. Thermocycling consisted of incubation at 94 °C for 30 s followed by 15 rounds of successive incubations at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min, then a final incubation at 68 °C for 5 min. Radio-labeled probe was purified by passage through a ChromaSpin column (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A multiple human tissue mRNA blot (BD Biosciences) was prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in 10 ml of ExpressHyb (Clontech) containing 1 mg of denatured salmon testes DNA (Sigma). Labeled probe was mixed with 30 μg of Cot-1 DNA (Roche Applied Science), 150 μg of denatured salmon testes DNA, and 50 μlof20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0). This mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, at 68 °C for 30 min, and then added to the blot. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C followed by five 20-min washes at 65 °C with 200 ml of 2× SSC containing 1.0% SDS and two 20-min washes at 55 °C with 200 ml of 0.1× SSC, containing 0.5% SDS. Hybridized probe was quantitated using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Identification and Cloning Human SMP3—We reasoned that the protein responsible for Man-4 addition to human GPIs might resemble the fourth GPI mannosyltransferase of S. cerevisiae, Smp3p. Locus 80235 of human chromosome 3 encodes a predicted 579-amino acid protein (FLJ12769) that has been grouped into a family of dolichol phosphate mannose-utilizing mannosyltransferase sequences by its homology with the asparagine glycosylation pathway mannosyltransferases Alg9p and Alg12p and the GPI mannosyltransferases PIG-Bp and S. cerevisiae Smp3p (23Grimme S.J.

Mollicone R. Codogno P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Human FLJ12769 contains a HQEXRF amino acid motif that is characteristic of the SMP3 group within this sequence family. Additionally, it exhibits 30% identity and 56% similarity to S. cerevisiae Smp3p and 26% identity and 50% similarity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Smp3p, thus making it a plausible candidate human GPI fourth mannosyltransferase. We refer to this protein as hSmp3p in this study. Because Man-4 has been identified on the GPIs of two purified brain proteins (6Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Anand R. Williams A.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 26Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), we used a human brain cDNA library as template for PCR amplification of a hSMP3 cDNA for cloning. The deduced protein sequence of the cloned hSMP3 cDNA was identical to that of FLJ12769. Human SMP3 Complements the Growth Defects of Yeast smp3 Mutants—Haploid S. cerevisiae cells harboring a deleted smp3 locus are inviable (23Grimme S.J. Westfall B.A. Wiedman J.M. Taron C.H. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27731-27739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether hSMP3 functions similarly to ScSMP3, we tested its ability to restore viability to a yeast smp3 null mutant. A hSMP3 cDNA was expressed from the S. cerevisiae GAL10 promoter (pGAL-hSMP3) in a heterozygous SMP3/smp3::KanR diploid strain. Diploid cells were sporulated, and complementation was assessed via tetrad analysis. Asci from diploids harboring pGAL-hSMP3 gave rise to four viable haploid progeny (Fig. 1A). Additionally, two haploids from each tetrad were resistant to G418 and sensitive to 5-fluoroorotic acid, indicating that they harbored the smp3::KanR allele and that their viability was dependent upon the complementing URA3-containing pGAL-hSMP3 plasmid (Fig. 1B). Expression of hSMP3 also restored viability to a temperature-sensitive (t-s) smp3 mutant S. cerevisiae strain at nonpermissive temperature (data not shown) and a haploid strain of the fission yeast S. pombe harboring a lethal smp3 null mutation. 2B. A. Taron, P. A. Colussi, and C. H. Taron, manuscript in preparation. However, hSMP3 did not restore viability to S. cerevisiae cells harboring lethal null mutations in YJR013w or GPI10, genes encoding mannosyltransferases that add Man-1 (37Maeda Y. Watanabe R.

https://openalex.org/W2088649765,"Based on previous in vitro studies that have illustrated prevention of ethanol-induced cell death by antioxidants, using an in vivo model, we have tested the anti-teratogenic potential of a potent synthetic superoxide dismutase plus catalase mimetic, EUK-134. The developing limb of C57BL/6J mice, which is sensitive to ethanol-induced reduction defects, served as the model system. On their ninth day of pregnancy, C57BL/6J mice were administered ethanol (two intraperitoneal doses of 2.9 g/kg given 4 h apart) alone or in combination with EUK-134 (two doses of 10 mg/kg). Pregnant control mice were similarly treated with either vehicle or EUK-134, alone. Within 15 h of the initial ethanol exposure, excessive apoptotic cell death was observed in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the newly forming forelimb buds. Forelimb defects, including postaxial ectrodactyly, metacarpal, and ulnar deficiencies, occurred in 67.3% of the ethanol-exposed fetuses that were examined at 18 days of gestation. The right forelimbs were preferentially affected. No limb malformations were observed in control fetuses. Cell death in the AER of embryos concurrently exposed to ethanol and EUK-134 was notably reduced compared with that in embryos from ethanol-treated dams. Additionally, the antioxidant treatment reduced the incidence of forelimb malformations to 35.9%. This work illustrates that antioxidants can significantly improve the adverse developmental outcome that results from ethanol exposure in utero, diminishing the incidence and severity of major malformations that result from exposure to this important human teratogen."

Extensive investigation has revealed that this complex participates in multiple biological processes, including protein synthesis and vesicle/protein targeting to the plasma membrane. In this article we report that the exocyst may also play a role in modulating microtubule dynamics. Using monoclonal antibodies, we observed that endogenous exocyst subunits co-localized with microtubules and mitotic spindles in normal rat kidney cells. To test for a functional relationship between the exocyst complex and microtubules, we established an in vitro exocyst reconstitution assay and studied exocyst effect on microtubule dynamics. We found that the exocyst complex reconstituted from eight recombinant exocyst subunits inhibited tubulin polymerization in vitro. Deletion of exocyst subunit sec5, sec6, sec15, or exo70 diminished its tubulin polymerization inhibition activity. Surprisingly, exocyst subunit exo70 itself was also capable of inhibiting tubulin polymerization, although exocyst complex with exo70 deletion did not lose its activity completely. Overexpression of exo70 in NRK cells resulted in microtubule network disruption and the formation of filopodia-like plasma membrane protrusions.

The exocyst is a multisubunit complex first discovered for its requirement in the secretory pathway in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. J.

Temperature-sensitive mutations in any of its eight subunits sec3, sec5, sec6, sec8, sec10, sec15, exo70, and exo84, resulted in defective secretion and polarized growth with concomitant accumulation of intracellular secretory vesicles under non-permissive temperature (1Novick P.

The role of this complex in mammals and other multicellular organisms has been mostly studied through perturbation of its function in whole organisms and tissue culture cells. At the level of organism, knockout of exocyst subunits sec8 or sec10 resulted in early embryonic lethality (10Friedrich G.A. Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Likewise, in the neuronal system, disruption of the exocyst function by exocyst subunit sec10 C-terminal deletion mutant overexpression and exocyst subunit sec5 knockout inhibited neurite outgrowth in neuroendocrine PC12 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons, respectively (11Murthy M. Garza D. Scheller R.H. Schwarz T.L. Neuron. 2003; 37: 433-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the exocyst subunit sec8 has been shown to play a role in targeting the NMDA glutamate neurotransmitter receptor to the plasma membrane via its association with the PDZ-binding protein SAP102 in cultured hippocampal neurons (17Sans N. Prybylowski K. Petralia R.S. Chang K. Wang Y.X. Racca C. Vicini S. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 6: 520-530Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Finally, the exocyst has also been shown to promote protein translation and filopodia formation (18Lipschutz J.H. Lingappa V.R. Mostov K.E. J. Biol.

The involvement of exocyst in multiple cellular processes may explain, in part, the early lethality of exocyst mutants during development.The indispensability of exocyst function during development has prompted extensive investigation into the molecular associations and biochemical mechanisms of its function. Currently, the exocyst has been found to associate, either directly or indirectly, with various cellular structures. These multiple associations may be partly responsible for the various functions associated with the exocyst complex in different cell types. In epithelial and mucosal LLC-PK1, MDCK, Caco-2 cell lines, exocyst subunits have been found to coimmunoprecipitate and co-migrate on density gradients with a subset of Golgi-derived vesicles and the plasma membrane fraction (13Grindstaff K.K.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, in MDCK type II cells, exocyst subunit sec10 also coimmunoprecipitated with the sec61b component of the endoplasmic reticulum translocon (18Lipschutz J.H. Lingappa V.R. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20954-20960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, in neuroendocrine PC12 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons, we found exocyst subunits coimmunoprecipitated and co-migrated with tubulin (16Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of exocyst subunits in PC12 cells was dependent on microtubule integrity. These observations in PC12 cells led us to hypothesize that exocyst function may involve modulating microtubules. In this article, we tested this hypothesis by examining the in vivo co-localization of exocyst subunits with microtubules and investigating the effect of exocyst on microtubule polymerization dynamics.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—NRK cells were cultured at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 on culture dishes coated with 0.1 mg/ml polylysine for transfection and immunocytochemistry experiments. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Cell Transfection—For exocyst subunit overexpression studies, exo70 and exo84 cDNAs subcloned into GFP-C3 vector (Clontech; Palo Alto CA) were used. The resulting constructs were amplified in Escherichia coli bacteria and purified using Qiagen midi-prep kit (Qiagen; Valencia CA). These constructs were then transfected into NRK cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described for PC12 cells (16Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transfected for 2 h. At 1 h following transfection, cells were treated with 0, 2, or 20 μm taxol for 18–24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The treated cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and mounted for GFP fluorescence visualization using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Triton X-100 permeabilization prior to mounting improved the preservation of plasma membrane protrusions in NRK cells but did not alter the intracellular distribution of GFP-exo70 or GFP-exo84.Exocyst Complex Reconstitution—For recombinant exocyst subunit protein production, exocyst subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the bacterial expression pGEX vector. Recombinant exocyst subunits were produced as GST fusion proteins in E. coli bacteria (21Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). These recombinant proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-coupled beads and eluting from those beads by thrombin cleavage in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Reconstitution of the exocyst complex was carried out by mixing equal molar concentration of each subunit at 4 °C for 1–4 h, followed by another hour of incubation at room temperature. The reconstituted exocyst complex was then stored at 4 °C and used for immunoprecipitation or activity assay within 24 h.For immunoprecipitation, anti-sec8 monoclonal antibody 8S2E12 or nonspecific mouse immunoglobulin was coupled to protein-A beads at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml using the cross-linker dimethylpimelimidate as previously described (22Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Recombinant exocyst subunits were incubated with antibody-coupled protein A beads overnight at 4 °C. Next day, the beads were washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, and proteins bound to beads were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining.Tubulin Polymerization Assay Using MAP-enriched Tubulin Preparation—To test the effect of exocyst complex and subunits on microtubule polymerization, 0.1–0.3 μm of reconstituted exocyst complex or exocyst subunits and 13.5 μm of MAP-rich tubulin preparation (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) were mixed in a final buffer condition containing 35 mm MOPS, 7 mm Tris, 33 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, 1mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4 and 10% glycerol, pH 7.0. 1 mm of GTP was added to the mixture to initiate tubulin polymerization. For the intact exocyst, exocyst single subunit deletion, and single exocyst subunit studies, exocyst was incubated with tubulin at 4 °C for 1 h prior to the addition of GTP. The extent of tubulin polymerization at 25 °C was examined at 1 h after the initiation of tubulin polymerization by negative staining transmission electron microscopy.Tubulin Polymerization Assay Using Purified Tubulin Preparation—25 μm purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was incubated with 1 μm purified exo70 or exo84 at 4 °C for 1 h in a final buffer condition containing 50 mm MOPS, 1.5 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl,1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.0. 1 mm of GTP and 2 μm taxol were then added to the mixture to initiate tubulin polymerization at 25 °C. The presence of low concentration of taxol accelerated microtubule formation but did not abolish exo70 effect on tubulin polymerization. Three assays were used to monitor the effect of exo70 on tubulin polymerization: optical scattering at 340 nm, electron microscopy, and SDS-PAGE of microtubules harvested by centrifugation. The time course of tubulin polymerization was monitored by optical scattering measurement at 340 nm using a Beckman Genesis 5 spectrophotometer. Increased microtubule formation is indicated by an increase in A340. The structure of formed microtubules was examined by negative staining transmission electron microscopy. The amount of microtubules formed was also collected at various time intervals after the initiation of polymerization by centrifugation at 18,000 × g in a Beckman microfuge R centrifuge. Pelleted microtubules were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Negative Staining Transmission Electron Microscopy—To visualize microtubules following exocyst activity assay, the tubulin/exocyst mixture was adsorbed onto formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids (EMS, Fort Washington, PA) for 1 min. The grids were then stained with 1% uranyl acetate for another minute and air-dried for 30 min before visualization at Rutgers electron microscopy facility. All procedures were carried out at room temperature. The extent of tubulin polymerization was assessed by quantitating the amount of microtubules in each electron micrograph using the Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software. This program reverses the dark/light images in the micrographs (so microtubules would appear as bright filaments against a dark background) and estimates the relative quantity of microtubules in the micrograph by luminosity. Micrographs of blank electron microscopy grids subjected to the same negative staining procedure was used as the reference background luminosity. The final luminosity was determined by subtracting the reference background luminosity from the sample luminosity. The amount of tubulin polymerization occurred in the presence of equal protein concentration of BSA was assigned to be 100% maximal tubulin polymerization for all our analyses. The extent of tubulin polymerization taking place in the presence of exocyst was assessed by comparing against this 100% maximal tubulin polymerization control.Immunocytochemistry—Monoclonal antibodies against exocyst subunits sec8, exo84, and exo70 were generated using soluble recombinant exocyst subunits as described (16Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang S. Hsu S.C. Hybridoma and Hybridomics. 2003; 22: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against tubulin were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. To monitor exocyst subcellular localization, NRK cells were fixed with methanol at room temperature or 37 °C for 1 min. We found that this fixation condition is optimal for preserving microtubule integrity and exocyst antibody reactivity in NRK cells. The fixed cells were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline solution for 30 min and permeabilized with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 0. 5% Triton X-100. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-sheep (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) antibodies were then used as secondary antibodies. DNA was labeled by Hoechst dye (Sigma). Labeled cells were visualized by inverted fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200; Zeiss).To monitor exocyst localization following nocodazole and cytochalasin D treatment, NRK cells were incubated in the presence of 20 μm nocodazole or 10 μm cytochalasin D for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before being subjected to immunostaining.Western Blot—PC12 and NRK cells were lysed and scraped off the culture plates in protein sample buffer containing 5% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The resulting cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis as described (16Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSExocyst Subunits Exhibit Filamentous Subcellular Distribution That Co-localizes with Microtubules and Mitotic Spindles—To begin investigating a functional relationship between the exocyst complex and microtubules, we studied the in vivo co-localization of endogenous exocyst subunits and microtubules in NRK cells. These cells are large and flat, and are thus ideal for intracellular protein localization studies. The localization of three endogenous exocyst subunits, sec8, exo70, and exo84, was detected by their respective monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1, B, D, and G show that exocyst subunits sec8, exo70, and exo84 exhibited an apparent filamentous distribution. Co-staining of NRK cells with both anti-exocyst and anti-tubulin antibodies revealed that exocyst subunits co-localized with microtubules (Fig. 1, E, F, H, and I). In some cells, exocyst-containing filaments could be seen emanating with microtubules from a perinuclear region, possibly the microtubule-organizing center, toward the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, B, G, H, and I; arrows). This similar intracellular distribution of multiple exocyst subunits and their co-localization with microtubules bring up the possibility that the entire exocyst complex may co-localize with microtubules. In addition, it is also interesting to note that in NRK cells undergoing cell division, exocyst co-localized with mitotic spindles composed of microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins in metaphase and anaphase (Fig. 1, B and D–I). This co-localization indicates that exocyst can associate, either directly or indirectly, with microtubules in the absence of secretory vesicles.The observed exocyst co-localization with microtubules was not caused by fluorophore bleed-through because we still detected similar exocyst distribution in NRK cells stained with only anti-exocyst subunit antibodies (Fig. 1B). The staining pattern was also not likely an artifact of our fixation procedure. We have observed similar exocyst subunit localization with methanol fixation time ranging from 1–6 min (Data not shown). Using the same fixation condition, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a cytosolic glycolytic enzyme, displayed an expected diffuse cytosolic distribution (Fig. 1C). In addition, these monoclonal antibodies are specific for their respective antigens as assayed by Western blot, ELISA, and immunostaining of overexpressed exocyst subunits in NRK cells (Fig. 5A). Very little or no sec8, exo70, or exo84 staining was observed at the plasma membrane or Golgi apparatus as previously observed with other cell types. It is interesting to note that anti-exo70 and anti-exo84 antibodies used in this study localized these exocyst subunits to a perinuclear enrichment near or at the microtubule-organizing center (16Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in PC12 cells. This difference in localization may be due to, at least in part, different exocyst association and/or regulation in various cell types (13Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is also possible that the anti-exocyst subunit monoclonal antibodies we have used in this study recognize only a subpopulation of exocyst complex in the cell that associate with microtubules.Fig. 5Effect of exo70 on polymerization of purified tubulin. 25 μm purified tubulin was allowed to polymerized in the presence of 1 μm exo70 or of a control protein, exocyst subunit exo84. In A, the time course of tubulin polymerization in the presence of exo70 (open circles) or of exo84 (filled square) was monitored by optical scattering at 340 nm. Error bar represents S.D. in each category. n is four assays. In B, tubulin samples collected at 20 min after polymerization in the presence of exo70 (+exo70) or exo84 (+exo84) were examined by electron microscopy at two magnifications. Bar in panel i = 1 μm for both panels i and iii. Bar in panel ii = 0.1 μm for both panels ii and iv. In C, microtubules formed in the presence of exo70 (+exo70) and exo84 (+exo84) at 0, 20, and 90 min intervals were harvested by centrifugation. Pelleted microtubules were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, pharmacological studies, consistent with the above cell biological observations, showed that exocyst localization is dependent on microtubule, but not actin filament, integrity (Fig. 1, J–O). The filamentous distribution of both exo70 and microtubules was greatly disturbed by the microtubule-disrupting drug nocodazole (Fig. 1, J–L). Similar disruption was also observed with sec8 and exo84 (data not shown). The actin-disrupting drug cytochalasin D, on the other hand, caused actin filaments to aggregate into multiple foci but did not abolish the exocyst filamentous staining (Fig. 1, M–O). The slight distortion of exocyst distribution was most likely caused by the deformation of cytoplasm brought about by actin filament disruption. Taken together, the in vivo co-localization of exocyst subunits with microtubules, the dependence of their localization on microtubule integrity and the previous finding that exocyst and tubulin coimmunoprecipitated in vitro (16Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bring up the possibility that the exocyst complex may play a role in modulating microtubule dynamics.The Reconstituted Exocyst Complex Can Inhibit Tubulin Polymerization in Vitro—To investigate this hypothesis, we have established an in vitro assay to reconstitute the mammalian exocyst complex from eight recombinant exocyst subunits. Fig. 2A shows recombinant exocyst subunits: sec8, sec3, sec5, sec5, sec15, exo70, exo84, and sec10, purified from E. coli bacteria lysates (lanes sec8 to sec10). All subunits, with the exception of sec15, could be purified as intact proteins with molecular weights similar to that observed for rat brain exocyst subunits. The recombinant sec15 subunit was ∼5 kDa smaller than the brain sec15 protein (data not shown). This subunit was very susceptible to degradation during the removal of GST tag from the GST-sec15 fusion protein by thrombin digestion.Fig. 2The reconstituted exocyst complex can prevent tubulin polymerization in vitro.A, purified recombinant exocyst subunits were visualized by Coomassie Blue-stained 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. B, purified exocyst subunits were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, and complex formation was examined by subjecting the mixed subunits to immunoprecipitation with anti-sec8 antibodies non-covalently bound to protein A beads (exo) or to anti-sec8 antibodies covalently linked to protein A beads (x-α-sec8). Three controls were carried out. First, mixed exocyst subunits without sec8 were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-sec8 antibody (exo-sec8). Second, the recombinant sec8 by itself was subjected to immunoprecipitation by non-cross-linked anti-sec8 antibody (sec8). Third, the reconstituted exocyst complex was subjected to immunoprecipitation by nonspecific immunoglobulin (Ig+exo). Protein bands corresponding to immunoprecipitated recombinant sec8 and the sec8 antibody heavy chains were noted as sec8 and IgG, respectively. C, reconstituted exocyst complex was assayed for its effect on tubulin polymerization. 13.5 μm MAP-rich tubulin was incubated with 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 μm of reconstituted exocyst for 30 min before being allowed to polymerize for 1 h at room temperature. As control, an aliquot of tubulin preparation was also incubated with 0.3 μm BSA in the same buffer.

This antibody has been shown to immunoprecipitate intact exocyst complex from brain lysate (6Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It can also immunoprecipitate the recombinant sec8 alone (Fig. 2B, lane sec8). We found that the anti-sec8 antibody, either covalently cross-linked (lane exo(x-α-sec8)) or non-covalently bound (lane exo) to protein A beads, coimmunoprecipitated all eight exocyst subunits (Figs. 2B and 3A). This immunoprecipitation was specific because nonspecific immunoglobulin did not immunoprecipitate any exocyst subunit (Fig. 2B, Ig+exo). In addition, the anti-sec8 antibody did not immunoprecipitate other exocyst subunits in the absence of sec8 subunit (Fig. 2B, exo-sec8). The coimmunoprecipitation of eight exocyst subunits by anti-sec8 antibodies indicates that recombinant exocyst subunits can form the exocyst complex in vitro.Fig. 3Exocyst subunits have differential effects on tubulin polymerization. Exocyst complexes with single subunit omission were reconstituted by mixing seven exocyst subunits in a 1:1 molar ratio. The formation of the complex was tested by immunoprecipitation with anti-sec8 antibody. The precipitated complex was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.

Here, we describe an approach to characterize drug function based on statistical analysis of protein expression datasets from multiple primary human cell-based models of inflammatory disease. This approach, termed Biologically Multiplexed Activity Profiling (BioMAP), provides rapid characterization of drug function, including mechanism of action, secondary or off-target activities, and insights into clinical phenomena. Using three model systems containing primary human endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in different environments relevant to vascular inflammation and immune activation, we show that BioMAP profiles detect and discriminate multiple functional drug classes, including glucocorticoids; TNF-alpha antagonists; and inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, calcineurin, IMPDH, PDE4, PI-3 kinase, hsp90, and p38 MAPK, among others. The ability of cholesterol lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to improve outcomes in rheumatic disease patients correlates with the activities of these compounds in our BioMAP assays. In addition, the activity profiles identified for the immunosuppressants mycophenolic acid, cyclosporin A, and FK-506 provide a potential explanation for a reduced incidence of posttransplant cardiovascular disease in patients receiving mycophenolic acid. BioMAP profiling can allow integration of meaningful human biology into drug development programs."

Mammalian homologues of Toll, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are thought to function only in host defense. Here, we report that mice harboring mutations in TLR4 or in CD14, a co-receptor for TLR4, have an ""ideal"" body plan consisting of increased bone mineral content, density, and size as well as decreased body fat. These mutant mice live long lives, have normal activity and fertility, and show no evidence of infection. Unlike many strains of caged wild-type mice, they do not become obese. Although all mice continue to gain body fat, bone content, and overall weight, the difference in bone content and body fat between mutant and wild-type mice increases with age. Thus, defects in TLR4/CD14 complex generate an ""Adonis"" phenotype, characterized by this ideal body type, and this function could potentially be exploited for the treatment of osteoporosis and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2153584160,"Mutations in the gene coding for the ubiquitous, anti-oxidant enzyme Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), a fatal disease characterized by selective loss of motor neurons. Expression of a mutant SOD1 typical of fALS patients restricted to either motor neurons or astrocytes is insufficient to generate a pathological phenotype in mouse models, suggesting that a deleterious interplay between different cell types is necessary for the pathogenesis of the disease. In this study, we demonstrate the actual role of a functional cross-talk between glial and neuronal cells expressing fALS mutant G93A-SOD1, where an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species occurs. We show that human glioblastoma cells expressing G93A-SOD1 induce activation of caspase-1, release of cytokines, and activation of apoptotic pathways in cocultured human neuroblastoma cells also expressing G93A-SOD1. Activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3 is observed also in neuroblastoma lines expressing other fALS-SOD1s (G37R, G85R, and I113T) cocultured with glioblastoma lines expressing the corresponding mutant enzymes. These effects are consequent to activation of inflammatory processes in G93A-glioblastoma cells stimulated by cocultured G93A-neuroblastoma. Furthermore, selective death of embryonal spinal motor neurons from G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice is induced by coculture with G93A-glioblastoma and prevented by inhibition of NO synthase. Proinflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma, and nitric oxide are among the molecular signals exchanged between glial and neuronal cells that generate a functional interplay between the two cell types. This cross-talk may be crucial for the pathogenesis of SOD1-linked fALS but also for the more common sporadic form of the disease, where markers of increased oxidative stress and of glial activation have been found."

We report that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) constitutively associates with the prototypic integrin αIIbβ3 in platelets and in cell lines overexpressing the integrin. PP1c binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin αIIb subunit containing a conserved PP1c binding motif 989KVGF992.

These studies reveal a previously unrecognized role for integrins whereby the α subunit cytoplasmic tail localizes the machinery for initiating and temporally maintaining the regulatory signaling activity of a phosphatase. Integrin signaling mediated by reversible phosphorylation of proteins controls fundamental cellular processes like adhesion and migration. The prototypic integrin, platelet αIIbβ3, undergoes affinity/avidity modulation for its ligands through the process of inside-out signaling, resulting in firm adhesion and platelet aggregation upon vascular injury. Subsequent binding of fibrinogen to integrin αIIbβ3 generates outside-in signaling (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both αIIbβ3 inside-out and outside-in signaling result in tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins, serving to initiate and amplify signaling cascades that support the formation of stable platelet-platelet and platelet-extracellular matrix interactions. Cytoskeletal proteins like talin (2Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A.

The net tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation of a protein substrate is regulated by the activities of both protein kinases and phosphatases. While kinases and phosphorylation events during integrin mediated signaling have been clearly demonstrated, the role for phosphatases is poorly understood. Phosphatases play an essential role in dampening platelet phosphorylation events, and serine/threonine dephosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins like cofilin, talin, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein correlates with platelet activation (7Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Murata K. Sakon M. Kambayashi J. Okuyama M. Hase T. Mori T. J. Cell.

Unlike the situation with kinases, only serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A has been reported to associate with integrin β1 (10Pankov R. Cukierman E. Clark K. Matsumoto K. Hahn C. Poulin B. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18671-18681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), while only tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is known to associate with β3 (11Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 9: 1824-1833Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We are unaware of any reports of a phosphatase associating with an integrin α subunit. PP1 is the best characterized and major serine/threonine protein phosphatase. The catalytic subunit of PP1 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP1c, catalytic subunit of PP1; MLC, myosin light chain; ppMLC, diphosphorylated MLC; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP1c, catalytic subunit of PP1; MLC, myosin light chain; ppMLC, diphosphorylated MLC; BSA, bovine serum albumin. (PP1c) does not exist freely in the cell but associates with a host of regulatory polypeptides to form distinct multimeric holoenzymes. This association targets PP1c to a specific subcellular location and affects its activity and substrate specificity via allosteric modulation (12Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different isoforms of PP1 (PP1α, PP1β, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2) exhibit ∼90% similarity in amino acid sequence and have similar catalytic rates, substrate specificities, and inhibition profiles in vitro, suggesting a predominant role for the regulatory subunit in determining the specificity and the diversity of PP1 function. PP1c binds to its regulatory polypeptide via a conserved PP1c binding motif K/RVXF, although interactions independent of this motif have also been reported (12Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have studied the prototypic integrin (αIIbβ3), and our data demonstrate for the first time the specific association of PP1c with integrin αIIb and that ligand occupancy can initiate transient dephosphorylation events. Platelet Aggregation and Adhesion—Blood was drawn in an acid/citrate/dextrose anticoagulant from normal, healthy, and fasting donors and washed platelets prepared as described (13Vijayan K.V. Liu Y. Dong J.F. Bray P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 200-μl aliquots from 2 × 108 platelets/ml were allowed to aggregate using 0.5 and 1 unit/ml thrombin in a Biodata aggregation profiler as described (14Michelson A.D. Furman M.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Mascelli M.A. Hendrix C. Coleman L. Hamlington J. Barnard M.R. Kickler T. Christie D.J. Kundu S. Bray P.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In some experiments 10 nm integrelin, 250 nm okadaic acid, or 1% Me2SO was added prior to thrombin addition. The reaction was stopped after 2 min by adding SDS sample buffer or 1% Triton X-100 and samples analyzed for myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation or immunoprecipitation as described. In some experiments, fibrinogen or BSA-coated dishes were incubated with 2 × 108 platelets for 45 min at 37 °C. The fibrinogen-bound platelets and the nonadherent platelets from BSA-coated plates were lysed using Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—800 μg/ml platelet lysates from the above experiments or 1% Triton X-100 platelet lysates obtained from ∼3 × 108 resting platelets were immunoprecipitated using 3 μg of anti-αIIb (SEW-8) (gift from Dr. Newman, Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI) or anti-PP1c (Fl-18) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit IgG (Pierce) and protein G-Sepha-rose. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with monoclonal antibodies to αIIb (132.1) or PP1c (E-9, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or Gp1bα (WM23), and developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The signals were scanned using Photoshop Version 6 software, and densitometric quantification was performed using NIH Image software (Scion Image Beta Version 4.02, Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Interaction of PP1c with Integrin αIIbβ3—Integrin αIIbβ3 was purified from outdated human platelets as described by Shock and Parise (15Shock D.D. Parise L.V. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 249-253Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Silver staining and Western blotting with anti-αIIb (132.1) and anti-β3 (AP3) monoclonal antibodies confirmed the purity of the sample. Five biotinylated 11-amino acid peptides corresponding to residues 985-995 of integrin αIIb were synthesized for these studies: wild type αIIb (LAMWKVGFFKR), a control with scrambled sequence (LWKRVAGPFKM), and peptides with alanine substitutions at 989, 990, and 992 (Protein Sequencing Core Facility, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). 25-50 μg/ml peptide was mixed with 1-2 μg/ml purified PP1c or 750 μg/ml platelet lysates and precipitated using streptavidin-agarose beads. The beads were washed three times and bound proteins eluted using SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with anti PP1c (E-9), and signals detected using ECL. Phosphatase Activity of αIIb-bound PP1c—Varying concentrations of αIIb peptide (25, 5, and 1 μg/ml) or control peptide (25 μg/ml) were incubated with purified and active 0.1 unit of PP1c (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 16 h at 4 °C. MLC in lysates obtained from integrelin-blocked and thrombin-stimulated 3 × 108 platelets served as a substrate for PP1. Phosphatase reaction was carried out by mixing the peptide/PP1c mixture with the platelet lysate at 30 °C for 2 h. Following termination of the reaction, lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with ppMLC antibody (gift from Dr. James Staddon, Eisai London Research, London). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-MLC antibody to assess equivalency of total MLC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Constitutive Association of PP1c with the Integrin αIIbβ3—We were struck by the 989KVGF992 sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of integrin αIIb, which matches the consensus-binding motif for PP1c, and tested the association of PP1c with the integrin complex. Immunoblots of αIIb immunoprecipitates from resting human platelets detected the PP1c protein (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with two different αIIb monoclonal antibodies Tab and 132.1 and a second polyclonal antibody H-160 (not shown). Association of PP1c with the integrin αIIb subunit was confirmed by a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment, wherein αIIb was detected in a PP1c immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1B). Another major platelet receptor GPIbα was not detected in the PP1c immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1B). Moreover, this association was also observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing αIIbβ3 (Fig. 1A), indicating that the PP1c-integrin αIIbβ3 association is constitutive in nature and intrinsic to integrin αIIbβ3. To ascertain whether there was a direct interaction of PP1c with integrin αIIbβ, we examined the binding of a purified polyhistidine-tagged PP1c protein with the biotinylated integrin cytoplasmic peptides. Purified PP1c and PP1c from the resting platelet lysates bound specifically to a biotinylated αIIb peptide containing the KVGF motif but not to a control peptide with scrambled sequence (Fig. 1C). Compared with PP1c from platelet lysates, purified recombinant PP1c migrated at a slightly larger than 36 kDa due to the polyhistidine modification. Mutating Lys989, Val990, and Phe992 to alanine abolished the ability of the αIIb peptide to support PP1c binding (Fig. 1D). Thus, the PP1c binding KVXF motif appears to mediate the direct interaction of PP1c with the integrin complex. Although over 50 polypeptides are known to bind directly or indirectly to PP1c, this is the first example describing an interaction of PP1c with any cell adhesion receptor. αIIbβ3-Fibrinogen Interaction Results in PP1c Dissociation—We next asked whether the association of αIIbβ3 with PP1c is altered upon integrin activation and ligand engagement. Platelet aggregation serves as a convenient test system for this issue, since agonist stimulation activates the integrin, enabling it to bind fibrinogen. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation caused dissociation of PP1c from the integrin complex (Fig. 2A). Blockade of integrin-fibrinogen engagement with integrelin repressed the dissociation of PP1c from the integrin (Fig. 2B). Although the association and dissociation results may appear modest, its consequence on signaling is not (see below in Fig. 3). While these results suggest that the αIIbβ3-fibrinogen interaction regulates the dissociation of PP1c from the integrin, it is conceivable that thrombin signaling itself might have some role. We therefore examined PP1c association with the integrin following platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, an αIIbβ3-mediated event. Compared with platelets that were maintained in suspension over the BSA substrate, platelets that adhered to fibrinogen exhibited a dissociation of PP1c from the integrin αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results suggest that fibrinogen binding to the integrin αIIbβ3 and not direct thrombin signaling is sufficient for the dissociation of PP1c from αIIbβ3.Fig. 3αIIbβ3 engagement dephosphorylates PP1 substrate MLC.A, platelets were aggregated with the indicated concentrations of thrombin in the absence (No integrelin) or presence of 10 nm integrelin. The final percent platelet aggregation is indicated. Following the addition of SDS sample buffer lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted for diphosphorylated (Thr18 and Ser19) MLC (ppMLC) or MLC. B, platelets were treated with either Me2SO or 250 nm okadaic acid (OA) and aggregated using thrombin. Densitometric quantification of MLC phosphorylation (ratio of ppMLC to total MLC in arbitrary units) is shown. C, varying concentrations of αIIb (25, 5, and 1 μg/ml) or control peptide (C) (25 μg/ml) were mixed with purified and active PP1c. To assess PP1c phosphatase activity, platelet lysates were incubated with the peptide/PP1c mixture at 30 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with either ppMLC or MLC antibodies. In A-C, data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dissociated PP1c Is Active and Participates in Integrin-mediated Dephosphorylation Events—To address whether PP1c dissociation from αIIb modulates integrin signaling via subsequent dephosphorylation events, we probed the phosphorylation state of MLC, a PP1c substrate during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. When the dissociation of PP1c from αIIbβ3 is prevented using integrilin, robust phosphorylation of MLC was observed (Fig. 3A, left panel). In contrast, when fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 is allowed to proceed and PP1c dissociates from the integrin, MLC becomes dephosphorylated (Fig. 3A, right panel), implying activation of a PP1 phosphatase. Indeed, application of the PP1/PP2A phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, enhanced MLC phosphorylation during platelet aggregation (Fig. 3B). Thus, dissociation of PP1c from the integrin correlated with an increase in PP1 activity (decreased MLC phosphorylation). In contrast, blocking the dissociation of PP1c from the integrin with integrelin resulted in a decreased PP1 activity (increased MLC phosphorylation). These results suggested that compared with the dissociated or free PP1c, integrin-bound PP1c has less activity toward MLC. We tested this possibility by studying the in vitro phosphatase activity of purified and active PP1c in the presence of either the wild type αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide or the control scrambled peptide. The PP1c substrate was MLC in lysates obtained from integrelin-blocked and thrombin-stimulated platelets. Addition of the αIIb peptide to PP1c resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of PP1 activity, while the control scrambled peptide was inactive (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the association of PP1c with αIIbβ3 negatively modulates its activity to MLC but nevertheless provides a local high concentration of phosphatase for tonic dephosphorylation events upon integrin engagement. Engagement of signaling inhibitory receptors on platelets like platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 is known to dampen phosphorylation events via recruitment and activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (16Newman P.J. Newman D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Additionally, integrin αIIbβ3 engagement also activates tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by calpain cleavage and dephosphorylates tyrosine residues (17Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11927-11934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results support a model wherein PP1c is anchored to the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 under resting conditions. Addition of agonist results in integrin activation and protein phosphorylation, while binding of fibrinogen leads to PP1c release, activation, and transient dephosphorylation events. A similar concept has been previously described wherein PP1c interacts with the vitamin D receptor in a ligand independent manner, while PP1c activity increases in a ligand-dependent manner leading to dephosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (18Bettoun D.J. Buck D.W. Lu J. Khalifa B. Chin W.W. Nagpal S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24847-24850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). What is the significance of the PP1c-integrin association? PP1c-integrin association may ensure a localized concentration of phosphatase near the integrin tail that can be utilized for transient dephosphorylation events upon receptor engagement. We have yet to formally assess the stoichiometry of this association, but preliminary studies suggest that the majority of the αIIbβ3 molecules are not bound to PP1c. Nevertheless, our data show that this association regulates MLC phosphorylation, and others (19Nadal F. Levy-Toledano S. Grelac F. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22381-22384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Bugaud F. Nadal-Wollbold F. Levy-Toledano S. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M.

Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22381-22384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Jun-N kinase JNK (20Bugaud F. Nadal-Wollbold F. Levy-Toledano S. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3800-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) upon fibrinogen binding. More importantly, these transient dephosphorylation events are essential for platelet physiology because phosphatase inhibitors impair platelet aggregation, adhesion, and spreading to fibrinogen (21Mauco G. Artcanuthurry V. Pidard D. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Levy-Toledano S. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Lerea K.M. Cordero K.P. Sakariassen K.S. Kirk R.I. Fried V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, serine/threonine dephosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins like cofilin, talin, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein correlates with platelet activation (7Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Murata K. Sakon M. Kambayashi J. Okuyama M. Hase T. Mori T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Abel K. Mieskes G. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that PP1c could dephosphorylate (and thus activate) actin-depolymerizing protein like cofilin and promote efficient cytoskeletal reorganization that favors stronger αIIbβ3 adhesion by avidity modulation. Indeed in B lymphocytes, PP1c dephosphorylation events are proposed to be required for high avidity αLβ2 binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and α4 to vascular cell adhesion molecule (23Hedman H. Lundgren E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2295-2299PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hedman H. Lundgren E. Scand. J. Immunol. 1996; 44: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The rapid dephosphorylation of cofilin upon platelet activation and the association of PP1/PP2A with cofilin in human T lymphocytes also support this idea (25Ambach A. Saunus J. Konstandin M. Wesselborg S. Meuer S.C. Samstag Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3422-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Perhaps, in a resting integrin the physical proximity of integrin α and β tails may assist the αIIb-associated PP1c to maintain the serine/threonine residues on integrin β3 in a dephosphorylated state. PP1c bound to the regulatory peptide has a distinct substrate specificity such that the αIIb anchored PP1c may retain its activity against β3 but not MLC. Mutations or deletions in the GFFKR region result in constitutive integrin activation (26Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Besides the well documented role of KVGF sequences in forming a salt bridge between the α and β subunits, it is tempting to speculate that the PP1c anchorage via this motif may help maintain integrin αIIbβ3 in the resting state. Indeed, competition of the native PP1c binding site on integrin αIIb with an exogenous cell-permeable PP1c binding peptide KVGFFKR directly activates integrin αIIbβ3 (27Stephens G. O'Luanaigh N. Reilly D. Harriott P. Walker B. Fitzgerald D. Moran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20317-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, the association of PP1c with the integrin could affect the association of other integrin modulators like CIB or the more recently identified chloride channel protein ICIn (28Larkin D.

In summary, we report for the first time that PP1 associates with and is regulated by αIIbβ3 engagement in platelets. This functional relationship may extend to other family members of serine/threonine phosphatases and other integrins like α1, αL, and αX with the similar phosphatase binding motif, thereby regulating a variety of biological events."
https://openalex.org/W2104321055,"The ability to control the orientation, morphology, and electrophysiological characteristics of neurons in culture allows the construction of neural circuits with defined physiological properties. Using microfluidic protein deposition onto chemically modified glass, we achieve the controlled growth of Aplysia neurons on geometrical patterns of poly-L-lysine and collagen IV, surrounded by nonadhesive regions of bovine albumin. We investigate the parameters essential for forming functional neuronal networks, the morphology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology under engineered cell culture conditions. We demonstrate that not only the orientation of neurite extension but also the number of primary neurites originating from the cell soma, their length, and branching pattern depend on the spatial constraints presented by the size and shape of the adhesion region on the patterned substrate. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the support layer influence the electrical activity of the cultured neurons. Substrate-dependent changes in the amplitude and in the dynamic parameters of the action potential cause decreased spike broadening in patterned neurons, which reflects changes in the number or functioning of active membrane ion channels. In contrast to morphology and electrophysiology, the neuropeptide content, as determined by mass spectrometry of individual patterned neurons, is not affected by the growth on patterned surfaces. Our results suggest that the morphological and electrophysiological parameters of neurons can be predictably altered/engineered by modulation of the chemical, physical, and topographical features of culture substrates. We also demonstrate that a full suite of techniques is required for functional characterization of neurons on engineered substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2060400925,"Lysyl hydroxylase (LH, EC 1.14.11.4) is the enzyme catalyzing the formation of hydroxylysyl residues in collagens and other proteins with collagenous domains. Although lower species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, have only one LH orthologue, LH activity in higher species, such as human, rat, and mouse, is present in three molecules, LH1, LH2, and LH3, encoded by three different genes. In addition, LH2 is present in two alternatively spliced forms (LH2a, LH2b). To understand the functions of the four molecular forms of LH in vertebrates, we analyzed differences in the binding and hydroxylation of various collagenous peptides by the LH isoforms. Nine-amino acid-long synthetic peptides on Pepspot were used for the binding analysis and an activity assay to measure hydroxylation. Our data with 727 collagenous peptides indicated that a positive charge on the peptide and specific amino acid residues in close proximity to the lysyl residues in the collagenous sequences are the key factors promoting peptide binding to the LH isoforms. The data suggest that the LH binding site is not a deep hydrophobic pocket but is open and hydrophilic where acidic amino acids play an important role in the binding. The data do not indicate strict sequence specificity for the LH isoforms, but the data indicated that there was a clear preference for some sequences to be bound and hydroxylated by a certain isoform."

We have identified a novel NIK interacting protein, TNAP (for TRAFs and NIK-associated protein). In mammalian cells, TNAP physically interacts with NIK, TRAF2, and TRAF3 but not IKK1 or IKK2. TNAP specifically inhibits NF-κB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, TNF receptor 1, TRADD, RIP, TRAF2, and NIK but does not affect IKK1- and IKK2-mediated NF-κB activation. Knockdown of TNAP by lentiviral-mediated small interference RNA potentiates TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. TNAP suppresses NIK kinase activity and subsequently reduces p100 processing, p65 phosphorylation, and IκBα degradation. These data suggest that TNAP is a repressor of NIK activity and regulates both the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways.

The classical pathway involves most forms of NF-κB, especially the p65 (RelA)/p50 dimer. It is triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; CD40L, CD40 ligand; LT, lymphotoxin; IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain; RIP, receptor interacting protein; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcriptase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; CD40L, CD40 ligand; LT, lymphotoxin; IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain; RIP, receptor interacting protein; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcriptase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and CD40 ligand (CD40L) and to a lesser extent by lymphotoxin-β (LT-β) and B cell-activating factor. Activation of this pathway depends on the IκB kinase (IKK) signalsome, which consists of at least two catalytic subunits (IKK1 or IKK-α and IKK2 or IKK-β) and a regulatory subunit (IKK-γ or NEMO). The IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitor proteins of NF-κB (IκBs) to induce their ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and transcriptional activation of specific target genes. This pathway is crucial for the activation of innate immunity and inflammation. The alternative pathway involves p100 processing and nuclear translocation of RelB/p52 dimers. It is activated by LT-β, CD40L, LPS, and B cell-activating factor and depends on IKK1 homodimers (8Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R.

This alternative pathway is crucial for secondary lymphoid organ development, maturation of B cells, and adaptive humoral immunity.NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) has been implicated in activating both the classical and alternative pathways. NIK was originally identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and activates NF-κB when expressed in mammalian cells (13Malinin N.L.

These observations indicate that NIK exerts a wide range of biological functions. However, the mechanisms for NIK activation and regulation are not well understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with NIK as bait, we have identified a novel protein, designated TNAP (for TRAFs and NIK-associated protein), which directly binds to NIK and inhibits NIK kinase activity. Studies via overexpression and knockdown of TNAP demonstrate that TNAP negatively regulates NF-κB activation upstream of the IKK complex and regulates both the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast two-hybrid system Matchmaker II (Clontech) was used. The bait, encoding the N-terminal domain (nucleotides 1–437) of NIK, was inserted in frame into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast expression vector pBridge (Clontech). The yeast strain G1945 was transformed first with pBridge-NIK (1–437) and then with a human brain cDNA expression library fused to the GAL4 transactivator domain in expression vector pACT2 (Clontech).Mammalian Expression Vector—The NF-κB-luciferase and interferon response factor-luciferase reporter constructs were obtained from Clontech.

A multiplicity of infection of 50 was used to infect target cells.Transfections and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—For coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments, the cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes. For reporter gene assay and EMSA, the cells were seeded in 6-well dishes. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were seeded in 8-well chamber slides. The adherent cells (HEK293T) were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate method. Suspension cells (Jurkat) were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After cotransfection of pRK-TNAP with pTK-Hyg selection vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) into HEK293T cells, stable clones were selected with hygromycin (20 ng/ml).Reporter Gene Assay—The Dual-Light chemiluminescent reporter gene assay for the combined detection of luciferase and β-galactosidase (Tropix) was performed following the manufacturer's protocols. Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and when necessary, empty control plasmid was added to each sample to ensure each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency and protein concentration, a constant amount of RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was added to all transfections. The luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase expression levels. The data are expressed as the averages ± S.D. of one representative experiment.GST-TNAP Fusion Protein Expression and Antibody Production— GST fusion proteins were expressed and prepared according to standard procedures using expression vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). The purified fusion protein was used as an immunogen to raise polyclonal antisera in rabbits (Proteintech Group Inc.). The final anti-serum was affinity-purified with a GST-TNAP and a GST column.In Vitro Translation, GST Pull-down, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—IKK1 and NIK were in vitro translated and labeled with [35S]methionine (TnT kit; Promega). For pull-down experiments, 15 μl of in vitro translation mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with equal amounts of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins coupled to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were washed six times with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40.

For the in vivo kinase assay, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pRK-Myc-NIK and pRK-FLAG-IKK1(K44M) with or without pRK-Myc-TNAP. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed once in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed, heat-inactivated, fetal bovine serum and starved for 2 h in the same medium. 32P-Labeled orthophosphoric acid (0.5 mCi) was then added to the cells.

Two micrograms of RNA pretreated with DNase I for 2 h at 37 °C was used to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase with random hexanucleotide as primers. A touchdown PCR was performed on the cDNA using TNAP (76–140) specific primers: the antisense (21-mer), 5′-ATGCCTCTGCACCCCAGCCTG-3′ and the sense (21-mer), 5′-AAATATGGCTGGGGCAGCAAT-3′.The tissue-specific expression of TNAP was examined by hybridization of a human multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (OriGene). A PCR-produced probe of 192 bp was [32P]dCTP-labeled with random priming. The hybridizations were conducted in the ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) at 65 °C for 2 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. The same blots were then stripped and hybridized with the 32P-labeled 380-bp cDNA fragment PstI-digested from pRK-FLAG-NIK as well as 300 bp of PCR product of human β-actin.Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemical studies, free floating sections of spinal cord were stained as described (52Hu W.H. Li F. Qiang W.A. Liu N. Wang G.Q. Xiao J. Liu J.S. Liao W.H. Jen M.F. J. Neurotrauma. 1999; 16: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The human spinal cords were obtained from the Pathology Department at the University of Miami.Quantitative Image Analysis—The images from EMSA, Western blot, and kinase assays were scanned and analyzed with the Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. The data are presented as adjusted volume times the total area.RESULTSCloning and Characterization of TNAP—To identify proteins associated with the NF-κB signaling pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult human brain cDNA library using NIK as bait. From 3 × 106 yeast transformants, 40 clones were both histidine- and β-galactosidase-positive. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of several known gene products that interact with NIK, such as TRAF3 (41Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). We also identified several novel clones. One of them, TNAP, is 660 bp in length with an open reading frame of 140 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number: AF463496). TNAP coincides with nucleotides 87239–86607 of human clone RP11-429E17 on chromosome 13q13.1–14.2. No known protein sequence or motif was found to resemble TNAP. The 140 amino acids share significant homology (40–60%) with several un-named small protein products.To determine the transcript size and tissue distribution of TNAP, Northern blot analysis of human adult tissues (OriGene) was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, a single transcript of 660 bp is expressed in all the tissues examined, with high expression in testis, brain, colon, liver, and lung (Fig. 1A). The tissue distribution of TNAP mRNA is consistent with NIK mRNA expression, although the expression level is different between TNAP and NIK in most tissues. The relative amount of mRNA was confirmed by Northern blot with human α-actin. RT-PCR of RNAs extracted from different cell lines demonstrates that TNAP mRNA is constitutively expressed in HL60 (human myeloid leukemia cell line), BV2 (mouse microglia cell line), and RN33B (rat neuronal cell line) (Fig. 1B and data not shown).To determine whether the TNAP gene encodes an expressed protein, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a GST-TNAP fusion protein. The specificity of this affinity-purified antibody was tested using double-labeled immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis of HEK293T cells overexpressing Myc-TNAP. As shown in Fig. 1C, anti-TNAP antibody specifically recognizes the purified Myc-TNAP fusion protein. Double-labeled confocal image analysis confirms the colocalization of TNAP-like and Myc-like immunoreactivities (Fig. 1C). To determine the endogenous protein expression of TNAP, Western blot analysis of different cell lines was performed. As shown in Fig. 1D, the anti-TNAP antibody recognizes a band of ∼16 kDa, the predicted size for TNAP in HL60 cells, which is consistent with the expression of TNAP mRNA demonstrated by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). In the white matter of the spinal cord, TNAP-like immunoreactivity is detectable in glial cells (Fig. 1E).Physical Interaction of TNAP with NIK—We cloned the open reading frame of TNAP into a mammalian expression vector to verify the interaction between TNAP and NIK in mammalian cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in transiently transfected HEK293T cells demonstrate that TNAP specifically interacts with NIK (Fig. 2A). TNAP also interacts with TRAF2 and TRAF3 but does not interact with IKK1 or IKK2 (Fig. 2A). The direct interaction between TNAP and NIK, but not TNAP and IKK1, was confirmed by GST pull-down assay using bacterially expressed GST-TNAP fusion protein and in vitro translated NIK or IKK1 protein (Fig. 2B). To examine which region of TNAP interacts with NIK, we made several deletion mutants of TNAP and transiently expressed these mutants in HEK293T cells. The expression levels of TNAP and its mutants were confirmed by immunofluorescent cytochemistry with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 87–140) interacts with NIK, but the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–70) does not. To determine whether endogenous interactions between TNAP and NIK occur, coimmunoprecipitation studies in HL60 cells were performed. The affinity-purified anti-TNAP antibody works well for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C). We show that the anti-TNAP antibody coimmunoprecipitates endogenous NIK in HL60 whole cell lysates (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that TNAP interacts with NIK.Fig. 2Physical interaction between TNAP and NIK.A, TNAP interaction with NIK, TRAF2, and TRAF3 in transfected cells. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated vectors. After 24 h, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the coimmunoprecipitated TNAP was detected by Western blot (WB) using anti-Myc antibody. B, TNAP direct interaction with NIK. GST-TNAP fusion protein or GST control were incubated with in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled NIK or IKK1 protein. Specifically bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and revealed by fluorography (upper panel). The expressions of GST constructs were confirmed by Coomassie staining (lower panel). Input represents 15% of the materials used for pull-down assays. C, C-terminal domain of TNAP interacting with NIK. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pRK-FLAG-NIK and various TNAP mutants as indicated. After 24 h, TNAP was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or mouse control IgG, and NIK was detected by Western analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. The expression level of NIK and TNAP mutants were verified by Western blot and immunofluorescent (IF) staining. D, interaction of endogenous TNAP and NIK. Whole lysate of HL60 cells was immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified anti-TNAP antibody or control rabbit Ig G followed by Western blot with anti-NIK antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Suppression by TNAP of NF-κB Activation—NIK has been demonstrated to be important in NF-κB activation (1Mattson M.P.

To test whether TNAP modulates NF-κB activation, we performed NF-κB-dependent reporter gene assays. Transient expression of TNAP alone does not affect NF-κB-dependent gene expression but significantly inhibits TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in HEK293T and Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A). However, TNAP does not affect interferon-γ-induced interferon response factor-1-dependent gene expression in either HEK293T or Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the inhibition by TNAP of NF-κB-dependent gene expression is specific. Stable clones constitutively expressing TNAP also exhibit significant inhibition of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3TNAP specific inhibition of NF-κB activation.A, TNAP inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene expression induced by TNFα. HEK293T or Jurkat cells in a 6-well plate were cotransfected in triplicate with 2 μg of TNAP expression vector or empty pRK vector and 0.2 μg of NF-κB-luciferase (left panel) or interferon response factor-luciferase (middle panel) and 0.1 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase vectors.

https://openalex.org/W2130306084,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening ailment characterized by severe lung injury involving inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung, cytokine production, surfactant dysfunction, and up-regulation of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) resulting in nitric oxide (NO) production. We hypothesized that NO production from NOS2 expressed in lung parenchymal cells in a murine model of ARDS would correlate with abnormal surfactant function and reduced surfactant protein-B (SP-B) expression. Pulmonary responses to nebulized endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) were evaluated in wild-type (WT) mice, NOS2 null (-/-) mice, and NOS2-chimeric animals derived from bone marrow transplantation. NOS2-/- animals exhibited significantly less physiologic lung dysfunction and loss of SP-B expression than did WT animals. However, lung neutrophil recruitment and bronchoalveolar lavage cytokine levels did not significantly differ between NOS2-/- and WT animals. Chimeric animals for NOS2 exhibited the phenotype of the recipient and therefore demonstrated that parenchymal production of NOS2 is critical for the development of LPS-induced lung injury. Furthermore, administration of NO donors, independent of cytokine stimulation, decreased SP-B promoter activity and mRNA expression in mouse lung epithelial cells. This study demonstrates that expression of NOS2 in lung epithelial cells is critical for the development of lung injury and mediates surfactant dysfunction independent of NOS2 inflammatory cell expression and cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W2062178524,"The possible functional abnormalities in three different Darier disease-causing Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2b) mutants, Ile(274) --> Val at the lumenal end of M3, Leu(321) --> Phe on the cytoplasmic part of M4, and Met(719) --> Ile in P domain, were explored, because they exhibited nearly normal expression and localization in COS-1 cells and the high ATPase and coupled Ca(2+) transport activities that were essentially identical (L321F) or slightly lower (I274V by approximately 35% and M719I by approximately 30%) as compared with those of the wild type. These mutations happened to be in Japanese patients found previously by us. Kinetic analyses revealed that each of the mutants possesses distinct types of abnormalities; M719I and L321F possess the 2-3-fold reduced affinity for cytoplasmic Ca(2+), whereas I274V possesses the normal high affinity. L321F exhibited also the remarkably reduced sensitivity to the feedback inhibition of the transport cycle by accumulated lumenal Ca(2+), as demonstrated with the effect of Ca(2+) ionophore on ATPase activity and more specifically with the effects of Ca(2+) (up to 50 mm) on the decay of phosphoenzyme intermediates. The results on I274V and M719I suggest that the physiological requirement for Ca(2+) homeostasis in keratinocytes to avoid haploinsufficiency is very strict, probably much more than considered previously. The insensitivity to lumenal Ca(2+) in L321F likely brings the lumenal Ca(2+) to an abnormally elevated level. The three mutants with their distinctively altered kinetic properties will thus likely cause different types of perturbation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, but nevertheless all types of perturbation result in Darier disease. It might be possible that the observed unique feature of L321F could possibly be associated with the specific symptoms in the pedigree with this mutation, neuropsychiatric disorder, and behavior problems. The results also provided further insight into the global nature of conformational changes of SERCAs for ATP-driven Ca(2+) transport."

https://openalex.org/W1980532801,"In the adult, involvement of bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in tissue revascularization (vasculogenesis) and the cooperation of hematopoietic cell subsets in supporting this process have been described in different experimental animal models. However, the effective contribution of such cells in restoring organ vascularization in a clinical setting needs to be clarified. In this study, a mouse transplantation model was engrafted by human cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to follow the behavior of donor-derived endothelial and hematopoietic cells in the presence of a localized source of an angiogenic inducer. Human endothelial markers (CD31+/CD45-, VE-cadherin+) were always detectable in the bone marrow of transplanted mice, while they were only randomly detectable in peripheral neovascularization sites. To investigate the ability of human transplanted hematopoietic stem cells to support new vessel formation in response to altered homeostatic conditions, chimeric mice were further treated by systemic injection of human mononuclear cells (MNCs). Our data indicate that MNC administration in transplanted mice enhances vasculogenesis in the newly formed vessels. Taken together these results suggest that human-derived EPCs, long-term engrafting a xenotransplantation model, have hematopoietic and endothelial developmental potential, which can be modulated by altering the physiological conditions of host microenvironment."

In her Perspective, [Levasseur-Regourd][1] discusses results from the Stardust mission to Comet Wild 2, published in the same issue, in which swarms of dust particles were observed. The images show striking variations in the flux of dust particles over small length scales that may signal the breakup of aggregates within the nucleus. Understanding these processes, and the dust-particle size distributions that will be brought back in the later stages of the mission, may help us better solve the puzzle of whether water and organic material were carried to early Earth by comets.

In the present work we studied Ras-mediated effects on the G2 checkpoint in two human cell lines, MDAH041 immortalized fibroblasts and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells. The transduction of the H-Ras mutants that retain certain functions (V12S35, V12G37, and V12C40 retain the ability to activate Raf or RalGDS or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively) as well as the activated or dominant-negative mutants of RalA (V23 and N28, respectively) has revealed that the activation of Ras-RalGEFs-Ral pathway was responsible for the attenuation of the G2 arrest induced by ethyl metanesulfonate or doxorubicin. Noteworthy, the activated RalA V23N49 mutant, which cannot interact with RLIP76/RalBP1 protein, one of the best studied Ral effectors, retained the ability to attenuate the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. Activation of the Ras-Ral signaling affected neither the level nor the intracellular localization of cyclin B1 and CDC2 but interfered with the CDC2 inhibitory phosporylation at Tyr15 and the decrease in the cyclin B/CDC2 kinase activity in damaged cells.

We have found previously that the genetic instability can be connected in part with the inhibitory effects of Ras oncoproteins on the function of the DNA damage G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints (39Agapova L.S.

These Ras activities are especially notable in the cells showing dysfunction of the p53 tumor-suppressor, which is the most common feature of various human tumors. In particular, the p53 inactivation coupled with the expression of activated Ras almost completely abrogates EMS-induced G2 arrest in rat and human fibroblasts, while each of these alterations alone has no notable effect on the function of the G2 checkpoint (39Agapova L.S. Ivanov A.V. Sablina A.A. Kopnin P.B. Sokova O.I. Chumakov P.M. Kopnin B.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The goal of this work was to study possible mechanisms by which Ras oncoproteins can modulate the activity of the G2 cell cycle checkpoint in p53-deficient human cells. In particular, we decided to determine the involvement of different Ras effectors in the regulation of the G2-to-M transition in damaged cells. Also, we studied how the activated Ras and its effectors affect the activity of cyclin B/CDC2 kinase, which is believed to play a key role in the entering to mitosis (44Nurse P.

The amplified fragments of RalA-V23 and RalA-N49 were subcloned to XhoI-BamHI sites of the retroviral vector pLXSN carrying the G418 resistance gene. The amplified fragment of dominant-negative RalA-N28 was cloned to the lentivirus vector pLV-CMV (51Pfieifer A. Ikawa M. Dayn Y. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures—Human p53-deficient MDAH041 immortalized fibroblasts derived from a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (52Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bishoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 (ATCC number HTB-85) were used. Their derivatives expressing the H-Ras or RalA retroviral constructs were obtained as described previously (39Agapova L.S. Ivanov A.V. Sablina A.A. Kopnin P.B. Sokova O.I. Chumakov P.M. Kopnin B.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA constructs were transfected into Phoenix packaging cells (kindly provided by G. Nolan, Stanford, CA) using LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen). Virus-containing supernatants were collected 24–48 h after transfection and used to infect recipient cells in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). Infected cell cultures were selected in G418-containing medium (0.5 mg/ml) for 14–20 days. The developed MDAH041 and Saos-2 cell sublines demonstrated similar expression efficiency from the introduced retroviral constructs, in particular equal expression levels of various exogenous Ras mutant proteins (Fig. 1). High-titer stocks of recombinant lentiviruses pseudotyped with VSV-G protein were produced by cotransfection into 293T cells of the pLV constructed together with the pCMVdelta8.2 packaging plasmid and pVSV-G. Virus-containing supernatants were collected 24–48 h after transfection and used to infect recipient cells. All the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone) and penicillin/streptomycin. Analysis of Mitotic Fraction in Mutagen-treated Cell Cultures—EMS (Sigma, 600 μg/ml), doxorubicin (Sigma, 50 ng/ml), or an equal volume of PBS was added 3–5 h before fixation. Chromosome slides were prepared by routine methods. In each case more than 2000 cells were scored to determine the percentage of mitotic cells. FACScan Analysis—The cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with 30 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.25 μg/ml RNase A. Then the cells were filtered through 35-μm nylon mesh (Falcon 2235 tubes), and cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACScan. Data were analyzed using ModFitLT V3.0 software. Cell Culture Synchronization—Cell cultures were synchronized at the G1-S border by double thymidine block. Briefly, asynchronously growing cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, released from the block by switching to complete growth medium containing 24 μm deoxycytidine for 8 h, and again treated with thymidine for 16 h. Then the cells were rinsed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured in complete growth medium. Samples were harvested at various times after release from the second thymidine block. Western Analysis—Whole-cell extracts were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A, and 1 mm E64). Protein concentration in the extracts was determined with a protein assay system (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of protein was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with antibodies specific to p21Ras (Ab-3, Oncogene Research Production), CDC2 (sc-54), cyclin B1 (sc-245), p21Cip1/Waf1 (F-5), p27Kip1 (F-8) (all from Santa Cruz Biothechnology), or phospho-CDC2(Tyr15) (catalog number 9111, from Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes were treated with secondary sheep anti-mouse-HPR or anti-rabbit-HPR antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were developed with ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence Analysis—To visualize cyclin B1 and CDC2 localization, cells were cultured on coverslips, fixed with ice-cold methanol, and incubated with anti-cyclin B1 and anti-CDC2 antibody (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and TRITC-conjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS cells were incubated with 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst for 10 min for nucleus staining, examined with a fluorescent microscope, and photographed with a Kodak digital camera. Ral Activity Assay—Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. Thirty minutes after stimulation with 10% FBS cells were lysed in RAB buffer (Upstate Biotechnology). The amount of GTP-bound Ral was determined using a Ral Activation Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cyclin B1/CDC2 Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Cells were synchronized by double thymidine block. Nine hours after releasing from the block cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μm leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-B1 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. The beads were pelleted at 14,000 × g and washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate). The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated cyclin B1/CDC2 complex was assessed by its ability to phosphorylate histone H1-specific peptide using the CDC2 protein assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Influence of Various Ras Mutants on the DNA Damage-induced G2 Cell Cycle Arrest—To test the possible role of different Ras pathways in the regulation of the DNA damage G2 checkpoint, we studied the effects caused by introduced H-Ras V12S35, V12G37, and V12C40 mutants showing partial loss of function. It was found that expression of the V12G37 mutant, which retained the ability to bind to Ral-GDS but not to c-Raf and PI3K (33Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J.

Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 54Luce R.A. Hopkins P.B. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 340: 396-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such effect was revealed in the derivatives of the MDAH041 and Saos2 cell lines both by FACScan analysis of cell cycle profiles and by counting of mitotic figures after short term (3–5 h) exposure to clastogenic agents. In fact, both the activated V12 H-Ras and its V12G37 mutant decreased significantly in EMS-treated synchronized cell cultures, the fraction of cells arrested in G2 (Fig. 2 and Table I), and increased the number of mitoses in unsynchronized cell cultures exposed to EMS (Table I) or doxorubicin (Fig. 3). At the same time, the other two loss-of-function Ras mutants showing preferential ability to bind to PI3K or c-Raf (V12C40 and V12S35, respectively) practically did not affect the G2-to-M transition in damaged cells (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). The differences in the activity of the mutants were revealed despite the fact that Western analysis demonstrated similar levels of V12, V12S35, V12G37, and V12C40 proteins in the corresponding MDAH041 and Saos-2 cell sublines (Fig. 1). Moreover, the V12S35 and V12C40 mutants showing minor ability to affect the G2 checkpoint were more effective than the V12G37 mutant in the induction of such effects as changes in cell morphology (actin cytoskeleton disintegration, diminishing of cell areas, and alterations of cell shape) (supplemental Fig. 1) and phosporylation/activation of the p42/p44 Erk kinases (supplemental Fig. 2). These data indicated specific involvement of V12G37-regulated signaling pathway(s) in the control of G2- to-M transition.Table IInfluence of expression of various Ras mutants on EMS-induced arrest of G2-to-M transitionCell linesIntroduced Ras mutantG2/M fraction in synchronized cell culturesaDetermined by FACScan analysis 12 h after release from double thymidine block as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the legend to Fig. 2.

To test whether the V12 and V12G37 Ras mutants affect the activity of the DNA damage G2 checkpoint through the RalGEF-Ral pathway, we studied the effects caused by two RalA mutants, N28 and V23. The N28 dominant-negative mutant of RalA is believed to form an inactive complex with RalGEFs thus impeding the activation of endogenous Ral family small GTPases (47Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A.

Phosphorylation results in movement of the NTD 3445 face (from α-helix 3 to β-strand 5), which exposes a hydrophobic surface that has been proposed to interact with the central domain and stimulate its activities. The ∼230-residue central domain mediates a phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization that is required for transcriptional activation (14Weiss V. Claverie-Martin F. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The central domain hydrolyzes ATP, which is required for productive open promoter complex formation and which oligomerization stimulates (19Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The central domain also interacts with RNA polymerase (23Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A structure has been presented for the central domain of one NtrC-like protein (24Lee S.Y. De La Torre A. Yan D. Kustu S. Nixon B.T. Wemmer D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The ∼80-residue C-terminal domain (CTD) contains DNA-binding and dimerization determinants (23Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Klose K.E. North A.K. Stedman K.M. Kustu S. J. Mol.

The structure of the NtrC CTD from Salmonella enterica has been determined (27Pelton J.G. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence indicates a presumably stimulatory interaction between the 3445 face of phosphorylated NTD of NtrC and small peptides of the central domain (10Hastings C.A. Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Yan D. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9081-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic evidence suggests a potentially inhibitory interaction between α-helix 5 of the NTD and the central domain, which phosphorylation may alter (28Harrod A.C. Yang X. Junker M. Reitzer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of the NTD of Rhizibial DctD impairs a dimerization between two α-helix 5s, which stimulates central domain activities (29Park S. Zhang H. Jones A.D. Nixon B.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10934-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Park S. Meyer M. Jones A.D. Yennawar H.P. Yennawar N.H. Nixon B.T. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1964-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The proposed dimerization determinants of the NTD of DctD are not found in NtrC. Nonetheless, an in vivo protein-protein interaction study suggests that NTDs of NtrC have the potential to dimerize (31Fiedler U. Weiss V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Though details of the activation mechanism may differ, a common theme of NtrC-like proteins is that the phosphorylation of NTD probably exposes or stabilizes (or both) oligomerization determinants of the central domain (28Harrod A.C. Yang X. Junker M. Reitzer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). One manifestation of this oligomerization is cooperative binding to DNA. We previously showed that deletion of the central domain abolishes phosphorylation-stimulated cooperative binding, but did not eliminate cooperative binding (16Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We refer to the residual cooperative binding as phosphorylation-independent. The goals of this work were to determine the domain, structural determinants, and function of phosphorylation-independent cooperative binding. Strains and Plasmids—Strains used for mutant isolation and enzyme assays were derivatives of the Escherichia coli K-12 strain W3110 (lacIqlacL8) and are listed in Table I. All lacZ fusions are single copy on the chromosome. The strains were constructed using previously described methods (32Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 33Haldimann A. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Plasmid pXY11 is the parental plasmid for mutagenesis of ntrC alleles. It is equivalent to the pBR322-derived pCB12 (26Shiau S.P. Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 190-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that DNA coding for residues 135–136 has been changed from GGC CCA to GGG CCC, which introduces an ApaI site but does not affect the amino acid sequence. The ntrC allele also contains a deletion of the central domain from residues 143 to 398. pXY12 is a variant of pXY11, which contains full-length wild-type ntrC. Full-length versions of pXY11 derivatives were generated by inserting an ApaI-Eco47III fragment from pXY12 (which contains DNA from codons 136 to 411) into pXY11 derivatives cut with ApaI and Eco47III.Table IStrainsStrainRelevant genotype or descriptionPromoter region in lacZ fusionsaThe coordinates are in relation to the translational start site.W3110lacL8 lacIqLR20as W3110, but also ntrC10::Tn5 λgln107 (ntrBp-lacZ)-130 to +130XY12as LR20, but also rpoN208::Tn10BLS43as W3110, but also ΔntrC::cat attL::ygjG′-′lacZ-886 to +471BLS54as W3110, but also ΔntrC::cat attL::nac′-′lacZ-287 to -5BLS55as W3110, but also ΔntrC::cat attL::glnH′-′lacZ-464 to +101BLS56as W3110, but also ΔntrC::cat attL::ast′-′lacZ-494 to +43a The coordinates are in relation to the translational start site. Open table in a new tab Cell Growth and Enzyme Assays—The minimal growth medium contained W salts, 0.4% of the carbon source, 0.2% of each nitrogen source, and 0.02% thiamine (34Rothstein D.M. Pahel G. Tyler B. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7372-7376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Assays for glutamine synthetase and β-galactosidase were performed as described (34Rothstein D.M. Pahel G. Tyler B. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7372-7376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Units are nmol of product min–1 mg protein–1, unless otherwise specified. Isolation of Mutants with NtrC Defective in Cooperative DNA Binding—The strategy for mutant isolation is described under “Results.” The region encoding the ntrC gene in plasmid pXY11 was mutagenized by a PCR-based method (36Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar), except that 0.1 μm MnCl2 and 4 mm MgCl2 were included in the buffer. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with PflM1 and EcoRI and the ntrC-containing fragments (from codon 15 to about 200 bases past the stop codon) were subcloned into unmutagenized pXY11. The ligation mixture was transformed into LR20. About 1% of the transformants were glutamine prototrophs on glycerol-ammonia minimal medium plates. The prototrophs were then screened for repression of the ntrB promoter by a qualitative β-galactosidase assay. Cells were resuspended into wells of a 96-well plate that contained 100 μl of Z buffer (35Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar), 1 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2 mg/ml hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Cells were permeabilized by incubation for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated with 25 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenol-β-d-galactoside, stopped with 100 μlof1 m Na2CO3, and color development examined visually. Site-specific Mutagenesis—Plasmid pXY12 was used as a template for megaprimer mutagenesis (37Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The primer sequences of the forward and reverse primers were GCGCTGAATATGGCAGCTATCCCA and CGTATCACGAGGCCCTTT, respectively. The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotide for NtrC-R431A, NtrC-S423A, and NtrC-T435A were 5′-GAGCTGGAGGCGACGTTACTGACG, 5′-AAATCTGCTAGCGGAAGCGCAGC, and 5′-GACGTTACTCGCGACCGCGTTGC, respectively. Mismatched sites are underlined. Purification of NtrC Variants—NtrC variants were overexpressed using a phage T7 RNA polymerase expression system, and purified as previously described (16Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Moore J.B. Shiau S.P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2692-2701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the strain for overexpression was BL21 (λDE3)/pLysE with ntrC alleles cloned into derivatives of pCB5, itself a derivative of pT7-7, which contains a T7 promoter preceding ntrC. Various ntrC alleles were subcloned into pCB5 by swapping PflMI-EcoRI fragments; the PflMI site is 50 bases downstream from the 5′-end of ntrC, while the EcoRI site is about 200 bases downstream from the 3′-end. Cells were lysed by sonication, and ribosomes removed by streptomycin precipitation. The NtrC variant proteins were precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, bound to and eluted from an heparin-Sepharose column, reprecipitated with ammonium sulfate, dialyzed in a pH 7.5 storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol) and stored at –80 °C. DNase I Footprinting—Assays were performed as previously described (6Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For binding to site 2 of the glnA regulatory region, we used a 1.6-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment from pCB37, which contains sequences from –122 to –92 (16Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For binding to site 2 of the glnA regulatory region in the presence of site 1, we used a 153-bp EcoRI-PstI fragment from pVW7, which contains sequences from –189 to –92 (16Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For binding to the ast promoter, we used a 442-bp EcoRI-PstI fragment from pUC-astp(+), which contains sequences from +103 to –298 of the ast promoter cloned into the HincII site of pUC18 (6Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—The basic procedures have been described (39Ninfa A.J. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 40Austin S. Dixon R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All concentrations (for glnA and ast transcription) are final concentrations in the 25-μl reaction. Transcription from the glnA promoter was measured using pTH8, which has a T7 terminator about 300 bases downstream from the transcription start site (41Hunt T.P. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Single round in vitro transcription reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 25 μl, transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 10 nm supercoiled plasmid pTH8, 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences), 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.1 mm UTP, 10 μCi [α-32P]UTP, 6 mg/ml heparin, 100 nmE. coli RNA core polymerase (Epicenter Technologies Inc.), 300 nm σ54, various concentrations of NtrC, and 100 nm NtrB. The components were added in transcription buffer in the following sequence. DNA, RNase inhibitor, and RNA polymerase (core plus sigma) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. NtrC and NtrB were then added, and the mixture incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. ATP (4 mm) was added to phosphorylate NtrC and permit open complex formation, and the mixture incubated for 10 min. Finally, we added a 4.5-μl mixture containing heparin and the remaining nucleotides, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of stop buffer (50 mm EDTA and 100 μg/ml bakers' yeast tRNA). The sample was extracted with phenol twice, and 40 μl was mixed with 15 μl of loading dye (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF). The sample was heated to 90 °C for 3 min, centrifuged briefly, and 30 μl were subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. The protocol for transcription from the ast promoter was essentially the same as described above, except that the DNA template was plasmid pAK10 (6Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), arginine (5 mm) was added with the DNA, and ArgR (300 nm) was added with NtrB. ATPase Activity—The ATPase assay was based on measurement of ADP (42Lowry O.H. Passoneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972: 147-149Google Scholar). A 100-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 35 units of lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle), 50 units of pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle), 0.2 mm NADH, and 500 nm NtrC. When appropriate, the reaction mixture also contained 25 mm of acetyl phosphate, which phosphorylates NtrC, and 10 nm of supercoiled pVW7, which contains the entire glnA promoter region. The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C. ATP (1 mm final concentration) addition started the reaction. NADH concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation—For the phosphorylation reaction, 38 μl of solution A (40 nm NtrB, 1× transcription buffer (described above), 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, and 12.5 μm/15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 38 μl of solution B (4 μm NtrC, 1× transcription buffer, and 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin) were each preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C. These solutions were mixed and incubated for another 10 min. For the dephosphorylation reaction, 4 μl of unlabeled ATP (10 mm final concentration) were added to the reaction. 10-μl samples were taken at various times and mixed with an equal amount of stop buffer (pH 6.8) containing 10 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.6% Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue. Total samples were loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel without heating, the gel placed in a phosphorimager cassette, and the bands quantified using a phosphorimager program (Molecular Dynamics). Isolation and Characterization of Mutants Defective in Repressing the glnAp1 Promoter—To analyze phosphorylation-independent cooperative DNA binding, we studied a strain with NtrC-ΔCen, which lacks the central domain that is required for phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization. NtrC-ΔCen cannot activate transcription from the σ54-dependent glnAp2 promoter, but can still repress the σ70-dependent glnAp1 promoter (26Shiau S.P. Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 190-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two NtrC sites overlap the glnAp1 promoter, and NtrC-ΔCen binds cooperatively (without phosphorylation) to these sites, and if it is the only form of NtrC present, then it results in glutamine auxotrophy (16Chen P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We mutated plasmid DNA coding for NtrC-ΔCen, and isolated mutants with defective repression of glnAp1 by a two-step procedure (Fig. 1). First, we isolated about 1000 glutamine prototrophs. Second, to eliminate those mutants in which NtrC does not bind DNA, we screened for mutants in which NtrC-ΔCen normally repressed the ntrB promoter (ntrBp). ntrBp contains a single binding site for NtrC, and, coincidently, NtrC binds with the same affinity to the two-site glnAp1 operator and the single site ntrB operator (15Porter S.C. North A.K. Wedel A.B. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2258-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To assess transcription from ntrBp, we performed qualitative β-galactosidase assays from cells containing an ntrB-lacZ fusion integrated into the λ attachment site. Only three prototrophic transformants had β-galactosidase qualitatively similar to that found in cells with unmutagenized plasmid. Sequencing the mutated ntrC alleles indicated the following amino acid substitutions: A413V, P427L, and A437V. To further verify the mutant phenotype, we quantified expression from the glnAp1 and ntrB promoters. The three mutants had derepressed glutamine synthetase and normal β-galactosidase, which was expected from the plate phenotypes (Table II).Table IIRepression of glnAp1 and ntrBp promoters by NtrC variantsNtrC variantsGlutamine synthetase (glnAp1)β-Galactosidase (glnLp)None100.0 ± 3.9100.0 ± 2.8Wild type — ΔCen8.9 ± 0.833.2 ± 4.3ΔCen-A413V23.6 ± 2.231.3 ± 3.9ΔCen-P427L24.0 ± 3.631.2 ± 5.1ΔCen-A437V23.1 ± 1.932.4 ± 0.8Wild type5.3 ± 0.833.2 ± 4.3A413V10.6 ± 1.736.7 ± 4.7P427L20.0 ± 1.736.8 ± 2.5R431A19.5 ± 0.931.6 ± 0.9T435A18.5 ± 1.635.6 ± 1.7A437V15.2 ± 0.835.5 ± 5.1 Open table in a new tab We cloned the DNA fragment coding for the central domain back into the mutated ntrC alleles and examined the phenotype of cells with these proteins. We introduced these full-length ntrC alleles into strain XY12 (rpoN), which cannot activate glnA expression from the nitrogen-regulated glnAp2 promoter. We grew these cells in ammonia-containing minimal medium, which minimizes phosphorylation of NtrC. Cells with wild-type NtrC were glutamine auxotrophs, but cells with the mutant alleles were prototrophs. Glutamine synthetase activity indicated that the full-length variants did not repress glnAp1 as well as wild-type NtrC, while β-galactosidase activity indicated that the variants and wild-type NtrC repressed ntrBp equally well (Table II). In other words, cells with the full-length variants had the same phenotype as cells with the NtrC-ΔCen variants with respect to repression of the glnAp1 and ntrB promoters. Alteration of Surface Residues of the B-helix of the C-terminal Domain—All three alterations were located in the NtrC CTD. The NtrC CTD from S. enterica, which shares 100% sequence identity with the NtrC CTD from E. coli, consists of four α-helices (27Pelton J.G. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Helices A (residues 402–414) and B (residues 421–440) participate in dimerization, while helices C (residues 446–451) and D (residues 456–468) form the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (Fig. 2). All three altered residues were located in helices A and B. We hypothesized that surface residues in these helices, i.e. those that face away from the dimerization surface, might contribute to phosphorylation-independent cooperative DNA binding. To test this hypothesis, we changed three residues in the B helix, serine 423, arginine 431, and threonine 435, to alanine and examined the effect of these alterations. The mutations were placed in alleles that coded for full-length proteins. Cells with NtrC-S423A were glutamine auxotrophs and had wild-type levels of glutamine synthetase and β-galactosidase (not shown). However, cells with NtrC-R431A and NtrC-T435A were glutamine prototrophs and had the same glutamine synthetase and β-galactosidase activities found in the mutants isolated after random mutagenesis (Table II). Therefore, cells with alterations in surface residues of the CTD B-helix can result in the desired phenotype (Fig. 2). The Binding of Purified NtrC Variants to DNA—To more directly demonstrate a defect in phosphorylation-independent cooperative DNA binding, we characterized the binding of purified NtrC-P427L, NtrC-R431A, and NtrC-T435A to DNA by quantitative DNaseI footprinting. We assayed binding to sites in the regulatory region for the glnA-ntrBC operon. Wild-type and variant NtrCs (without phosphorylation) bound equally well to a single site, site 2, of the glnA regulatory region (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with β-galactosidase activity in strains with a ntrB-lacZ fusion (Table II). To assess cooperative binding, we assayed the binding to site 2 in the presence of the adjacent site 1 (Fig. 3B). 50% occupancy of site 2 required 10 nm wild-type NtrC, but 20–30 nm for the NtrC variants. Therefore, these three NtrC variants are defective in phosphorylation-independent cooperative DNA binding, which we equate with a defect in phosphorylation-independent oligomerization. Nitrogen Source Utilization and Ntr Gene Expression—All the mutants grew normally (no greater than 15% slower than wild type) with ammonia, alanine, glutamine, or putrescine as the nitrogen source (not shown). In contrast, mutants with NtrC-P427L or NtrC-R431A, but not other variants, grew twice as slow with arginine as the nitrogen source (Fig. 4). We also examined expression in vivo from the following Ntr operons: astCADBE, glnA-ntrBC, glnHPQ, nac, and ygjG. glnHPQ codes for components of a high affinity glutamine transport system (43Nohno T. Saito T. Hong J.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 44Reitzer L. Schneider B.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Rev. 2001; 65: 422-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); and ygjG for putrescine transaminase (45Samsonova N.N. Smirnov S.V. Altman I.B. Ptitsyn L.R. BMC Microbiol. 2003; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 46.Pybus, C. (2002) Roles of the Omega-Transaminases of Escherichia coli in Nitrogen Metabolism and Characterization of a Putrescine Aminotransferase, M. S. thesis, Dept. of Molecular and Cell Biology, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TXGoogle Scholar). The promoters for these operons, except for glnA-ntrBC, were fused to lacZ and expressed on the chromosome. glnA-ntrBC expression was assessed by assay of glutamine synthetase, the product of the first gene. Expression of glnA-ntrBC, glnHPQ, and nac was normal for strains with each variant (not shown). Expression of ygjG was essentially the same for cells with wild-type NtrC, NtrC-S423A (which has no defect), NtrC-A413V, NtrC-T435A, and NtrC-A437V (Fig. 5A). Expression was modestly lower in cells with NtrC-P427L, and 2-fold lower with NtrC-R431A (Fig. 5A). These differences did not affect growth with putrescine as a nitrogen source, which was expected since the major pathway of putrescine catabolism is not under Ntr control, 2B. Schneider and L. Reitzer, unpublished observation. and deletion of ygjG does not significantly impair such growth (46.Pybus, C. (2002) Roles of the Omega-Transaminases of Escherichia coli in Nitrogen Metabolism and Characterization of a Putrescine Aminotransferase, M. S. thesis, Dept. of Molecular and Cell Biology, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TXGoogle Scholar). Expression of the ast promoter in vivo was more complex. Cells with wild-type NtrC, NtrC-S423A, NtrC-A413V, NtrC-T435A, and NtrC-A437V had essentially the same expression (Fig. 5B). However, cells with NtrC-P427L or NtrC-R431A had ∼2-fold lower expression (Fig. 5B), which correlates well with growth rates. In summary, the variants generally had little effect on nitrogen source utilization or expression of five different Ntr genes. However, the alterations in NtrC-P427L and NtrC-R431A modestly affected growth with arginine and expression of the ygjG and astCADBE operons. Transcription of glnA and astCADBE with Purified NtrC Variants—To further confirm that the variants were not affected in their ability to activate Ntr genes, we examined transcription with purified components from promoters of the glnA-ntrBC and astCADBE operons. NtrC-P427L activated transcription from the glnAp2 promoter as well as wild-type NtrC (Fig. 6). NtrC-R431A and NtrC-T435A activated transcription slightly less well than wild-type NtrC, especially at the lower protein concentrations (Fig. 6). In contrast, all three variants were significantly impaired in their ability to initiate transcription from the ast promoter (Fig. 7). This result is not consistent with the growth of cells with NtrC-T435A, which grew normally, or cells with NtrC-P427L or NtrC-R431A, which grew only twice as slow as wild-type cells with arginine as the nitrogen source (Fig. 4).Fig. 7Transcription from the ast promoter by NtrC variants in vitro. A, autoradiography of the 300-base transcript from the σ54-dependent ast promoter. B, quantitation of the intensity of the transcripts. The intensity of the each band was quantified using a phosphorimager with the intensity of the band from the sample with 400 nm wild-type NtrC defined as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Characterization of NtrC-P427L—The preceding results indicate that loss of phosphorylation-independent oligomerization generally has minimal effects in vivo. Nonetheless, the diminished transcription in vitro, at least for the astCADBE operon, suggests the potential to affect Ntr gene expression. It is possible (perhaps likely) that the conditions in the reconstituted system do not accurately reflect conditions inside the cell. It is also possible that the variants are affected in properties other than phosphorylation-independent oligomerization. To explore the latter possibility, we further characterized the properties of purified NtrC-P427L, which is modestly impaired in its ability to activate Ntr gene in vivo. Phosphorylation of NtrC is required for transcriptional activation. Purified wild-type NtrC and NtrC-P427L had identical levels of steady-state phosphorylation (not shown), and the phosphorylation was equally stable for both proteins (not shown). Phosphorylation stimulates ATPase activity, which is required for transcriptional activation. Phosphorylation stimulated ATPase activity of NtrC-P427L (Fig. 8A). Phosphorylated NtrC-P427L and wild-type NtrC had essentially identical ATPase activity (Fig. 8A). Curiously, the variant had one-third less phosphorylation-independent activity (Fig. 8A). Perhaps this activity, which is not required for transcriptional activity, depends on phosphorylation-independent oligomerization. Phosphorylation stimulates central domain-mediated oligomerization which appears to complete the structure of the ATPase active site (24Lee S.Y. De La Torre A. Yan D. Kustu S. Nixon B.T. Wemmer D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Such oligomerization can be detected by cooperative binding to DNA, which we assessed at two Ntr promoters. Phosphorylation reduced the concentration of unphosphorylated wild-type NtrC required for 50% occupancy of site 2 of the glnA regulatory region (in the presence of site 1) from 10 (Fig. 3B) to 4.1 nm (not shown), which was expected. The phosphorylated NtrC-P427L variant bound to site 2 (with site 1) as well as phosphorylated wild-type NtrC (not shown). In other words, phosphorylation-dependent cooperative binding obscured the defect in phosphorylation-independent cooperative binding at the glnA regulatory region (Fig. 3B). The promoter of the astCADBE operon has two weak NtrC binding sites upstream of the start site of transcription. Half-maximal occupancy at this promoter requires about 10 times more phosphorylated wild-type NtrC than at the glnA promoter (6Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Half-maximal occupancy required three times more phosphorylated NtrC-P427L than phosphorylated wild-type NtrC (Fig. 8B). This defect correlates reasonably well with diminished growth (Fig. 4) and astCADBE expression in vivo (Fig. 5B). We conclude that the properties of NtrC-P427L are essentially normal, except for phosphorylation-independent cooperative DNA binding in the glnA regulatory region (Fig. 3B), phosphorylation-dependent cooperative binding to weak sites of the ast promoter (Fig. 8B), and in vitro transcription from the ast promoter (Fig. 7). Structural Determinants of Phosphorylation-independent Cooperative Binding—Our genetic analysis indicates that phosphorylation-independent oligomerization (a property deduced from cooperative binding to DNA) is a function of the CTD, which establishes a third function for the ∼80-residue CTD. The other two functions of the CTD are binding to DNA and dimerization. Substitutions of alanine 413, proline 427, arginine 431, threonine 435, and alanine 437 affected CTD-mediated oligomerization. Alanine 413 is located in helix A, while the other amino acids are in helix B (Fig. 2). The A413V substitution generates a side chain that may protrude into the interaction region and impair the interaction. This is insufficient to suggest that the small alanine 413 residue directly participates in the interaction. Proline 427 introduces a 14 (±3)° kink (27Pelton J.G. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is difficult to show in a ribbon diagram. Nonetheless, the P427L substitution probably changes the direction of the B-helix after proline-427. The possible alterations in the position of several side chains may explain why the P427L substitution has the greatest effect on expression of some Ntr genes. The R431A and T435A substitutions reduce the size of the amino acid side chains. It is possible that arginine 431 and threonine 435 directly participate in oligomerization. The A437V substitution is not obviously consistent with the proposed interaction interface. However, the increased side chain length may indirectly interfere with oligomerization. Based on the locations of these residues, we propose that several outward-facing residues of helix B form a surface that interacts with an adjacent dimer (Fig. 2B). Our results do not exclude the possibility that helix A also contributes to this oligomerization. Function of Phosphorylation-independent Cooperative Binding—The primary phenotype of strains with defective phosphorylation-independent oligomerization is derepressed transcription from the glnAp1 promoter (Table I). Such repression is only apparent in the absence of transcription from glnAp2, that is, in nitrogen sufficient environments when NtrC is not phosphorylated. This repression sets the basal level of glnA-ntrBC expression and the regulators of the Ntr response (NtrB and NtrC) during nitrogen-sufficient growth. The greater wild-type repression may impede inappropriate induction of σ54-dependent Ntr genes, which may occur in environments with fluctuating nitrogen availability. Phosphorylation-dependent cooperative binding in the glnA regulatory region completely obscured the defect in NtrC-P427L. Nonetheless, two variants had 2-fold diminished ygjG and astCADBE expression (Fig. 5, A and B). The diminished expression in vivo may reflect alterations in the structure of the multimeric activation complex. The impaired expression of the ast operon correlates well with 3-fold diminished DNA binding (Fig. 8B), but not with the dramatic effect on reconstituted transcription from the ast promoter (Fig. 7). The in vitro transcription assays were not optimized for the NtrC variants and may exaggerate the defect in DNA binding. Nonetheless, it appears that phosphorylation-independent oligomerization can modestly contribute to Ntr gene expression at promoters that bind NtrC poorly. Fis and the NtrC CTD—The NtrC CTD is homologous to the 98-amino acid Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) (27Pelton J.G. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 47Johnson R.C. Ball C.A. Pfeffer D. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3484-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis implies that Fis is derived from an α proteobacterial NtrC (48Morett E. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structures of Fis and the NtrC CTD are similar with minor differences in the length of helix A, the position of proline in helix B, and the distances between the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix regions (27Pelton J.G. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Like the NtrC CTD, Fis can participate in intermolecular interactions. Fis interacts with RNA polymerase and the Hin recombinase (49Merickel S.K. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2803-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 50McLeod S.M. Xu J. Cramton S.E. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. Johnson R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Curiously, a proline to leucine alteration in helix B of Fis eliminates the Hin-mediated inversion, but has no effect on DNA binding (51Osuna R. Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This is strikingly similar to the P427L substitution in NtrC, which eliminates the homologous intermolecular interaction, but does not affect DNA binding (to a single site). Even though the regions of Fis and NtrC involved in intermolecular interactions are not the same (50McLeod S.M. Xu J. Cramton S.E. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. Johnson R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 52Safo M.K. Yang W.Z. Corselli L. Cramton S.E. Yuan H.S. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6860-6873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the very existence of such intermolecular interactions in Fis further confirms the assignment of such a function to the NtrC CTD."

That sunny outlook shines through in Science 's 2004 salary survey. This second survey was an electronic polling of the 42,000 U.S. members of AAAS (which publishes Science ) in the life sciences. It yielded 6124 usable responses. In particular, it's a distinctly younger crowd this time around than in 2001, our first survey, and it includes hefty representation from postdocs. Although gripes are not hard to find, discontent seems to be outweighed, even among struggling younger scientists, by the deep satisfaction many express with the work they have chosen. Indeed, most look forward to additional years on the job rather than view them as a necessary burden to preserve their financial health.

Certainly, there are problems with the profession. But when asked if they would do it all over again, 70% said yes. Some 22% would have pursued a career in a different field of science. But only 8% said they wouldn't have chosen to be a scientist at all. And even then, it's not the subject they dislike; rather, it's the conditions under which they must toil. As one respondent wrote: “I should not have gone into science, even though I love it so much. I should have gone into my second love (music). At least there I would have anticipated the long hours and low compensation.”

Money and happiness.
There doesn't seem to be the remotest suggestion of a linear correlation between the two factors for these respondents, most of whom are very satisfied with their jobs. Pharmaceutical employees are the outliers, possibly reflecting the job insecurities in the field.
