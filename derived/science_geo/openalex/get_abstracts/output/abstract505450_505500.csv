Experiments that produce null results face a higher barrier to publication than those that yield statistically significant differences. Whether this is a problem depends on how many null but otherwise valid results might be trapped in the file drawer. Franco et al. use a Time-sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences archive of nearly 250 peer-reviewed proposals of social science experiments conducted on nationally representative samples. They find that only 10 out of 48 null results were published, whereas 56 out of 91 studies with strongly significant results made it into a journal. Science , this issue p. 1502"

In a diverse sample of U.S. homes, Lax et al. found that people and animals sharing homes shared their microbial communities (microbiota) too, probably because of skin shedding and hand and foot contamination. When families moved, their microbiological “aura” followed. If one person left the home even for a few days, their contribution to the microbiome diminished. These findings have implications not only for household identity and composition, but also for indicators of the members' health and well-being. Science , this issue p. 1048"

Resident memory T cells (T RM ) are long-lived and remain in the tissues where they first encountered a pathogen (see the Perspective by Carbone and Gebhardt). Schenkel et al. and Ariotti et al. found that CD8 + T RM cells act like first responders in the female reproductive tissue or the skin of mice upon antigen reencounter. By secreting inflammatory proteins, T RM cells rapidly activated local immune cells to respond, so much so that they protected against infection with an unrelated pathogen. Iijima and Iwasaki found that CD4 + T RM cells protected mice against reinfection with intravaginal herpes simplex virus 2. Science , this issue p. 98 , p. 101 , p. 93 ; see also p. 40"

Here, by using parabiotic mice, we show that a preexisting pool of CD4 T(RM) cells in the genital mucosa was required for full protection from a lethal herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection. Chemokines secreted by a local network of macrophages maintained vaginal CD4 T(RM) in memory lymphocyte clusters (MLCs), independently of circulating memory T cells. CD4 T(RM) cells within the MLCs were enriched in clones that expanded in response to HSV-2. Our results highlight the need for vaccine strategies that enable establishment of T(RM) cells for protection from a sexually transmitted virus and provide insights as to how such a pool might be established."

Banks-Leite et al. asked this question for the biodiversity hotspot of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. An annual investment of &lt;10% of Brazil's agricultural subsidies could support effective ecological restoration on private lands. This would increase biodiversity in set-aside land to the same level observed in protected areas. The cost-effectiveness of this scheme suggests a path forward for conservation strategies in other similarly mixed landscapes, too. Science , this issue p. 1041"

To identify the selective pressures that led to rabbit domestication, Carneiro et al. sequenced a domestic rabbit genome and compared it to that of its wild brethren (see the Perspective by Lohmueller). Domestication did not involve a single gene changing, but rather many gene alleles changing in frequency between tame and domestic rabbits, known as a soft selective sweep. Many of these alleles have changes that may affect brain development, supporting the idea that tameness involves changes at multiple loci. Science , this issue p. 1074 ; see also p. 1000"
https://openalex.org/W1977237743,"T and B cells' intricate molecular dance Generating high-affinity antibodies to fight infection is no easy task. To do so requires multiple steps, including T cells interacting with antibody-producing B cells in lymph nodes. These interactions select B cells expressing high-affinity antibodies for further proliferation, ensuring that the immune response generates high-affinity antibodies in large quantities. Shulman et al. use fluorescent live-cell imaging in mice to determine the molecular details of these interactions. They find that T cells engage B cells in short-lived mobile contacts during selection. These contacts cause T cells to flux calcium and produce proteins called cytokines, which probably drive B cells to proliferate and produce high-affinity antibodies. Science , this issue p. 1058"
https://openalex.org/W2168243900,"Push me, pull you, that's the way to move Primary cells, derived directly from human tissue, exhibit different behaviors in shape and signaling within three-dimensional (3D) or 2D spaces. When the pressure within the cell increases, cells display limb-like bumps, which they use to move through their 3D environment. Petrie et al. now show that when the complex of actin and myosin contracts, it controls the pressure within cells and therefore the shape of those protruding structures (see the Perspective by DeSimone and Horwitz). The authors measured internal pressures in migrating mammalian cells. In the 3D matrix, those cells have higher pressure that differs between the front and back of the cell, which creates a piston effect. Science , this issue p. 1062 ; see also p. 1002"
https://openalex.org/W1999753634,"Origin of fish pigment cell for pattern Zebrafish stripes arise from the interactions of pigment cells: black melanophores, iridescent iridophores, and yellow-orange xanthophores. Melanophores and iridophores develop from nerve-associated stem cells, but the origin of xanthophores is unclear. Two studies now reveal that adult xanthophores originate from xanthophores in embryonic and larval fish, when they proliferate to cover the skin before the arrival of black and silver cells in a striped arrangement. Mahalwar et al. show that xanthophores change their final shape and color depending on their location. In black cells, xanthophores appear faint and stellate, but in silver cells, they are bright and compact. Precise superposition creates the blue and golden colors. McMenamin et al. observe the loss of pigment in embryonic xanthophores and the later reappearance in the adult. They show that redifferentiation depends on the thyroid hormone that also limits melanophore population expansion. Science , this issue p. 1362 and p. 1358"
https://openalex.org/W2081856232,"Subduction faults, called megathrusts, can generate large and hazardous earthquakes. The mode of slip and seismicity of a megathrust is controlled by the structural complexity of the fault zone. However, the relative strength of a megathrust based on the mode of slip is far from clear. The fault strength affects surface heat flow by frictional heating during slip. We model heat-flow data for a number of subduction zones to determine the fault strength. We find that smooth megathrusts that produce great earthquakes tend to be weaker and therefore dissipate less heat than geometrically rough megathrusts that slip mainly by creeping."

Herz et al. show that specific mutations in the residues that are normally modified to regulate expression cause severe disruption of normal development in the fruit fly. Similar mutations are known to be involved in a subtype of aggressive pediatric brain cancers. Insights into the epigenetic regulatory pathways disrupted by these mutations in Drosophila may suggest possible treatments for human cancers. Science , this issue p. 1065"

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hormone that is predominantly secreted by the liver, exerts a broad range of effects upon the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. Although increased circulating levels of FGF21 have been documented in animal models and human subjects with obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the functional interconnections between metabolic ER stress and FGF21 are incompletely understood. Here, we report that increased ER stress along with the simultaneous elevation of FGF21 expression were associated with the occurrence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease both in diet-induced obese mice and human patients. Intraperitoneal administration of the ER stressor tunicamycin in mice resulted in hepatic steatosis, accompanied by activation of the three canonical UPR branches and increased the expression of FGF21. Furthermore, the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway of the UPR could directly activate the transcriptional expression of Fgf21. Administration of recombinant FGF21 in mice alleviated tunicamycin-induced liver steatosis, in parallel with reduced eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF21 is an integral physiological component of the cellular UPR program, which exerts beneficial feedback effects upon lipid metabolism through counteracting ER stress.

Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins or perturbation of lipid metabolism at the ER causes ER stress, activating the adaptive cellular response termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1.Ron D.

In mammals, three canonical signaling branches of the UPR act coordinately to relieve ER stress. These include the ER-resident transmembrane protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (1.Ron D. Walter P.

Upon sensing ER stress, PERK mediates the second UPR branch through phosphorylating the ubiquitous protein translation initiation factor eIF2α, thereby inhibiting cellular mRNA translation (1.Ron D.

Despite this recent progress, the physiological mechanism by which each individual UPR branch can affect lipid metabolism during hepatic steatosis has yet to be completely delineated. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), an atypical member of the FGF family, functions as a hormone that has a wide range of endocrine, autocrine, and pharmacological actions on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (24.Potthoff M.J.

While the molecular basis of the increased FGF21 levels in association with metabolic disorders remains elusive, it is currently unclear whether important differences in the regulation and function of FGF21 exist between rodents and humans. It was recently reported that the expression of FGF21 can be induced by ATF4 during amino acid deprivation or ER stress (41.De Sousa-Coelho A.L. Marrero P.F. Haro D.

Autophagy deficiency leads to protection from obesity and insulin resistance by inducing Fgf21 as a mitokine.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To fully understand the potential physiological connection between the metabolic actions of FGF21 and ER stress, we examined the relationship between hepatic FGF21 expression and activation of the UPR branches in association with hepatic steatosis in mice as well as in human subjects. We found that hepatic FGF21 is transcriptionally up-regulated by the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway of the UPR, which can in turn suppress the eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway in hepatocytes, alleviating ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis. Male C57BL/6J mice, purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd., were housed in laboratory cages at a temperature of 23 ± 3 °C with a humidity of 35 ± 5%. Animals were maintained on a 12-h dark/light cycle with free access to a standard chow diet (Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd.) and water. For the diet-induced obesity model, mice at 6 weeks of age were fed for 16 weeks a low fat diet (LFD) containing 10% kcal of fat or a high fat diet (HFD) containing 60% kcal of fat (Research Diets Inc.). For the tunicamycin-induced ER stress animal model, mice at 12 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally with DMSO or tunicamycin (Sigma) at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight and sacrificed after 24 h of treatment. Mice with liver-specific knock-out of IRE1α (LKO) were bred as described previously (44.Shao M. Shan B. Liu Y. Deng Y. Yan C. Wu Y. Mao T. Qiu Y. Zhou Y. Jiang S. Jia W. Li J. Li J. Rui L. Yang L. Hepatic IRE1α regulates fasting-induced metabolic adaptive programs through the XBP1s-PPARα axis signalling.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For examination of the effect of FGF21 on ER stress, mice at 12 weeks were treated with DMSO or tunicamycin (1 mg/kg body weight), and starting at 6 h before tunicamycin injection, recombinant mouse FGF21 (PeproTech) was administered intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg body weight for a total of five times every 6 h. Mice were sacrificed at 24 h after tunicamycin treatment. All animals were killed under anesthetic conditions, and livers were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after resection before storage at −80 °C. All experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Serum FGF21 was measured using the ELISA kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For secreted FGF21, cell culture medium (3 ml) was collected by centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was concentrated to 200 µl using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore). FGF21 concentrations were then determined by ELISA. Serum levels of triglycerides were determined using the serum triglyceride determination kit (Sigma). To measure hepatic content of triglycerides, 40–50 mg of mouse liver tissue was homogenized in 0.5 ml of PBS, and 0.4 ml of homogenate was aspirated into a new tube before mixing sufficiently with 1.6 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, the lower organic phase was transferred and air-dried overnight in a chemical hood. The residue was resuspended in 800 µl of 1% Triton X-100 in absolute ethanol, and then the concentration of triglycerides was determined using the serum triglyceride determination kit (Sigma). Human liver samples were collected from patients of benign focal hepatic lesions undergoing liver surgery at the Department of Liver Surgery (Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China) as described previously (37.Li H.

Diagnosis of NAFLD was according to the guidelines proposed by the Asia-Pacific Working Party (45.Chitturi S. Farrell G.C. Hashimoto E. Saibara T. Lau G.K. Sollano J.D.

Tissues were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All samples had been examined by a pathologist, who was blinded to the study. Hepatic steatosis was classified as grade 0 (1–5%), grade 1 (6–33%), grade 2 (34–66%), and grade 3 (67–100%) (46.Kleiner D.E. Brunt E.M. Van Natta M. Behling C. Contos M.J. Cummings O.W. Ferrell L.D.

Tissue samples used for protein and total RNA preparation were from five patients with severe NAFLD (i.e. hepatic steatosis scored as grade 2 or 3) and five controls (i.e. hepatic steatosis grade 0), and none of which was pathologically diagnosed as having nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or cirrhosis. The study procedures were approved by the local ethics committee, following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written voluntary consent was obtained from all subjects before their participation. Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin) (Invitrogen). For ER stress experiments, cells were incubated in DMEM containing DMSO, 1 µm thapsigargin (Sigma), or 10 µg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma). Recombinant adenoviruses for the overexpression of EGFP (control), the wild-type, or the mutant forms of IRE1α were generated as described previously (47.Mao T. Shao M. Qiu Y. Huang J. Zhang Y.

Adenoviruses for XBP1s overexpression and knockdown were the generous gifts from Dr. Ling Qi (Cornell University). The knockdown control adenovirus Ad-sh-LacZ was generated as described with the BLOCK-iT adenoviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen) in HEK293A cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (48.Wang Q.

For infection of mouse primary hepatocytes, viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection of 40, which was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male mice at 8–12 weeks of age according to the procedure previously described in detail (48.Wang Q. Jiang L. Wang J. Li S. Yu Y. You J. Zeng R. Gao X. Rui L.

Briefly, collagenase perfusion was performed through the portal vein of mice after anesthetizing with 50 ml of perfusion buffer. Livers were aseptically removed and cut in a sterile 10-cm cell culture dish with 20 ml of ice-cold perfusion buffer without collagenase. After aspirating with a large-bore pipette, hepatocytes were filtrated through a 70-µm cell strainer (BD Falcon)"

Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are considered a highly specialized functional group, which depends on the supply of nitrite from other microorganisms and whose distribution strictly correlates with nitrification in the environment and in wastewater treatment plants. On the basis of genomics, physiological experiments, and single-cell analyses, we show that Nitrospira moscoviensis, which represents a widely distributed lineage of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, has the genetic inventory to utilize hydrogen (H2) as an alternative energy source for aerobic respiration and grows on H2 without nitrite. CO2 fixation occurred with H2 as the sole electron donor. Our results demonstrate a chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria outside the nitrogen cycle, suggesting greater ecological flexibility than previously assumed."

In poultry, avian-specific C. perfringens strains cause necrotic enteritis, an economically significant poultry disease that costs the global industry over $2 billion annually in losses and control measures. With removal of antibiotic growth promoters in some countries this disease appears to be on the rise. In experimental conditions used to study disease pathogenesis and potential control measures, reproduction of the disease relies on the use of predisposing factors such as Eimeria infection and the use of high protein diets, indicating complex mechanisms involved in the onset of necrotic enteritis. The mechanisms by which the predisposing factors contribute to disease progression are not well understood but it has been suggested that they may cause perturbations in the microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. We inspected changes in cecal microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) induced by Eimeria and fishmeal, in birds challenged or not challenged with C. perfringens. C. perfringens challenge in the absence of predisposing factors did not cause significant changes in either the alpha or beta diversity of the microbiota nor in concentrations of SCFA. Moreover, there was no C. perfringens detected in the cecal microbiota 2 days post-challenge without the presence of predisposing factors. In contrast, both fishmeal and Eimeria caused significant changes in microbiota, seen in both alpha and beta diversity and also enabled C. perfringens to establish itself post challenge. Eimeria had its strongest influence on intestinal microbiota and SCFA when combined with fishmeal. Out of 6 SCFAs measured, including butyric acid, none were significantly influenced by C. perfringens, but their levels were strongly modified following the use of both predisposing factors. There was little overlap in the changes caused following Eimeria and fishmeal treatments, possibly indicating multiple routes for progressing towards clinical symptoms of necrotic enteritis."

https://openalex.org/W2070704205,"Identification of important nodes in complex networks has attracted an increasing attention over the last decade. Various measures have been proposed to characterize the importance of nodes in complex networks, such as the degree, betweenness and PageRank. Different measures consider different aspects of complex networks. Although there are numerous results reported on undirected complex networks, few results have been reported on directed biological networks. Based on network motifs and principal component analysis (PCA), this paper aims at introducing a new measure to characterize node importance in directed biological networks. Investigations on five real-world biological networks indicate that the proposed method can robustly identify actually important nodes in different networks, such as finding command interneurons, global regulators and non-hub but evolutionary conserved actually important nodes in biological networks. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the five networks indicate remarkable prediction accuracy of the proposed measure. The proposed index provides an alternative complex network metric. Potential implications of the related investigations include identifying network control and regulation targets, biological networks modeling and analysis, as well as networked medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2047372255,"It has recently been appreciated that the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a prototypic member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, also functions as a mechanosensor. Specifically, mechanical stretch activates the AT1R to promote downstream signaling mediated exclusively by the multifunctional scaffold protein, β-arrestin, in a manner consistent with previously identified β-arrestin-biased ligands. However, the ligand-independent mechanism by which mechanical stretch promotes β-arrestin-biased signaling remains unknown. Implicit in the concept of biased agonism (i.e. the ability of an agonist to activate a subset of receptor-mediated signaling pathways) is the notion that distinct active conformations of the receptor mediate differential activation of signaling pathways. Here we determined whether mechanical stretch stabilizes distinct β-arrestin-activating conformations of the AT1R by using β-arrestin2-biased agonists as conformational probes in pharmacological and biophysical assays. When tested at cells expressing the AT1R fused to β-arrestin (AT1R-β-arrestin2), we found that osmotic stretch increased the binding affinity and potency of the β-arrestin-biased agonist TRV120023, with no effect on the balanced agonist AngII. In addition, the effect of osmotic stretch on ERK activation was markedly augmented in cells expressing the AT1R-β-arrestin2 fusion compared with the wild type AT1R and completely blocked in cells expressing the AT1R-Gq fusion. Biophysical experiments with an intramolecular BRET β-arrestin2 biosensor revealed that osmotic stretch and TRV120023 activate AT1Rs to stabilize β-arrestin2 active conformations that differ from those stabilized by the AT1R activated by angiotensin II.

Signal. 2010; 3: ra46Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), direct evidence for a β-arrestin-biased AT1R conformation induced by mechanical stretch is lacking. This is due in large part to the considerable technical difficulties associated with measuring the effects of mechanical stress on GPCRs at the molecular level. To determine whether mechanical stretch stabilizes distinct β-arrestin-activating conformations of the AT1R, we used biased agonists as novel conformational probes in pharmacological and biophysical assays. Critical to this approach were fusions between the AT1R and Gq (AT1R-Gq) or β-arrestin2 (AT1R-β-arrestin2), which were recently used to quantify the signaling bias of AT1R agonists (18.Strachan R.T. Sun J.P. Rominger D.H. Violin J.D. Ahn S. Rojas Bie Thomsen A. Zhu X. Kleist A. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J.

From these studies, we propose a ligand-independent mechanism whereby mechanical stretch allosterically stabilizes specific β-arrestin-activating conformations of the AT1R to engender β-arrestin-biased signaling. HEK 293 cells stably expressing the following receptors: wild type AT1R (WT AT1R), AT1R-β-arrestin2 fusion protein, or AT1R-Gq fusion protein, were generated and maintained as previously described (18.Strachan R.T. Sun J.P. Rominger D.H. Violin J.D. Ahn S. Rojas Bie Thomsen A. Zhu X. Kleist A. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J.

HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT AT1R (1152 bp, 44 kDa), AT1R-β-arrestin2 fusion protein (2334 bp, 88 kDa), or AT1R-Gq (2280 bp, 87 kDa) fusion protein were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 500 µg/ml neomycin at 37 °C in a humidified environment (5% CO2). Receptor densities of HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT AT1R, AT1R-β-arrestin fusion protein, or AT1R-Gq fusion protein are 400, 1400, and 1200 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The AT1R biased ligands used, TRV120023 (Sar-Arg-Val-Tyr-Lys-His-Pro-Ala-OH) and TRV120056 (Asp-Arg-Gly-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-OH), were developed and supplied by Trevena, Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Six-well flat bottom Corning Costar® cell culture plates (Sigma-Aldrich) were coated with 0.01% collagen (Sigma-Aldrich) for adherence. HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT AT1R, AT1R-β-arrestin fusion protein, or AT1R-Gq fusion protein were plated at a confluence of 60–70%. Cells were incubated for 24 h and then serum-starved for 16 h before osmotic stimulation. Osmotic stretch was applied by adding a defined volume of double-distilled H2O to the culture medium in each well of the 6-well plates. The cells were stimulated for 10 min 37 °C in a humidified environment (5% CO2). Control samples were maintained at the same condition with no application of osmotic stretch. Osmolality, measured as mOsm of solute/Kg of solvent (mOsm/kg), was measured using an Advanced InstrumentsTM 3250 Single Sample Osmometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) in the Duke University Clinical Laboratory. Competition radioligand binding assays were performed on HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT AT1Rs, AT1R-β-arrestin2 fusion proteins, or AT1R-Gq fusion proteins after stimulation with isotonic or hypotonic conditions as described above. On the day of assay, cells were washed gently with ice-cold PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, covered with 5 ml of versene, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were then gently harvested in 5 ml of cold MEM and spun down in a 15-ml conical tube at 500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of cold indicator-free minimal essential Eagle's medium (undiluted or diluted 1:1 with double-distilled H2O) and adjusted to achieve ∼1–2 µg of protein per µl of cells as determined from the Bradford assay. Competition binding assays with 50 µl of cells, 50 µl of serially diluted 5× test ligand in cold buffer, and 150 µl of 1.67× radioligand (125I-S1I8-AngII at 83.5 pm; 50 pm final concentration) were incubated at 4 °C for 4–5 h. Nonspecific binding was determined with 10 µm telmisartan. Bound radioactivity was collected on 0.3% PEI-treated GF/C filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) using cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Bound radioactivity was quantified on a Packard Cobra gamma counter (GMI, Ramsey, MN). Human FLAG-tagged AT1R was stably expressed in a suspension adapted tetracycline-inducible HEK cell line (Invitrogen). AT1R expression was induced for 24 h by treatment with doxycycline (2 µg/ml) and sodium butyrate (5 mm). Cell lysate was solubilized in 0.5% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol and subject to M1 anti-FLAG chromatography. Monomeric AT1R was isolated using size exclusion chromatography. Binding assays were performed as described above in MEM buffer or a 1:1 dilution of MEM and double-distilled H2O. The final concentration of AT1R was 0.4 ng/µl, and 125I-S1I8-AngII was used at a final concentration of 200 pm. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, aprotinin (2.5 µg/ml), and leupeptin (2.5 µg/ml). Protein concentrations were assayed with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad), and 35 µg of protein was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min before resolving by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis. Immunoblotting for total ERK and phosphorylated ERK was performed as previously described (6.Rakesh K. Yoo B. Kim I.M. Salazar N. Kim K.S. Rockman H.A. β-Arrestin-biased agonism of the angiotensin receptor induced by mechanical stress.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra46Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The following dilutions of primary antibody were used: total ERK (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), 1:3000; phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 1:1000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was employed as the secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Individual bands were then quantified by densitometry with the Syngene Imager (Syngene USA, Frederick, MD) using GeneSnap software. BRET assays were performed as described previously (6.Rakesh K.

HEK-293 cell stably expressing AT1Rs were transfected with the intramolecular BRET-based biosensor of β-arrestin2 and 24 h later were distributed onto collagen coated 96-well microplates. The BRET signal was determined as the ratio of the light emitted by YFP and the light emitted by Luc. BRET ratio was monitored at 10 min after ligand stimulation or osmotic stress. Values were corrected by subtracting the background BRET signals. For the measurement of osmotic stretch-induced ERK signaling in buffer with or without sodium ions, HEK 293 stable expressing WT AT1R cells were grown in MEM on 10-cm polystyrol dishes and were split into 6-well plates. The cells were washed four times using sodium-free buffer as previously described (20.Fork C. Bauer T. Golz S. Geerts A. Weiland J. Del Turco D. Schömig E. Gründemann D.

After preincubation in sodium-free buffer for 20 min, the buffer was replaced with either sodium-free buffer or buffer containing sodium buffer (125 mmol/liter NaCl, 25 mmol/liter Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5.6 mmol/liter (+) glucose, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 1.2 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4) (20.Fork C.

Stimulation with AngII, osmotic stretch, with or without the addition of telmisartan, was performed in MEM, sodium buffer, or sodium-free buffer for 10 min, and then the cell lysates were analyzed for ERK phosphorylation by immunoblotting. Competition binding curves were best fit by a one-site binding model using the nonlinear least squares regression program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Differences in competition binding curves were tested using the F test, with a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Individual dose-response curves for ERK1/2 phosphorylation were fit to a three-parameter logistic model in Prism. Emax and LogEC50 average values for the data in FIGURE 3., FIGURE 6. were calculated from the best fit of individual curves except for Fig. 6B where two of the dose-response curves did not fit a three-parameter logistic model, and therefore Emax and LogEC50 were calculated from the best fit of the average data. For each ligand the data were normalized to the fit bottom value determined for isotonic buffer, thus setting it equal to 1. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined with a one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to correct for multiple comparisons and either a Bonferroni or Holm-Sidak post hoc test using GraphPad Prism. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.FIGURE 6.Dose-response characteristics of ERK1/2 phosphorylation for the WT AT1R and the AT1R-Gq fusion over a broad range of AngII concentrations.

To examine whether mechanical stretch stabilizes distinct β-arrestin2-activating conformations of the AT1R, we measured the binding affinities of balanced and β-arrestin2-biased agonists in intact cells expressing either the unfused WT AT1R (uncoupled) or AT1R-β-arrestin2 fusion protein (β-arrestin coupled) under normal tonicity (288 mOsm/kg) or hypotonic conditions (143 mOsm/kg) to induce membrane stretch (Fig. 1A). Compared with the WT AT1R, the balanced agonist AngII bound with 3.1-fold higher affinity to the AT1R-βarrestin2 fusion protein in isotonic media (Fig. 1B and Table 1). This was in agreement with the known allosteric enhancing effect of β-arrestin2 coupling on AngII affinity in whole cells (25.Sanni S.J. Hansen J.T. Bonde M.M. Speerschneider T. Christensen G.L.

In the current study, we used genome-wide RNA sequencing of normal lung parenchyma and 26 additional tissue types, combined with antibody-based protein profiling, to localize the expression to specific cell types. Altogether, 221 genes were found to be elevated in the lung compared with their expression in other analyzed tissues. Among the gene products were several well-known markers, but also several proteins previously not described in the context of the lung. To link the lung-specific molecular repertoire to human disease, survival associations of pneumocyte-specific genes were assessed by using transcriptomics data from 7 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts. Transcript levels of 10 genes (SFTPB, SFTPC, SFTPD, SLC34A2, LAMP3, CACNA2D2, AGER, EMP2, NKX2-1, and NAPSA) were significantly associated with survival in the adenocarcinoma subgroup, thus qualifying as promising biomarker candidates. In summary, based on an integrated omics approach, we identified genes with elevated expression in lung and localized corresponding protein expression to different cell types. As biomarker candidates, these proteins may represent intriguing starting points for further exploration in health and disease."

Properties of glass depend on the number and location of oxygen atoms surrounding each cation. Edwards et al. combine nuclear magnetic resonance measurements with theoretical calculations to understand structural transformations in borosilicate glass (see the Perspective by Youngman). Boron atoms in planar threefold coordination move out of plane with increasing pressure to form trigonal pyramids. Identification of this type of transition state connects structural evolution with stress-induced processes in amorphous materials. In borosilicate glass, the transition leads to the formation of tetrahedral fourfold-coordinated boron that tunes glass properties for use in numerous applications.

In this study, we have performed an in-depth lipidomic analysis of human plasma from healthy individuals and subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in order to determine the lipidomic profile that allows prognosis of a pathological subpopulation with altered high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. The MetS population was categorized as having pathological or nonpathological HDL. Anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk markers, and lipoprotein subclasses of HDL and low-density lipoproteins were also evaluated. Lipidomic analysis revealed 357 differential molecules that were clustered (k means) in the two groups. The molecules identified in the whole lipidome showed that MetS subjects presented lower levels of glycerolipids and higher levels of glycerophospholipids with respect to control subjects. In contrast, when only statistically differential lipids were taken into account, differences were found between the two groups in almost cases. Furthermore, levels of saturated fatty acids were higher in patients with pathological HDL levels than in controls, whereas levels of unsaturated fatty acids were lower.

Although both osteoblasts and osteoclasts express P2X7 receptors, their function in osteogenesis remains controversial. Here, we investigated the role of the P2X7 receptor on osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) cultures from postmenopausal women (age 71 ± 3 yr, n=18). We focused on the mechanisms related to intracellular [Ca2+]i oscillations and plasma membrane-dynamics. ATP, and the P2X7 agonist BzATP (100 μM), increased [Ca2+]i in parallel to the formation of membrane pores permeable to TO-PRO-3 dye uptake. ATP and BzATP elicited reversible membrane blebs (zeiosis) in 38 ± 1 and 70 ± 1% of the cells, respectively. P2X7-induced zeiosis was Ca2+ independent, but involved phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and Rho-kinase activation. BzATP (100 μM) progressively increased the expression of Runx-2 and Osterix transcription factors by 452 and 226% (at d 21), respectively, alkaline phosphatase activity by 88% (at d 28), and mineralization by 329% (at d 43) of BMSC cultures in a Rho-kinase-dependent manner.

Crohn disease muramyl-dipeptide non-targeting protein-protein interaction genome-wide association studies. IL-8 (CXCL8) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine produced by many cell types in response to various stressors. IL-8 was first described as a neutrophil chemo-attractant (12.Yoshimura T.

Moreover, NOD2 mutations are associated with Blau syndrome and early onset sarcoidosis (21.Kanazawa N. Okafuji I. Kambe N. Nishikomori R. Nakata-Hizume M. Nagai S. Fuji A. Yuasa T. Manki A.

Thus, it is clear that NOD2 signaling plays an important role in maintaining inflammatory homeostasis, prompting us to systematically interrogate regulators of NOD2-induced IL-8 secretion. In this paper, we report the results of a genome-wide siRNA screen identifying numerous genes that regulate NOD2-induced IL-8 secretion. Many of the identified IL-8 regulators affect both NF-κB induction and IL-8 secretion, validating our previously reported regulators of NOD2-induced NF-κB activation (23.Warner N. Burberry A. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Sartor M.A. Núñez G. A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals positive and negative regulators of the NOD2 and NF-κB signaling pathways.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: rs3Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, however, we focus our analysis on genes that specifically affect IL-8 secretion independent of NF-κB activation. Interestingly, many of the identified IL-8 regulators are present in loci associated with CD risk. Overall, the identified IL-8 regulators provide a molecular framework for understanding how NOD2-induced IL-8 secretion is controlled and offers insight into the molecular mechanisms that may be deregulated in inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn disease. IL-8 levels from frozen cell supernatants stored from our previously described siRNA screen (23.Warner N. Burberry A. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Sartor M.A. Núñez G. A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals positive and negative regulators of the NOD2 and NF-κB signaling pathways.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: rs3Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were measured by ELISA. Briefly, HEK293 cells stably expressing human NOD2 (HEK293-NOD2) were cultured on 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Pools of four distinct siGENOME siRNAs (Thermo Scientific) were reverse transfected at a concentration of 20 nm with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After 48 h, to allow for gene silencing, cells were stimulated with the NOD2 agonist MDP (20 ng/ml; Bachem) using a Thermo Labsystems Multidrop plate dispenser. Cell supernatants were collected 18 h later using a Biomek FX programmable robot (Beckman), sealed, and frozen at −20 °C. Experimental conditions were chosen based on initial optimization experiments testing different siRNA transfection protocols and varying the length and dose of MDP to achieve an ∼10-fold increase in IL-8 secretion after MDP stimulation relative to unstimulated cells. The concentration of human IL-8 was measured by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol adapted to a 384-well plate format. Cell supernatants were thawed and diluted 1:1 in assay buffer (Tris-buffered casein; Surmodics) and developed with TMB substrate (Surmodics). Concentrations of IL-8 were determined by comparison with an eight-point standard curve (in quadruplicate) prepared on each plate. Reporter cells were reverse transfected with 40 nm ON-TARGETplus siRNA pools (Thermo Scientific) for 48 h, followed by stimulation with either MDP (20 ng/ml) or human TNFα (10 ng/ml, R&D Biosystems) for 18 h. IL-8 levels were determined as described above, and NF-κB luciferase and viability assays were carried out as described previously (23.Warner N. Burberry A. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Sartor M.A. Núñez G. A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals positive and negative regulators of the NOD2 and NF-κB signaling pathways.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: rs3Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A custom-built database (MScreen) was used for data storage, display, and analysis. In order to compare IL-8 levels across assay plates, IL-8 values were normalized relative to RIPK2-specific and non-targeting (NT) siRNA present on each assay plate. The average amount of IL-8 (in pg/ml) from multiple wells receiving RIPK2-specific siRNA was considered as 100% inhibition, whereas the average amount of IL-8 in wells that received NT siRNA was considered as 0% inhibition. Therefore, test siRNA that resulted in decreased IL-8 secretion (relative to those receiving NT siRNA) resulted in values greater than 0, whereas test siRNAs that resulted in increased IL-8 secretion (relative to that of cells treated with NT siRNA) resulted in values less than 0. For assay plates stimulated with TNFα, IL-8 levels were normalized against wells receiving RELA-specific siRNA, which was considered as 100% inhibition. JAK Inhibitors were purchased from EMD Millipore (pan JAK inh (catalog no. 420099) and JAK2 inh (catalog no. 420139)). Total RNA was isolated using an EZNA Omega Biotek kit as directed by the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using predesigned gene-specific Taqman primers and probes, PCR master mix, and the StepOne PlusTM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Expression was normalized to that of GAPDH, and expression levels were analyzed by the 2−ΔΔCt method. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from B6 mice were immortalized as described previously (24.Adami C. Brunda M.J. Palleroni A.V. In vivo immortalization of murine peritoneal macrophages: a new rapid and efficient method for obtaining macrophage cell lines.J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 53: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and were transfected using the INTERFERinTM polyplus transfection reagent (VWR) as described by the manufacturer. Staphylococcus aureus (strain 8325-4, a gift from Timothy Foster, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland) was inoculated into brain heart infusion medium and incubated overnight at 30 °C with shaking. Overnight cultures were subcultured into fresh media and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for ∼2 h until reaching an A600 of 0.6. The bacteria were washed and diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 40,000 bacteria were added to each well, giving a bacterium/HEK293-NOD2 cell ratio of ∼1:1. After a 1-h infection, gentamicin (50 ng/µl; Invitrogen) was added to the media. Supernatants were collected after 18 h. We previously reported a genome-wide siRNA screen targeting 18,100 human genes to identify regulators of NOD2-induced NF-κB activation (23.Warner N. Burberry A. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Sartor M.A. Núñez G. A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals positive and negative regulators of the NOD2 and NF-κB signaling pathways.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: rs3Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To further examine the relationship between NOD2 signaling and IL-8 secretion downstream of NF-κB activation, we measured the levels of IL-8 present in cell supernatants by ELISA (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Genes whose silencing decreases IL-8 secretion were classified as positive regulators, whereas genes whose knockdown increased IL-8 secretion were categorized as negative regulators (Fig. 1B). Relative IL-8 levels were normalized against multiple positive (RIPK2) and negative siRNA controls on each assay plate (supplemental Fig. S2) and are reported in supplemental Table S1. Histogram analysis reveals a non-normal distribution skewed toward negative regulators (supplemental Fig. S3). Duplicate IL-8 measurements from independent replica plates were collected, and linear correlation analysis shows a high degree of reproducibility (supplemental Fig. S4). As previously reported, the effect of gene silencing on cell viability was quantified to control for nonspecific effects on cell number (23.Warner N. Burberry A. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Sartor M.A. Núñez G. A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals positive and negative regulators of the NOD2 and NF-κB signaling pathways.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: rs3Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As expected, genes whose knockdown significantly reduces cell viability tend to have decreased levels of IL-8 secretion, whereas gene knockdown resulting in increased viability tends to result in increased IL-8 levels (supplemental Fig. S5). Therefore, to reduce false positives related to nonspecific effects on cell number, genes whose silencing either enhances IL-8 secretion and increases viability (>120%) or decreases both IL-8 secretion and viability (<70%) were considered inconclusive with respect to their effect on NOD2-induced IL-8 secretion. Numerous genes known to affect IL-8 production are identified as hits in the screen, thereby validating our experimental approach (Fig. 1C). For example, it is well known that IL-8 production is strongly regulated at the transcriptional level by NF-κB- and AP-1-responsive elements in the IL-8 promoter (25.Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon γ synergistically induce interleukin 8 production in a human gastric cancer cell line through acting concurrently on AP-1 and NF-κB-like binding sites of the interleukin 8 gene.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, knockdown of the NF-κB transcription factor RELA or its binding partner RNF31 diminishes both NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion, consistent with their previously reported roles in NOD2 signaling (23.Warner N. Burberry A. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Sartor M.A. Núñez G. A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals positive and negative regulators of the NOD2 and NF-κB signaling pathways.Sci.

Cell. 2012; 46: 746-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, silencing the NOD2 binding protein, CAD, which has previously been implicated in the negative regulation of NOD2 signaling (27.Richmond A.L. Kabi A. Homer C.R. Marina-García N. Nickerson K.P. Nesvizhskii A.I. Sreekumar A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nuñez G. McDonald C.

By comparing our previously reported regulators of NOD2-induced NF-κB activation with this IL-8 data set, we were able to identify 87 positive and 100 negative regulators that concordantly increase or decrease both NF-κB activity and IL-8 secretion, respectively (Fig. 1D and supplemental Table S2). Of greater interest, we were able to identify many genes that specifically influenced IL-8 secretion without affecting NF-κB induction. These genes, which we refer to as IL-8-specific regulators, probably influence IL-8 secretion either downstream of NF-κB or via parallel pathways. For example, silencing SFPQ, an IL-8 mRNA-binding protein that negatively regulates IL-8 expression by sequestering IL-8 mRNA into nuclear paraspeckles (28.Imamura K. Imamachi N. Akizuki G. Kumakura M. Kawaguchi A. Nagata K. Kato A. Kawaguchi Y. Sato H. Yoneda M. Kai C. Yada T. Suzuki Y. Yamada T. Ozawa T. Kaneki K. Inoue T. Kobayashi M. Kodama T. Wada Y. Sekimizu K. Akimitsu N.

Cell. 2014; 53: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), enhances IL-8 secretion without affecting NF-κB activity. Furthermore, many groups have shown a role for the MAPK pathway in the regulation of IL-8 secretion (29.Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nuñez G. Flavell R.A. Nod2-dependent regulation of innate and adaptive immunity in the intestinal tract.Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar), and, although siRNAs targeting individual MAPKs did not significantly affect IL-8 secretion in our screen, presumably due to genetic redundancy, knockdown of the MAPK substrate, ATF-2 (activating transcription factor-2), which binds to and activates the IL-8 promoter (30.Hisatsune J. Nakayama M. Isomoto H. Kurazono H. Mukaida N. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Azuma T. Yamaoka Y. Sap J. Yamasaki E. Yahiro K. Moss J. Hirayama T.

In another case, DUSP1, a MAPK phosphatase that down-regulates MAPK activity, was identified as an IL-8-specific negative regulator, consistent with previous reports (32.Manetsch M. Che W. Seidel P. Chen Y. Ammit A.J. MKP-1: a negative feedback effector that represses MAPK-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine secretion in human airway smooth muscle cells.Cell.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), two NOD2-binding proteins known to negatively regulate NOD2 signaling, increases IL-8 secretion. In total, 218 IL-8-specific positive regulators and 391 IL-8-specific negative regulators were identified that either decrease or increase IL-8 secretion, respectively, without major effects on NF-κB activation (Fig. 1D and supplemental Table S3). These results highlight the utility of monitoring IL-8 at the protein level, thereby allowing us to interrogate genes that influence either parallel pathways (i.e. the MAPK pathway) or pathways downstream of NF-κB induction that are specific to IL-8 secretion, thereby providing additional insight into the molecular mechanisms that control NOD2 signaling. Given that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate the assembly and regulation of signal transduction pathways, we examined proteins that interact with known core components of the NOD2/IL-8 signaling pathway using the STRING (36.Franceschini A. Szklarczyk D. Frankild S. Kuhn M. Simonovic M. Roth A. Lin J. Minguez P. Bork P. von Mering C. Jensen L.J.

Many NOD2-, RIPK2-, RELA-, and MAPK-associated proteins affect IL-8 secretion (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S6). In addition, we asked whether gene knockdown of proteins reported to interact with NOD2 in the literature (supplemental Table S4) influenced IL-8 secretion. Under the conditions used in the screen, 8 of 44 reported NOD2-interacting proteins affect IL-8 secretion, and numerous other proteins that interact with these known NOD2-associated proteins affect IL-8 secretion (supplemental Fig. S7). Finally, using various sources, including recently reported NOD1 (39.Yeretssian G. Correa R.G. Doiron K. Fitzgerald P. Dillon C.P. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Saleh M.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) siRNA screens (supplemental Table S5), we were able to identify supporting evidence in the literature for many of the identified IL-8 regulators. Overall, the supporting evidence provided by overlaying information from PPI networks and other relevant “omics” data sets increases the confidence in the validity of the identified IL-8 regulators. To minimize false positives due to off-target effects, a secondary validation screen was performed using alternative siRNA pools. In total, 554 genes whose silencing affected MDP-induced IL-8 secretion in the primary screen were assessed in triplicate, validating 53 positive and 83 negative regulators (supplemental Table S6). For example, RIPK2, RELA, and ELF4, which encodes a transcription factor that binds to the IL-8 promoter (42.Hedvat C.V. Yao J. Sokolic R.A. Nimer S.D.

The density and composition of the intestinal microbiome shift with age (51.Wong C.N. Ng P. Douglas A.E. Low-diversity bacterial community in the gut of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster.Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 13: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and genetic studies suggest that microbial signatures lead to intestinal dysplasia through the induction of stem cell division (32.Buchon N. Broderick N.A. Chakrabarti S. Lemaitre B. Invasive and indigenous microbiota impact intestinal stem cell activity through multiple pathways in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2333-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the insulin or JNK pathway delays the onset of dysplasia, lowers rates of ISC division, and expands host longevity (44.Biteau B. Karpac J. Supoyo S. Degennaro M. Lehmann R. Jasper H. Lifespan extension by preserving proliferative homeostasis in Drosophila.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001159Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, despite correlations between the microbiome and ISC division, the contributions of the microbiome to host longevity are unclear. One study implied a beneficial effect of the microbiome for host life span (52.Brummel T. Ching A. Seroude L. Simon A.F. Benzer S. Drosophila lifespan enhancement by exogenous bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and another study suggested that the microbiome has no effect on host longevity (47.Ren C. Webster P. Finkel S.E. Tower J. Increased internal and external bacterial load during Drosophila aging without life-span trade-off.Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 144-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In addition, there are no data on the phenotypic consequences of direct manipulation of the intestinal cell cycle program. Thus, the relationship between the intestinal microflora, ISC proliferation, and host longevity remains unclear. To address this question, we genetically manipulated cell cycle progression in the intestines of otherwise normal flies and examined the phenotypic consequences for the host. We found that modification of the cell cycle in progenitor cells or enterocytes invariably disrupted intestinal homeostasis. Nonetheless, we did not see obvious effects of deregulated proliferation on the longevity of conventionally reared (CR) flies. Instead, we observed that ISC division is required for maintenance of stem cell numbers. Inhibition of cell division diminished the number of stem cells and altered the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression profile of the host. Our data suggest an intimate link between proliferation and homeostasis that is independent of fly longevity. All experiments were performed with virgin male and female flies. w1118 flies were used as the wild-type strain. Unless stated otherwise, flies were raised on standard cornmeal medium (Nutri-Fly Bloomington Formulation, Genesee Scientific) at 29 °C. Germ-free (GF) flies were generated by raising adult flies in standard medium supplemented with an antibiotic mixture (100 µg/ml ampicillin, 50 µg/ml vancomycin, 100 µg/ml neomycin, and 100 µg/ml metronidazole dissolved in ethanol) described previously (53.Ryu J.H.

CR control flies were raised on cornmeal medium supplemented with ethanol. Minimal medium was prepared by mixing equal volumes of water and instant Drosophila medium (Carolina Biological Supply Co.). Dyed medium for the Smurf assay was prepared by adding 1% (w/v) erioglaucine disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) to fly food medium.

Mitotic clones were generated with flies of the following genotype: y, w, hs-flp, UAS-mCD8:GFP;neoFRT(40A)/tubGAL80, neoFRT(40A). For survival curve analysis, 40–50 flies were raised in vials, with 10 flies/vial, and transferred to fresh vials weekly. Adults flies were washed with 95% ethanol and dissected in PBS, and guts were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Guts were rinsed with PBS and blocked overnight in PBSTBN (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% BSA, and 1% normal goat serum) at 4 °C. Guts were stained for 3 h at room temperature in PBSTBN with the appropriate primary antibodies, washed with PBSTB (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% BSA), and stained for 1 h at room temperature in PBSTBN with Hoechst 33258 (1:500; Molecular Probes) and the appropriate secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 and 568 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, Molecular Probes). The guts were washed with PBSTB and rinsed with PBS prior to visualization. The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: mouse anti-Delta (1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank C594.9B), mouse anti-Armadillo (1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank N2 7A1), mouse anti-Prospero (1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank MR1A), and rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000). For TUNEL assays, dissected guts of virgin female flies were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed with PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated in 100 µl of TUNEL labeling mixture/enzyme solution (in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red, Roche Applied Science) and Hoechst 33258 at room temperature. Gut were washed with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min, washed with PBS overnight, and visualized. Samples were mounted on slides in Fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich F4680), and the posterior midgut was visualized with a spinning disk confocal microscope (Quorum WaveFX, Quorum Technologies Inc.). Images were collected as a Z-series and processed with Fiji software to generate a single Z-stacked image. Cell numbers were counted using the Harmony software package (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Electron microscopy was performed at the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry Core Imaging Cell Imaging Centre of the University of Alberta. Virgin female flies were raised for 10 days at 29 °C. Flies were placed in empty vials for 2 h prior to infection. Pseudomonas entomophila was prepared to an absorbance of 200 in 5% sucrose in PBS. Ten flies/vial were infected with 100 µl of P. entomophila preparations on cotton plugs, and mortality was measured at 8-h intervals The quantitative PCR protocol and primers used in this study have been described previously (56.Guntermann S. Foley E. The protein Dredd is an essential component of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in the Drosophila immune response.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30284-30294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from flies using the UltraClean microbial DNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial 16 S DNA was amplified with primers AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG (forward) and GGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT (reverse), and the croquemort promoter was amplified with the AATAGCCAAGGTGGGAATAATCCAG and CACCTGCGCCAGTTATCGACAGCTGAG primer pair. To determine the importance of enterocyte endoreplication for intestinal homeostasis, we used the myo1A[ts] TARGET system (myo1AGAL4;tubGAL80[ts], UASGFP) to express the G1-to-S phase transition inhibitor dacapo (dap) (55.Lane M.E. Sauer K. Wallace K. Jan Y.N. Lehner C.F. Vaessin H. Dacapo, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, stops cell proliferation during Drosophila development.Cell. 1996; 87: 1225-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) in adult enterocytes, and we examined the consequences in the adult posterior midgut. In this system, myo1AGAL4 marks enterocytes as GFP-positive cells (Fig. 1, A and C). Expression of dap in enterocytes greatly reduced the number of GFP-positive cells, and the residual population appeared smaller than their myo1A[ts]/+ counterparts (Fig. 1, B–E). Transmission electron microscopy revealed a conventional arrangement of progenitor cells interspersed between larger enterocytes in myo1A[ts]/+ midguts (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the nuclei of UASdap/+;myo1a[ts]/+ epithelial cells were smaller than those of their control counterparts (Fig. 1G); most cells were heavily vacuolated; and we frequently observed delamination of small irregularly shaped cells, suggesting elevated levels of cell death (Fig. 1G, arrowheads). In agreement with this hypothesis, we detected a substantial level of TUNEL staining in UASdap/+;myo1a[ts]/+ midguts (Fig. 1, H–K). Consistent with elevated enterocyte death, we found that inhibition of enterocyte endoreplication led to an increase in the relative proportion of enteroendocrine cells in UASdap/+;myo1a[ts]/+ midguts, as determined by quantification of Prospero-positive cells (Fig. 1, L–N). In short, inhibition of endoreplication disrupts midgut homeostasis with reduced numbers of enterocytes, widespread cell death, and increased proportions of enteroendocrine cells. To examine the impact of deregulated proliferation on midgut organization, we used the esg[ts] TARGET system (esgGAL4; UASGFP, tubGAL80[ts]) to accelerate or block the cell cycle of progenitor cells. Consistent with previous reports, we observed GFP expression in small regularly spaced basal progenitor cells in the posterior midgut of newly eclosed esg[ts]/+ adults (Fig. 2A). The organization of GFP deteriorated with age: the number of GFP-positive cells increased, and we observed GFP in epithelial cells (Fig. 2B). These data overlap with several studies that established progressive dysplasia in aging intestines. We initially used the esg[ts] system to accelerate proliferation of progenitor cells through expression of an active variant of the PDGF and VEGF receptor-related (pvrCA) receptor tyrosine kinase. We previously established that expression of pvrCA in posterior midgut progenitor cells accelerates ISC proliferation and increases the number of Dl-positive ISCs (15.Bond D. Foley E. Autocrine platelet-derived growth factor-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-related (Pvr) pathway activity controls intestinal stem cell proliferation in the adult Drosophila midgut.J. Biol.

Within 1 day of eclosion, we observed a large population of GFP-positive cells that included epithelial cells and resembled 20-day-old control es"
https://openalex.org/W2045605961,"HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, in part due to an altered high density lipoprotein profile exacerbated by down-modulation and impairment of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) activity by the HIV-1 protein Nef. However, the mechanisms of this Nef effect remain unknown. Here, we show that Nef interacts with an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin, which regulates folding and maturation of glycosylated proteins. Nef disrupted interaction between calnexin and ABCA1 but increased affinity and enhanced interaction of calnexin with HIV-1 gp160. The Nef mutant that did not bind to calnexin did not affect the calnexin-ABCA1 interaction. Interaction with calnexin was essential for functionality of ABCA1, as knockdown of calnexin blocked the ABCA1 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, reduced ABCA1 abundance, and inhibited cholesterol efflux; the same effects were observed after Nef overexpression. However, the effects of calnexin knockdown and Nef on cholesterol efflux were not additive; in fact, the combined effect of these two factors together did not differ significantly from the effect of calnexin knockdown alone. Interestingly, gp160 and ABCA1 interacted with calnexin differently; although gp160 binding to calnexin was dependent on glycosylation, glycosylation was of little importance for the interaction between ABCA1 and calnexin. Thus, Nef regulates the activity of calnexin to stimulate its interaction with gp160 at the expense of ABCA1. This study identifies a mechanism for Nef-dependent inactivation of ABCA1 and dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2076646500,"In this paper a novel application of a particular type of spiking neural network, a Polychronous Spiking Network, was used for financial time series prediction. It is argued that the inherent temporal capabilities of this type of network are suited to non-stationary data such as this. The performance of the spiking neural network was benchmarked against three systems: two “traditional”, rate-encoded, neural networks; a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and a Dynamic Ridge Polynomial neural network, and a standard Linear Predictor Coefficients model. For this comparison three non-stationary and noisy time series were used: IBM stock data; US/Euro exchange rate data, and the price of Brent crude oil. The experiments demonstrated favourable prediction results for the Spiking Neural Network in terms of Annualised Return and prediction error for 5-Step ahead predictions. These results were also supported by other relevant metrics such as Maximum Drawdown and Signal-To-Noise ratio. This work demonstrated the applicability of the Polychronous Spiking Network to financial data forecasting and this in turn indicates the potential of using such networks over traditional systems in difficult to manage non-stationary environments."
https://openalex.org/W2023068372,"Purpose Few studies has documented early relapse in luminal B/HER2-negative breast cancer. We examined prognostic factors for early relapse among these patients to improve treatment decision-making. Patients and Methods A total 398 patients with luminal B/HER2-negative breast cancer were included. Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to estimate disease-free survival and Cox regression to identify prognostic factors. Results Progesterone receptor (PR) negative expression was associated with higher tumor grade (p<.001) and higher Ki-67 index (p = .010). PR-negative patients received more chemotherapy than the PR-positive group (p = .009). After a median follow-up of 28 months, 17 patients (4.3%) had early relapses and 8 patients (2.0%) died of breast cancer. The 2-year disease-free survival was 97.7% in the PR-positive and 90.4% in the PR-negative groups (Log-rank p = .002). Also, patients with a high Ki-67 index (defined as >30%) had a reduced disease-free survival (DFS) when compared with low Ki-67 index group (≤30%) (98.0% vs 92.4%, respectively, Log-rank p = .013). In multivariate analysis, PR negativity was significantly associated with a reduced DFS (HR = 3.91, 95% CI 1.29–11.88, p = .016). Conclusion In this study, PR negativity was a prognostic factor for early relapse in luminal B/HER2-negative breast cancer, while a high Ki-67 index suggested a higher risk of early relapse."
https://openalex.org/W1965243989,"The relationship between disability and comorbidity on mortality is widely perceived as additive in clinical models of frailty.National data were retrospectively extracted from medical records of community hospital.There were of 12,804 acutely-disabled patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in Singapore rehabilitation community hospitals from 1996 through 2005 were followed up for death till 31 December 2011.Cox proportional-hazards regression to assess the interaction of comorbidity and disability at discharge on all-cause mortality.During a median follow-up of 10.9 years, there were 8,565 deaths (66.9%). The mean age was 73.0 (standard deviation: 11.5) years. Independent risk factors of mortality were higher comorbidity (p<0.001), severity of disability at discharge (p<0.001), being widowed (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.25-1.53), low socioeconomic status (aHR:1.40, 95%CI:1.29-1.53), discharge to nursing home (aHR:1.14, 95%CI:1.05-1.22) and re-admission into acute care (aHR:1.54, 95%CI:1.45-1.65). In the main effects model, those with high comorbidity had an aHR = 2.41 (95%CI:2.13-2.72) whereas those with total disability had an aHR = 2.28 (95%CI:2.12-2.46). In the interaction model, synergistic interaction existed between comorbidity and disability (p<0.001) where those with high comorbidity and total disability had much higher aHR = 6.57 (95%CI:5.15-8.37).Patients with greater comorbidity and disability at discharge, discharge to nursing home or re-admission into acute care, lower socioeconomic status and being widowed had higher mortality risk. Our results identified predictive variables of mortality that map well onto the frailty cascade model. Increasing comorbidity and disability interacted synergistically to increase mortality risk."

Previous studies have shown that high levels of anti-apoA-I IgGs are independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with myocardial infarction. Autoantibody responses to apoA-I can be polyclonal and it is likely that more than one epitope may exist. To identify the specific immunoreactive peptides in apoA-I, we have developed a set of methodologies and procedures to isolate, purify, and identify novel apoA-I endogenous epitopes. First, we generated high purity apoA-I from human plasma, using thiophilic interaction chromatography followed by enzymatic digestion specifically at lysine or arginine residues. Immunoreactivity to the different peptides generated was tested by ELISA using serum obtained from patients with acute myocardial infarction and high titers of autoantibodies to native apoA-I. The immunoreactive peptides were further sequenced by mass spectrometry. Our approach successfully identified two novel immunoreactive peptides, recognized by autoantibodies from patients suffering from myocardial infarction, who contain a high titer of anti-apoA-I IgG.

https://openalex.org/W2088010764,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as a major class of developmental regulators. Sequences of many miRNAs are highly conserved, yet they often exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity in expression among species and have been proposed as an important reservoir for adaptive evolution and divergence. With this in mind we studied miRNA expression during embryonic development of offspring from two contrasting morphs of the highly polymorphic salmonid Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), a small benthic morph from Lake Thingvallavatn (SB) and an aquaculture stock (AC). These morphs differ extensively in morphology and adult body size. We established offspring groups of the two morphs and sampled at several time points during development. Four time points (3 embryonic and one just before first feeding) were selected for high-throughput small-RNA sequencing. We identified a total of 326 conserved and 427 novel miRNA candidates in Arctic charr, of which 51 conserved and 6 novel miRNA candidates were differentially expressed among developmental stages. Furthermore, 53 known and 19 novel miRNAs showed significantly different levels of expression in the two contrasting morphs. Hierarchical clustering of the 53 conserved miRNAs revealed that the expression differences are confined to the embryonic stages, where miRNAs such as sal-miR-130, 30, 451, 133, 26 and 199a were highly expressed in AC, whereas sal-miR-146, 183, 206 and 196a were highly expressed in SB embryos. The majority of these miRNAs have previously been found to be involved in key developmental processes in other species such as development of brain and sensory epithelia, skeletogenesis and myogenesis. Four of the novel miRNA candidates were only detected in either AC or SB. miRNA candidates identified in this study will be combined with available mRNA expression data to identify potential targets and involvement in developmental regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1973696610,"Genome wide transcription analysis in response to stresses is important to provide a basis of effective engineering strategies to improve stress tolerance in crop plants. We assembled a Brassica rapa oligomeric microarray (Br135K microarray) using sequence information from 41,173 unigenes and analyzed the transcription profiles of two contrasting doubled haploid (DH) lines, Chiifu and Kenshin, under cold-treatments. The two DH lines showed great differences in electrolyte leakage below -4°C, but similar patterns from 4°C to -2°C. Cold-treatments induced 885 and 858 genes in Chiifu and Kenshin, respectively. Overall, 134, and 56 genes showed an intrinsic difference in expression in Chiifu and Kenshin, respectively. Among 5,349 genes that showed no hit found (NHF) in public databases, 61 and 24 were specifically expressed in Chiifu and Kenshin, respectively. Many transcription factor genes (TFs) also showed various characteristics of expression. BrMYB12, BrMYBL2, BrbHLHs, BrbHLH038, a C2H2, a WRKY, BrDREB19 and a integrase-type TF were induced in a Chiifu-specific fashion, while a bHLH (Bra001826/AT3G21330), bHLH, cycling Dof factor and two Dof type TFs were Kenshin specific. Similar to previous studies, a large number of genes were differently induced or regulated among the two genotypes, but many genes, including NHFs, were specifically or intrinsically expressed with genotype specificity. Expression patterns of known-cold responsive genes in plants resulted in discrepancy to membrane leakage in the two DH lines, indicating that timing of gene expression is more important to conferring freezing tolerance rather than expression levels. Otherwise, the tolerance will be related to the levels of transcripts before cold-treatment or regulated by other mechanisms. Overall, these results indicate common signaling pathways and various transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are working together during cold-treatment of B. rapa. Our newly developed Br135K oligomeric microarray will be useful for transcriptome profiling, and will deliver valuable insight into cold stresses in B. rapa."
https://openalex.org/W2060085436,"Previous studies showed that the amplitude and latency of the auditory offset cortical response depended on the history of the sound, which implicated the involvement of echoic memory in shaping a response. When a brief sound was repeated, the latency of the offset response depended precisely on the frequency of the repeat, indicating that the brain recognized the timing of the offset by using information on the repeat frequency stored in memory. In the present study, we investigated the temporal resolution of sensory storage by measuring auditory offset responses with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The offset of a train of clicks for 1 s elicited a clear magnetic response at approximately 60 ms (Off-P50m). The latency of Off-P50m depended on the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of the click train, which was the longest at 40 ms (25 Hz) and became shorter with shorter ISIs (2.5∼20 ms). The correlation coefficient r2 for the peak latency and ISI was as high as 0.99, which suggested that sensory storage for the stimulation frequency accurately determined the Off-P50m latency. Statistical analysis revealed that the latency of all pairs, except for that between 200 and 400 Hz, was significantly different, indicating the very high temporal resolution of sensory storage at approximately 5 ms."
https://openalex.org/W2061452826,"Tung tree (Vernicia fordii) provides the sole source of tung oil widely used in industry. Lack of fatty acid composition and molecular markers hinders biochemical, genetic and breeding research. The objectives of this study were to determine fatty acid profiles and develop unigene-derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in tung tree. Fatty acid profiles of 41 accessions showed that the ratio of α-eleostearic acid was increasing continuously with a parallel trend to the amount of tung oil accumulation while the ratios of other fatty acids were decreasing in different stages of the seeds and that α-eleostearic acid (18∶3) consisted of 77% of the total fatty acids in tung oil. Transcriptome sequencing identified 81,805 unigenes from tung cDNA library constructed using seed mRNA and discovered 6,366 SSRs in 5,404 unigenes. The di- and tri-nucleotide microsatellites accounted for 92% of the SSRs with AG/CT and AAG/CTT being the most abundant SSR motifs. Fifteen polymorphic genic-SSR markers were developed from 98 unigene loci tested in 41 cultivated tung accessions by agarose gel and capillary electrophoresis. Genbank database search identified 10 of them putatively coding for functional proteins. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that all 15 polymorphic SSR-associated unigenes were expressed in tung seeds and some of them were highly correlated with oil composition in the seeds. Dendrogram revealed that most of the 41 accessions were clustered according to the geographic region. These new polymorphic genic-SSR markers will facilitate future studies on genetic diversity, molecular fingerprinting, comparative genomics and genetic mapping in tung tree. The lipid profiles in the seeds of 41 tung accessions will be valuable for biochemical and breeding studies."
https://openalex.org/W2090499415,"Mitochondrial cytochrome c assembly requires the covalent attachment of heme by thioether bonds between heme vinyl groups and a conserved CXXCH motif of cytochrome c/c1. The enzyme holocytochrome c synthase (HCCS) binds heme and apocytochrome c substrate to catalyze this attachment, subsequently releasing holocytochrome c for proper folding to its native structure. We address mechanisms of assembly using a functional Escherichia coli recombinant system expressing human HCCS. Human cytochrome c variants with individual cysteine, histidine, double cysteine, and triple cysteine/histidine substitutions (of CXXCH) were co-purified with HCCS. Single and double mutants form a complex with HCCS but not the triple mutant. Resonance Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy support the proposal that heme puckering induced by both thioether bonds facilitate release of holocytochrome c from the complex. His-19 (of CXXCH) supplies the second axial ligand to heme in the complex, the first axial ligand was previously shown to be from HCCS residue His-154. Substitutions of His-19 in cytochrome c to seven other residues (Gly, Ala, Met, Arg, Lys, Cys, and Tyr) were used with various approaches to establish other roles played by His-19. Three roles for His-19 in HCCS-mediated assembly are suggested: (i) to provide the second axial ligand to the heme iron in preparation for covalent attachment; (ii) to spatially position the two cysteinyl sulfurs adjacent to the two heme vinyl groups for thioether formation; and (iii) to aid in release of the holocytochrome c from the HCCS active site. Only H19M is able to carry out these three roles, albeit at lower efficiencies than the natural His-19."
https://openalex.org/W1985862706,"Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer typically show favorable survival. However, identifying individuals at high risk of recurrence among these patients is a crucial issue. We tested the hypothesis that [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans can help predict prognosis in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.Between April 2004 and December 2008, 305 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who underwent FGD-PET were enrolled. Patients with luminal B subtype were identified by positivity for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) or high Ki67 (≥14%) according to criteria recently recommended by the St. Gallen panelists. The cut-off value of SUVmax was defined using the time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curve for recurrence-free survival (RFS).At a median follow up of 6.23 years, continuous SUVmax was a significant prognostic factor with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.21 (p = 0.021). The cut-off value of SUVmax was defined as 4. Patients with luminal B subtype (n = 82) or high SUVmax (n = 107) showed a reduced RFS (p = 0.031 and 0.002, respectively). In multivariate analysis for RFS, SUVmax carried independent prognostic significance (p = 0.012) whereas classification with immunohistochemical markers did not (p = 0.274). The Harell c-index was 0.729. High SUVmax was significantly associated with larger tumor size, positive nodes, HER2 positivity, high Ki67 (≥14%), high tumor grade, and luminal B subtype.Among patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, FDG-PET can help discriminate patients at high risk of tumor relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2049690424,"Cellular signaling pathways involving mTOR, PI3K and ERK have dominated recent studies of breast cancer biology, and inhibitors of these pathways have formed a focus of numerous clinical trials. We have chosen trametinib, a drug targeting MEK in the ERK pathway, to address two questions. Firstly, does inhibition of a signaling pathway, as measured by protein phosphorylation, predict the antiproliferative activity of trametinib? Secondly, do inhibitors of the mTOR and PI3K pathways synergize with trametinib in their effects on cell proliferation? A panel of 30 human breast cancer cell lines was chosen to include lines that could be classified according to whether they were ER and PR positive, HER2 over-expressing, and “triple negative”. Everolimus (targeting mTOR), NVP-BEZ235 and GSK2126458 (both targeting PI3K/mTOR) were chosen for combination experiments. Inhibition of cell proliferation was measured by IC50 values and pathway utilization was measured by phosphorylation of signaling kinases. Overall, no correlation was found between trametinib IC50 values and inhibition of ERK signaling. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was observed at trametinib concentrations not affecting proliferation, and sensitivity of cell proliferation to trametinib was found in cell lines with low ERK phosphorylation. Evidence was found for synergy between trametinib and either everolimus, NVP-BEZ235 or GSK2126458, but this was cell line specific. The results have implications for the clinical application of PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1976767729,"Neural output from the locomotor system for each arm and leg influences the spinal motoneuronal pools directly and indirectly through interneuronal (IN) reflex networks. While well documented in other species, less is known about the functions and features of convergence in common IN reflex system from cutaneous afferents innervating different foot regions during remote arm and leg movement in humans. The purpose of the present study was to use spatial facilitation to examine possible convergence in common reflex pathways during rhythmic locomotor limb movements. Cutaneous reflexes were evoked in ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle by stimulating (in random order) the sural nerve (SUR), the distal tibial nerve (TIB), and combined simultaneous stimulation of both nerves (TIB&SUR). Reflexes were evoked while participants performed rhythmic stepping and arm swinging movement with both arms and the leg contralateral to stimulation (ARM&LEG), with just arm movement (ARM) and with just contralateral leg movement (LEG). Stimulation intensities were just below threshold for evoking early latency (<80 ms to peak) reflexes. For each stimulus condition, rectified EMG signals were averaged while participants held static contractions in the stationary (stimulated) leg. During ARM&LEG movement, amplitudes of cutaneous reflexes evoked by combined TIB&SUR stimulation were significantly larger than simple mathematical summation of the amplitudes evoked by SUR or TIB alone. Interestingly, this extra facilitation seen during combined nerve stimulation was significantly reduced when performing ARM or LEG compared to ARM&LEG. We conclude that locomotor rhythmic limb movement induces excitation of common IN reflex pathways from cutaneous afferents innervating different foot regions. Importantly, activity in this pathway is most facilitated during ARM&LEG movement. These results suggest that transmission in IN reflex pathways is weighted according to the number of limbs directly engaged in human locomotor activity and underscores the importance of arm swing to support neuronal excitability in leg muscles."

The mechanisms that regulate the expansion of HSCs in vivo and in vitro remain unclear to date. Since the current set of surface markers only allow for the identification of a population of cells that is highly enriched for HSC activity, we will refer to the population of cells we expand as Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor cells (HSPCs). We describe here a novel approach to expand a cytokine-dependent Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell (HSPC) population ex vivo by culturing primary adult human or murine HSPCs with fusion proteins including the protein transduction domain of the HIV-1 transactivation protein (Tat) and either MYC or Bcl-2. HSPCs obtained from either mouse bone marrow, human cord blood, human G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood, or human bone marrow were expanded an average of 87 fold, 16.6 fold, 13.6 fold, or 10 fold, respectively. The expanded cell populations were able to give rise to different types of colonies in methylcellulose assays in vitro, as well as mature hematopoietic populations in vivo upon transplantation into irradiated mice. Importantly, for both the human and murine case, the ex vivo expanded cells also gave rise to a self-renewing cell population in vivo, following initial transplantation, that was able to support hematopoiesis upon serial transplantation. Our results show that a self-renewing cell population, capable of reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment, expanded ex vivo in the presence of Tat-MYC and Tat-Bcl-2 suggesting that this may be an attractive approach to expand human HSPCs ex vivo for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2004888965,"Qualitative characteristics of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs) are important in measuring the effectiveness of CTLs in controlling HIV-1 infections. Indeed, in recent studies patients who are naturally resistant to HIV-1 infections have been shown to possess CTLs that are of high functional avidity and have a high capacity to recognize HIV epitope variants, when compared to HIV-1 infection progressors. When developing efficacious vaccines, assays that can effectively measure CTL quality specifically in vivo are becoming increasingly important. Here we report the use of a recently developed high-throughput multi-parameter technique, known as the fluorescent target array (FTA) assay, to simultaneously measure CTL killing magnitude, functional avidity and epitope variant cross-reactivity in real time in vivo. In the current study we have applied the FTA assay as a screening tool to assess a large cohort of over 20 different HIV-1 poxvirus vaccination strategies in mice. This screen revealed that heterologous poxvirus prime-boost vaccination regimes (i.e., recombinant fowlpox (FPV)-HIV prime followed by a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV)-HIV booster) were the most effective in generating high quality CTL responses in vivo. In conclusion, we have demonstrated how the FTA assay can be utilized as a cost effective screening tool (by reducing the required number of animals by >100 fold), to evaluate a large range of HIV-1 vaccination strategies in terms of CTL avidity and variant cross-reactivity in an in vivo setting."

https://openalex.org/W2048727149,"Recombination mediator proteins (RMPs) are important for genome stability in all organisms. Several RMPs support two alternative reactions: initiation of homologous recombination and DNA annealing. We examined mechanisms of RMPs in both reactions with Mycobacterium smegmatis RecO (MsRecO) and demonstrated that MsRecO interacts with ssDNA by two distinct mechanisms. Zinc stimulates MsRecO binding to ssDNA during annealing, whereas the recombination function is zinc-independent and is regulated by interaction with MsRecR. Thus, different structural motifs or conformations of MsRecO are responsible for interaction with ssDNA during annealing and recombination. Neither annealing nor recombinase loading depends on MsRecO interaction with the conserved C-terminal tail of single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein (SSB), which is known to bind Escherichia coli RecO. However, similarly to E. coli proteins, MsRecO and MsRecOR do not dismiss SSB from ssDNA, suggesting that RMPs form a complex with SSB-ssDNA even in the absence of binding to the major protein interaction motif. We propose that alternative conformations of such complexes define the mechanism by which RMPs initiate the repair of stalled replication and support two different functions during recombinational repair of DNA breaks."

However, in the absence of strand specific sequencing information, the post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation in D. purpurea thus far remains unknown. In this study, a strand-specific RNA-Seq library was constructed and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq platforms to characterize the transcriptome of D. purpurea with a focus on alternative splicing (AS) events and the effect of AS on protein domains. De novo RNA-Seq assembly resulted in 48,475 genes. Based on the assembled transcripts, we reported a list of 3,265 AS genes, including 5,408 AS events in D. purpurea. Interestingly, both glycosyltransferases and monooxygenase, which were involved in the biosynthesis of cardiac glycosides, are regulated by AS. A total of 2,422 AS events occurred in coding regions, and 959 AS events were located in the regions of 882 unique protein domains, which could affect protein function.

https://openalex.org/W2014945183,"It has been clearly established that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKS) are important mediators of angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling via AT1 receptors in the vasculature. However, evidence for a role of these kinases in changes of Ang II-induced vasoconstriction in obesity is still lacking. Here we sought to determine whether vascular MAPKs are differentially activated by Ang II in obese animals. The role of AT2 receptors was also evaluated. Male monosodium glutamate-induced obese (obese) and non-obese Wistar rats (control) were used. The circulating concentrations of Ang I and Ang II, determined by HPLC, were increased in obese rats. Ang II-induced isometric contraction was decreased in endothelium-intact resistance mesenteric arteries from obese compared with control rats and exhibited a retarded AT1 receptor antagonist response. Blocking of AT2 receptors and inhibition of either endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) restored Ang II-induced contraction in obese rats. Western blot analysis revealed increased protein expression of AT2 receptors in arteries from obese rats. Basal and Ang II-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was also increased in obese rats. Blockade of either AT1 or AT2 receptors corrected the increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in arteries from obese rats to levels observed in control preparations. Phosphorylation of eNOS was increased in obese rats. Incubation with the ERK1/2 inhibitor before Ang II stimulation did not affect eNOS phosphorylation in control rats; however, it corrected the increased phosphorylation of eNOS in obese rats. These results clearly demonstrate that enhanced AT2 receptor and ERK1/2-induced, NO-mediated vasodilation reduces Ang II-induced contraction in an endothelium-dependent manner in obese rats."
https://openalex.org/W2050787692,"Background Since 2007, Guatemala integrated STI clinical service with an HIV prevention model into four existing public health clinics to prevent HIV infection, known as the VICITS strategy. We present the first assessment of VICITS scale-up, retention, HIV and STI prevalence trends, and risk factors associated with HIV infection among Female Sex Workers (FSW) attending VICITS clinics in Guatemala. Methods Demographic, behavioral and clinical data were collected using a standardized form. Data was analyzed by year and health center. HIV and STI prevalence were estimated from routine visits. Retention was estimated as the percent of new users attending VICITS clinics who returned for at least one follow-up visit to any VICITS clinic within 12 months. Separate multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to investigate factors associated with HIV infection and program retention. Results During 2007–2011 5,682 FSW visited a VICITS clinic for the first-time. HIV prevalence varied from 0.4% to 5.8%, and chlamydia prevalence from 0% to 14.3%, across sites. Attending the Puerto Barrios clinic, having a current syphilis infection, working primarily on the street, and using the telephone or internet to contact clients were associated with HIV infection. The number of FSW accessing VICITS annually increased from 556 to 2,557 (361%) during the period. In 2011 retention varied across locations from 7.7% to 42.7%. Factors negatively impacting retention included current HIV diagnosis, having practiced sex work in another country, being born in Honduras, and attending Marco Antonio Foundation or Quetzaltenango clinic sites. Systematic time trends did not emerge, however 2008 and 2010 were characterized by reduced retention. Conclusions Our data show local differences in HIV prevalence and clinic attendance that can be used to prioritize prevention activities targeting FSW in Guatemala. VICITS achieved rapid scale-up; however, a better understanding of the causes of low return rates is urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2054965757,"Inflammation is associated with immune cells infiltrating into the inflammatory site and pain. CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) mediates trafficking of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. However, the contribution of CCR1 to pain is incompletely understood. Here we report an unexpected discovery that CCR1-mediated trafficking of neutrophils and CCR1 activity on non-hematopoietic cells both modulate pain. Using a genetic approach (CCR1−/− animals) and pharmacological inhibition of CCR1 with selective inhibitors, we show significant reductions in pain responses using the acetic acid-induced writhing and complete Freund's adjuvant-induced mechanical hyperalgesia models. Reductions in writhing correlated with reduced trafficking of myeloid cells into the peritoneal cavity. We show that CCR1 is highly expressed on circulating neutrophils and their depletion decreases acetic acid-induced writhing. However, administration of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity did not enhance acetic acid-induced writhing in wild-type (WT) or CCR1−/− mice. Additionally, selective knockout of CCR1 in either the hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic compartments also reduced writhing. Together these data suggest that CCR1 functions to significantly modulate pain by controlling neutrophil trafficking to the inflammatory site and having an unexpected role on non-hematopoietic cells. As inflammatory diseases are often accompanied with infiltrating immune cells at the inflammatory site and pain, CCR1 antagonism may provide a dual benefit by restricting leukocyte trafficking and reducing pain."
https://openalex.org/W2009561113,"Saltation is an important geological process and the primary source of atmospheric mineral dust aerosols. Unfortunately, no studies to date have been able to precisely reproduce the saltation process because of the simplified theoretical models used. For example, sand particles in most of the existing wind sand movement models are considered to be spherical, the effects of the sand shape on the structure of the wind sand flow are rarely studied, and the effect of mid-air collision is usually neglected. In fact, sand grains are rarely round in natural environments. In this paper, we first analyzed the drag coefficients, drag forces, and starting friction wind speeds of sand grains with different shapes in the saltation process, then established a sand saltation model that considers the coupling effect between wind and the sand grains, the effect of the mid-air collision of sand grains, and the effect of the sand grain shape. Based on this model, the saltation process and sand transport rate of non-spherical sand particles were simulated. The results show that the sand shape has a significant impact on the saltation process; for the same wind speed, the sand transport rates varied for different shapes of sand grains by as much as several-fold. Therefore, sand shape is one of the important factors affecting wind-sand movement."
https://openalex.org/W2130891010,"Many species of mature forest-nesting birds (""forest birds"") undergo a pronounced shift in habitat use during the post-fledging period and move from their forest nesting sites into areas of early-successional vegetation. Mortality is high during this period, thus understanding the resource requirements of post-fledging birds has implications for conservation. Efforts to identify predictors of abundance of forest birds in patches of early-successional habitats have so far been equivocal, yet these previous studies have primarily focused on contiguously forested landscapes and the potential for landscape-scale influences in more fragmented and modified landscapes is largely unknown. Landscape composition can have a strong influence on the abundance and productivity of forest birds during the nesting period, and could therefore affect the number of forest birds in the landscape available to colonize early-successional habitats during the post-fledging period. Therefore, the inclusion of landscape characteristics should increase the explanatory power of models of forest bird abundance in early-successional habitat patches during the post-fledging period. We examined forest bird abundance and body condition in relation to landscape and habitat characteristics of 15 early-successional sites during the post-fledging season in Massachusetts. The abundance of forest birds was influenced by within-patch habitat characteristics, however the explanatory power of these models was significantly increased by the inclusion of landscape fragmentation and the abundance of forest birds in adjacent forest during the nesting period for some species and age groups. Our findings show that including factors beyond the patch scale can explain additional variation in the abundance of forest birds in early-successional habitats during the post-fledging period. We conclude that landscape composition should be considered when siting early-successional habitat to maximize its benefit to forest birds during the post-fledging period, and should also be included in future investigations of post-fledging habitat use by forest birds."
