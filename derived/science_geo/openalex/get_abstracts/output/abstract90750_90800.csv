https://openalex.org/W2007618593,"The human immune system offers special advantages for study of the development and evolution of the immune response. A variety of human cell lines are available that are arrested at various stages of development, and human genes provide a convenient evolutionary point of comparison with the already well characterized genes of the mouse. In this paper, we describe the procedure we have used to clone the human kappa chain genes in both germline and rearranged configurations. We have taken advantage of distantly related probes derived from the mouse and nonstringent conditions of hybridization to find the human genes among phage lambda recombinants formed with partially purified genomic restriction fragments of human DNA. In addition to establishing a physical map of the human kappa C and J regions, we have determined the entire sequence of a germline human constant region gene (the Inv3 allele) and two of its J segments, as well as the V/J recombination site of an active human kappa chain gene. For purposes of comparison, we also determined the sequence of the chromosomal mouse constant region gene and its flanking sequences. Although mouse and human sequences have changed extensively during the 70 million years since the two species diverged. significant blocks of homology have been conserved selectively. Some of these have obvious significance in terms of DNA and RNA splicing reactions. By forming heteroduplex structures between mouse and human genes we were able to identify four human J regions that are much more stringently conserved throughout their coding sequences than are the C region genes. In addition, the middle j structure (J3) of the mouse (which is thought to be inactive) appears to be missing from the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1967701670,"alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (RMI 71,782), a specific irreversible inhibitor of the first step in polyamine biosynthesis, that is, the formation of putrescine from ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase, cures mice infected with a virulent, rodent-passaged strain of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. This parasite is closely related to the trypanosomes that cause human sleeping sickness. The drug, which is remarkably nontoxic, was effective when administered in drinking water or by intubation. The ability of the compound to inhibit ornithine decarboxylase in vitro was demonstrated by the reduced amounts of putrescine synthesized from tritiated ornithine in Trypanosoma brucei suspensions. These observations direct attention to polyamine metabolism as a target for chemotherapy of parasitic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1522869477,"One of the major proteins secreted by Sertoli cells (Band 3) has a molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels which corresponds to rat serum transferrin. The preparation of Sertoli cell-secreted proteins contains an iron-binding protein with electrophoretic properties on native polyacrylamide gels similar to serum transferrin. Antibodies against Sertoli cell-secreted proteins contain a component which will immunoprecipitate serum transferrin. Antibodies to serum transferrin cross-react with and immunoprecipitate a major component (Band 3) of [35S]-methionine-labeled Sertoli cell-secreted proteins. We propose that testicular transferrin is a major secretory product of Sertoli cells in culture. In addition to transferrin, antiserum to rat serum proteins will immunoprecipitate one other polypeptide from preparations of Sertoli cell-secreted proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2044178660,"A transient increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine biosynthesis occurs in the intestinal mucosa of the newborn rat in the third week after birth. During this period, there is a rapid conversion of the mucosa from a fetal to a mature adult status. A similar increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity also accompanies the rapid recovery of the mucosa 1 week after an injury is induced by chemotherapy in adult rats. In vivo, alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine, a highly selective, enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor, suppresses these increases in mucosal ornithine decarboxylase and delays both intestinal mucosal maturation and recovery from injury. Thus increased ornithine decarboxylase activity, with the resultant increase in polyamine content, may play an essential role in intestinal mucosal maturation and regeneration in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W2091810736,"Immunoglobulin class switching involves specific DNA rearrangements of the gene segments coding for heavy chain constant regions (CH) during B lymphocyte differentiation. In two different cases of Cμ to Cα switching examined here (T15 and M603) and one taken from the literature (MC101), three different sites on the 5′ side of Cμ and three different sites on the 5′ side of Cα are joined together in the process of CH switching. The sequences surrounding the three germ-line Cα sites of recombination are highly conserved blocks of 30 nucleotides that may serve as recognition sequences for CH switching to the Cα gene. This putative recognition sequence is repeated 17 times in approximately 1400 nucleotides of the germ-line Cα 5′ flanking sequence. The lack of homology between this Cα sequence and sequences reported for the Cγ1 and Cγ2b switch sites suggests that heavy chain switching is mediated by class-specific recognition sequences and, presumably, class-specific regulatory mechanisms. In addition, it appears that in one example (MC101) CH switching progressed from Cμ to Cα to Cγ1. This switching pathway may present difficulties for the simple deletional model of CH switching."
https://openalex.org/W1964134937,"Genomic Southern blotting analysis reveals that a 5' flanking DNA sequence located 1.5-2.0 kb upstream from the C mu and C alpha genes undergoes extensive length variation in the germlines of inbred and wild mice. In addition, genomic clones of the BALB/c C mu gene undergo deletion events during their propagation in Charon 4A when maintained in RecA+ bacterial strains. These deletion events occur between the JH cluster and the C mu gene and approximately 2.0 kb 5' of the C alpha gene, and may encompass several kb of DNA. Deletion events are capable of yielding a group of C mu clones which differ in size by units of 100-200 bp. The site of length variation in the mouse germline corresponds to the location of these cloning-derived deletion events, suggesting that both phenomena are reflections of intrinsic genetic properties of these Ig gene 5' flanking sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2022109629,"Growth and function of primary cultures of granulosa cells obtained from immature, hypophysectomized, estrogen-treated rats were compared in serum-containing and serum-free media. In serum-free medium (1:1 mixture of DMEM:F-12) supplemented with insulin, hydrocortisone, transferrin and fibronectin (4F medium), the cells remained healthy and steroidogenically responsive for at least 60 days in culture. The growth profile of the granulosa cells in 4F medium was similar to that obtained in serum-containing medium. In both media cell proliferation did not exceed more than one cell doubling. DMEM:F-12 alone did not support the cell viability. Upon FSH stimulation, the cells produced 25 fold more progestin and estrogen per cell in 4F medium than in medium supplemented with 5% serum. This effect was not directly related to serum proteins which mediate cell adhesion since cells cultured in dishes precoated with serum remained steroidogenically responsive to FSH. Cholera toxin and Bt2-cAMP readily stimulated progestin production in the presence of serum. The inhibitory effect of serum was not reversed by adding the four factors to serum-containing medium. The factors were essential for the FSH-induced steroidogenesis in serum-free medium. After four days of incubation in 4F medium, the cells showed a transient loss of their ability to produce progestin in response to FSH. In both 4F medium as well as in serum-containing medium, the cells regained their hormonal responsiveness after 35 days in culture. Since the loss of hormonal responsiveness occurred at the same time as growth was initiated in the cultures, it is suggested that the FSH-induced steroidogenesis is negatively controlled by growth-related processes."
https://openalex.org/W2073573493,"Heat shock, deciliation and release from anoxia result in similar alterations in the pattern of protein synthesis in starved Tetrahymena pyriformis. In each case, synthesis of the same set of (at least) 16 polypeptides is induced, and many of these polypeptides accumulate in stainable amounts within 50 min. The molecular weights of these proteins, which we refer to as stress proteins (sp), are very similar to those of the heat shock polypeptides of Drosophila. Heat shock and deciliation also lead to similar changes in proteins associated with isolated nuclei. One stress-induced polypeptide, designated sp29c, is highly enriched in the nucleus. This protein is undetectable in control cells but is synthesized in response to stress and accumulates in the nucleus in stainable amounts within 50 min. It is not released by staphylococcal nuclease digestion, suggesting that it is not chromatin-associated. Three other stress-induced proteins, sp73 and sp75a and b, are also present in nuclei isolated from stressed cells but, unlike sp29c, are not enriched in this compartment. Another protein, which is present in stainable quantities in the cytoplasm of control cells, appears to be translocated to the nucleus after stress."
https://openalex.org/W2070957765,"A single DNA fragment containing both mu and delta immunoglobulin heavy chain genes has been cloned from normal BALB/c mouse liver DNA with a new lambda phage vector Charon 28. The physical distance between the membrane terminal exon of mu and the first domain of delta is 2466 base pairs, with delta on the 3' side of mu. A single transcript could contain a variable region and both mu and delta constant regions. The dual expression of immunoglobulins M and D on spleen B cells may be due to alternate splicing of this transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2070017545,"Two types of immature B cells, namely fetal liver hybridomas and the leukemic cell line 70Z/3, both of which have cytoplasmic mu chains but no light chains, were examined for DNA rearrangements of their light chain and heavy chain immunoglobulin genes. In the fetal liver hybridomas, which were constructed from fetal liver cells and a tumor cell, no light chain gene rearrangement was observed, whereas in the 70Z/3 cell line a kappa light chain rearrangement probably occurred. The results suggest that, although the lack of light chain synthesis can be due to a lack of gene rearrangement, there may also be transcriptional regulation, which may also be important for the expression of light chain immunoglobulins in immature B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014040442,"When cells and tissues of Drosophila are subjected to elevated temperatures, the pattern of protein synthesis shifts from the production of a broad spectrum of different proteins to the vigorous production of a small number of new, heat shock proteins. The intracellular distribution of these proteins has been investigated through autoradiographic analysis of cells labeled with 3H-leucine at 25° and 37°C. After examining sections of cultured cells from D. melanogaster and polytene cells of D. virilis by electron and light microscopy, we conclude that little (if any) heat shock protein becomes associated with mitochondria, despite the many lines of evidence linking the response to respiratory stress. Confirming earlier reports on the presence of heat shock proteins in nuclei, we find the proteins are very highly concentrated there and that their transport to the nucleus occurs very rapidly. Interestingly, their free concentration in the nuclear sap is extremely low; they are, in fact, quantitatively associated with chromosomes. This association occurs in a nonrandom manner, their concentration in highly condensed chromatin being very low relative to that of other chromosomal loci."

https://openalex.org/W1571327350,"Inhibitors of arachidonic acid oxygenation can inhibit polymorphonuclear leukocyte lysosomal enzyme release, aggregation, and generation of activated oxygen species, as stimulated by N-formylated chemotactic peptides. Guinea Guinea pig peritoneal leukocytes were prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 5-monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were identified as products produced by these cells. Both Ionophore A23187 and the N-formylated peptide, N-formylmethionylphenylalanine, significantly stimulated release of these products, with the exception of a lack of effect of N-formylmethionylphenylalanine on 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. This metabolite was found to be produced by contaminating mononuclear cells unresponsive to N-formylmethionylphenylalanine stimulation when cell preparations purified to 96 leads to 99% polymorphonuclear cells were studied. The ability of N-formylmethionylphenylalanine to stimulate arachidonic acid metabolism of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was specifically antagonized by a competitive blocker of the formylated peptide receptor, t-butoxy-carbonyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. The results indicate that metabolism of arachidonic acid induced by N-formylmethionylphneylalanine could play a role in the responses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to this peptide."

https://openalex.org/W1559734347,"The role of myosin phosphorylation in regulating smooth muscle contraction has been investigated by quantitating the myosin phosphate content of tracheal smooth muscle frozen during contraction or relaxation. Myosin was purified from quick-frozen muscle samples with the aid of antibodies prepared against tracheal smooth muscle myosin, and the phosphate content was determined after separation of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin subunits by isoelectric focusing. The myosin phosphate content increased from an initial value of 0.50 to 1.1 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin within 3 min after the addition of 100 microM methacholine to resting tracheal smooth muscle. Myosin phosphorylation coincided temporally with the increase in isometric tension. Tracheal smooth muscles relaxed and the phosphate content decreased from 1.2 to 0.50 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin upon the addition of 10 microM atropine to muscles which had been previously contracted with 100 microM methacholine. Incubating methacholine-contracted muscles in a calcium-free Krebs buffer relaxed tracheal smooth muscles and reduced the phosphate content to 0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin. Addition of 3 mM CaCl2 to these muscles elicited an increase in isometric tension concomitant with phosphorylation of myosin. These results support the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is important in regulating smooth muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1550646996,"1. Rat liver mitochondria undergo a spontaneous, respiration-dependent K+ extrusion which is accelerated by citrate. This K+ efflux is electroneutral and is considered to occur on an endogenous K/H exchanger. The spontaneous efflux, but not nigericin-induced K/H exchange, is always preceded by a lag phase, suggesting that the lag phase is a characteristic property of the endogenous exchange reaction. 2. K+ extrusion induced by ionophore A23187 also has the characteristics of K/H exchange. The rate of K+ efflux is faster and the lag time is shorter when compared to endogenous K+ efflux. The effects of A23187 on the lag phase suggest that the ionophore acts by unmasking the endogenous exchanger. This conclusion is supported by the finding that K+ efflux rates reach a maximum which cannot be exceeded by increasing the dose of A23187 but is exceeded by adding nigericin. 3. Steady state perturbation studies were carried out on respiring mitochondria in which electrophoretic K+ influx was balanced by electroneutral K+ efflux. These steady states were appropriately shifted in opposite directions by additions of nigericin or valinomycin. In contrast, addition of A23187 had no effect. It is concluded that A23187 is incapable of transporting K+ in rat liver mitochondria. 4. These results are consistent with a model in which free matrix Mg2+ acts as a K/H carrier brake. The proposed role of this carrier-brake mechanism is to provide volume homeostasis with minimal energy expenditure. According to this model, both citrate and A23187 stimulate K/H exchange by reducing Mg2+ activity within the matrix. Citrate acts by complexation of Mg2+, while A23187 acts by transporting Mg2+ out of the matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1551043917,"A PBS2 phage-coded inhibitor of uracil-DNA glycosylase activity from Bacillus subtilis has been purified extensively and characterized preliminary. The inhibitor has a relative S value of 1.44 +/- 0.08 measured by sedimentation in 15 to 40% glycerol density gradients. It is unusually stable to heating and to the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and/or 8 M urea. The inhibitor has no known cofactor requirement and is active in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. Inhibitor activity is sensitive to digestion with proteinase K, but is insensitive to DNase or RNase digestion. The purified inhibitor behaves anomalously during electrophoresis in poly-acrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate; however, experiments designed to show that the inhibitor is a glycoprotein were negative. The inhibitor clearly contains a protein required for activity, however, the possibility that some other molecular component is part of the active inhibitor cannot be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2170526750,"The indirect 125I-fibrin plate assay has been used to measure the levels of plasminogen activator (PA) in uterine flushings from pigs through the estrous cycle and during early pregnancy, and to measure the production of PA by pig conceptuses cultured in vitro. Activity in the flushings was high at the beginning and end of the estrous cycle, but only low levels were detected in mid cycle (the luteal phase). In pregnant animals, uterine PA levels became low around day 12 and did not show any further increase. Cultured day 12 blastocysts, however, released large amounts of PA into the medium in a time-dependent fashion over a 48 hr period, suggesting that this activity was inhibited in vivo. The presence of a protease inhibitor in uterine flushings has been demonstrated in cycling gilts, and follows a hormone-directed trend, with flushings taken during the luteal phase showing inhibitory activity against PA secreted early or late in the cycle. By assaying flushings from ovariectomized gilts given daily injections of progesterone, estrogen, both hormones together, or corn coil, it has been verified that the inhibitor is progesterone-induced and is also active against both PA produced by day 12 conceptuses and urokinase. It also inhibits PA, as determined using a direct fluorometric assay with glutaryl-glycyl-L-arginine-4-methyl-coumarinyl-7-amide as substrate. The PA inhibitor is acid-stable, and of low molecular weight (15,000 ± 5000), as determined by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. Unlike most animals, the trophoblast of the pig is not invasive in the uterus, but is invasive if transplanted to some ectopic site. The progesterone-induced inhibitor may possibly play a role in preventing invasive implantation."
https://openalex.org/W1594797965,"Three mutants with ribosomes apparently lacking Protein L11, AM68, AM76, and AM77, were investigated using a variety of immunological techniques to determine whether L11 was indeed lacking. Ouchterlony double diffusion, modified immunoelectrophoresis, and dimer formation on sucrose gradients all gave results indicating Protein L11 was missing from the ribosome in these mutants. Electron micrographs of ribosomes of the mutants were indistinguishable from those of wild type. Ribosomes of AM68, AM76, and AM77, did not bind the antibiotic thiostrepton, but binding was recovered upon reconstitution with wild type Protein L11."

https://openalex.org/W1576149482,"The segment corresponding to residues 121 to 164 of human plasma apolipoprotein A-I (apo-A-I) has been synthesized by the Merrifield solid phase method. The peptide binds to unilamellar phospholipid vesicles and to phospholipid-cholesterol mixed vesicles. The surface affinity of the peptide measured in this way indicated that the mechanism of binding is the same as that of apo A-I (144-165) and apo A-I itself. The peptide appears to be a globular monomer in a aqueous solution, with 17% alpha helix content. The peptide bound to vesicles activates lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase: compared to apo A-I, the peptide is about 30% as efficient in the activation of cholesterol esterification and of phospholipid hydrolysis when the surface is saturated by the activator. For a variety of amphiphilic peptides and for apo A-I, the lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase-activating ability correlates well with their alpha helix contents in 50% trifluoroethanol."

The results demonstrate the essential role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the maintenance of reproductive functions and have implications for the regulation of male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2139671226,"When a cloned 6 kb Eco RI-Sal I fragement of mouse ribosomal gene nontranscribed spacer DNA (rDNA NTS) was used to screen a BALB/c mouse gene library, 25% of the recombinant phage hybridized with it. In situ hybridization experiments and characterization of 12 clones selected using this probe supported the idea that sequences homologous to this rDNA NTS region are scattered throughout the genome. Subsequently, sequences homologous to mouse rDNA NTS were found flanking mouse mu, alpha and gamma 2b immunoglobulin CH genes. One region was localized 3' to the mu coding sequence, an area which has been identified as an intervening sequence between the secreted C mu heavy chain terminus and the C terminal portion of the membrane-bound C mu heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1549556389,"Net rates of synthesis and secretion into the medium for hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate have been calculated at varying cell densities of fibroblastic cell cultures from several tissues of the neonatal rat, utilizing an improved technique for glycosaminoglycan microquantitation. The incorporation of radioactivity from [3H]glucosamine and 35SO4 into the separated glycosaminoglycans from the cell surface and the cell pellet have also been estimated at varying cell densities. For rat muscle, skin, and heart fibroblasts, the net rate of hyaluronic acid synthesis per cell per day decreased rapidly with increasing cell densities, and the data best fit a linear relationship if plotted on semilog coordinates. The relationship of cell density to net chondroitin sulfate synthesis is more complex, but in the medium fraction a linear relationship is most closely approximated by plotting the data on linear coordinates. Glucose supplementation experiments and comparative rates of uptake of glucose from the medium by the various lines indicate that glucose depletion had only minor effects on the net synthesis and secretion of medium glycosaminoglycans. The y intercepts of linear plots of net glycosaminoglycan synthesis with varying cell density can be considered to reflect rates of synthesis and secretion at infinitely low cell densities. Under defined culture conditions, this value may be useful in characterizing the intrinsic synthetic capability of fibroblastic lines independent of the modifying influence of cell density."
https://openalex.org/W1597979925,"In this paper, we examined the effect of two known inhibitors of prostacyclin synthetase, tranylcypromine and 15-hydroperoxyarachidonate, on bradykinin-stimulated prostacyclin synthesis and arachidonic acid release from cellular phospholipids in endothelial cells derived from calf aorta. These two inhibitors inhibit prostacyclin synthesis stimulated by bradykinin, arachidonic acid, and ionophore A23187. However, these two inhibitors also affect the release of arachidonic acid from cells. Using cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, we found that bradykinin-stimulated arachidonic acid release is severely inhibited by tranylcypromine (500 microgram/ml) but is stimulated by 15-hydroxyperoxyarachidonate at a concentration as low as 1 microgram/ml. We also found that 15-hydroperoxyarachidonate inhibits not only prostacyclin formation but also prostaglandin formation from the released arachidonic acid. Under the conditions used, these two compounds have no effects on the cell viability as judged by trypan blue exclusion test. We conclude that tranylcypromine and 15-hydroperoxyarachidonate not only inhibit prostacyclin synthesis but also affect other steps in the metabolism of arachidonic acid in whole cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514467819,"Horse neutrophils incorporate exogenous [14C]arachidonate into phosphatidic acid very rapidly. This acylation of phosphatidate with arachidonate is followed quickly and spontaneously by its deacylation. This transient formation of arachidonyl-phosphatidate, which reflects a rapidly turning over pool of arachidonate-associated lipid, is not observed with stearic acid or other phospholipids or triglycerides. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinosinositol, and triglycerides are slowly but increasingly labeled with time. Ionophore A23187 (10 microM) stimulates the extent of labeling of phosphatidate while decreasing the labeling of all the other phospholipids and triglycerides. Phosphatidate is not transiently labeled with [14C]stearate of (32P)orthophosphate, either in the presence or absence of ionophore A23187. When cells are prelabeled for 2 h with very high quantities of (32P)orthophosphate a very substantial fraction (i.e. 20 to 30%) of the phospholipid radioactivity is associated with phosphatidic acid. However, on addition of exogenous arachidonate, there is no increase in [32P]phosphatidate in these prelabeled cells. Thus, the entire phosphatidate molecule does not appear to be turned over during the process described above. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities such as BW755C, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and low concentrations of indomethacin do not affect the labeling of phospholipids. However, eicosatetraynoic acid, an analog of arachidonate, and high concentration (0.1 mM) of indomethacin can block [14C]arachidonate incorporation into lipids. The rapid turnover of the 2-acyl position in phosphatidate might be related to a specific process of fatty acid mobilization within neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1585577088,"The N-acylsaccharins and N-acylbenzoisothiazolinones form a new class of acylating inhibitors of the serine proteases with a broad spectrum of activity. However, they are unique in that they are able to differentiate between various serine proteases because of the differential stability of the presumptive acyl-enzyme formed. Furoyl saccharin was the best studied among this class of inhibitors. We report evidence that the amide bond in the heterocyclic ring of this compound is cleaved by porcine pancreatic and human leukocyte elastases and chymotrypsin, forming acyl-enzymes. Radioisotope studies indicate that the saccharin portion of furoyl saccharin is attached to these enzymes in approximately a 1:1 molar ratio with enzyme, blocking the active site serine. The acylelastases thus prepared are unusually stable to hydrolysis, with kdeacyl values at neutral pH of 2.3 x 10(-6) s-1 for porcine pancreatic elastase and 1.4 x 10(-6) s-1 for human leukocyte elastase. Trypsin appears to be inhibited by a different mechanism. These data suggest a new approach to the design of specific synthetic protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2085157518,"Recent studies indicate that genes from only one nucleolus organizer undergo replication during polytenization of salivary gland cells of X/Y flies. This report presents evidence that this is also true X/X polytene cells. Interstrain hybrids were constructed which contain X chromosomes with different rDNA hybridization patterns following digestion with Eco RI, and DNA from diploid or polytene tissue was analyzed using Southern transfers. DNA from diploid tissue of X/X hybrids shows rDNA patterns from both X chromosomes, while DNA from polytene tissue of hybrids shows a pattern characteristic of only one of the X chromosomes. The polytene pattern of the hybrid is independent of whether the dominant X chromosome was derived from the female or male parent. These results suggest that genes from only one nucleolus organizer undergo multiple rounds of replication in X/X polytene cells, and account for the finding that X/O and X/X polytene cells contain similar levels of rDNA without postulating compensation as a ribosomal gene rectification mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2126006280,"To initiate a genetic study of the hormonal regulation of genes coding for the three vitellogenins or yolk polypeptide precursors (YPs) in Drosophila, we have isolated from wild flies genetic variants which alter the mobility in SDS-PAGE of each YP independently. These variants are expressed codominantly and they are sex-linked: Yp1 and Yp2 map to region 8E to 9B1 (locus 30) and Yp3 is in 12A6-7 to 12D3 (locus 44). The amount of each YP synthesized and secreted into the hemolymph is related to the dosage of the above regions, suggesting that the structural genes are in those intervals. These experiments raise the question of the functional role of the proximity of Yp1 and Yp2 and provide a mechanism for a search for mutations altering the hormonally regulated function of these three genes."

https://openalex.org/W176311796,"The homogeneous DNA polymerase alpha from early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster contains four polypeptides designated alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with molecular weights of 148,000, 58,000, 46,000, and 43,000, respectively (Banks, G. R., Boezi, J. A., and Lehman, I. R. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9886-9892). The four polypeptides are structurally distinct from one another, as indicated by their different peptide patterns following limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus protease. Furthermore, the inclusion of the protease inhibitors, leupeptin and pepstatin, in addition to phenpylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sodium metabisulfite, which are used routinely during the purification, does not alter the pattern of polypeptides in the purified polymerase, suggesting that the four polypeptides are not a consequence of nonspecific proteolysis during purification. Thus, the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta polypeptides appear to be distinct subunits of the alpha-DNA polymerase of D. melanogaster. The alpha subunit is required for DNA polymerase activity. However, the specific activity of the isolated subunit is substantially lower than when it is associated with the beta, gamma, and delta subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1856564166,"Calcium uptake by vesicles in a highly enriched sarcolemma preparation from canine ventricle was found to be markedly stimulated by intravesicular calcium. Stimulation of calcium uptake appeared to be a saturable function of intravesicular calcium. Calcium efflux from the vesicles was stimulated by calcium in the reaction medium. Calcium uptake, supported by intravesicular calcium, and calcium efflux, stimulated by extravesicular calcium, were found to correspond on a one-to-one basis. Only small changes in net uptake or efflux were observed to occur in response to chemical gradients of calcium across the membrane. It was concluded, therefore, that under certain conditions, the major means for calcium movement across vesicles in the preparation is via a one-to-one exchange of calcium. Sodium was found to stimulate calcium uptake when present in the intravesicular space and to stimulate calcium efflux when present in the extravesicular space, but the effects of calcium plus sodium were not additive with respect to stimulating either calcium uptake or efflux. The effects of unlabeled calcium, strontium, barium, and magnesium on calcium uptake stimulated by intravesicular calcium and by intravesicular sodium were similar though not identical. The temperature dependence for calcium-stimulated and sodium-stimulated calcium movements was characterized by Q10 values of 1.27 and 2.06, respectively. Previous work has associated the sodium-calcium exchange reaction with the sarcolemma. It is argued that the present study, in turn, provides evidence that the calcium-calcium exchange reaction is also associated with the sarcolemma. In addition, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesis that one membrane system can promote the exchange of either calcium for calcium or calcium for sodium."
https://openalex.org/W1605340166,"1. Ionophore A23187 depletes the endogenous Mg2+ of beef heart mitochondria to 4 ng ions . mg-1 (or less) and Ca2+ to less than 2 ng ions . mg-1 in a reaction which does not require metabolic energy. Ionophore A23187 also promotes the near quantitative extrusion of endogenous K+ from heart mitochondria to a K+-free medium, but this reaction requires respiration and is sensitive to uncouplers. Respiring mitochondria which extrude K+ in the presence of A23187 maintain high membrane potentials and do not swell. The K+ depletion has the properties of a K+/H+ exchange reaction occurring at the expense of delta pH of respiration. 2. The rate and extent of K+ efflux are dependent on the removal of endogenous divalent cations by A23187, but are otherwise independent of the amount of A23187 present. It is concluded that K+ efflux results from activation of an endogenous K+/H+ exchange component and that A23187 does not function directly as a K+/H+ exchanger in mitochondria."

Since this sequence of events could be an important control mech- anism in blood coagulation, we have attempted to char- acterize further the reactions of purified human FwI/ vWF' with thrombin. The extent of thrombin-induced activation of FVIII/vWF was found to be dependent on the ratio of thrombin to FVIII/vWF. The extent of activation continued to increase with increasing throm- bin to"

https://openalex.org/W1534028177,"ApoA-II and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) spontaneously associate to give three different complexes whose structures are determined by the initial reactant concentration and by the reaction temperature with respect to Tc (23.9 degrees C), the gel to liquid crystalline transition temperature of DMPC. At an initial lipid to protein ratio of 45/1, a single complex (2.29 x 10(5) daltons) is quantitatively formed at all temperatures between Tc - 4 degrees C and Tc + 6 degrees C. When the 45/1 complex is mixed with DMPC liposomes there is lipid exchange but no net transfer of lipid, so that the structure of the complex remains unaltered. At an initial molar ratio of 100 to 300:1, the reaction scheme is more complex. At 24 degrees C a 240/1 complex (1.5 x 10(6) daltons) is formed from a precursor 75/1 complex (3.43 x 10(5) daltons) if excess (approximately 300 mol/mol) lipid is present. The 75/1 complex exhibits lipid exchange in the presence of added DMPC liposomes at 24 degrees C, and both the 75/1 and the 240/1 complex can be converted to smaller protein-rich complexes in the presence of added apoA-II. These results suggest that the initial lipid/protein ratio and the physical state of a lipid or lipid . protein complex determines the composition and structure of the resulting complex and support the view that lipid-protein interactions are stronger than protein-protein or lipid-lipid interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1519454654,"Experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that membrane depolarization stimulates Ca2+ uptake by vesicles in a sarcolemma preparation. Vesicles from a highly enriched sarcolemma preparation, previously loaded with 150 mM K+, developed a membrane potential when placed in a medium with 2.5 mM K+ as confirmed by changes in fluorescent intensity of the voltage-sensitive dye, 3,3‘-dipropyl-2,2‘-thiadicarbocyanine. Inclusion of valinomycin in the assay increased the magnitude of the potential, and elevation of extra-vesicular K+, after development of the potential, caused depolarization. Ca2+ uptake by the vesicles was examined under three conditions: (a) nonpolarized state of the vesicles with 150 mM K+ on both sides of the membrane; (b) polarized state of the vesicles with inside negative due to high intravesicular K+ (150 mM) and low extravesicular K+ (2.5 mM); and (c) after a transition from a polarized to a relatively depolarized state by changing extravesicular K+ from 2.5 to about 106 mM. Ca2+ uptake was moderately affected by polarization of the vesicles after 10 min of reaction but was markedly and rapidly enhanced by depolarization of the vesicles. Extravesicular Na+ appeared to be required for the depolarization-induced Ca2+ uptake. La3+, Mn2+, and high concentrations of verapamil and tetrodotoxin inhibited the process. It was concluded that the effect of depolarization on Ca2+ uptake may reflect the process that serves as the trigger for myocardial contraction."

https://openalex.org/W1519906018,"The complete covalent structure of Protein B, the third major protein degraded during germination of Bacillus megaterium spores, has been determined. The intact protein was cleaved with the specific B. megaterium spore protease into three peptides, residues 1 to 31 (B-III), 32 to 66 (B-I), and 67 to 96 (B-II). Cleavage of the intact protein with trypsin allowed isolation of the peptide encompassing residues 61 to 77 (T-11) as well as the COOH-terminal peptide, residues 94 to 96 (T-4). Cleavage of Peptide B-I with trypsin or chymotrypsin allowed isolation of peptides encompassing residues 53 to 60 (B-I-T-2) and residues 52 to 66 (B-I-C-4), respectively. Subtractive Edman degradation of Peptide T-4, automated sequenator analysis of Peptides B-I, B-II, T-11, B-I-T-2, and B-I-C-4, previously published partial sequence data on the intact B-protein and carboxypeptidase V digestion of the intact protein provided the data from which the following unique sequence was deduced: NH2-Ala-Lys-Gln-Thr-Asn-Lys-Thr-Ala-Ser-Gly-Thr-Ser-Thr-Gln-His-15 Val-Lys-Gln-Gln-Asp-Ala-Gln-Ala-Ser-Lys-Asn-Asn-Phe-Gly-Thr-30 Glu-Phe-Gly-Ser-Glu-Thr-Asn-Val-Gln-Glu-Val-Lys-Gln-Gln-Asn-45 Ala-Gln-Ala-Ala-Asn-Lys-Ser-Gln-Asn-Ala-Gln-Ala-Ser-Lys-60 Asn-Asn-Phe-Gly-Thr-Glu-Phe-Ala-Ser-Glu-Thr-Ser-Ala-Gln-Glu-75 Val-Arg-Gln-Gln-Asn-Ala-Gln-Ala-Gln-Lys-Lys-Asn-Gln-Asn-90 Ser-Gly-Lys-Tyr-Gln-Gly-COOH. The primary sequence of the B-protein contains a large internal duplication (residues 17 to 50 and 52 to 85), and shows significant sequence homology with the A- and C-proteins, the other major proteins degraded during B. megaterium spore germination."
https://openalex.org/W1583828599,"Acid phosphatase-1 (orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, acid optimum, EC 3.1.3.2), the major phosphatase in adult Drosophila melanogaster, has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The final product is a glycoprotein homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of about 50,000, as measured by its electrophoretic mobility in denaturing conditions on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. It has a turnover number of 1720 1-naphthyl phosphate molecules hydrolyzed/s by each acid phosphatase-1 molecule at 37 degrees C, pH 5.0. An average fly contains about 5 ng of enzyme. Pure acid phosphatase-1 displays heterogeneity in isoelectric focusing, with a major band at pH 5.3. The enzyme hydrolyzes a wide variety of phosphate monoesters, including AMP, glucose 6-phosphate, ATP, choline phosphate, or phosphoproteins. The maximum reaction rates are different for all substrates, and some substrates appear to inhibit the reaction at high substrate concentrations. The Michaelis constants for 1-naphthyl phosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate are 79 microM and 68 microM, respectively, at pH 5.0 and 37 degrees C. The optimum pH level for 1-naphthyl phosphate is 4.5. Acid phosphatase-1 is inhibited by L(+)-tartrate (but not D(-)-tartrate), phosphate, and fluoride. The reaction rate increases 2.1-fold for every 10 degrees C rise in temperature. Above 48 degrees C, the rate of thermal denaturation is greater than the rate of the enzyme reaction."
