https://openalex.org/W2093664485,"Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic agent, which regulates glucose homeostasis through inhibition of liver glucose production and an increase in muscle glucose uptake. Recent studies suggest that metformin may reduce the risk of cancer, but its mode of action in cancer remains not elucidated. We investigated the effect of metformin on human prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Metformin inhibited the proliferation of DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP cancer cells with a 50% decrease of cell viability and had a modest effect on normal prostate epithelial cell line P69. Metformin did not induce apoptosis but blocked cell cycle in G0/G1. This blockade was accompanied by a strong decrease of cyclin D1 protein level, pRb phosphorylation and an increase in p27kip protein expression. Metformin activated the AMP kinase pathway, a fuel sensor signaling pathway. However, inhibition of the AMPK pathway using siRNA against the two catalytic subunits of AMPK did not prevent the antiproliferative effect of metformin in prostate cancer cells. Importantly, oral and intraperitoneal treatment with metformin led to a 50 and 35% reduction of tumor growth, respectively, in mice bearing xenografts of LNCaP. Similar, to the in vitro study, metformin led to a strong reduction of cyclin D1 protein level in tumors providing evidence for a mechanism that may contribute to the antineoplastic effects of metformin suggested by recent epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2066596168,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on our planet. Interactions between viruses and their hosts impact several important biological processes in the world's oceans such as horizontal gene transfer, microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling. Interrogation of microbial metagenomic sequence data collected as part of the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Expedition (GOS) revealed a high abundance of viral sequences, representing approximately 3% of the total predicted proteins. Cluster analyses of the viral sequences revealed hundreds to thousands of viral genes encoding various metabolic and cellular functions. Quantitative analyses of viral genes of host origin performed on the viral fraction of aquatic samples confirmed the viral nature of these sequences and suggested that significant portions of aquatic viral communities behave as reservoirs of such genetic material. Distributional and phylogenetic analyses of these host-derived viral sequences also suggested that viral acquisition of environmentally relevant genes of host origin is a more abundant and widespread phenomenon than previously appreciated. The predominant viral sequences identified within microbial fractions originated from tailed bacteriophages and exhibited varying global distributions according to viral family. Recruitment of GOS viral sequence fragments against 27 complete aquatic viral genomes revealed that only one reference bacteriophage genome was highly abundant and was closely related, but not identical, to the cyanomyovirus P-SSM4. The co-distribution across all sampling sites of P-SSM4-like sequences with the dominant ecotype of its host, Prochlorococcus supports the classification of the viral sequences as P-SSM4-like and suggests that this virus may influence the abundance, distribution and diversity of one of the most dominant components of picophytoplankton in oligotrophic oceans. In summary, the abundance and broad geographical distribution of viral sequences within microbial fractions, the prevalence of genes among viral sequences that encode microbial physiological function and their distinct phylogenetic distribution lend strong support to the notion that viral-mediated gene acquisition is a common and ongoing mechanism for generating microbial diversity in the marine environment."
https://openalex.org/W2160780945,"Background The objective of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of 1.0% C31G (SAVVY) in preventing male-to-female vaginal transmission of HIV infection among women at high risk. Methodology/Principal Findings This was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants made up to 12 monthly follow-up visits for HIV testing, adverse event reporting, and study product supply. The study was conducted between September 2004 and December 2006 in Lagos and Ibadan, Nigeria, where we enrolled 2153 HIV-negative women at high risk of HIV infection. Participants were randomized 1∶1 to SAVVY or placebo. The effectiveness endpoint was incidence of HIV infection as indicated by detection of HIV antibodies in oral mucosal transudate (rapid test) or blood (ELISA), and confirmed by Western blot or PCR testing. We observed 33 seroconversions (21 in the SAVVY group, 12 in the placebo group). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of HIV infection at 12 months were 0.028 in the SAVVY group and 0.015 in the placebo group (2-sided p-value for the log-rank test of treatment effect 0.121). The point estimate of the hazard ratio was 1.7 for SAVVY versus placebo (95% confidence interval 0.9, 3.5). Because of lower-than-expected HIV incidence, we did not observe the required number of HIV infections (66) for adequate power to detect an effect of SAVVY. Follow-up frequencies of adverse events, reproductive tract adverse events, abnormal pelvic examination findings, chlamydial infections and vaginal infections were similar in the study arms. No serious adverse event was attributable to SAVVY use. Conclusions/Significance SAVVY did not reduce the incidence of HIV infection. Although the hazard ratio was higher in the SAVVY than the placebo group, we cannot conclude that there was a harmful treatment effect of SAVVY. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00130078"

https://openalex.org/W2053407268,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death, where the amplification of oncogenes contributes to tumorigenesis. Genomic profiling of 128 lung cancer cell lines and tumors revealed frequent focal DNA amplification at cytoband 14q13.3, a locus not amplified in other tumor types. The smallest region of recurrent amplification spanned the homeobox transcription factor TITF1 (thyroid transcription factor 1; also called NKX2-1), previously linked to normal lung development and function. When amplified, TITF1 exhibited increased expression at both the RNA and protein levels. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of TITF1 in lung cancer cell lines with amplification led to reduced cell proliferation, manifested by both decreased cell-cycle progression and increased apoptosis. Our findings indicate that TITF1 amplification and overexpression contribute to lung cancer cell proliferation rates and survival and implicate TITF1 as a lineage-specific oncogene in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1970117928,"Cognitive insight phenomenon lies at the core of numerous discoveries. Behavioral research indicates four salient features of insightful problem solving: (i) mental impasse, followed by (ii) restructuring of the problem representation, which leads to (iii) a deeper understanding of the problem, and finally culminates in (iv) an ""Aha!"" feeling of suddenness and obviousness of the solution. However, until now no efforts have been made to investigate the neural mechanisms of these constituent features of insight in a unified framework.In an electroencephalographic study using verbal remote associate problems, we identified neural correlates of these four features of insightful problem solving. Hints were provided for unsolved problems or after mental impasse. Subjective ratings of the restructuring process and the feeling of suddenness were obtained on trial-by-trial basis. A negative correlation was found between these two ratings indicating that sudden insightful solutions, where restructuring is a key feature, involve automatic, subconscious recombination of information. Electroencephalogram signals were analyzed in the space x time x frequency domain with a nonparametric cluster randomization test. First, we found strong gamma band responses at parieto-occipital regions which we interpreted as (i) an adjustment of selective attention (leading to a mental impasse or to a correct solution depending on the gamma band power level) and (ii) encoding and retrieval processes for the emergence of spontaneous new solutions. Secondly, we observed an increased upper alpha band response in right temporal regions (suggesting active suppression of weakly activated solution relevant information) for initially unsuccessful trials that after hint presentation led to a correct solution. Finally, for trials with high restructuring, decreased alpha power (suggesting greater cortical excitation) was observed in right prefrontal area.Our results provide a first account of cognitive insight by dissociating its constituent components and potential neural correlates."
https://openalex.org/W2075684271,"Evidence that Escherichia coli YqhD is involved in bacterial response to compounds that generate membrane lipid peroxidation is presented. Overexpression of yqhD results in increased resistance to the reactive oxygen species-generating compounds hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, chromate, and potassium tellurite. Increased tolerance was also observed for the lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes butanaldehyde, propanaldehyde, acrolein, and malondialdehyde and the membrane-peroxidizing compound tert-butylhydroperoxide. Expression of yqhD was also associated with changes in the concentration of intracellular peroxides and cytoplasmic protein carbonyl content and with a reduction in intracellular acrolein levels. When compared with the wild type strain, an yqhD mutant exhibited a sensitive phenotype to all these compounds and also augmented levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, which may indicate an increased level of lipid peroxidation. Purified YqhD catalyzes the in vitro reduction of acetaldehyde, malondialdehyde, propanaldehyde, butanaldehyde, and acrolein in a NADPH-dependent reaction. Finally, yqhD transcription was induced in cells that had been exposed to conditions favoring lipid peroxidation.

Oxidative stress is detrimental to a number of cellular macromolecules including proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids. In eukaryotic organisms oxidative modification of cellular constituents has been implicated in the etiology of different pathological conditions such as diabetes, cataracts, pulmonary emphysema, arthritis, cancer, and aging (1Mates J.M. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J. 3rd Ed. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, NY1999Google Scholar).

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide (O2·¯), and hydroxyl radical (OH·) are typical side products of the aerobic metabolism. ROS compounds are also formed during cell exposure to redox-cycling chemicals like paraquat or metals and metalloids like chromate and potassium tellurite (K2TeO3) (3Imlay J. Annu. Rev.

Except for mechanisms involved in membrane peroxidation, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells use similar mechanisms to respond to oxidative stress. Lipid oxidation is a common consequence of the activity of free radicals on cell membrane components. Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by HO2, the protonated form of superoxide anion, or OH· leads to the formation of lipid peroxides (7Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Schaur R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Membrane Lipid Oxidation. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 239-268Google Scholar). Enzymatic or chemical degradation of lipid peroxides results in the generation of toxic breakdown products like short-chain (C3-C9) aldehydes such as 2-alkenals (α,β-unsaturated aldehydes), 2-propenal (acrolein), 4-hydroxynonenal, and malondialdehyde (MDA) (7Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Schaur R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Membrane Lipid Oxidation. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 239-268Google Scholar, 8Esterbauer H. McBrien D.C.H. Slater T.F. Free Radicals, Lipid Peroxidation, and Cancer. Academia Press Ltd, London1982: 101Google Scholar). The toxicity of these “reactive aldehydes” lies in their ability to form Michael adducts with thiol and amino groups of proteins, thus affecting several cellular processes (9Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Scholz N. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For example, inactivation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase by reactive aldehydes that modify lysine and cysteine residues located in enzyme active sites has been reported (10Szweda L. Uchida K. Stadtman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3342-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Uchida K. Stadtman E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1380: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Reactive aldehydes can also generate DNA adducts causing an important increase of the rate of mutagenesis in E. coli and Salmonella (13Yang I. Hossain M. Miller H. Khullar S. Johnson F. Grollam A. Moriya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9071-9076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Neudecker T. Eder E. Deininger C. Henschler C. Mutat. Res. 1991; 264: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells use three distinct systems to cope with the harmful effect of reactive aldehydes. The glutathione S-transferase pathway fueled by the GSH or thioredoxin redox cycle conjugates aldehydes with glutathione (GSH), the aldo-keto reductase system reduces aldehydes to alcohols, and alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases oxidize aldehydes to carboxyl groups. In animals, the main detoxification pathway is GSH-dependent, and it has been shown that the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase pathways account for 10 and 55% of aldehyde elimination by hepatocytes, respectively (15Hartley D. Ruth J. Petersen D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Because the major peroxidation substrate, polyunsaturated fatty acid, is found at very low levels in bacterial membranes, peroxidation of prokaryotic membranes has been a matter of controversy. Increasing experimental evidence suggesting that lipid peroxidation is physiologically important in microorganisms has been reported during the last few years. Bacterial accumulation of reactive aldehydes has been demonstrated in cells exposed to tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium tellurite (K2TeO3), and titanium oxide (TiO2) (4Pérez J.M. Calderón I.L. Arenas F.A. Fuentes D.E. Pradenas G.A. Fuentes E.L. Sandoval J.M. Castro M.E. Elías A.O. Vásquez C.C. Plos One. 2007; 2: e211Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Yoon S.

It has been proposed that members of the ubiquitous thiol peroxidase thiol-dependent antioxidant/AhpC family participate in protecting E. coli against alkyl and lipid hydroperoxides (19Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 178: 5610-5614Crossref Google Scholar) such as alkyl hydroperoxidase reductase, bacterioferrin comigratory protein, and periplasmic thiol peroxidase. However, direct experimental evidence for specific defense systems against lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes in bacteria have not been reported to date. Sulzenbacher et al. (20Sulzenbacher G. Alvarez K. van den Heuvel R. Versluis C. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Valencia C. Cambillau C. Eklund H. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of a new E. coli dehydrogenase, YqhD, whose physiological substrates could not be determined. Based mainly on the bound coenzyme, NADP(OH)2, they proposed a putative relationship between YqhD and oxidative stress. Genomic and proteomic studies have shown that YqhD is expressed in E. coli after exposure to stress conditions such as cold shock (21Phadtare S. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7007-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), nutrient starving (22Hua Q. Yang C. Oshima T. Mori H. Shimizu K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and oxidative stress generated by the Curvularia peroxidase system (23Hansen E. Schembri M. Klemm P. Schäfer T. Molin S. Gram L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). YqhD has several features similar to AdhE, an alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in fermentative metabolism in E. coli for which an antioxidant function under aerobic conditions has been proposed (24Echave P. Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 32: 30193-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have found that YqhD is induced under tellurite exposure, suggesting that it is involved in bacterial response to oxidative stress. In this work we show that E. coli YqhD is an aldehyde reductase involved in resistance to ROS-generating compounds and reactive aldehydes. Evidence to confirm that YqhD catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of various membrane peroxidation-derived aldehydes, including acrolein and MDA, is provided. Increased levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) and acrolein are found in ΔyqhD cells as compared with the parental, isogenic, wild type strain cells. Expression of YqhD resulted in diminished concentrations of cytoplasmic peroxides and oxidized proteins. This antioxidant-like effect was only observed in the presence of oxygen, a condition required for lipid peroxidation. Finally, we determined that yqhD transcription was induced upon exposure to H2O2, K2TeO3, paraquat, t-BOOH, and low temperatures, conditions known to promote membrane lipid peroxidation. Results suggest that YqhD is part of a specific defense mechanism against reactive aldehydes generated by membrane peroxidation in E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the first communication describing that such mechanism might be used by bacteria to cope with the toxicity of membrane lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes.

Open table in a new tab Cloning and Expression of yqhD and Protein Purification—Plasmid pBAD yqhD was constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified E. coli yqhD gene fragment into the expression vector pBAD TOPO (Invitrogen). E. coli BW25113 chromosomal DNA and primers described in Table 1 was used to amplify the yqhD gene. The PCR product was ligated to the cloning vector, and the resulting plasmid pBAD yqhD was introduced into E. coli Top10 by electroporation. Insert orientation was confirmed by NcoI digestion, and gene integrity was determined by nucleotide sequencing. Plasmid pBAD yqhD was then mobilized into E. coli BW25113 to carry out the resistance studies reported in this work. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pDEST17 yqhD (a generous gift of Dr. C. Cambillau, CNRS, Marseille, France) were used to purify YqhD. After 5 h of induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and subjected to sonic disruption. Nucleic acids were precipitated with streptomycin sulfate (2%, w/v) on ice. After centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid). Proteins were eluted with 0.5 m imidazole and fractionated by SDS-PAGE to estimate protein purity. Assay for YqhD Dehydrogenase—The reaction mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm NADPH, a defined aldehyde (acetaldehyde, propanal, or butanal), or alcohol (butanol, propanol or isopropanol) as substrate and purified YqhD (10 μg/ml). The mixture was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and NADPH oxidation was determined at 340 nm using a UV-Visible Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of protein that oxidizes 1 pmol of NADPH/min at 37 °C. Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations—Cells from overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold with fresh LB medium. Ten μl of this dilution were used to inoculate 1 ml of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics (Kan and/or Amp) and the toxics to be tested. Cells were grown for 48 h at 37 °C with shaking. Peroxide Intracellular Levels—The oxidant-sensitive probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used to measure peroxide levels in cells exposed to potassium tellurite (0.5 μg/ml), hydrogen peroxide (1 mm), paraquat (50 μg/ml), or chromate (1 mm) (24Echave P. Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 32: 30193-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were grown under aerobic conditions in LB medium amended with the compounds to be tested to an A600 ∼ 0.3. After washing with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, cells were incubated in the same buffer containing 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) for 30 min. Cells were washed, suspended in the same buffer, and disrupted by sonication. Cell extracts (100 μl) were mixed with 1 ml of phosphate buffer, and fluorescence intensity was measured using an Applied Biosystems Cytofluor 4000 multi-well plate reader (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 519 nm). Fluorescence emission values were normalized to protein concentration. Protein Carbonylation—Protein carbonyl content was determined according to Semchyshyn et al. (18Semchyshyn H. Bagnyukoba T. Storey K. Lushchak V. Cell Biol. Int. 2005; 29: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nucleic acid-free extracts (100 μl) prepared from E. coli BW25113 cells treated and untreated for 30 min with K2TeO3 (0.5 μg/ml) or H2O2 (100 μm) were mixed with four volumes of 10 mm dinitrophenylhydrazine (dissolved in 2 m HCl) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with vortexing every 10–15 min. Proteins were precipitated by adding 500 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid and sedimented at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed at least 3 times with 1:1 ethanol:ethyl acetate to remove any unreacted dinitrophenylhydrazine. Finally, the pellet was dissolved at 37 °C in 450 μl of 50 mm dithiothreitol in 6 m guanidine HCl. Carbonyl content was determined spectrophotometrically at 370 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 22,000 m–1 cm–1 (18Semchyshyn H. Bagnyukoba T. Storey K. Lushchak V. Cell Biol. Int. 2005; 29: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TBARs—TBARs were determined in cell extracts as described by Semchyshyn et al. (18Semchyshyn H. Bagnyukoba T. Storey K. Lushchak V. Cell Biol. Int. 2005; 29: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB media to an A600 ∼ 0.6 and exposed for 30 min to a particular toxic compound. Cell suspensions (1.0 ml) were then precipitated by the addition of 1.0 ml of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged, and supernatants were mixed with 2.0 ml of a saturated solution of thiobarbituric acid dissolved in 0.1 m HCl and 10 mm butylated hydroxytoluene. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 60 min, and 1.5-ml aliquots were removed, chilled on ice, and mixed with 1.5 ml of n-butanol. After centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, the organic fraction was removed, and the A535 was measured. TBARs content was determined using a molar absorption coefficient of 156 mm–1 cm–1 (18Semchyshyn H. Bagnyukoba T. Storey K. Lushchak V. Cell Biol. Int. 2005; 29: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Rice-Evans C. Diplock A. Symins M. Buerdon R. van Knippenberg P.H. Laboratory techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 22. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1991: 147-149Google Scholar). RNA Purification and Quantitative Real Time (qRT)-PCR—RNA purification was carried out using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). E. coli BW25113 cultures were diluted 1:100, inoculated in 200 ml of LB medium, and incubated at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 ∼ 0.6. Cultures were then amended with 0.5 μg/ml K2TeO3, 0.1 mm H2O2, 50 μg/ml paraquat, or 0.05% t-BOOH and incubated for 30 min. Cells were sedimented at 13,000 × g for 3 min and used for RNA purification. Two μl of total RNA (∼1 μg/μl) from control and treated cells were used in qRT-PCR experiments. Reactions (20 μl) used the LightCycler® RNA Amplification kit SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) and contained Lightcycler® 0.4 μl of RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 4 μl of SYBR Green I Reaction Mix, 3.2 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 5.4 μl of H2O PCR grade, 4 μl of resolution solution, and 0.5 pmol of each specific primer. Amplification products were detected by increase of fluorescence. Crossing points (Cp) are inversely proportional to the RNA content and were determined using the software included in LightCycler® 2.0. Primers used to amplify yqhD are shown in Table 1. Induction of gene expression was expressed as the difference between the crossing points of each RT-PCR determination (Cp–Cptoxic). Positive numbers reflect higher amounts of the particular, specific mRNA in cells exposed to the toxic condition. Acrolein Concentration—Acrolein concentration was determined as described by Slininger and Bothast (26Slininger P.J. Bothast R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1985; 50: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acrolein reacts with tryptophan yielding a purple complex absorbing at 560 nm. Commercially available acrolein (Sigma) was used to standardize the assay and to make a calibration curve. “Tryptophan solution” consisted of tryptophan (2.05 g), 4.17 ml of 8.9 m HCl, and 2.5 ml of toluene in 1 liter of bi-distilled water. Approximately 300 μl of crude extracts (or acrolein standard) were mixed with 600 μl of 8.9 m HCl and 1.5 ml of tryptophan solution. Duplicated samples were incubated for 20 min at 40 °C until a purple color developed and became stable. A560 was determined spectrophotometrically. YqhD Mediates Resistance to ROS Elicitors in E. coli—To determine whether YqhD plays a role in resistance to oxidative damage, minimal inhibitory concentrations for different ROS-generating compounds for E. coli strains lacking (ΔyqhD) and overexpressing the yqhD gene (pBAD yqhD) were determined (Table 2). Although cells overexpressing yqhD showed increased tolerance to compounds whose toxicity involves superoxide generation like paraquat and potassium tellurite (4Pérez J.M. Calderón I.L. Arenas F.A.

Biochem. 1995; 117: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and hydrogen peroxide, E. coli ΔyqhD showed increased sensitivity to all these compounds (Table 2). To assess whether YqhD-mediated resistance phenotype was also related to cytoplasm thiol depletion (especially GSH), the effect of YqhD on E. coli resistance to oxidant compounds that involve thiol oxidation like diamide and cadmium chloride (28Wang A. Crowley D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3259-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was determined. All E. coli strains tested exhibited similar resistance levels to these compounds, confirming the idea that YqhD protects E. coli from ROS-generated damage.TABLE 2YqhD mediates resistance to potassium tellurite and other ROS elicitors in E. coliStrainK2TeO3H2O2ParaquatK2CrO7CdCl2DiamideE. coli pBAD1.2553001.25250350E. coli pBAD yqhD241010005250350E. coli ΔyqhD0.31.21000.15250350 Open table in a new tab YqhD Is a NADPH-dependent Aldehyde Reductase—YqhD exhibits 40–50% sequence similarity with a number of bacterial alcohol dehydrogenases. However, it did not show any detectable enzymatic activity when tested with short-chain alcohols as substrates (20Sulzenbacher G. Alvarez K. van den Heuvel R. Versluis C. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Valencia C. Cambillau C. Eklund H. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In our hands, purified YqhD did not show NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase activity on methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or isopropanol (not shown). YqhD showed enzymatic activity with short-chain aldehydes including a few with unsaturations or hydroxylations. Km values ranged from 0.67 mm for butanaldehyde to 28.5 mm for acetaldehyde. The kcat value was similar for all substrates (Table 3).TABLE 3YqhD is a NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductaseSubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmmms-1s-1 m-1Acetaldehyde28.4753.51880Propanaldehyde3.3145.0613613Butanaldehyde0.6759.588018Acrolein4.8162.512994Malondialdehyde1.7860.133764 Open table in a new tab yqhD Elimination Increases TBARs Levels in E. coli—TBARs are routinely used to estimate malondialdehyde content. They can also indicate the presence of a series of reactive aldehydes that are mainly generated during lipid peroxidation (17Maness P. Smolinski S.Z. Blake D. Huang Z. Wolfrum E. Jacoby W. Appl.

Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1991: 147-149Google Scholar). We have previously shown that E. coli cells exposed to H2O2 or K2TeO3 have increased levels of TBARs (4Pérez J.M. Calderón I.L. Arenas F.A. Fuentes D.E. Pradenas G.A. Fuentes E.L. Sandoval J.M. Castro M.E. Elías A.O. Vásquez C.C. Plos One. 2007; 2: e211Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). E. coli ΔyqhD exhibited increased content of TBARs even when H2O2 or K2TeO3 were not added to the culture, suggesting that YqhD may function in controlling the amount of membrane peroxidation products that are generated during the normal basal metabolism. E. coli ΔyqhD showed 2-(H2O2) and 4-fold (K2TeO3) TBARs increases when compared with the wild type strain, indicating that YqhD affects the content of reactive aldehydes within the cell (Fig. 1). Elimination of yqhD Alters the Intracellular Level of Peroxides—The oxidation-sensitive probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used to estimate the level of cytoplasmic peroxides in E. coli pBAD yqhD and E. coli ΔyqhD. Probe activation was monitored in the presence or absence of the ROS-generating compounds K2TeO3, H2O2, paraquat, and chromate. E. coli cells lacking the yqhD gene showed an important increase in probe activation as compared with the wild type counterpart even in the absence of any compound. Overexpression of yqhD resulted in decreased peroxide levels in untreated cells. Peroxide levels were similar in wild type and pBAD yqhD cells (Fig. 2). YqhD Protects E. coli from Protein Oxidation—Formation of carbonyl groups in proteins, a consequence of ROS and reactive aldehydes, is a commonly used marker to estimate oxidative stress. Anti-dinitrophenylhydrazine Western blotting was used to estimate the extent of protein oxidation. Analysis of cytoplasmic protein extracts revealed that protein carbonylation in E. coli ΔyqhD was slightly higher than that of wild type and E. coli pBAD yqhD even in unstressed cells (Fig. 3A). These results agree with those obtained spectrophotometrically with cells grown aerobically in LB medium and exposed to K2TeO3 or H2O2 (Fig. 3B). E. coli ΔyqhD showed increased protein oxidation even when grown in the absence of these compounds (Fig. 3B). Genetic complementation of the deletion mutant restored protein carbonyl content to wild type levels, whereas overexpression of yqhD resu"
https://openalex.org/W1975614304,"FOXO1, a member of the evolutionarily conserved forkhead family of transcription factors, regulates expression of a number of genes that play critical roles in cell cycle and apoptosis. A pivotal regulatory mechanism of FOXO is reversible phosphorylation, catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases. Phosphorylation of FOXO1 is associated with 14-3-3 binding and cytosolic localization, whereas dephosphorylated FOXO1 translocates to the nucleus and is transcriptionally active. Experiments were performed to identify the serine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates FOXO1. PP2A inhibitors, okadaic acid and fostriecin, increased FOXO1 phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Microcystin-agarose pull-downs suggested that a phosphatase binds to FOXO1, and PP2A catalytic subunit was identified in endogenous FOXO1 immunocomplexes, indicating that PP2A is a FOXO1 phosphatase. Purified PP2A interacted directly with FOXO1 and dephosphorylated FOXO1 in vitro. Silencing of PP2A protected FOXO1 from dephosphorylation and delayed FOXO1 nuclear translocation, confirming the physiologic role of PP2A in the regulation of FOXO1 function. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A phosphatases rescued FOXO1-mediated cell death by regulating the level of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM. We conclude that PP2A is a physiologic phosphatase of FOXO1.

FOXO (Forkhead box, class O) proteins, an evolutionarily conserved subgroup of the winged helix or forkhead transcription factors family, regulate a wide variety of cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest, cell death, and protection from stress stimuli (1Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, four members are identified: FOXO1 (FKHR), FOXO3a (FKHRL1), and FOXO4 (AFX), and FOXO6; the first three were found at chromosomal translocations in tumors, suggesting roles in oncogenesis (2Arden K.C. Exp. Gerontol. 2006; 41: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Activation of FOXO proteins leads to G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and gluconeogenesis, through up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1, apoptotic-related proteins such as FAS ligand, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), BIM, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), respectively (3Medema R.H.

FOXO proteins accomplish these functions as active transcription factors in the dephosphorylated state. Reversible phosphorylation of proteins, catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases, regulates many organismal and cellular processes including embryonic development, cell proliferation, and cell death (25Gallego M.

PP2A holoenzyme is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit C, a structural scaffolding subunit A, and a highly variable B regulatory subunit, giving rise to many different PP2A holoenzymes (29Janssens V. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Because the phosphorylation state of FOXO1 plays a critical role in its physiological function, we sought to determine whether phosphatase(s) are involved in the activation of FOXO1. In this study, we used phosphatase inhibitors, coimmunoprecipitations, knockdowns, as well as functional studies to investigate the role of serine-threonine phosphatases in FOXO1-mediated apoptosis. Reagents—Serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors microcystin-LR, okadaic acid, fostriecin, and calyculin A, PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, AKT inhibitor SH5 and His-AKT1 were purchased from EMD Biosciences. The following antibodies were used: phospho-AKT, AKT, phospho-Thr24-FOXO1 and phospho-Ser256-FOXO1 (Cell signaling Technology); FOXO1 (H128 and N18), PP1 (E9), phospho-ERK (E4), 14-3-3 (K19 and H8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); PP2A catalytic subunit, BIM (BD Biosciences); PP2A A subunit (Zymed Laboratories); PP4 (Chemicon International); and PP6 (Sigma). PP2A and microcystin-agarose were purchased from Upstate. PP1 siRNA, PP2A siRNA, and scrambled siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. pGEX-mFOXO1 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Masahiko Negishi (National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC). Dr. David Brautigan (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) generously provided purified PP2A AC core enzyme. Cell Line and Cultures—The FL5.12 cell line with doxycycline-inducible wild type FOXO1 (F14) and the FL5.12 cell line with the inducible FOXO1-AAA mutant (T24A, S256A, S319A) (A3) were kindly provided by Dr. David Plas (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH). Plasmids pcDNA3-Flag-FOXO1, pcDNA3-Flag-FOXO1-AAA mutant, and pcDNA3-GFP-FOXO1 were gifts from Dr. William R. Sellers (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). FL5.12 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and IL3. FOXO1 expression was induced with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 14 h. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. BOSC cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. In IL3 deprivation experiments, FL5.12 cells with inducible FOXO1 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 3 times and re-cultured in medium lacking IL3. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates for Western blotting were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). Immunoblotting of lysates with antibodies specific to phospho-Thr24 or phospho-Ser256 FOXO1 often interfered with subsequent detection of total FOXO1 using rabbit antibody, therefore, phospho-FOXO bands were standardized against actin on the same blots and total FOXO1 was detected in a separate loading of the same samples. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in isotonic immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors, incubated with FOXO1 antibody (N-18 or H128), precipitated with protein A and G Sepharose, fractionated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For immunoprecipitated FOXO1, blots were probed with phosphospecific antibody first, then re-probed with antibody against total FOXO1. Cross-linking Assay—Whole cell extracts were prepared in IP buffer with a protease inhibitor mixture, incubated with cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP, 2 mm) at 4 °C for 2 h. A final concentration of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, was added to quench the reaction for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the immunoprecipitation assay was conducted as usual, except that IP buffer was replaced by RIPA buffer in the final washings. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—For FOXO1 dephosphorylation in whole cell lysates, cell extracts were prepared in phosphatase assay buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with or without the addition of serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors. For dephosphorylation of FOXO1 by PP2A, FOXO1 was immunoprecipitated from F14 cells and incubated in phosphatase assay buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Purified PP2A was added to immunoprecipitated FOXO1 and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. In Vitro Binding Assay—FOXO1 was immunoprecipitated from F14 cells. Purified PP2A was added to immunoprecipitated FOXO1 and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. GST-mFOXO1 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified with glutathione-Sepharose. Phosphorylated GST-pFOXO1 was made by adding purified His-AKT1 (Calbiochem) to GST-mFOXO1-glutathione-Sepharose in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2) at 30 °C for 30 min. For in vitro binding, purified PP2A was added to GST-Sepharose, GST-FOXO1-Sepharose, or GST-pFOXO1-Sepharose and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with the cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate). PP2A and PP1 Knock-down Assay—The F14 cell line was transfected with PP2A/C siRNA or PP1 siRNA using the Amaxa Nucleofector kit V. Transfection frequencies were over 70% as indicated by fluorescent control vector pmaxGFP. 24 h after transfection, FOXO1 expression was induced with doxycycline (2 μg/ml) for 16 h and collected at 40 h after transfection. Nuclear Translocation Assay—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-GFP-FOXO1 expression plasmid. Twenty-four to 36 h after transfection, cells were pretreated or not with serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors for 1 h and then serum deprived for 2 h with or without the continued presence of inhibitors. Using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection kit, BOSC cells were transfected with pcDNA3-GFP-FOXO1 and scrambled siRNA or pcDNA3-GFP-FOXO1 and PP2A siRNA. Red indicator siRNA was used to assess efficiency of siRNA delivery. Usually, the majority of the cells were transfected by siRNA. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with staurosporine (2 μm) for 1 h. Subcellular GFP localization was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Cell Survival Assay—After F14 and A3 cells were treated with doxycycline (2 μg/ml) for 12 h, fostriecin (3 μm) or calyculin A (5 nm) was added to the medium for 3 h in the presence of IL3, followed by IL3 deprivation. Cell death was measured by propidium iodide exclusion or annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining, analyzed by flow cytometry. BOSC cells transfected with GFP-FOXO1 were preteated with calyculin A (5 nm) for 1 h, then treated with 2 μm staurosporine for 6 h with or without the continued presence of calyculin A. One μg/ml Hoechst was added to the medium at 37 °C for 20 min. PP1 and PP2A Inhibitors Prevent FOXO1 Dephosphorylation—To determine whether serine/threonine phosphatases are involved in FOXO1 dephosphorylation in cells, we treated cells with okadaic acid (OA), a cell-permeable inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, and checked FOXO1 phosphorylation status. F14, the FL5.12 cell line with doxycycline-inducible FOXO1 (30Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), was treated with increasing concentrations of OA for 3 h and assayed for FOXO1 phosphorylation by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cells with OA resulted in increased phosphorylation of FOXO1 at both the Thr24 and Ser256 sites. The dose-dependent increase in FOXO1 phosphorylation by OA suggested the involvement of either PP1 or a phosphatase of the PP2A family in FOXO1 dephosphorylation. To distinguish between the action of PP1 or PP2A, serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors were used in in vitro phosphatase assays of FOXO1 dephosphorylation. Both Thr(P)24 and Ser(P)256 were dephosphorylated in F14 lysates after incubation for 20 min at 30 °C (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). FOXO1 dephosphorylation was effectively prevented by PP1 and PP2A inhibitors microcystin-LR, okadaic acid, and fostriecin (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5). Fostriecin is a highly selective inhibitor of PP2A and PP2A-like phosphatases and is 10,000 to 40,000 times more potent against PP2A than PP1 (31Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The concentration of fostriecin used in this experiment, 10 nm, was far lower than the IC50 for PP1, which suggested that the phosphatase acting on FOXO1 in cell-free extracts is PP2A or a PP2A-like phosphatase. Increased FOXO1 Phosphorylation by PP2A Inhibitors Is Due to Inhibition of Phosphatases, Not Activation of Upstream Kinases—In cells, increased phosphorylation of FOXO1 can result from the inhibition of FOXO1 phosphatases or the activation of FOXO1 kinases. To rule out the possibility that maintenance of FOXO1 phosphorylation by phosphatase inhibitors was the result of activation of upstream kinases, we combined inhibitors of AKT/PKB or PI 3-kinase with phosphatase inhibitors. Because FOXO1 is a downstream substrate in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, we used the AKT inhibitor SH5 and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin together with okadaic acid or fostriecin. After removal of IL3 from the culture medium, FOXO1 was dephosphorylated at Thr24 and Ser256 (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 to lanes 5 and 9, lane 10 to lanes 14 and 18). The phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid, fostriecin, and calyculin A all prevented the dephosphorylation at Thr24 and Ser256 when used alone or when AKT and PI3K were also inactivated by SH5 or wortmannin, respectively (compare lanes 2 and 4, 6 and 8, 11 and 13, 15, and 17). These results suggested that increased FOXO1 phosphorylation was due to direct inhibition of phosphatase(s) acting on FOXO1 rather than increased kinase activity of AKT or PI3K. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation upon IL3 stimulation confirmed that the kinase inhibitors SH5 and wortmannin were functional at the doses used (Fig. 1D). Activation of phosphatase would be expected to lead to rapid dephosphorylation of substrate, whereas inhibition of kinases would result in a gradual decrease of already phosphorylated substrate over time. In NIH 3T3 cells, dephosphorylation of at least the Thr(P)24 site was observed as early as 10 min after serum withdrawal (Fig. 1E), supporting the hypothesis that an enzyme was activated, which directly dephosphorylated FOXO1. PP2A Binds Directly to FOXO1 Regardless of 14-3-3 and Phosphorylation Status—The inhibitor experiments above suggested that PP2A or a PP2A-like phosphatase might directly dephosphorylate FOXO1, which would be strongly supported by demonstration of interaction of FOXO1 and PP2A. Microcystin-agarose binds PP1 and PP2A from cell lysates efficiently. Both FOXO1 wild type and AAA mutant proteins were captured by microcystin-agarose from lysates of FL5.12 cells with inducible FOXO1, suggesting that FOXO1 bound to either PP1 or PP2A pulled down by microcystin (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the phosphatase binding to FOXO1 was PP1 or PP2A, lysates of NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-FOXO1wt, FLAG-FOXO1-AAA, or GFP-FOXO1 were incubated with FLAG beads, eluted with FLAG peptide, then the eluates were mixed with microcystin beads. FLAG-FOXO1wt and mutant, but not GFP-FOXO1, were pulled down by FLAG beads, and microcystin-agarose captured the FLAG-FOXO1wt and AAA mutant from the FLAG eluates. Western blotting of the microcystin pull-down revealed the presence of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2A/C), but not PP1, indicating that the phosphatase in the FOXO1 immunocomplex was PP2A (Fig. 2B). To test whether FOXO1 can bind to PP2A in cell-free extracts, we incubated recombinant GST-FOXO1 or GST-pFOXO1 (in vitro phosphorylated by AKT) with FL5.12 lysates. PP2A catalytic subunit was captured by GST-FOXO1 or GST-pFOXO1, but not GST (Fig. 2C). The presence of 14-3-3 in the GST-pFOXO1 complex confirmed that GST-pFOXO1 was indeed phosphorylated. The presence of both PP2A/C and 14-3-3 in the GST-pFOXO1 pull down strongly suggested that PP2A/C binds both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated FOXO1 and that binding was unaffected by 14-3-3. Other PP2A-like phosphatases, PP4 and PP6, were not detected in the GST-FOXO1 complexes, confirming that PP2A, but not other phosphatases, were involved in FOXO1 dephosphorylation. PP2A Coimmunoprecipitates with FOXO1—To directly visualize PP2A/C in the FOXO1 complex, wild type or AAA mutant FOXO1 were immunoprecipitated and Western blotted for PP2A/C. The PP2A catalytic subunit coimmunoprecipitated with FOXO1 from the F14 cell lysates (Fig. 2D). R18, a peptide that displaces 14-3-3 from its substrates by interacting with basic residues in the amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 (32Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), did not significantly affect the interaction of FOXO1 and PP2A (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the presence of 14-3-3 did not inhibit PP2A binding to FOXO1. However, when 14-3-3 was present, phosphorylation at Thr24 and Ser256 was protected from PP2A action. When 14-3-3 was displaced by R18, Thr(P)24 was greatly diminished and Ser(P)256 became undetectable (Fig. 2D, compare Thr(P)24 and Ser(P)256 bands in lanes 3 and 4). Similar PP2A association with FOXO1wt and the AAA mutant indicated that binding of PP2A was not regulated by the phosphorylation status of the AKT sites on FOXO1. PP1 was never detected in any of the FOXO1 immunocomplexes. To verify that PP2A will bind to endogenous FOXO1, we immunoprecipitated endogenous FOXO1 from the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and NIH 3T3 cells. Both PP2A/C and 14-3-3 were readily detected in endogenous FOXO1 complexes, as well as in complexes of induced FOXO1 in F14 cells, supporting the physiologic relevance of the FOXO1 and PP2A interaction (Fig. 2E). FOXO1 Interacts Directly with PP2A—We tested whether the PP2A AC core dimer interacted directly with FOXO1. Immunoprecipitated FOXO1 extensively washed with detergent buffer to remove associated proteins was incubated with purified AC dimer. The absence of 14-3-3 in the complex confirmed that the known associated protein was successfully removed by detergent washing. Immunoblotting suggested that PP2A/C bound to FOXO1 directly (Fig. 2F). Direct binding of PP2A to FOXO1 was further tested by incubating bacterially produced GST-FOXO1 or GST-pFOXO1 with purified PP2A AC dimer (Fig. 2G). PP2A/C bound to both recombinant GST-FOXO1 and GST-pFOXO1, but not GST. PP2A/A was also detected in the complex. The experiments in Fig. 2 demonstrated conclusively that a PP2A enzyme binds both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated FOXO1 directly. PP2A Dephosphorylates FOXO1—Next, we tested whether PP2A has enzymatic activity against FOXO1. Immunoprecipitated FOXO1 was incubated with purified PP2A AC dimer in an in vitro phosphatase assay. PP2A dephosphorylated both Thr(P)24 and Ser(P)256 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). To confirm that PP2A is a physiologic phosphatase of FOXO1, PP2A siRNA was nucleofected into F14 cells and FOXO1 phosphorylation was assayed by Western analysis. The PP2A/C level was significantly decreased in cells nucleofected with PP2A siRNA, and phosphorylation of Thr(P)24 and Ser(P)256 was concomitantly increased (Fig. 3B, left). PP1 siRNA had no significant effect on FOXO1 dephosphorylation (Fig. 3B, right). These results are consistent with PP2A being the major phosphatase for FOXO1. Inhibition of PP2A Prevents Nuclear Translocation of FOXO1—Phosphorylation of Ser256 is important for FOXO1 transactivation by inhibiting nuclear import through suppression of a nuclear localization signal. To address the physiologic function of FOXO1 dephosphorylation, we asked whether GFP-FOXO1 translocation is affected by inhibition of phosphatases. In the presence of serum, GFP-FOXO1 was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus. After serum withdrawal, GFP fluorescence translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 4A, panels a and b). However, when the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor OA, calyculin A, or fostriecin were added in the absence of serum, GFP-FOXO1 remained cytoplasmic in a significant number of the cells (Fig. 4A, panels d–f). Nuclear translocation was decreased ∼50% by these PP1 and PP2A phosphatase inhibitors (Figs. 4B). In contrast, FK506, which inhibits PP2B, had no effect on FOXO1 nuclear translocation (Fig. 4, A, panel c, and B). The PP1 and PP2A inhibitors acted on the physiologic phosphorylation sites of FOXO1, because they failed to affect the localization of the GFP-FOXO1-AAA mutant (Fig. 4, A panels g–j, and B). To determine whether decreased FOXO1 nuclear translocation by phosphatase inhibitors was specifically due to inhibition of PP2A, PP2A siRNA was co-transfected with GFP-FOXO1. Induction of cell death by staurosporine (STS) led to translocation of GFP-FOXO1 into the nucleus in the majority of cells within 1 h. In cells with PP2A knockdown, GFP-FOXO1 remained largely cytoplasmic at the same time point, whereas scrambled siRNA had no effect on GFP-FOXO1 translocation (Fig. 4, C and D). The delay in FOXO1 nuclear translocation associated with PP2A knockdown linked PP2A to a physiologic FOXO1 function. Inhibition of Serine/Threonine Phosphatase Prevents BIM Up-regulation by FOXO1 and Rescues FOXO1-induced Cell Death—BIM, a pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member, is up-regulated by FOXO in hematopoietic cell death (5Dijkers P.F.

Because serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors prevented dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO1, we tested whether BIM expression was altered when FOXO1 dephosphorylation was inhibited. After IL3 withdrawal from F14 cells, FOXO1 was dephosphorylated and the BIM level increased at the times tested, 1.5 and 3 h. Calyculin A prevented FOXO1 dephosphorylation after IL3 withdrawal and BIM expression remained unchanged (Fig. 5A). This result demonstrated that inhibition of FOXO"
https://openalex.org/W2128499874,"Background The objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with the nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin slows cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methodology/Principal Findings This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between May 2000 and September 2005 in two hospitals in the Netherlands. 51 patients with mild to moderate AD were enrolled into the study. Patients received 100 mg indomethacin or placebo daily for 12 months. Additionally, all patients received omeprazole. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline after one year of treatment on the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Secondary outcome measures included the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change with caregiver input, the noncognitive subscale of the ADAS, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Interview for Deterioration in Daily life in Dementia. Considerable recruitment problems of participants were encountered, leading to an underpowered study. In the placebo group, 19 out of 25 patients completed the study, and 19 out of 26 patients in the indomethacin group. The deterioration on the ADAS-cog was less in the indomethacin group (7.8±7.6), than in the placebo group (9.3±10.0). This difference (1.5 points; CI −4.5–7.5) was not statistically significant, and neither were any of the secondary outcome measures. Conclusions/Significance The results of this study are inconclusive with respect to the hypothesis that indomethacin slows the progression of AD. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00432081"
https://openalex.org/W2009253350,"Background Imaging single cells with fluorescent markers over multiple cell cycles is a powerful tool for unraveling the mechanism and dynamics of the cell cycle. Over the past ten years, microfluidic techniques in cell biology have emerged that allow for good control of growth environment. Yet the control and quantification of transient gene expression in unperturbed dividing cells has received less attention. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we describe a microfluidic flow cell to grow Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for more than 8 generations (≈12 hrs) starting with single cells, with controlled flow of the growth medium. This setup provides two important features: first, cells are tightly confined and grow in a remarkably planar array. The pedigree can thus be determined and single-cell fluorescence measured with 3 minutes resolution for all cells, as a founder cell grows to a micro-colony of more than 200 cells. Second, we can trigger and calibrate rapid and transient gene expression using reversible administration of inducers that control the GAL1 or MET3 promoters. We then show that periodic 10–20 minutes gene induction pulses can drive many cell division cycles with complete coherence across the cell cluster, with either a G1/S trigger (cln1 cln2 cln3 MET3-CLN2) or a mitotic trigger (cdc20 GALL-CDC20). Conclusions/Significance In addition to evident cell cycle applications, this device can be used to directly measure the amount and duration of any fluorescently scorable signal-transduction or gene-induction response over a long time period. The system allows direct correlation of cell history (e.g., hysteresis or epigenetics) or cell cycle position with the measured response."
https://openalex.org/W2114094798,"The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans resides asymptomatically in the gut of most healthy people but causes serious invasive diseases in immunocompromised patients. Many C. albicans strains have the ability to stochastically switch between distinct white and opaque cell types, but it is not known with certainty what role this switching plays in the physiology of the organism. Here, we report a previously undescribed difference between white and opaque cells, namely their interaction with host phagocytic cells. We show that both Drosophila hemocyte-derived S2 cells and mouse macrophage-derived RAW264.7 cells preferentially phagocytose white cells over opaque cells. This difference is seen both in the overall percentage of cultured cells that phagocytose white versus opaque C. albicans and in the average number of C. albicans taken up by each phagocytic cell. We conclude that susceptibility to phagocytosis by cells of the innate immune system is an important distinction between white and opaque C. albicans, and propose that one role of switching from the prevalent white form into the rarer opaque form may be to allow C. albicans to escape phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1999760558,"Claudin-1 (CLDN1), a tight junction (TJ) protein, has recently been identified as an entry co-receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Ectopic expression of CLDN1 rendered several non-hepatic cell lines permissive to HCV infection. However, little is known about the mechanism by which CLDN1 mediates HCV entry. It is believed that an additional entry receptor(s) is required because ectopic expression of CLDN1 in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells failed to confer susceptibility to viral infection. Here we found that CLDN1 was co-immunoprecipitated with both HCV envelope proteins when expressed in 293T cells. Results from biomolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed that overexpressed CLDN1 also formed complexes with CD81 and low density lipoprotein receptor. Subsequent imaging analysis revealed that CLDN1 was highly enriched at sites of cell-cell contact in permissive cell lines, co-localizing with the TJ marker, ZO-1. However, in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells the ectopically expressed CLDN1 appeared to reside predominantly in intracellular vesicles. The CLDN1-CD81 complex formed in HeLa cells was also exclusively distributed intracellularly, co-localizing with EEA1, an early endosomal marker. Correspondingly, transepithelial electric resistance, obtained from the naturally susceptible human liver cell line, Huh7, was much higher than that of the HeLa-CLDN1 cell line, suggesting that Huh7 is likely to form functional tight junctions. Finally, the disruption of TJ-enriched CLDN1 by tumor necrosis factor-α treatment markedly reduced the susceptibility of Huh7.5.1 cells to HCV infection.

Importantly, pseudoviral particles that consist of an HIV core and HCV E1 and E2 (i.e. HCVpp) have been found to strictly infect human hepatocytes and a few hepatoma-derived cell lines (2Bartosch B.

Like CD81, CLDN1 spans the plasma membrane four times and is a component of the tight junction barrier that restricts the free exchange of ions and aqueous molecules between cells (20Van Itallie C.M.

It was shown that CLDN1 is required for HCV infection of human hepatoma cell lines and was the first factor to confer susceptibility to HCV when ectopically expressed in non-hepatic cell types (19Evans M.J. von Hahn T.

Discrete residues within the first extracellular loop (EL1) of CLDN1, but not the protein interaction motifs within the intracellular domains, are required for HCV entry. While the precise role of CLDN1 in HCV entry remains unclear, it was shown to facilitate fusion between virions and cell membranes in a fusion assay (19Evans M.J. von Hahn T. Tscherne D.M. Syder A.J. Panis M. Wolk B. Hatziioannou T. McKeating J.A. Bieniasz P.D. Rice C.M. Nature. 2007; 446: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), indicating that it is a critical component for entry. However, several cell lines remained resistant to HCVpp infection, even upon the ectopic expression of CLDN1. It is therefore reasonable to assume that an additional factor(s) is required for viral entry. In an attempt to define the role of CLDN1 in HCV entry, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies and demonstrated that overexpressed CLDN1 could interact with HCV E1 and E2, CD81, and the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). We then fortuitously found that the subcellular distribution of CLDN1 correlated with the permissiveness of the cells to HCVpp infection. Specifically, ectopically expressed CLDN1 in non-permissive lines was localized predominantly within intracellular vesicles, whereas in permissive lines, it was enriched at sites of cell-cell contact. Huh7 cells displayed a considerably high transepithelial electric resistance compared with HeLa-CLDN1 cells, indicating that they form functional TJs that prohibit free ion diffusion. Endogenous CLDN1 also co-localized with the TJ marker, ZO-1, at cell-cell contacts in Huh7 cells, suggesting that these cells form TJs. Finally, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) treatment disrupted the cell surface expression of CLDN1 in the Huh7.5.1 cell line; as a result, treated cells showed decreased susceptibility to HCVpp infection. These results suggest that cell type-specific CLDN1 localization may be a novel mechanism by which the HCV cellular tropism is controlled. Cell Lines and Reagents—The human kidney epithelial cell line HEK293T (CRL-11268), the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 (HTB-37), mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells (CRL-1658), and the human lung cancer cell line A549 (CCL-185) were purchased from The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The human osteosarcoma cell line Ghost and the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa were both obtained through the NIAID AIDS research and reference program. HepG2 cells were provided by Dr. QingDe Wang (University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute). The human liver cell line Huh7 was obtained from Apath Inc., with the permission of Dr. Charles Rice (Rockefeller University). The Huh7.5.1 line generated from a cured HCV replicon cell line was provided by Dr. Francis Chisari (Scripps Research Institute). A Huh7 cell line stably producing JFH1 HCVcc was a generous gift from Dr. G. Luo (University of Kentucky) (22Cai Z. Zhang C. Chang K.S. Jiang J. Ahn B.C. Wakita T. Liang T.J. Luo G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13963-13973Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All cell lines except A549 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% penicillin and streptomycin, 1% NEAA, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The A549 cell line was maintained in F12K media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin and streptomycin. Antibodies were obtained from Dr. Harry Greenberg (HCV E1, clone A4), Dr. Jean Dubuisson (HCV E2, clones H47, H52, H53), Zymed Laboratories Inc. (anti-CLDN1, clones 2H10D10 and JAY.8, and anti-ZO-1, clone ZO1-1A12), BD Bioscience (monoclonal anti-EEA1), and Sigma (anti-FLAG M2 and β-actin). DNA Constructs—Full-length human CLDN1, CD81, LDLR, HCV E1, E2, and MLV envelope protein (MLV Env) were cloned into the XbaI/NotI sites of the pcDNA3-VN and pcDNA3-VC plasmids to produce fusions to N-terminal residues 1-172 (VN), or C-terminal residues 155-238 (VC) of the Venus protein, leaving the VN- or VC-tagged to the C terminus of the target proteins. hCLDN1, FLAG-CLDN1, and CD81 were also cloned between the BglII/XhoI sites of the pMIR-DFT plasmid for expression. CLDN1-EGFP was generated by inserting the hCLDN1 gene between the BglII/SalI sites of the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech). Detailed plasmid maps are available upon request. pCMV E1 and E2 were provided by Dr. Charles Rice (Rockefeller University) expressing full-length genotype 1a (H77) HCV E1 and E2 (4Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7271-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Production of HCVpp—To produce the pseudovirus, HEK293T cells were seeded 1 day prior to transfection at 2.5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm plate in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or the standard calcium phosphate transfection method. The DNA transfection mixture (1 ml) was composed of 10 μg of pNL-4.3-Luc-E-R-(obtained through the NIAID AIDS research and reagent program), 10 μg of phCMV-HCV E1E2 (a generous gift from Dr. Cosset, INSERM, France), or 3 μg of pHEF-VSV-G (expressing the VSV-G Env protein). pNL-4.3-Luc-E-R-expresses all the HIV proteins except Env, Vpr, and Nef. Two frameshift mutations were introduced into the Env- and Vpr-coding regions and the firefly luciferase gene was inserted in-frame immediately downstream of the start codon of the Nef gene. As a result, the produced pseudovirus is infectious for only one round. In our study, HCVpp and VSVpp represent lentivirus particles pseudotyped with HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins or with VSV-G glycoprotein, respectively. A nonenveloped lentivirus particle (Bald virus) was also generated as the negative control. To make this particle, the amount of envelope-encoding plasmid was replaced by the same amount of pcDNA3 empty plasmid. Sixteen hours after transfection, media was replaced; supernatants containing HCVpp were typically harvested 36-48 h after transfection and then filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter. Because HIV viral-like particles can be formed and released even in the absence of the Env protein, the level of p24 in the supernatant is not an accurate indicator of HCVpp viral titer. We therefore determined viral titer using an end point titration assay; infection unit/ml (international units/ml) is used to represent the titer of HCVpp. The typical viral titer for HCVpp using the pNL4.3-Luc-E-R-construct is between 4 × 103 and 4 × 104 international units/ml. HCVpp Infection Assay—To conduct the infection assay, Huh 7 or other cell lines were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well 1 day prior to transduction. The next day, 500 μl of supernatant containing HCVpp or VSVpp or Bald virus was added into each well in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene and 10 μl of 2 m HEPES (pH 7.55) and centrifuged in a table-top centrifuge machine (2500 rpm, 30 °C, 90 min). Cells were washed twice in 500 μl of PBS and then 500 μl of fresh media was added into each well. Thirty-six hours after transduction, cells were lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer and 20-50-μl lysate was incubated with 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega luciferase assay kit). We used a Veritas luminometer and typically obtained counts ranging from 5000 to 100,000 following this protocol. The background signal from a blank well is usually less than 100 counts. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—For cell lysate preparation, monolayer cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) on ice. The lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Boiled samples in 2× SDS loading buffer were loaded onto a 10-12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitro-cellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The resulting blots were blocked in 10% milk for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody used in the immunoblot was a 1:2000 dilution of HRP-linked anti-IgG. The ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) was used as the substrate for detection. For immunoprecipitation-coupled Western blotting, the cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) and washed with lysis buffer. Eluted samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-E1, -E2, and -FLAG antibodies. HCVcc Production—To produce high titer infectious HCV virus (JFH1 strain), we first collected virus secreted by a Huh 7-stable cell line. The HCV produced by this line was then used to infect a human liver cell line (Huh7.5.1) according to a published procedure (23Zhong J. Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Kapadia S. Kato T. Burton D.R. Wieland S.F. Uprichard S.L. Wakita T. Chisari F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9294-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). On day 7, media was collected containing high-titer viruses. For long-term storage, viruses were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. This step was shown not to decrease virus infectivity even after three freeze-thaw cycles (17Lindenbach B.D. Evans M.J. Syder A.J. Wolk B. Tellinghuisen T.L. Liu C.C. Maruyama T. Hynes R.O. Burton D.R. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2005; 309: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). To determine the viral titer, Huh-7.5.1 cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well. Medium containing HCV was serially diluted 2-fold in complete growth medium and used to infect the seeded cells (3-4 wells per dilution). Forty-eight hours following infection, culture media were aspirated and cells were fixed in 100 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton-X 100 for 30 min. To stain the cells, a 1:400 (2.5 μg/ml) dilution of monoclonal antibody against the HCV core protein (ABR affinity bioreagent, clone C7-50) was used, and the incubation was carried out at room temperature for 2 h. As a negative control, purified normal mouse IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included as a primary antibody. After incubation, the antibody solution was discarded and cells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS followed by an incubation with 50 μl of appropriately diluted FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, secondary antibody was removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were then mounted on slides and counterstained with DAPI at a 1:2,000 dilution. Images were obtained by an Olympus Provis II fluorescence microscope. When nearly 100% of the cells were positive for core staining, we then calculated the viral titer as international unit/ml. Our method typically yielded viral titers ranging from 105 to 106 international units/ml. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Transfected or infected cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (30 min, room temperature). Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS three times (PBST; 10 min, room temperature), blocked in 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS (1 h, room temperature), and incubated in PBS (1 h, room temperature) with appropriately diluted primary antibodies against CLDN1 (1:80), HCVE2 (clone H47) (1:100), and EEA1 (1:500). Samples were washed in PBS and subsequently incubated with either FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS (1:100) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were mounted on slides and sealed with nail polish. Images were captured by a Leica TCS-SL confocal microscope, edited using Metamorph, and assembled using Photoshop CS (Adobe). In most studies, the nucleus was stained with Draq5 (Biostatus). Biomolecular Fluorescence Complementation Assay (BiFC)—We adopted a protocol developed by others (24Shyu Y.J. Liu H. Deng X. Hu C.D. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) for BiFC assays. Briefly, DNA plasmids were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and transiently transfected into cells preseeded on a 24-well plate. On the day of transfection, the cell density was ∼50% confluent. The total amount of DNA plasmids was maintained at 0.25 μg as this amount of DNA was determined previously to yield the highest ratio of BiFC signal over background (24Shyu Y.J. Liu H. Deng X. Hu C.D. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed and co-stained for other markers when necessary. Samples were then analyzed by either immunofluorescence or confocal microscopy using the FITC filter setting. To quantify the percentage of positive cells, cells were resuspended in PBS (without fixation) and directly analyzed by flow cytometry. Transepithelial Electric Resistance Measurement—1000 Huh7, Caco-2, and Hela-CLDN1 cells were seeded on a 24-well transwell plate (Corning, 6.5-mm membrane diameter, 0.4-μm pore size). Cells that were resuspended in 0.2 ml of medium were added to the upper chamber, and 0.5 ml of medium was added to the lower chamber in triplicate. Resistance was measured daily for 6 days using an epithelial voltohmmeter (EVOM, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). A blank well with no cells was maintained, and the average resistance from the blank was subtracted from the sample. Resistance (R) per unit area was calculated as (Rsample - Rblank) × 0.33 cm2. Flow Cytometric Analysis—GFP-positive cells or cells stained with antibodies specific for CD81 or HCVE2 were analyzed on a Coulter XL flow cytometer. Acquired data were analyzed and plotted using WinMDI 2.9 software. Interactions between CLDN1 and HCV Glycoproteins—Although CLDN1 was suggested as an entry co-receptor for HCV, little is known about the interactions between CLDN1 and HCV envelope proteins (E1 and E2). We therefore performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found that FLAG-CLDN1 could pull down HCV E1 and E2 when E1 and E2 were co-expressed in 293T cells from the same plasmid (Fig. 1A). Because E1 and E2 are known to dimerize (5Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Op De Beeck A. Montserret R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31428-31437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next expressed E1 and E2 separately in 293T cells and found that both E1 and E2, but not the negative control PLIC-1, could be independently precipitated with FLAG-CLDN1 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, overexpressed HCV E2 partially co-localized with CLDN1 in vesicular-like structures in both Ghost and HeLa cells (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that in overexpression systems, CLDN1 is able to interact with both HCV glycoproteins, which is in sharp contrast with CD81 and SR-BI, both of which only interact with E2 (13Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar, 14Scarselli E.

Dubuisson J. Levy S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10677-10683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ghost and HeLa cells were chosen for these studies because of their suitable morphology (considerable size of cytoplasm) and relatively high transfection efficiency compared with the human hepatoma cell line Huh7. It should be noted that neither of these lines express endogenous CLDN1 (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Ectopic expression of CLDN1 rendered Ghost but not HeLa cells susceptible to HCVpp infection (supplemental Fig. S1C). FLAG-CLDN1 and other tagged proteins used in this study were tested to be functional in infection assays (supplemental Fig. S1D). Association of CLDN1 with CD81 and LDLR—To study the interactions between CLDN1 and other HCV receptors, such as CD81 and LDLR, we utilized a novel approach, the BiFC assay (Fig. 2A). In a standard BiFC assay, a fluorescent protein gene is divided into N-terminal and C-terminal segments. Separately, the encoded fragments are unable to fluoresce; however, co-expression of interacting proteins individually fused to these fragments generates detectable fluorescence signal when the two fluorescent protein fragments are placed in close proximity (less than 15 nm). The BiFC assay has been used previously to demonstrate co-assembly of HIV-1 and HIV-2 Gag 319 (27Jin J. Sturgeon T. Chen C. Watkins S.C. Weisz O.A. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 11226-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We prepared a panel of constructs expressing fusion proteins with the optimized N- (VN) and C- (VC) terminal fragments of the Venus fluorescence protein for BiFC assay. One of the advantages of BiFC assay over the regular co-staining method is that the signal can be easily quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). In summary, CLDN1 formed a BiFC complex with HCVE1, E2, CD81, and LDLR, but not with the MLV Env protein. Similar observations could be repeated in the Huh7 cell line despite lower transfection efficiency (data not shown). By contrast, CD81 could only complex with HCV E2 but not E1, which is consistent with a previous report (26Cocquerel L. Kuo C.C. Dubuisson J. Levy S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10677-10683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Together, these results confirmed our co-immunoprecipitation studies. Because the addition of VN or VC might disrupt the function of CLDN1, we monitored the expression level of the BiFC constructs by Western analysis and found that they expressed well (Fig. 2C). Subsequently, we tested whether these BiFC constructs could mediate HCVpp entry. VN- or VC-fused CLDN1, but not CD81, were able to mediate efficient HCVpp entry into 293T cells (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S1C). Tagged CD81 was able to render HepG2 cells permissive to HCVpp infection (supplemental Fig. S2A) and could be displayed on the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S2B) as well; suggesting that the addition of the tag was unlikely to disrupt CD81 function. HCV entry into target cells is a low pH-dependent process, presumably requiring receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Codran A. Royer C. Jaeck D. Bastien-Valle M. Baumert T.F. Kieny M.P. Pereira C.A.

It appeared that CLDN1-CD81 and CLDN1-LDLR interactions occurred both on plasma membranes as well as intracellularly in both GHOST (Fig. 3, A and B) and Huh 7 cell lines (date not shown). The intracellular portion of the formed complex strongly co-localized with early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1), an early endosomal marker. Interestingly, in HeLa cells, the CLDN1-CD81 complex was exclusively concentrat"
https://openalex.org/W2061644646,"It is generally assumed that human differentiated cells have a limited life-span and proliferation capacity in vivo, and that genetic modifications are a prerequisite for their immortalization in vitro. Here we readdress this issue, studying the long-term proliferation potential of human B cells. It was shown earlier that human B cells from peripheral blood of healthy donors can be efficiently induced to proliferate for up to ten weeks in vitro by stimulating their receptor CD40 in the presence of interleukin-4. When we applied the same stimuli under conditions of modified cell number and culture size, we were surprised to find that our treatment induced B cells to proliferate throughout an observation period of presently up to 1650 days, representing more than 370 population doublings, which suggested that these B cells were immortalized in vitro. Long-term CD40-stimulated B cell cultures could be established from most healthy adult human donors. These B cells had a constant phenotype, were free from Epstein-Barr virus, and remained dependent on CD40 ligation. They had constitutive telomerase activity and stabilized telomere length. Moreover, they were susceptible to activation by Toll-like receptor 9 ligands, and could be used to expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro. Our results indicate that human somatic cells can evade senescence and be conditionally immortalized by external stimulation only, without a requirement for genetic manipulation or oncoviral infection. Conditionally immortalized human B cells are a new tool for immunotherapy and studies of B cell oncogenesis, activation, and function."
https://openalex.org/W2038012621,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disorder characterized by cancer susceptibility and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinks and other damages. Thirteen complementation groups and genes are identified, including BRCA2, which is defective in the FA-D1 group. Eight of the FA proteins, including FANCG, participate in a nuclear core complex that is required for the monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 and FANCI. FANCD2, like FANCD1/BRCA2, is not part of the core complex, and we previously showed direct BRCA2–FANCD2 interaction using yeast two-hybrid analysis. We now show in human and hamster cells that expression of FANCG protein, but not the other core complex proteins, is required for co-precipitation of BRCA2 and FANCD2. We also show that phosphorylation of FANCG serine 7 is required for its co-precipitation with BRCA2, XRCC3 and FANCD2, as well as the direct interaction of BRCA2–FANCD2. These results argue that FANCG has a role independent of the FA core complex, and we propose that phosphorylation of serine 7 is the signalling event required for forming a discrete complex comprising FANCD1/BRCA2-FANCD2-FANCG-XRCC3 (D1-D2-G-X3). Cells that fail to express either phospho-Ser7-FANCG, or full length BRCA2 protein, lack the interactions amongst the four component proteins. A role for D1-D2-G-X3 in homologous recombination repair (HRR) is supported by our finding that FANCG and the RAD51-paralog XRCC3 are epistatic for sensitivity to DNA crosslinking compounds in DT40 chicken cells. Our findings further define the intricate interface between FANC and HRR proteins in maintaining chromosome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2094710221,"In the Sahel, most malaria deaths occur among children 1-4 years old during a short transmission season. A trial of seasonal intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and a single dose of artesunate (AS) showed an 86% reduction in the incidence of malaria in Senegal but this may not be the optimum regimen. We compared this regimen with three alternatives.2102 children aged 6-59 months received either one dose of SP plus one dose of AS (SP+1AS) (the previous regimen), one dose of SP plus 3 daily doses of AS (SP+3AS), one dose of SP plus three daily doses of amodiaquine (AQ) (SP+3AQ) or 3 daily doses of AQ and AS (3AQ+3AS). Treatments were given once a month on three occasions during the malaria transmission season. The primary end point was incidence of clinical malaria. Secondary end-points were incidence of adverse events, mean haemoglobin concentration and prevalence of parasites carrying markers of resistance to SP.The incidence of malaria, and the prevalence of parasitaemia at the end of the transmission season, were lowest in the group that received SP+3AQ: 10% of children in the group that received SP+1AS had malaria, compared to 9% in the SP+3AS group (hazard ratio HR 0.90, 95%CI 0.60, 1.36); 11% in the 3AQ+3AS group, HR 1.1 (0.76-1.7); and 5% in the SP+3AQ group, HR 0.50 (0.30-0.81). Mutations associated with resistance to SP were present in almost all parasites detected at the end of the transmission season, but the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum was very low in the SP+3AQ group.Monthly treatment with SP+3AQ is a highly effective regimen for seasonal IPT. Choice of this regimen would minimise the spread of drug resistance and allow artemisinins to be reserved for the treatment of acute clinical malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2119511077,"The therapeutic efficacy of recombinant antibodies such as single-chain Fv fragments and small bispecific or bifunctional molecules is often limited by rapid elimination from the circulation because of their small size. Here, we have investigated the effects of N-glycosylation on the activity and pharmacokinetics of a small bispecific single-chain diabody (scDb CEACD3) developed for the retargeting of cytotoxic T cells to CEA-expressing tumor cells. We could show that the introduction of N-glycosylation sequons into the flanking linker and a C-terminal extension results in the production of N-glycosylated molecules after expression in transfected HEK293 cells. N-Glycosylated scDb variants possessing 3, 6, or 9 N-glycosylation sites, respectively, retained antigen binding activity and bispecificity for target and effector cells as shown in a target cell-dependent IL-2 release assay, although activity was reduced ∼3–5-fold compared with the unmodified scDb. All N-glycosylated scDb variants exhibited a prolonged circulation time compared with scDb, leading to a 2–3-fold increase of the area under curve (AUC). In comparison, conjugation of a branched 40-kDa PEG chain increased AUC by a factor of 10.6, while a chimeric anti-CEA IgG1 molecule had the longest circulation time with a 17-fold increase in AUC.

This is mainly due to the small size leading to rapid renal clearance and the lack of recycling processes mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Thus, repeated injections or infusions are required to maintain a therapeutically effective dose in the body (5Schlereth B. Fichtner I. Lorenczewski G. Kleindienst P. Brischwein K. da Silva A.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2882-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Several strategies to improve pharmacokinetic properties and thus dosing and therapeutic efficacy of recombinant antibodies have been developed in recent years. These strategies can be divided into: 1) those based on reducing renal clearance by increasing the apparent size of the therapeutic molecule, and 2) those that in addition implement FcRn-mediated recycling processes (6Mahmood I.

Several PEGylated proteins are in clinical use, e.g. PEGylated interferon α-2a (PegIntron, PEGASYS) and PEGylated granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (Neulasta), or are under clinical development, e.g. a PEGylated anti-TNF Fab fragment (certolizumab pegol) (9Duncan R.

This strategy is based on the observation that albumin has a similar half-life as IgG and also utilizes FcRn-mediated recycling processes. One albumin fusion protein, albumin-interferon-α (Albuferon α), is currently in clinical development (16Bain V.G. Kaita K.D. Yoshida E.M. Swain M.G. Heathcote E.J. Neumann A.U. Fiscella M. Yu R.

Darbepoetin alpha (Aranesp) is a recombinant form of human erythropoietin possessing 2 additional N-glycosylation sites resulting in a hyperglycosylated protein (5 N-glycosylation sites in total) with a ∼2-fold prolonged half-life and an improved in vivo activity (19Egrie J.C. Browne J.K. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In other studies, glycosylated analogs of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) with prolonged circulation time and increased activity have been generated by adding N-glycans through an N-terminal extension of the α subunit (20Perlman S. van den Hazel B. Christiansen J. Gram-Nielsen S. Jeppesen C.B. Andersen K.V. Halkier T. Okkels S. Schambye H.T. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Here, we performed a comparative analysis of N-glycosylated bispecific single-chain diabody (scDb) molecules with other modifications including PEGylation. N-Glycosylation at 3, 6, or 9 Asn-X-Thr sites introduced at the flanking linker sequences and C-terminal extensions prolonged half-life ∼2-fold leading to a 2–3-fold increase of the AUC. In contrast, site-directed chemical coupling of a branched PEG molecule of 40 kDa to a cysteine residue introduced in one of the linker sequences prolonged circulation time ∼5-fold resulting in a 11-fold increase of the AUC, similar to fusion of the scDb molecule with human serum albumin or a albumin binding domain of streptococcal protein G.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His tag antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, unconjugated anti-His tag antibody from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany) and anti-mouse IgG-FITC or PE-conjugated antibody as well as goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC-conjugated antibody from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Rabbit antiserum recognizing PEGylated scDb was produced by Pineda Antikörper-Service (Berlin, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Roche Applied Sciences (Mannheim, Germany). Carcinoembryonic antigen was obtained from Europa Bioproducts (Cambridge, UK). Branched mPEG2-Mal was purchased from Nectar Therapeutics (Birmingham, AL). The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T was purchased from ECACC (Wiltshire, UK) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS. HEK293 were cultured in RPMI 1640, 5% FBS. Buffy coat from a healthy human donor was kindly provided by Prof. G. Multhoff (München, Germany). IL-2 was purchased from Immunotools (Friesoythe, Germany) and phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA-L) from Roche Applied Sciences (Germany).

Chem. 2007; 282: 12650-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was used as starting material for the construction of scDb variants. Cysteine residues were introduced into linker A or the C terminus by PCR (scDb-A′, scDb-C′). Similarly, N-glycosylation sites were introduced into the linkers A and B as well as at the C terminus (scDbABC1, scDbABC4, scDbABC7) (see also Fig. 1). The N-glycosylation sites for scDbABC4 and scDbABC7 were first optimized using the NetNglyc-Software, 4R. Gupta, E. Jung, and S. Brunak, personal communication. which allowed an in silico prediction of N-glycosylation efficiency. All constructs were cloned into pSecTagA (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) via SfiI/EcoRI for eukaryotic expression.Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmid DNA encoding the respective recombinant antibody was transfected with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) into HEK293 cells. Stable transfectants were generated by selection with zeocin (300 μg/ml). For protein production, cells were first expanded and grown in RPMI 1640, 5% FBS to 90% confluence and subsequently cultured in Opti-MEM®I (Invitrogen) replacing media every 3 days 3–4 times. Supernatants were pooled, and proteins were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation), before loading onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was performed as described elsewhere (4Müller D. Karle A. Meiβburger B. Höfig I. Stork R. Kontermann R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12650-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).PEGylation of scDb Molecules—scDb-A′ and scDb-C′ were reduced with 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP) (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. TCEP was removed by dialyzing the solution overnight in an airtight bottle with oxygen-free phosphate buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaCl, pH 6.7). Subsequently, a 10-fold molar excess of mPEG2-Mal (40 kDa) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C under non-oxygen conditions. The unbound mPEG2-Mal was removed by IMAC purification. PEGylation was visualized by barium iodide staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (23Natarajan A. Xiong C.Y. Albrecht H. DeNardo G.L. DeNardo S.J. Bioconjug. Chem. 2005; 16: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Chimeric Anti-CEA IgG1—The regions encoding the human γ1 heavy chain constant region and the human Cκ domain were amplified from cDNA generated from RNA isolated from human PBMCs and combined with DNA encoding the VH and VL domain of anti-CEA antibody MFE23 (24Chester K.A. Begent R.H. Robson L. Keep P. Pedley R.B. Boden J.A. Boxer G. Green A. Winter G. Cochet O. Hawkins R.E. Lancet. 1994; 343: 455-456Abstract PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) cloned previously into vector pSecTagA. DNA encoding the complete heavy and light chain was then cloned into pEE6.4 or pEE12.4, respectively (Lonza Biologics, Berkshire, UK). The two plasmids were then combined according to the manufacturer's protocol resulting in a bicistronic expression plasmid (pEE12.4-IgG1-CEA). The linearized plasmid was transfected into CHO-K1 cells and stably transfected clones were selected in glutamine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) in the presence of 25 μm methionine sulfoximine (MSX). IgG1 was purified from cell culture supernatant by protein A chromatography. In brief, proteins were precipitated from supernatant with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, resuspended in PBS, pH 8 and loaded onto a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column (Sigma). Bound protein was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0 and protein-containing fractions were dialyzed against PBS.ELISA—Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (300 ng/well) was coated overnight at 4 °C. After 2 h blocking with 2% (w/v) dry milk/PBS, recombinant antibody fragments were titrated in duplicates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed either with mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His tag antibody or rabbit antiserum and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody using TMB substrate (1 mg/ml TMB, sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.006% H2O2). The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1 m H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in an ELISA reader.Flow Cytometry—5 × 105 cells/well were incubated with recombinant antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mouse anti-His tag antibody or rabbit antiserum followed by washing and 30 min of incubation with PE-labeled anti-mouse IgG or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Wash cycles and incubation steps were performed with PBS, 2% FBS, 0.02% azide. Finally, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using an EPICS XL-MCL (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany).Size Exclusion Chromatography—Apparent molecular masses (Mr) of the native proteins were determined by HPLC size exclusion chromatography using a BioSep-Sec-3000 or BioSep-Sec-2000 column (Phenomenex, Torrance) and PBS as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The following standard proteins were used: thyroglobulin (669 kDa, RS 8.5 nm), apoferritin (443 kDa, RS 6.1 nm), β-amylase (200 kDa, RS 5.4 nm), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, RS 3.55 nm), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, RS 2.35 nm), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa, RS 1.77 nm).Carbohydrate Analysis—Glycoproteins (10–30 μg) were denatured in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol prior to addition of Nonidet P-40 and 100 units of PNGaseF (NEB Biolabs) according to the supplier's instructions. After incubation for 18 h the sample was desalted on graphitized carbon columns (Carbograph, Alltech) (25Packer N.H. Lawson M.A. Jardine D.R. Redmond J.W. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation and in a desiccator in the presence of P2O5/KOH. To the dry sample, 50 μl of base (NaOH/Me2SO) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. Finally, an aliquot of 25 μl of methyl iodide was added to the reaction mixture followed by incubation for another 30 min at room temperature. After neutralization with dilute acetic acid the methylated glycans were extracted with chloroform-water. The chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen and the glycans solubilized in methanol. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was performed on a Bruker Reflex IV instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The methylated glycan samples (∼500 pmol per μl) in methanol were applied to the stainless steel target by mixing a 0.5-μl aliquot with 1.0 μl of matrix (saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1:2). Analyses were performed by positive ion detection in the reflectron mode as described previously (26Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Müller S. Razawi H. Badlus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).IL-2 Release Assay—PBMCs were prepared from a leukapheresis as previously described (4Müller D. Karle A. Meiβburger B. Höfig I. Stork R. Kontermann R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12650-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). 1 × 105 LS174T or HT1080 13.8 cells/100 μl/well were seeded in 96-well plates. The next day, the supernatant was removed, and 100 μl of recombinant antibody in RPMI, 10% FBS added. After 1 h of preincubation at room temperature, 2 × 105 PBMC/100 μl/well were added. PBMCs had been thawed the day before and seeded in RPMI, 10% FBS on a culture dish, to remove monocytes by attachment to the plastic surface. Only cells that remained in suspension were used for the assay. After addition of PBMCs, the 96-well-plate was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Plates were centrifuged, and the cell-free supernatant collected. The concentration of human IL-2 in the supernatant after T-cell retargeting was determined by an IL-2-Sandwich-ELISA. Antihuman IL-2 antibodies as well as the standard of recombinant human IL-2 was provided by DuoSet IL-2 ELISA Development System kit (R&D Systems, Nordenstadt, Germany), and the assay was performed following the manufacturer's protocol.Pharmacokinetics—Animal care and all experiments performed were in accordance with federal guidelines and have been approved by university and state authorities. CD1 mice (female, 18–30 weeks, weight between 31–44 g, 3–6 mice/group) received an i.v. injection of 25 μg of recombinant antibody in a total volume of 200 μl. In time intervals of 3, 10, 30, 60, 120, 360 min and 24-h blood samples (100 μl) were taken from the tail and incubated on ice. Clotted blood was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, 4 °C and serum samples stored at -20 °C. Serum concentrations of CEA-binding recombinant antibodies were determined by ELISA (as described above), interpolating the corresponding calibration curves. For comparison, the first value (3 min) was set to 100%. Pharmacokinetic parameters AUC, t½α and t½β were calculated with Excel using the first 3 times points to calculate t½α and the last three time points to calculate t½β. For statistics, the Student's t test was applied.RESULTSN-Glycosylated scDb Molecules—To generate N-glycosylated scDb molecules 2 N-glycosylation sequons (NGT) were introduced in the flanking linkers (A, B) and 1 to 7 sequons at C-terminal extensions (Fig. 1). Thus, scDb-ABC1 contains 3 sequons, scDb-ABC4 6 sequons, and scDb-ABC7 9 sequons. These modified scDb molecules were expressed in stably transfected HEK293 cells and purified by IMAC with yields of 8–17 mg/liter supernatant. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed reduced mobility of these three molecules compared with unmodified scDb depending on the number of sequons (Fig. 2a and Table 1). N-Glycosylation of these proteins was confirmed by enzymatic deglycosylation with PNGase F, which reduced the apparent molecular mass to that calculated for the unmodified protein (Fig. 2a). Some heterogeneity in the degree of N-glycosylation was observed. In size exclusion chromatography (SEC), proteins eluted with a major peak corresponding in size to apparent molecular masses of 36 kDa for unmodified scDb, 38 kDa for scDb-ABC1, 65 kDa for scDb-ABC4, and 78 kDa for scDb-ABC7 (Fig. 2b and Table 1). As expected from SDS-PAGE analysis scDb-ABC4 and scDb-ABC7 eluted over a broad range, further indicating size heterogeneity of these proteins. Binding to CEA was not or only marginally impaired by N-glycosylation as shown in ELISA with immobilized CEA and flow cytometry with CEA-expressing cell line LS174T as well as CD3-positive PBMCs (Fig. 2, c and d). MALDI-MS further revealed the structural heterogeneity of attached N-glycans, which were of the bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex type (Table 2). No high-mannose or hybrid N-glycans were detected. The degree of sialylation of the N-glycans was found to be 34% for scDb-ABC1, 23% for scDb-ABC4, and 22% for scDb-ABC7 as deduced from a semi-quantitative analysis of the MALDI-MS data.FIGURE 2N-glycosylated scDbs. a, SDS-PAGE analysis of N-glycosylated scDb molecules (1 + 2 scDb-ABC7;3 + 4, scDb-ABC4;5 + 6, scDb-ABC1; 7, scDb) before (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) and after (lanes 2, 4, 6) treatment with PNGase F. 3 μg of purified protein was loaded per lane, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. b, size exclusion chromatography of unmodified (gray line) and N-glycosylated scDb molecules (black lines). c, ELISA of binding of unmodified and N-glycosylated scDb variants to immobilized CEA (n = 2). d, flow cytometry analysis of binding of unmodified and N-glycosylated scDb variants to CEA-expressing tumor cells (LS174T), CD3-positive PBMCs, or HEK293 cells included as negative control.

Both variants were expressed in stably transfected HEK293 cells and purified by IMAC with yields of 8 and 10 mg/liters supernatant, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis showed under reducing conditions a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 59 kDa and under non-reducing conditions two bands corresponding to monomeric protein (apparent molecular mass 57 kDa) and disulfide-linked proteins (apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa for scDb-A′ and 112 kDa for scDb-C′) (Fig. 3a). Both proteins were PEGylated by chemical conjugation of a branched 40-kDa mPEG chain (mPEG2-Mal) to reduced scDb-A′ and scDb-C′ (Fig. 3b). PEGylation resulted in an increase of the molecular mass to ∼230 kDa as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis. Coupling efficiency were 94% for scDb-A′ and 79% for scDb-C' as determined by SEC (Fig. 3c). Both proteins eluted with a major peak corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼650 kDa and a hydrodynamic radius of 7.9 nm (Table 1). Interestingly, PEGylated scDb-A′ (scDb-A′-PEG40k) and scDb-C′ (scDb-C′-PEG40k) were not or only weakly recognized by an anti-His tag antibody (Fig. 3b). Thus, for further analysis a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was produced by immunization with scDb-A′-PEG40k, which recognized both unPEGylated and PEGylated scDb variants in ELISA (not shown). Using this antiserum similar binding of scDb and scDb-A′-PEG40k to immobilized CEA was found (Fig. 3d).

https://openalex.org/W2022067890,"Vascularization is an important step in tumour growth. Although a variety of molecules, for example, VEGF, ETS-1 or nestin have been implicated in tumour angiogenesis, the molecular mechanisms of vessel formation are not fully characterized. We showed that the Wilms' tumour suppressor WT1 activates nestin during development. Here we tested whether WT1 might also be involved in tumour angiogenesis. Endothelial WT1 expression was detected in 95% of 113 tumours of different origin. To analyse the function of WT1 in endothelial cells, we used an RNAi approach in vitro and showed that inhibition of WT1 reduces cell proliferation, migration and endothelial tube formation. On a molecular level, WT1 silencing diminished expression of the ETS-1 transcription factor. WT1 and ETS-1 shared an overlapping expression in tumour endothelia. The ETS-1 promoter was stimulated approximately 10-fold by transient co-transfection of a WT1 expression construct and WT1 bound to the ETS-1 promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Deletion of the identified WT1-binding site abolished stimulation of the ETS-1 promoter by WT1. These findings suggest that transcriptional activation of ETS-1 by the Wilms' tumour suppressor WT1 is a crucial step in tumour vascularization via regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration."
https://openalex.org/W4230713655,"Background The objective was to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the AMA-1-based blood-stage malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A in adults exposed to seasonal malaria. Methodology/Principal Findings A phase 1 double blind randomized controlled dose escalation trial was conducted in Bandiagara, Mali, West Africa, a rural town with intense seasonal transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A is a recombinant protein (FMP2.1) based on apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) from the 3D7 clone of P. falciparum, adjuvanted with AS02A. The comparator vaccine was a cell-culture rabies virus vaccine (RabAvert). Sixty healthy, malaria-experienced adults aged 18–55 y were recruited into 2 cohorts and randomized to receive either a half dose or full dose of the malaria vaccine (FMP2.1 25 µg/AS02A 0.25 mL or FMP2.1 50 µg/AS02A 0.5 mL) or rabies vaccine given in 3 doses at 0, 1 and 2 mo, and were followed for 1 y. Solicited symptoms were assessed for 7 d and unsolicited symptoms for 30 d after each vaccination. Serious adverse events were assessed throughout the study. Titers of anti-AMA-1 antibodies were measured by ELISA and P. falciparum growth inhibition assays were performed on sera collected at pre- and post-vaccination time points. Transient local pain and swelling were common and more frequent in both malaria vaccine dosage groups than in the comparator group. Anti-AMA-1 antibodies increased significantly in both malaria vaccine groups, peaking at nearly 5-fold and more than 6-fold higher than baseline in the half-dose and full-dose groups, respectively. Conclusion/Significance The FMP2.1/AS02A vaccine had a good safety profile, was well-tolerated, and was highly immunogenic in malaria-exposed adults. This malaria vaccine is being evaluated in Phase 1 and 2 trials in children at this site. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00308061"
https://openalex.org/W1987728370,"The BRMS1 metastasis suppressor interacts with the protein AT-rich interactive domain 4A (ARID4A, RBBP1) as part of SIN3.histone deacetylase chromatin remodeling complexes. These transcriptional co-repressors regulate diverse cell phenotypes depending upon complex composition. To define BRMS1 complexes and their roles in metastasis suppression, we generated BRMS1 mutants (BRMS1(mut)) and mapped ARID4A interactions. BRMS1(L174D) disrupted direct interaction with ARID4A in yeast two-hybrid genetic screens but retained an indirect association with ARID4A in MDA-MB-231 and -435 human breast cancer cell lines by co-immunoprecipitation. Deletion of the first coiled-coil domain (BRMS1(DeltaCC1)) did not disrupt direct interaction in yeast two-hybrid screens but did prevent association by co-immunoprecipitation. These results suggest altered complex composition with BRMS1(mut). Although basal transcription repression was impaired and the pro-metastatic protein osteopontin was differentially down-regulated by BRMS1(L174D) and BRMS1(DeltaCC1), both down-regulated the epidermal growth factor receptor and suppressed metastasis in MDA-MB-231 and -435 breast cancer xenograft models. We conclude that BRMS1(mut), which modifies the composition of a SIN3.histone deacetylase chromatin remodeling complex, leads to altered gene expression profiles. Because metastasis requires the coordinate expression of multiple genes, down-regulation of at least one important gene, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, had the ability to suppress metastasis. Understanding which interactions are necessary for particular biochemical/cellular functions may prove important for future strategies targeting metastasis."

Here we demonstrated that the egg cytosol prepared from the newly fertilized eggs of zebrafish Danio rerio is capable of killing the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, via in vitro assay system of the complement activity established. All findings indicate that it is the complement system operating via the alternative pathway that is attributable to the bacteriolytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2017517089,"In this study, we uncover a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in Drosophila germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance. Disruption of Dicer-1 function in GSCs during adult life results in GSC loss. Surprisingly, however, loss of Dicer-1 during development does not result in a GSC maintenance defect, although a defect is seen if both Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 function are disrupted. Loss of the bantam miRNA mimics the Dicer-1 maintenance defect when induced in adult GSCs, suggesting that bantam plays a key role in GSC self-renewal. Mad, a component of the TGF-β pathway, behaves similarly to Dicer-1: adult GSC maintenance requires Mad if it is lost during adult life, but not if it is lost during pupal development. Overall, these results show stage-specific differential sensitivity of GSC maintenance to certain perturbations and suggest that there may be a Dicer-2-dependent GSC maintenance mechanism during development that is lost in later life."
https://openalex.org/W1988608740,"Background Environmental stress can accelerate the evolutionary rate of specific stress-response proteins and create new functions specialized for different environments, enhancing an organism's fitness to stressful environments. Pikas (order Lagomorpha), endemic, non-hibernating mammals in the modern Holarctic Region, live in cold regions at either high altitudes or high latitudes and have a maximum distribution of species diversification confined to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Variations in energy metabolism are remarkable for them living in cold environments. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays important roles in energy homeostasis. Methodology/Principal Findings To examine the extent of leptin variations within the Ochotona family, we cloned the entire coding sequence of pika leptin from 6 species in two regions (Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Inner Mongolia steppe in China) and the leptin sequences of plateau pikas (O. curzonia) from different altitudes on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We carried out both DNA and amino acid sequence analyses in molecular evolution and compared modeled spatial structures. Our results show that positive selection (PS) acts on pika leptin, while nine PS sites located within the functionally significant segment 85-119 of leptin and one unique motif appeared only in pika lineages-the ATP synthase α and β subunit signature site. To reveal the environmental factors affecting sequence evolution of pika leptin, relative rate test was performed in pikas from different altitudes. Stepwise multiple regression shows that temperature is significantly and negatively correlated with the rates of non-synonymous substitution (Ka) and amino acid substitution (Aa), whereas altitude does not significantly affect synonymous substitution (Ks), Ka and Aa. Conclusions/Significance Our findings support the viewpoint that adaptive evolution may occur in pika leptin, which may play important roles in pikas' ecological adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We speculate that cold, and probably not hypoxia, may be the primary environmental factor for driving adaptive evolution of pika leptin."
https://openalex.org/W2062161179,"In neuroblastoma cells, retinoic acid induces cell cycle arrest and differentiation through degradation of the F-box protein, Skp2, and stabilization of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27. However, the mechanism responsible for retinoic acid-mediated Skp2 destabilization is unknown. Since Skp2 is degraded by anaphase-promoting complex (APC)Cdh1, here we studied whether retinoic acid promotes differentiation of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by modulating Cdh1. We found that retinoic acid induced the nuclear accumulation of Cdh1 that paralleled Skp2 destabilization and p27 accumulation. The mRNA and protein abundance of Rae1—a nuclear export factor that limits APCCdh1 activity in mitosis—decreased upon retinoic acid-induced inhibition of neuroblastoma cell proliferation. Furthermore, either Rae1 overexpression or Cdh1 inhibition promoted Skp2 accumulation, p27 destabilization and prevented retinoic acid-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Conversely, inhibition of Rae1 accelerated retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Thus, retinoic acid downregulates Rae1, hence facilitating APCCdh1-mediated Skp2 degradation leading to the arrest of cell cycle progression and neuroblastoma differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2087764283,"Background The complex interplay between B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins constitutes a crucial checkpoint in apoptosis. Its detailed molecular mechanism remains controversial. Our former modeling studies have selected the ‘Direct Activation Model’ as a better explanation for experimental observations. In this paper, we continue to extend this model by adding interactions according to updating experimental findings. Methodology/Principal Findings Through mathematical simulation we found bistability, a kind of switch, can arise from a positive (double negative) feedback in the Bcl-2 interaction network established by anti-apoptotic group of Bcl-2 family proteins. Moreover, Bax/Bak auto-activation as an independent positive feedback can enforce the bistability, and make it more robust to parameter variations. By ensemble stochastic modeling, we also elucidated how intrinsic noise can change ultrasensitive switches into gradual responses. Our modeling result agrees well with recent experimental data where bimodal Bax activation distributions in cell population were found. Conclusions/Significance Along with the growing experimental evidences, our studies successfully elucidate the switch mechanism embedded in the Bcl-2 interaction network and provide insights into pharmacological manipulation of Bcl-2 apoptotic switch as further cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1970547179,"The developmental trajectory of nervous system dynamics shows hierarchical structure on time scales spanning ten orders of magnitude from milliseconds to years. Analyzing and characterizing this structure poses significant signal processing challenges. In the context of birdsong development, we have previously proposed that an effective way to do this is to use the dynamic spectrum or spectrogram, a classical signal processing tool, computed at multiple time scales in a nested fashion. Temporal structure on the millisecond timescale is normally captured using a short time Fourier analysis, and structure on the second timescale using song spectrograms. Here we use the dynamic spectrum on time series of song features to study the development of rhythm in juvenile zebra finch. The method is able to detect rhythmic structure in juvenile song in contrast to previous characterizations of such song as unstructured. We show that the method can be used to examine song development, the accuracy with which rhythm is imitated, and the variability of rhythms across different renditions of a song. We hope that this technique will provide a standard, automated method for measuring and characterizing song rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W2056230661,"The rate-limiting step of the myosin basal ATPase (i.e. in absence of actin) is assumed to be a post-hydrolysis swinging of the lever arm (reverse recovery step), that limits the subsequent rapid product release steps. However, direct experimental evidence for this assignment is lacking. To investigate the binding and the release of ADP and phosphate independently from the lever arm motion, two single tryptophan-containing motor domains of Dictyostelium myosin II were used. The single tryptophans of the W129+ and W501+ constructs are located at the entrance of the nucleotide binding pocket and near the lever arm, respectively. Kinetic experiments show that the rate-limiting step in the basal ATPase cycle is indeed the reverse recovery step, which is a slow equilibrium step (kforward = 0.05 s–1, kreverse = 0.15 s–1) that precedes the phosphate release step. Actin directly activates the reverse recovery step, which becomes practically irreversible in the actin-bound form, triggering the power stroke. Even at low actin concentrations the power stroke occurs in the actin-attached states despite the low actin affinity of myosin in the pre-power stroke conformation.

Even at low actin concentrations the power stroke occurs in the actin-attached states despite the low actin affinity of myosin in the pre-power stroke conformation. The mechanism of the phosphate (Pi) release of the myosin ATPase is of particular interest, because it is the key step that is presumed to be activated by actin and is coupled to the working stroke of the cross-bridge cycle (1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 161-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2Karatzaferi C. Chinn M.K. Cooke R. Biophys.

The observed rate of phosphate release in the absence of actin is of the order of 0.05 s–1 for rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II at 20 °C and provides the major contribution to the rate of the overall basal ATPase activity. Phosphate binding is, however, weak (Kd > 1 mm), which led Trentham et al. (3Trentham D.R. Bardsley R.G. Eccleston J.F. Weeds A.G. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 4Trentham D.R. Eccleston J.F. Bagshaw C.R. Q. Rev.

This suggestion was made on the grounds that the second-order rate constant for phosphate binding would be abnormally low if steps 4 and 5 were combined into a single step. This idea was supported by the experiments of Mannherz et al. (5Mannherz H.G. Schenck H. Goody R.S. Eur. J.

From the kinetics and extent of incorporation, they estimated that the M**·ADP·Pi to M*·ADP·Pi isomerization was slow but freely reversible (K4 = 15.6 at pH 8 and 0.9 at pH 6) while phosphate binding to M* ·ADP was weak (K5 = 7.3 mm at pH 8 and 55 mm at pH 6). Subsequently, these authors modified their view (6Goody R.S. Hofmann W. Mannherz G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and considered that the apparent saturation they observed in 32P incorporation was a consequence of the increase in ionic strength with increasing phosphate concentrations. Their important conclusion about the very high affinity of ATP for myosin in the M* ·ATP complex was unaffected by this problem, but the values of K4 and K5 could no longer be reliably disentangled.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that phosphate release precedes the release of ADP. The ADP-bound myosin state possesses strong actin binding properties, whereas both ADP and phosphate binding to the active site of myosin results in the weakening of the actin-myosin interaction. It was shown in solution experiments that more than half of the free energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis is liberated during phosphate release (8White H.D. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5818-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), therefore this step was suggested to be coupled to the power-generating lever arm movement. However, Goldman & Brenner pointed out that solution kinetics might differ from fiber kinetics (10Goldman Y.E. Brenner B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They and others demonstrated that in single fiber experiments the power stroke precedes the fast phosphate release step and that the starting state of the power stroke in this case is a weak actin binding A ·M·ADP·Pi state (11Dantzig J.A.

It is well known that addition of phosphate analogs, such as BeFx and AlF4, to skeletal muscle myosin ·ADP complexes, generates an enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence, indicative of formation of the M** conformation (15Werber M.M. Peyser Y.M. Muhlrad A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7190-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, attempts to generate the M** state by addition of phosphate at high concentrations to rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1 in the presence of ADP failed to develop the high fluorescence state. Indeed the protein fluorescence signal decreased and indicated that M ·Pi binary complexes formed at the expense of M* ·ADP (16Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results of 32P incorporation show that some M**·ADP·Pi must be generated under these conditions (5Mannherz H.G. Schenck H. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Goody R.S. Hofmann W. Mannherz G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The protein fluorescence of skeletal myosin S1 is sensitive to both nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and probably arises from at least two different tryptophan residues. This contrasts to the situation with the Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) myosin II motor domain where there is no enhancement associated with the nucleotide binding steps, because it lacks homologous Trp residues at positions 113 and 131, which are sensitive to the binding events in rabbit myosin (17Kovacs M.

Indeed ADP binding gives a small quench in tryptophan fluorescence due to the specific perturbation of Trp-501 (≡Trp-510 in skeletal myosin). We have made a Dd motor domain construct, called W501+, which contains only a single tryptophan residue at this conserved position (Fig. 1) and gives an enhanced signal relative to the background compared with the wild-type protein (18Malnasi-Csizmadia A.

In these studies the W501+ construct allowed us to separate the hydrolysis step from the preceding lever arm swing, as is described by Scheme 2.SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The labeling in Schemes 1 and 2 are based on different isoforms, skeletal muscle myosin II S1 and W501+ Dd myosin motor domain construct, respectively. In Scheme 1, M* represents the partially enhanced fluorescent state of rabbit S1 (reviewed in Ref. 21Zeng W. Conibear P.B. Dickens J.L. Cowie R.A. Wakelin S. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Bagshaw C.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1843-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This state is equivalent with the M† in Scheme 2, which is a quenched Trp-501 fluorescence state of Dd myosin. In the text below we use the nomenclature of Scheme 2, where M* and M† represent the high and the low fluorescence intensity states of Trp-501, respectively (18Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The M state corresponds to the apo structure (22Coureux P.D. Wells A.L. Menetrey J. Yengo C.M.

M† corresponds to the pre-recovery state (down lever arm position, see Table 1), in which switch 1 is closed, while switch 2 is open so that the catalytic function of the ATPase is turned off in this state. M* in Scheme 2 (equivalent to M** in Scheme 1) represents the post-recovery state (up lever arm position, see Table 1). During step 3a, the lever arm swing (recovery step) is coupled to the closing of switch 2 (18Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R.

After ATP hydrolysis (step 3b), step 4 involves the swinging of the lever arm, which we call here the “reverse recovery step.” It is important to distinguish the reverse recovery step from the power stroke, because the reverse recovery step is a reversible step in the absence of actin while power stroke occurs in the actin-attached form and exerts force (large free energy change).TABLE 1Nomenclature of the enzymatic stepsEnzymatic stepsRate constantInitial and end states of the forward steps (lever arm position/nucleotide form)K1ATP binding collision stepk1ForwardApoATP-bindingk-1ReverseCollision complex with ATPK2ATP binding-induced conformational changek2ForwardCollision complex with ATPk-2ReverseDownaThe down lever arm state is also called the post-rigor and post-power stroke states, although it also exists in the actin-detached state.

Open table in a new tab All these steps are summarized in Table 1 to clarify the nomenclature we use in this report. We recommend using the recovery step and reverse recovery step instead of using recovery stroke and reverse recovery stroke, because these steps are freely reversible equilibrium steps and occur in the absence of actin. For an effective stroke one object must be in interaction with another object on which it can exert force. From this aspect, in the absence of actin the meaning of stroke is limited, therefore we recommend using the recovery/reverse recovery step for the particular conformational changes. The mechanism of the reverse recovery step can be either a slow lever arm motion followed by relatively fast product release, or alternatively, the lever arm reorientation is a fast equilibrium step followed by the relatively slow phosphate release step (26Wakelin S.

Answering which of these two mechanisms is correct is fundamental regarding the myosin ATPase mechanism, because it defines which is the rate-limiting step that is activated by actin binding during the power stroke: The first case would correspond to an “induced strain” mechanism, in which actin binding provokes a strain in the myosin head, and lever arm motion can release that strain. The second case would correspond to a “Brownian ratchet” mechanism, in which the pre-power stroke lever arm is freely reorienting and product release stabilizes the post-power stroke orientation. Here we address these questions by characterizing the kinetics of ADP and phosphate binding reactions and the related lever arm swing. The kinetics of these steps are studied as a function of [Pi] at constant ionic strength. We also make comparable studies on a W129+ construct (17Kovacs M. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28459-28467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that has a single tryptophan near the active site (Fig. 1), which responds only to nucleotide and phosphate binding but not to the lever arm motion. We present direct experimental evidence first, that ADP and phosphate binding events (steps 5 and 6 in Scheme 2) are kinetically separate from the reverse recovery step (step 4). The reverse recovery step occurs at slow equilibrium, which controls product release and is the rate-limiting step of the basal ATPase cycle (i.e. in the absence of actin). However, in the presence of actin the lever arm swing is accelerated by actin binding, thus increasing the ATPase turnover rate. The low initial affinity of M*·ADP·Pi for actin increased during the lever arm swing and the subsequent product release steps, thus depleting the weakly bound A ·M*·ADP·Pi population and pulling the reaction toward the actin-bound power stroke. Unless otherwise stated, all chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nucleotides and dmATP were obtained from Roche Applied Science and Jena Bioscience GmbH, respectively. Phosphate Buffers—Care was taken to maintain the constant ionic strength in the experiments using different phosphate concentrations or pH. Ionic strength values were calculated according to (27Beynon R.J. Easterby J.S. Buffers for pH Control: The Basics. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford1996Google Scholar) using the Buffers for pH Control website, and ionic strength was kept constant with additional NaCl to the phosphate buffers. Reduction of Pyrophosphate Contamination—To reduce the pyrophosphate contamination in the phosphate buffers, 0.5 m Na2HPO4 buffer (pH ≤ 12.6) was autoclaved at 121 °C for 30 min immediately before the experiments. Expression and Purification of Proteins—In this study we used Dd myosin II motor domain mutants, which are based on the M761 construct (28Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The W501+ construct possesses W36F, W432F, and W584F mutations (18Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the W129+ construct contains W36F, W432F, W501F, W584F, and F129W mutations (17Kovacs M. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28459-28467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and both were cloned into the pDXA-3H vector (29Manstein D.J. Schuster H.P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both W501+ and W129+ were expressed in Dd cells cultured in HL-5 (Formedium) medium at 21 °C and purified as in a previous study (18Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After purification proteins were dialyzed against an assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm benzamidine), and after dialysis, proteins were frozen to liquid nitrogen in 50-μl droplets. Actin was purified as described (30Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method. Steady-state Kinetic Measurements—Steady-state spectra and time courses of the purified proteins were measured on a FluoroMax SPEX-320 spectrofluorometer. All measurements were carried out at 20 °C. Trp fluorescence was excited at 296 nm with 2 nm bandwidth for both excitation and emission sides, and emission was detected from 305 to 420 nm. Time courses were followed by tryptophan fluorescence exited at 296 nm and detected at 340 nm. Transient Kinetic Measurements—Stopped-flow measurements were carried out with a KinTek-2004 equipped with a Super Quiet Mercury-Xenon Lamp (Hamamatsu) or with a BioLogic SFM-300/400 stopped-flow fluorometer equipped with a mercury-xenon lamp (Hamamatsu). Trp fluorescence was excited at 297 nm where the mercury-xenon lamp has a discrete emission peak. Slits were adjusted to 2 nm in the case of the KinTek-2004 stopped-flow and a 340 nm interference filter (Corion CFS-001999 9L134) was used on the emission side in both instruments. N-Methylanthraniloyl (mant) derivatives were excited either directly at 365 nm or via energy transfer (Forster resonance energy transfer) at 280 nm. In both cases, a WG420 cut-off filter (Comar Instruments) was used to selectively measure mant fluorescence. The cuvette block and the syringe house were thermostatted at 20 °C both in the KinTek 2004 and the BioLogic SFM-300/400 stopped-flow solutions. The dead-time parameter of the KinTek 2004 apparatus at 18 ml/s flow-rate was determined to be 1 ms (31Kintses B. Simon Z. Gyimesi M. Toth J. Jelinek B. Niedetzky C. Kovacs M. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 4605-4610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The BioLogic SFM-300/400 was equipped with an 8-μl cuvette (μFC-08) or a 15-μl cuvette (FC-15), which had <0.2 ms or 2 ms dead time at 18 ml/s, respectively, which increases if slower flow-rate is applied. Unless otherwise noted post-mix concentrations of the reactants are presented. Actin-activated ATPase Measurement—Actin-activated ATPase activity of W501+ was measured using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay at 20 °C as follows: 2% pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzyme mixture, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 200 μm NADH was used in the 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm KCl buffer at pH 7.2, with 0.5 μm W501+ and an actin concentration of 0 to 94 μm. NMR Spectroscopy—31P NMR spectra were collected at 101.25 MHz on a Bruker Avance 250 spectrometer using a 5-mm inverse 1H/13C/31P/19F probe head at room temperature. The inverse-gated proton-decoupling sequence was applied with 4-μs time, 30° pulse, 1-s FID acquisition time, and 1.2-s acquisition delay, and 21,000 scans collected. Chemical shifts were referenced to an external 85% H3PO4 standard at 0.00 ppm. All NMR samples were prepared by mixing 0.6 μl of 0.5 m Na2HPO4 solution (pH 7.5) and 0.06 μl of D2O. Detection and Elimination of Pyrophosphate Traces from Phosphate Buffer—We determined that untreated phosphate buffers contained ∼0.01% pyrophosphate contamination (Fig. 2). Because pyrophosphate has high affinity for myosin (Kd,PPi = 200 nm), even this small concentration of pyrophosphate can block the binding of the substrates with lower affinity such as ADP (Kd,ADP ∼ 1 μm) or phosphate (Kd,Pi ∼ 10 mm). However, according to the NMR spectroscopy results, heat treatment at alkaline pH (see “Experimental Procedures”) can reduce the pyrophosphate level by 5- to 10-fold and enabled us to investigate reactions of myosin and substrates at high phosphate concentrations. A detailed description of the experiments with the related figures (supplemental Fig. S1, a–c) can be found in the supplemental materials. Phosphate Binding of W501+ ·ADP Complex—To study ligand binding and the possible reverse reaction of the recovery step (M†·ADP·Pi ↔ M*·ADP·Pi), W501+ was preincubated with ADP and then rapidly mixed with different concentrations of a phosphate solution in the stopped-flow apparatus. The ionic strength of the solutions was kept constant in all experiments by adding an appropriate amount of NaCl. Also the ionic strength of the solutions was identical in both syringes of the stopped-flow apparatus. The reactions were studied at I = 244 mm at pH 7.2 and I = 118 mm at pH 7.2 and 6.7. At all phosphate concentrations studied, large and slow fluorescence increases (35% enhancement with kobs = 0.14 s–1 at 25 mm phosphate concentration, pH 7.2, I = 118 mm) were detected, which indicates the formation of M*·ADP·Pi. Because the rate constant of ADP release is 5 s–1 and accompanied with a 10–15% fluorescence increase, the larger than 15% amplitude increase and the slower than 5 s–1 observed rate constants rule out this fluorescence enhancement being simply due to dequenching on displacement of ADP from M† ·ADP. Upon phosphate binding to W501+, in the absence of ADP, a small (<3%) quench was detected. At each applied ionic strength and pH, stopped-flow records could be fitted with single exponentials (Fig. 3a). In addition, a very slow (0.005 s–1) fluorescence quench also was observed that is the consequence of binding of residual pyrophosphate. This reaction was faster and became dominant when untreated phosphate samples were used (see supplemental Fig. S1c). The amplitudes and the observed rate constants of the fluorescence enhancement increased with phosphate concentrations. The slope of the initial linear fit of the plot of rate constants versus phosphate concentration (kPi,on,app,118mM,pH7.2W501+·ADP = 0.0036 mm–1 s–1) depends on both the ionic strength and pH (Fig. 3b), whereas the extrapolated intercepts (kPi,on,app,118mM,pH7.2W501+·ADP = 0.052 s–1) were practically unchanged. From these values the dissociation constant of phosphate for W501+ ·ADP complex is Kd,app,Pi = 14.2 mm at 118 mm ionic strength. The intercept value is the same as the basal ATPase rate constant. This indicates that k+4 determines the ATPase rate constant of the cycle. It also supports the conclusion that the M*·ADP·Pi state is the one generated by addition of ADP and phosphate to W501+. The parameters under other conditions are presented in Table 2. Because the increase of phosphate concentration was limited by the constant ionic strength of the solution, it could not be increased above 25 mm at pH 7.2, therefore the saturation of values of rate constants could not be determined. Furthermore, it is difficult to characterize these values, because rate constants are strongly dependent on ionic strength and it is hard to maintain a constant value with different counter ions. Even a little overcompensation of the ionic strength level with sodium chloride could cause the apparent saturation of the observed rate constant. In summary, there is some indications that the rate constant might saturate at around kPi,max,appW501+·ADP ≈ 0.2 s–1. To overcome this uncertainty we carried out the inverse experiment in which W501+ was premixed with phosphate and then rapidly mixed with ADP.TABLE 2Summary of the rate and equilibrium constants measured in this studyMeasured constantsW501+·ADP × Pi Pi half sat (I = 118 mm, pH 6.7)12 mm Pi half sat (I = 118 mm, pH 7.2)14.2 mm Pi half sat (I = 244 mm, pH 7.2)23 mm kon,Pi (I = 118 mm, pH 6.7)0.0048 mm-1s-1 kon,Pi (I = 118 mm, pH 7.2)0.0036 mm-1s-1 kon,Pi (I = 244 mm, pH 7.2)0.0020 mm-1s-1 koff,Pi (I = 118 mm, pH 6.7)0.049 s-1 koff,Pi (I = 118 mm, pH 7.2)0.052 s-1 koff,Pi (I = 244 mm, pH 7.2)0.055 s-1 kmax,Pi (I = 118 mm, pH 7.2)∼0.2 s-1 Kd,app,Pi (I = 118 mm, pH 7.2)14.2 mmW501+·Pi × ADP Kd,app,ADP45 μm Kon,ADP0.011 μm-1s-1 kmax,ADP0.2 s-1W129+·Pi × ADP ADP,half sat15 μm kPD,on1.6 μm-1s-1 kPD,off19 s-1 kmax,ADP370 s-1W129+·ADP × Pi kobs7.5 ± 1 s-1W129+ × Pi kfast,on,PiaResults can be found in the supplemental material.50.3 mm-1s-1 kfast,off,PiaResults can be found in the supplemental material.35.0 s-1 kfast,max,PiaResults can be found in the supplemental material.300 s-1 kslowaResults can be found in the supplemental material.5 s-1W129+ × ATP kATP,fast1140 s-1 kATP,slow350 s-1W129+·Pi × ATP kP,off260 s-1W501+·dmADP × ATP kobs2.5 s-1W501+·dmADP·Pi × ATP kfast5.8 s-1 kslow0.04 s-1 Afast/Aslow0.50W501+ × ADP kD,on1.2 μm-1 kD,off7 s-1 KD (KdD)0.17 μm-1 (5.8 μm)W501+·ADP·AlF4 × PyA Kd, A·M*·ADP·Pi57 μma Results can be found in the supplemental material.

https://openalex.org/W2062817211,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor and remains largely incurable, in large part, due to its highly invasive nature. The phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase pathway is often constitutively active in these tumors due to activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor, or deletion/loss of function of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Protein kinase C type ι (PKCι), a member of the atypical protein kinase C family, is activated by the PI 3-kinase pathway and is an important downstream mediator. Here, we have assessed the role of PKCι in glioblastoma cell invasion. Depletion of PKCι with RNA interference caused an increase in actin stress fibers and a decrease in cell motility and invasion. Gene expression microarray analysis of U87MG cells showed that PKCι repressed expression of mRNA for RhoB, which has previously been shown to have a role in actin stress fiber formation. Western blot analysis showed that both PKCι depletion and pharmacological inhibition of PKCι caused an increase in the protein levels of RhoB, as did inhibition of PI 3-kinase. Expression of RhoB from a constitutive promoter caused changes in actin stress fibers and cell invasion that were similar to those seen with PKCι depletion. These data show that PKCι, activated as a consequence of aberrant upstream PI 3-kinase signaling, mediates glioblastoma cell motility and invasion, and that repression of RhoB is key downstream event in PKCι signaling leading to enhanced cell motility. In addition, constitutive expression of RhoB repressed PKCι activity, as assessed by its phosphorylation status on Thr555. PKCι and RhoB are, therefore, mutually antagonistic, potentially creating a sensitive switch between invasive and non-invasive phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2057986603,"The Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) genome encodes 12 intestinal colonization factors of the chaperone/usher fimbrial assembly class; however, the binding specificity is known for only one of these adhesins, known as type 1 fimbriae. Here we explored the utility of glycomics to determine the carbohydrate binding specificity of plasmid-encoded fimbriae from S. Typhimurium. A cosmid carrying the pef operon was introduced into Escherichia coli and expression of fimbrial filaments composed of PefA confirmed by flow cytometry and immune-electron microscopy. Plasmid-encoded fimbriae were purified from the surface of E. coli, and the resulting preparation was shown to contain PefA as the sole major protein component. The binding of purified plasmid-encoded fimbriae to a glycanarray suggested that this adhesin specifically binds the trisaccharide Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc, also known as the Lewis X (Le(x)) blood group antigen. Results from the glycanarray were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in which plasmid-encoded fimbriae bound Le(x)-coated wells in a concentration-dependent manner. The binding of plasmid-encoded fimbriae to Le(x)-coated wells could be inhibited by co-incubation with soluble Le(x) antigen. Our results establish glycomic analysis as a promising new approach for determining the carbohydrate binding specificity of bacterial adhesins."

It plays an important role in the transcriptional control of energy metabolism and female fertility. RIP140 contains four distinct repression domains (RD1–RD4), and the repressive activity of RIP140 involves complex mechanisms. The function of both RD1 and RD2 is linked to recruitment of histone deacetylases and C-terminal binding protein, respectively, but the mechanism of repression for RD3 and RD4 has remained elusive. Because covalent modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO-1, -2, and -3; SUMOylation) is often associated with transcriptional repression, we studied whether SUMOylation is involved in the repressive activity of RIP140. We show that two conserved lysines, Lys756 and Lys1154, located in RD3 and RD4, respectively, are subject to reversible SUMOylation, with SUMO-1 being more efficiently conjugated than SUMO-2. Interestingly, mutations of the RIP140 SUMOylation sites compromised the transcription repressor function of RIP140 and blunted its capacity to repress estrogen receptor α-dependent transcription. Conjugation of SUMO-1 also influenced the subnuclear distribution pattern of RIP140. In sum, our demonstration that the function of RIP140 repression domains 3 and 4 can be modulated by reversible SUMO modification thus adds a novel level to the regulation of RIP140 activity, which may have ramifications in the control of gene networks exerted by RIP140.

Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast to covalent modification by small chemical groups, ubiquitination and SUMOylation represent bulky covalent modifications in which a protein, ubiquitin, or SUMO, is attached via an isopeptide linkage to lysine residues of target proteins (18Mukhopadhyay D. Riezman H. Science. 2007; 315: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 19Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The SUMO attachment lysines are typically found within a minimal consensus motif ΨKXE (where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue and X is any residue). Mammalian SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 are ∼100-amino acid-long proteins. SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are nearly identical, whereas SUMO-1 is only ∼50% identical with SUMO-2/3. SUMOs are similar to ubiquitin in their three-dimensional structure, but their amino acid sequence and surface charge distribution differs considerably from those of ubiquitin. SUMO-2 and -3 contain an internal consensus site for SUMOylation, which allows SUMO chain formation (20Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The role of SUMOylation in the regulation of protein stability and degradation is still elusive, but in some cases, attachment of SUMO-1 can protect a protein from being degraded (19Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 21Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). The SUMO conjugation pathway is similar to that of ubiquitin, but cells contain distinct E1 (activating enzyme), E2 (conjugase), and E3 (ligase) activities for both processes. SUMOs are first activated by SAE1 and -2 dimer and subsequently conjugated by Ubc9. PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) proteins, nucleoporin RanBP2, and polycomb protein Pc2 can promote SUMOylation in a fashion that resembles the action of E3 ligases (19Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 21Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 22Bossis G. Melchior F. Cell. Div. 2006; 1: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Under cell-free conditions, the modification can, however, proceed efficiently without E3 activity. SUMOylation is a highly dynamic modification that is reversed by a family of SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (23Hay R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 370-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). SUMOylation has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism, especially in transcription and signal transduction. The modification can affect, in a target-specific fashion, the subcellular and subnuclear localization of a protein, its ability to interact with other proteins, and/or its activity in transcription (19Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 21Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Because SUMOylation has been shown to contribute to repression of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 21Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar and 24Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and RIP140 possesses lysine residues conforming to the SUMOylation consensus, we investigated whether the protein is modified and regulated by SUMOs. Our results show that even though RIP140 contains four SUMOylation consensus sites, only Lys756 and Lys1154 located in RD3 and RD4, respectively, are prone to modification by SUMO-1. Our results also show that the SUMO acceptor lysines have a significant effect on the nuclear distribution of RIP140 and contribute to its corepressor activity.

Cell Lines, Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—African green monkey kidney (COS-1) cells, human kidney (HEK 293) and HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained as suggested by the ATCC. Twenty-four hours before transfection, the cells were seeded onto 6- or 12-well plates, and transfections were carried out using TransIT-LT1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. When hormone-activated nuclear receptors were studied, the cells received a fresh medium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum 4 h before transfection, and vehicle/hormone (100 nm) was added 24 h after transfection. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The cleared supernatants were used for luciferase measurements with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and a Luminoskan Ascent reader (ThermoLabsystems) and for β-galactosidase assays as described previously (26Poukka H. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was measured using protein assay dye (Bio-Rad). The relative LUC activities (i.e. luciferase light units divided by β-galactosidase values or protein concentration) are represented as the means ± the standard deviations. The experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Immunoblotting and Protein Half-life Measurements—Cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Cell pellets were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide with 1:200 protease inhibitor mixture and lysed by sonication 2 × 10 s. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by indicated antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody using the ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For protein half-life measurements, goat anti-mouse IgG DyLight™ 680 fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody was used, and the membranes were analyzed with a Li-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro SUMOylation Assay—In vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were incubated with bacterially produced glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused E1 enzyme (GST-SAE1/2) and GST-Ubc9 in the presence and absence of GST-SUMOGG-1 at 30 °C for 2 has described (25Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed and treated with Amplify reagent (GE Healthcare) and visualized by fluorography. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—COS-1 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 22 °C, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at 22 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and unspecific binding was blocked using 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 22 °C. The primary antibody was incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and the cells were washed four times for 5 min with PBS. The secondary antibody, Rhodamine Red X-labeled anti-mouse IgG, was incubated for 1 h at 22 °Cand washed with PBS four times for 5 min. The coverslips were dipped in sterile water and put in mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The coverslips were sealed with nail polish and stored in the dark at 4 °C. The amount of transfected DNA was first titrated, and the lowest suitable dose was used. Any anomalous expression patterns and overexpressing cells were discarded. Each localization experiment was repeated at least three times. The micrographs were obtained with PerkinElmer UltraVIEW confocal imaging system connected to Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and 100× NA 1.3 oil immersion objective. Identification of SUMO Attachment Sites in RIP140—The presence of potential SUMO attachment sites in RIP140 were analyzed by SUMOplot algorithm, a web-based tool for prediction of consensus SUMOylation sites. Four lysine residues, Lys111, Lys170, Lys756, and Lys1154, in the RIP140 sequence fulfill the consensus SUMO-1 attachment sequence ΨKXE (Fig. 1A). To examine whether these lysine residues serve as SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 acceptors in mammalian cells, HA epitope-tagged RIP140 was expressed in COS-1 cells without or with an excess of SUMO-1 or SUMO-2. The cell lysates prepared in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (a SUMO protease inhibitor) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Ectopic expression of SUMOs was needed, because COS-1 cells contain very small amounts of unconjugated endogenous SUMOs (25Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Expression of wild type RIP140 with SUMO-1 yielded two to three additional, slower migrating forms that were detected with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B, asterisk, arrowhead, and arrow), suggesting that RIP140 is modified by SUMO-1 at more than one site. Formation of the additional RIP140 forms in the presence of SUMO-2 was weaker than with SUMO-1, yielding one to two slower migrating RIP140 species. To investigate which residues are involved in the modification, the four lysine residues conforming to the SUMOylation consensus were separately mutated into arginine residues, and the mutants were coexpressed with and without SUMO-1 or SUMO-2. Mutation of Lys111 and/or Lys170 did not affect the pattern of RIP140 forms (data not shown). In contrast, conversion of Lys756 to arginine (K756R) changed the pattern of RIP140 forms, abolishing the two slowest migrating RIP140 forms that were induced by SUMO-1 (arrowhead and asterisk) and weakening the forms dependent on SUMO-2 (Fig. 1B). Mutation of Lys1154 to arginine (K1154R) also influenced the pattern of RIP140 forms in the presence of SUMO-1; the higher molecular mass band (arrowhead) remained, but the faster migrating band (arrow) disappeared. The latter mutation did not clearly influence the main RIP140 form induced by SUMO-2. Importantly, concomitant mutation of the Lys756 and Lys1154 (K756R,K1154R) abolished all of the RIP140 forms that were induced by SUMOs (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that Lys756 and Lys1154 can serve as major SUMO acceptors in RIP140. Notably, the two SUMOylation consensus sites are conserved in vertebrates, from man to fish (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the location of the SUMO attachment site influenced the migration of RIP140 on SDS-PAGE. When SUMO-1 was conjugated at Lys1154, the protein migrated clearly faster than when it was modified at Lys756. The phenomenon may be due to the fact that the modification at Lys756 near the center of the protein creates a branched structure that migrates more slowly than the Lys1154-modified RIP140 form that is basically linear, because the modification site is essentially at the C terminus of the protein. A similar situation has been recognized in the SUMOylation of BKLF (30Perdomo J. Verger A. Turner J. Crossley M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is also of note that the SUMOylation pattern of RIP140 differed slightly between experiments; the slowest migrating SUMO-1-induced RIP140 form (depicted by asterisk in Fig. 1B) that very likely corresponds to a RIP140 form SUMOylated concomitantly at Lys756 and Lys1154 was not always readily detectable. The reason for this is currently not known. It is possible that other covalent modifications and/or changes in cellular SUMO E3 activity contribute to its formation. To investigate RIP140 SUMOylation under cell-free conditions, 35S-labeled RIP140 proteins produced by in vitro translation were incubated with bacterially produced SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9 in the presence and absence of SUMO-1. When (mature form of) SUMO-1 was present in the reactions, the in vitro SUMOylation machinery produced three additional higher molecular mass RIP140 bands (Fig. 1C) that, because of the fusion of GST with SUMO-1, migrated considerably more slowly than the SUMOylated forms in Fig. 1B. The effects of mutations of Lys756 and Lys1154 on SUMOylation in vitro were comparable with the assays in intact cells. These in vitro assays thus confirmed Lys756 and Lys1154 as main acceptor lysines of SUMO-1 in RIP140. Effect of PIAS Proteins and SUMO-specific Proteases on the SUMOylation of RIP140—We and others have shown that PIAS proteins can promote SUMOylation in a fashion that resembles the action of RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligases (25Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 31Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To study whether PIAS proteins are capable of enhancing SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 modification of RIP140, PIAS proteins were coexpressed with RIP140 and SUMO-1 or -2 in COS-1 cells. PIAS proteins had clearly different effects on the SUMOylation of RIP140, in that overexpression of PIAS1 and PIAS3, but not PIASxα or PIASxβ, markedly enhanced the modification of RIP140 by SUMO-1 (Fig. 2A), whereas in the presence of SUMO-2, only PIAS1 had a moderate stimulatory effect on the modification (Fig. 2B). In addition to enhancing the SUMOylated species present in the absence of ectopic PIAS expression, PIAS1 and PIAS3 also promoted formation of additional, even slower migrating RIP140 forms. Because SUMO-1 is not thought to mediate chain formation in vivo (20Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), and the appearance of the latter PIAS-promoted RIP140 species was less pronounced with SUMO-2 that can form SUMO polymers, PIAS-promoted SUMOylation of otherwise cryptic sites may be at least in part responsible for this phenomenon. Ectopic expression of PIAS1 or PIAS3 in fact induced weak SUMOylation of the RIP140K756R,K1154R mutant (Fig. 2). However, it is of note that, even in the presence of PIAS proteins, the modification of the compound mutant was dramatically weaker than that of the wild type protein. SUMOylation is thought to be a highly reversible modification, and the reverse reaction is catalyzed by a family of SENPs (23Hay R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 370-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, ectopic expression of SENP1 decreased the amount of SUMO-1-modified RIP140 forms in COS-1 cells, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive SENP1 mutant contrastingly increased their amount (Fig. 2C). Also SENP2, but not SENP5, was capable of deconjugating SUMOs from RIP140. 3M. Rytinki and J. J. Palvimo, unpublished observations. These results indicate the reversible nature of the modifications. Effect of SUMOylation Sites on the RIP140 Protein Stability—Small ubiquitin-like modifiers have been in some cases shown to influence the longevity of proteins and to subsequently protect them from proteasomal degradation (19Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 21Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). To study whether the main SUMOylation sites of RIP140 influence its degradation by proteasomes, RIP140 was expressed in COS-1 cells in the presence and absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. Inhibition of proteasome activity resulted in the appearance of higher molecular mass RIP140 species that were considerably strengthened with an ectopic expression of ubiquitin (Fig. 3A), implying that RIP140 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1967796748,"The ribosomal protein S1, in Escherichia coli, is necessary for the recognition by the ribosome of the translation initiation codon of most messenger RNAs. It also participates in other functions. In particular, it stimulates the T4 endoribonuclease RegB, which inactivates some of the phage mRNAs, when their translation is no longer required, by cleaving them in the middle of their Shine-Dalgarno sequence. In each function, S1 seems to target very different RNAs, which led to the hypothesis that it possesses different RNA-binding sites. We previously demonstrated that the ability of S1 to activate RegB is carried by a fragment of the protein formed of three consecutive domains (domains D3, D4, and D5). The same fragment plays a central role in all other functions. We analyzed its structural organization and its interactions with three RNAs: two RegB substrates and a translation initiation region. We show that these three RNAs bind the same area of the protein through a set of systematic (common to the three RNAs) and specific (RNA-dependent) interactions. We also show that, in the absence of RNA, the D4 and D5 domains are associated, whereas the D3 and D4 domains are in equilibrium between open (noninteracting) and closed (weakly interacting) forms and that RNA binding induces a structural reorganization of the fragment. All of these results suggest that the ability of S1 to recognize different RNAs results from a high adaptability of both its structure and its binding surface.

In Escherichia coli, S1 is the largest (61 kDa) ribosomal protein. It is found in almost all Gram-negative and in several Gram-positive bacteria (1Muralikrishna P. Suryanarayana T. Biochem. Int. 1985; 11: 691-699PubMed Google Scholar, 2Farwell M.A. Roberts M.W. Rabinowitz J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3375-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A shorter form (45 kDa) exists in chloroplasts (3Franzetti B. Carol P. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19075-19081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but S1 is otherwise absent of eukaryotic cells. S1 is involved in translation initiation, and its presence correlates with the way ribosomes recognize the correct translation start on messenger RNAs. In eukaryotic cells, the 40 S ribosomal subunit generally enters at the 5′ end of the mRNA and scans it until it finds the first AUG codon (4Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In prokaryotic and chloroplast mRNAs, the first AUG codon is seldom the translation start. During the translation initiation, the 30 S subunit is able to distinguish the initiation codon from synonymous triplets because of the presence of specific signals in the vicinity of the correct start (5McCarthy J.E. Gualerzi C. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 78-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6Sugiura M. Hirose T. Sugita M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 437-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One of these signals is the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), complementary to the 3′ end of the 16 S ribosomal RNA. This sequence is sufficient in all bacterial species devoid of S1. In the others, S1 likely mediates a second interaction, which was demonstrated to be strictly required in E. coli (7Sorensen M.A. Fricke J. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Beside its role in translation initiation, S1 is involved in other functions. It was recently shown to promote transcriptional cycling in vitro (8Sukhodolets M.V. Garges S. Adhya S. RNA. 2006; 12: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a role in the coupling between transcription and translation. It binds tmRNA (9Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), even if the physiological significance of this observation in the context of trans-translation is debated (10McGinness K.E. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13454-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). S1 is also one of the four subunits of the fr and Qβ RNA bacteriophage replicases (11Wahba A.J. Miller M.J. Niveleau A. Landers T.A. Carmichael G.G. Weber K. Hawley D.A. Slobin L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3314-3316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It forms a complex with the phage λ protein β involved in general recombination (12Muniyappa K. Mythili E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it is able to accelerate the cleavage rate of the phage T4 endoribonuclease RegB by a factor up to 100 (13Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of E. coli S1 reveals that the protein consists of six repetitions of a conserved structural domain, called S1 domain. This motif is found in many other proteins involved in RNA metabolism in all organisms. Considering this modular organization, several studies were performed to determine the role of each domain. Taking advantage of the existence of a natural cleavage site between the second and third domain (D2 and D3), it was shown that the two first domains bind the ribosome, whereas the four last bind mRNAs (14Subramanian A.R.

By using a mutant disrupted in the domain D6, it was further demonstrated that this domain is dispensable to overall mRNA translation initiation (15Boni I.V. Artamonova V.S. Dreyfus M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5872-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cole and co-workers (16Guerrier-Takada C. Subramanian A.R. Cole P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13649-13652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously established that the two first domains are necessary for formation of the Qβ replicase and that removal of the last domain did not impair the function of this enzymatic complex. Similarly, a mutant of S1 lacking the last domain was shown to promote E. coli RNA polymerase cycling (8Sukhodolets M.V. Garges S. Adhya S. RNA. 2006; 12: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally, we also demonstrated that an S1 fragment composed of the domains D3, D4, and D5 (F3-5) accelerates the cleavage rate of short RNAs by the endoribonuclease RegB with the same efficiency as the whole S1 protein (17Bisaglia M. Laalami S. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15261-15271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All of these results emphasize the central role of the region formed of the domains D3, D4, and D5 in these functions. The structure of S1 has not yet been determined. Several E. coli and Thermus thermophilus ribosomal 30 S subunits structures are known, but they were solved in the absence of S1 (18Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A.

S1 was studied with low resolution techniques, such as small angle x-ray scattering (14Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), electron microscopy (22Sengupta J. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

But these studies were performed on different systems (isolated E. coli and T. thermophilus S1 for the SAXS and sedimentation experiments respectively; bound to E. coli ribosome for electron microscopy) and lead to contradictory results: an extended structure according to SAXS, a compact structure according to sedimentation and electron microscopy. In parallel, some studies tried to decipher the mechanism of S1 and, in particular to probe S1-RNAs interactions, but also failed to draw a clear picture. S1 binds poly(U), poly(A), and poly(C) with similar affinities (14Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the case of translation initiation, S1 was proposed to recognize single-stranded U-rich regions (24Boni I.V. Isaeva D.M. Musychenko M.L. Tzareva N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). S1-tmRNA interaction involves pseudoknots (9Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These were also selected as the best S1 ligands in a SELEX experiment (25Ringquist S. Jones T. Snyder E.E. Gibson T. Boni I. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We observed that S1 promotes the cleavage by RegB of partially structured AG-rich RNAs (26Lebars I. Hu R.M. Lallemand J.Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and of unstructured RNA characterized by an 11-nucleotide A-rich consensus sequence (27Durand S. Richard G. Bisaglia M. Laalami S. Bontems F. Uzan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6549-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the light of the particular role played by the region formed of the D3, D4, and D5 domains of S1 and the biological activity of the isolated corresponding F3-5 fragment (activation of the endoribonuclease RegB), we have decided to study its structural organization and its interactions with different RNAs by NMR spectroscopy. We assigned the backbone atom frequencies of the fragments F3, F4, and F5, corresponding to the isolated domains D3, D4, and D5, of the fragments F34 and F45 composed of domains D3 and D4 and domains D4 and D5, respectively, and of the fragment F3-5. We analyzed the interactions between the different domains in the F3-5 fragment by NMR and small angle x-ray scattering, showing that the domains D4 and D5 are in contact with each other, whereas domains D3 and D4 appear to be in equilibrium between a noninteracting and a weakly interacting state. Finally, we analyzed the interactions of the F3-5 fragment with three different biologically pertinent RNAs, F3-5 having a direct activity on two of them (26Lebars I. Hu R.M. Lallemand J.Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Durand S. Richard G. Bisaglia M. Laalami S. Bontems F. Uzan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6549-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the three domains are involved in RNA binding, through systematic (common to the three RNAs) and specific (RNA-dependent) interactions. They strongly support the hypothesis that all S1 functions are mechanistically related and that RNA binding is associated to structural modifications in the fragment. 15N- and 15N-13C-Labeled Fragments—Typically, 25-ml overnight cultures of the BL21(DE3) E. coli host strain transformed with the adequate plasmid (17Bisaglia M. Laalami S. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15261-15271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were used to inoculate 1 liter of M9 minimal medium supplemented with the following: 1.0 g·liter-1 15NH4Cl and 4.0 g·liter-1 glucose for uniform 15N labeling or 1.0 g·liter-1 15NH4Cl and 3.0 g·liter-1 [13C[glucose for uniform 13C-15N labeling. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 by the addition of 1.0 mmol·liter-1 isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested after 3 h, disrupted by sonication. The proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Qiagen) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The F5 fragment forms inclusion bodies. After harvesting, the cells were thus resuspended and sonicated in 20 mmol·liter-1 phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mmol·liter-1 NaCl and 6 mol·liter-1 guanidium chloride. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated in the presence of Ni2+ resin. After several wash cycles, the extraction buffer was first exchanged against 20 mmol·liter-1 phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mmol·liter-1 NaCl, and 8 mol·liter-1 urea and then against 20 mmol·liter-1 phosphate, pH 7.0, and 300 mmol·liter-1 NaCl (renaturation buffer). The F5 fragment was then recovered like the others. The proteins were concentrated to 0.5-0.8 mmol·liter-1 (depending on the fragment solubility), and the elution buffer was exchanged against 50 mmol·liter-1 pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, 200 mmol·liter-1 NaCl, 20 mmol·liter-1 dithiothreitol by dialysis. 15N-13C-2H-Labeled Fragments—An overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB medium. The cells were harvested at A600 = 1.0, centrifuged, washed, and transferred into 1 liter of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1.0 g·liter-1 NH4Cl and 4.0 g·liter-1 glucose. The cells were again harvested at A600 = 0.6, first transferred into 100 ml of D2O M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1.0 g·liter-1 15NH4Cl and 3.0 g·liter-1 [13C]glucose and, after growth resuming, into 900 ml of the same fresh medium. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 using 1 mmol·liter-1 isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h. The protein was then purified as described above. All of the oligoribonucleotides were synthesized chemically on an Amersham Biosciences LKB Gene Assembler Plus apparatus using Amersham Biosciences polystyrene beads for primer support and phenoxyacetyl β-RNA phosphoramidites. The protocol was adapted from DNA synthesis, the main differences being the increase of the coupling time (20 min) and the use of 5-ethylthio-1H-tetrazol as activator (28Snoussi K. Nonin-Lecomte S. Leroy J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The terminal 5′-O-dimethoxytrityl group was removed on a synthesizer at the end of the synthesis. The oligoribonucleotides were cleaved from the support and unprotected according to Leroy and co-workers (28Snoussi K. Nonin-Lecomte S. Leroy J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Full-length product final yield was superior to 95% in all cases. The fragments were purified using a DEAE-Sepharose high pressure liquid chromatography column (Beckman system). All of the species could be separated using a linear gradient: 45% A/55% B to 100% B in 80 min (A, 10 mmol·liter-1 phosphate, pH 6.8; B, 10 mmol·liter-1 phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mol·liter-1 NaCl). 200 μg of F3, F4, and F34 fragments were diluted in the same buffer as used for the NMR studies (50 mmol·liter-1 Na2PO4 pH 6.8, 200 mmol·liter-1 NaCl, 20 mmol·liter-1 β-mercaptoethanol) and eluted from a Superdex 75 10/30 column at flow rate of 0.3 ml·min-1. The system was calibrated using dextran (200 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotripsinogen (25 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). All of the NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a TXI triple resonance gradient cryoprobe. The data were processed using XWIN-NMR 3.0 or Topspin 1.3 (Bruker) and analyzed with Sparky software (Thomas L. Goddard, University of California, San Francisco). 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to TSP. 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced from the γ15N/γ1H ratio (29Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). All of the spectra were recorded at 303 K. The resonance frequency assignment of the backbone (Hn, N, C′, Cα) and Cβ atoms of the fragments F34 (Asn179-His361) and F45 (Trp267-Asn448) was obtained by recording and analyzing HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and HN(COCA)CB triple resonance experiments on 15N-13C-2H-labeled samples of the two proteins. From this, it was possible to assign the Hn, N, and C′ backbone atom resonance frequencies of the fragments F4 (Trp267-His361), F5 (Trp354-Asn448), and F3-5 (Asn179-Asn448) by recording 1H-15N-HSQC 3The abbreviations used are: HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; IPI, intensity perturbation index. and HNCO experiments on 15N-13C-labeled samples of each of them in identical conditions to those used for F34 and F45. For the F3 fragment (Asn179-Tyr274), we observed that many peaks underwent large shifts compared with the F34 spectrum. Thus, we assigned its backbone atom resonance frequencies de novo by using HNCO and HNCA experiments recorded on a 15N-13C-labeled sample. The RNA binding studies were performed on 0.3 mmol·liter-1 15N-13C-labeled samples of the F3-5 fragment in which aliquots of the lyophilized RNAs were dissolved. Prior to lyophilization, RNAs were dialyzed against pure water and neutralized. Each titration point was done by removing the sample from the NMR tube, mixing it with lyophilized RNA, and returning it to the tube. Five 1H-15N-HSQC and three HNCO spectra were recorded for each series corresponding to RNA/protein ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (HSQC) and 0, 0.5, and 1.0 (HNCO). All of the recording parameters were kept rigorously identical throughout the experiments. The titration experiments were duplicated. SAXS data were collected at DESY on Beamline X33 (F3 and F4 fragments) and at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on Beamline ID02 (F34 and F45 fragment). The His tag was removed from the proteins by thrombin cleavage. Mass absorption coefficients of each species were calibrated using amino acid decomposition. Accordingly, the mass concentration of each sample could be properly measured by absorption at 280 nm just before data collection (F3, 1.3 g·liter-1; F4, 1.6 g·liter-1; F34, 12.45 g·liter-1; F45, 8.13 g·liter-1). At DESY, collection time was 180 s for each sample and its corresponding buffer. No aggregation or denaturation under radiation was observed after a second exposure. The useful Q range (Q = 4π·sin(θ)/λ, where λ = 1.5 Å and 2θ is the scattering angle) was 0.17-4.85 nm-1, with the detector off-centered. The intensity at Q = 0, I(0), and the radius of gyration, Rg, were determined by linear fit of Ln(I(Q)) versus Q2 in the range 0.2-0.6 nm-1 using PRIMUS (30Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). The average apparent molecular mass of the molecules in solution was deduced from I(0) by normalization with a scattering pattern of a bovine serum albumin solution with known concentration. At the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, a dilution series (C, C/2, and C/4) was measured for each protein. 50 frames of 1 s were averaged for each sample, with the protein solution being pushed between two frames through a circulating quartz capillary cell. The new CCD detector based on a Kodak 4320 chip gave extremely reproducible measurements. The available Q range was 0.056-3.03 nm-1. The data were normalized by transmitted intensity, measured with a diode inserted in the beamstop. A slight and monotonic evolution with concentration was seen at small angles on the buffer subtracted patterns, indicating some intermolecular interactions. Therefore subsequent analysis was systematically made on merged patterns using the sample with lowest concentration at low angles and that with the highest concentration at high angles. Atomic models of the F34 and F45 fragments were fitted to the SAXS curves by running Dadimodo software (31Mareuil F. Sizun C. Perez J. Schoenauer M. Lallemand J.Y. Bontems F. Eur. Biophys. J. 2007; 37: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) on the SOLEIL PC cluster. Dadimodo is a genetic algorithm designed to refine deformable homology models of multi-domain proteins using SAXS and/or NMR data. The input consisted of five sets of 25 structures obtained by connecting the C- and N-terminal ends of the D3 and D4 homology models for F34 (D4 and D5 for F45) and randomizing the geometry of the linker. Fitting the F34 SAXS curve required small modifications of the secondary structure element geometry, which was not the case for F45. One of the crucial aspects of Dadimodo is that all accepted solutions satisfy an energy criterion that ensures that they present neither geometrical deformations nor steric clashes. S1 domains are classified as OB fold/nucleic acid-binding protein/cold shock DNA-binding domain-like in the SCOP data base (32Hubbard T.J. Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thirty structures belonging to this family were retrieved, and their sequences and topologies were compared with those of the domains of S1. Taking the length of the secondary structure elements and of the loops between them into account, four sequences were retained: 1SRO, 1KL9, 1LUZ, and 1GO3. The 1SRO sequence could be aligned with those of the three domains with no or one insertion. In addition, many residues belonging to the loops are conserved. The alignment of 1KL9 and 1LUZ only requires insertion of two residues in the loop between the second and third strand of the motif. Finally, alignment of 1GO3 requires a 10-residues insertion in the long loop connecting the third and fourth strands, but a visual inspection of the structure reveals that this insertion corresponds to a small independent structural domain (a triple stranded β-sheet) and that the beginning of the loop is similar to the corresponding region in the 1KL9 structure. These four structures appeared to be good templates to model the structures of the S1 domains. However, in the case of 1KL9, the end of the long loop between the third and fourth strand is not resolved. We thus decided to use 1SRO (S1 domain of the E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (33Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J. Proctor M. Freund S.M. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar)), 1LUZ (vaccinia virus K3L protein (34Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), and 1GO3 (S1 domain of Methanococcus jannaschii RNA polymerase II (35Todone F. Brick P. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Onesti S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)). The models were calculated using the Modeler software (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10732) Google Scholar) with the standard model routine. Hydrogen atoms were added, and the structures were minimized in X-PLOR to remove steric clashes. Homology Modeling of the F3, F4, and F5 Fragments—We built models of S1 domains D3 (Asn179-Pro266), D4 (Trp267-Pro353), and D5 (Trp354-Pro440) by using an NMR structure of the S1-type domain of E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (1SRO), the x-ray structure of the S1-type domain of archeal M. jannaschii DNA-directed RNA polymerase (1GO3), and the x-ray structure of KL3 protein from the vaccinia virus (1LUZ). The sequences of these three template proteins are easily aligned with the D3, D4, and D5 domains of S1 (supplemental Fig. S1). In particular 43, 39, and 41% of D3, D4, and D5 amino acids are conserved in at least one template sequence, and 25, 26, and 24% are conserved in at least two template sequences. In addition, there is always one possibility with the correct length for each loop to be predicted. The three calculated model families are very similar, reflecting the sequence conservation between the three domains, with the exception of the long loop between the third and fourth strands. Many different solutions are obtained for this loop in each model, indicating a low confidence level in the prediction of this region. Assignment of the Resonance Frequencies of the Fragment Backbone Atoms—One of our goals was to analyze the interactions between the F3-5 fragment and several of its RNA targets by NMR. Accordingly, we wanted to assign as many backbone atom resonance frequencies as possible. Even if the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of the F3-5 fragment looks well, the size of the protein (267 amino acids) makes a direct study difficult. A preliminary analysis revealed the existence of large peak shifts between the HSQC spectrum of F3-5 and those of the F3, F4, and F5 fragments. On the opposite, the differences between the bi-domain and three-domain fragment spectra appeared much less striking. We therefore decided to assign the backbone atom resonance frequencies of the F34 and F45 fragments and to use this information to facilitate the assignment of F3-5. As a first task, we looked for buffer and temperature conditions simultaneously suitable for all the fragments. Well dispersed spectra were obtained in 50 mmol·liter-1 pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, 200 mmol·liter-1 NaCl, 20 mmol·liter-1 dithiothreitol at 303 K (supplemental Fig. S2). We could not obtain correct HNCACB experiments on 15N-13C-labeled samples of the F34 and F45 fragments. However, by using 15N-13C-2H triple labeled samples, we were able to record HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and HN(COCA)CB experiments on both proteins and to assign all but a few number of the Hn, N, Cα, Cβ, and C′ (carbonyl) resonance frequencies. The missing assignments correspond to Thr253 (D3 domain in F34), Ala269 (linker between the D3 and D4 domains in F34), Cys349 (D4 domain in F34), and Gln356, Phe357, and Ala358 (linker between the D4 and D5 domains in F45). The assignments obtained for F34 and F45 allowed us to assign all Hn, N, and C′ resonances of F4, F5, and F3-5 fragments by simply comparing the HSQC and HNCO spectra. In the case of the F3 fragment, the chemical shift variations were too large for a direct assignment transfer from F34. So we confirmed it (with the exception of the Glu251-Thr253 loop that could not be reassigned) by recording an HNCA in addition to the HSQC and HNCO spectra. Accordingly, we obtained the Hn, N, and C′ resonance frequencies of all fragments, the Cα resonance frequencies of F3, F34, and F45, and most of the Cβ resonance frequencies of F34 and F45. Characterization of the Interfaces between the Modules—NMR is a very sensitive tool to analyze local interactions and deformations in proteins because any change in an amino acid environment will modify the resonance frequencies of its atoms. Accordingly, by comparing the spectra of two neighboring domains, like isolated (F3, F4, and F5) and associated (F34 and F45) fragments, it is possible to determine whether they interact with each other and to localize the directly or indirectly affected residues. Similarly, by comparing the spectra of bidomains F34 and F45 with that of three-domain F3-5, it is possible to decide whether the third and fifth domains are in contact. Comparison of the 1H-15N-HSQC spectra, which correlate the amide nitrogen and amide proton frequencies, recorded on the mono- and bi-domain fragments is reported in Fig. 1. It clearly shows noticeable differences between the spectra of isolated or associated domains. The simplest situation seems to be that of the D4 and D5 domains. Two regions of the D4 domain are strongly affected in the presence of D5 within the F45 fragment: its C-terminal extremity (Leu346-Asn352) and a fragment (His305-Ser319) belonging to the long loop (L3) inserted between the third and the fourth strands (S3 and S4) of the β-barrel and located at its C-terminal edge (Fig. 2). Similarly, two regions of the D5 domain are affected. The first corresponds to the end of β-strand S2, the beginning of S3 and residues of the L2 loop between them (Gly382-Ile387). The second corresponds to the end of β-strand S4 and"

Understanding the regulation of the catalytic activity of GIVA PLA2 is crucial for understanding eicosanoid metabolism. group IVA phospholipase A2 hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry hydrogen/deuterium. The activity of the 85-kDa GIVA PLA2 has been suggested to be regulated by several factors including the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, its phosphorylation state, and the binding of various activators. Since the GIVA PLA2 was discovered in 1986, the activity of this enzyme has been known to be Ca2+-dependent (10Alonso F. Henson P.M. Leslie C.C. Biochim. Biophys.

The Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding domain (C2 domain) at the N terminus, which is linked to a catalytic domain where phospholipid hydrolysis occurs, was later identified (12Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A.

Various membrane-associated activators have been shown to bind to GIVA PLA2 and upregulate its activity. In particular, we have shown that the membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can bind to the “lysine pocket” of GIVA PLA2 with high affinity and specificity to activate the GIVA PLA2 independent of Ca2+ (16Six D.A.

Another membrane-associated activator, ceramide 1-phosphate, has been shown to bind to the cation groove of the C2 domain to activate GIVA PLA2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Stahelin R.V.

Two calcium ions coordinate with the calcium-binding loops, CBL1, CBL2, and CBL3, in the C2 domain, which is illustrated in known C2 domain structures (20Xu G.Y. McDonagh T. Yu H.A. Nalefski E.A.

These two Ca2+ ions neutralize the negative charge in the anion hole to facilitate the C2 domain's hydrophobic interaction with phospholipid membranes (21Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M.

Various models of membrane penetration for the GIVA PLA2 have been proposed to explain the hydrolysis activity of GIVA PLA2 (23Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol.

However, the x-ray crystal structure cannot fit the model perfectly unless there is a slight twist of the catalytic domain. Intradomain interactions may change the position of the C2 domain relative to the catalytic domain from that assumed in the crystal structure interpretation. Also, structural information regarding the calcium-free form of GIVA PLA2 is limited, because its NMR and x-ray crystal structure are not available. It is necessary to analyze the entire GIVA PLA2 and especially its intradomain interactions to fully understand the regulation of GIVA PLA2. Peptide amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (DXMS) has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein-protein interactions (25Mandell J.G.

The present study represents the first attempt to use DXMS to study intradomain interactions and the Ca2+ binding effect on the GIVA PLA2. This technique should complement what can be learned from NMR and x-ray crystallographic analysis. Our results describe the intradomain interactions between the C2 domain and the catalytic domain and confirm that the major conformational responses to Ca2+ are localized to the calcium-binding loop of the C2 domain. A tightened conformation of the C2 domain appears upon Ca2+ binding. Herein, we explore the resultant effects on the catalytic domain. Materials—All reagents were analytical reagent grade or better. Protein Expression and Purification—C-terminal His6-tagged GIVA PLA2, the C2 domain, and the catalytic domain were expressed using recombinant baculovirus in a suspension culture of Sf9 insect cells (16Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23842-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EGTA, and then the insoluble portion was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was passed through a column comprised of 6 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The protein in the native state was eluted in the “protein buffer” (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 125 mm imidazole, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay, and the activity was assayed using mixed micelles in the modified Dole assay (31Lucas K.K. Dennis E.A. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2005; 77: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Yang H.C. Mosior M. Johnson C.A. Chen Y. Dennis E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Purified GIVA PLA2 (2 mg/ml) was stored in the protein buffer on ice for DXMS experiments (16Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23842-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Preparation of Deuterated Samples—D2O buffer contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.9), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, (±) 200 μm CaCl2. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments were initiated by mixing 20 μl of GIVA PLA2, the C2 domain, or the catalytic domain (containing 40 μg) in protein buffer with 60 μl of D2O buffer to a final concentration of 70.4% D2O at pH 7.0. In calcium binding experiments, the GIVA PLA2 in protein buffer was preincubated in the presence of 240 μm CaCl2 in a 23 °C water bath for 5 min. The D2O buffer was then added, and the samples were incubated at 23 °C for an additional 10 s, 30 s, 100 s, 300 s, 1000 s, 3000 s, or 200 min. Each time point of the intact GIVA PLA2 was repeated three independent times. The deuterium exchange was quenched by adding 120 μl of ice-cold quench solution (0.96% formic acid, 1.66 m guanidine hydrochloride) that acidified the sample to a final pH 2.5. The samples were placed on ice at the quenched condition for 10 min to partially denature the protein for the purpose of better peptide map coverage and then frozen on dry ice. Fully deuterated samples were incubated in 2.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 75% D2O at 23 °C for 2 days. Vials with frozen samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis, usually within 3 days. Proteolysis Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Samples—All steps were performed at 0 °C as previously described (26Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S.

Biol. 2006; 363: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The samples were hand-thawed on melting ice and injected onto and passed through a protease column (66-μl bed volume) filled with porcine pepsin (Sigma; immobilized on Poros 20 AL medium at 30 mg/ml following the manufacturer's instructions, Applied Biosystems) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate from the pepsin column was directly loaded onto a C18 column (Vydac cat. 218MS5150). The peptides were eluted at 50 μl/min with a linear gradient of 0.046% trifluoroacetic acid, 6.4% (v/v) acetonitrile to 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, 38.4% acetonitrile for 30 min. The eluate from the C18 column was directed to a Finnigan Classic LCQ mass spectrometer via its ESI probe operated with a capillary temperature of 200 °C as previously described (26Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Brudler R. Gessner C.R. Li S. Tyndall S. Getzoff E.D. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Data Processing—SEQUEST software (Thermo Finnigan Inc.) was used to identify the sequence of the peptide ions. DXMS Explorer (Sierra Analytics Inc, Modesto CA) was used for the analysis of the mass spectra as previously described (26Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Brudler R. Gessner C.R. Li S. Tyndall S. Getzoff E.D. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All selected peptides had first passed the quality control threshold of the software and were then manually checked for the mass envelope fitting with the calculated mass envelope for data reduction. The highest signal/noise ion was picked if multiple ionization charges (1, 2, or 3) of a peptide were detected. Normally, the peptide with the lower charge gave a better signal. Incorporated deuteron number was the centroid shift between the non-deuterated and the partially deuterated mass envelope. The deuteration level of each peptide was calculated by the ratio of the incorporated deuteron number to the maximum possible deuteration number. GIVA PLA2 Coverage Map of Pepsin Fragmentation—The protein digestion procedure was optimized to produce a peptide map that yielded the best coverage of GIVA PLA2. These optimizations included testing various denaturants and denaturing conditions, denaturation times, amounts of protein, and flow rates for the online pepsin digestion. The final method is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The optimized condition gave a 92% coverage of the GIVA PLA2 sequence with 157 distinct peptic peptides being identified, see Fig. 1. The C2 domain and the catalytic domain alone generated the same digestion pattern as their respective parts did in the intact GIVA PLA2. There are 58 unresolved amino acid residues. These are due to regions without identified peptides and the fact that the first two residues of each peptide are rapidly exchanging and do not retain deuterons during the processing. Although we analyzed all 157 peptides, some regions of the protein contained several overlapping peptides. In some cases, comparing the deuterium levels of overlapping peptides will yield information about the deuterium levels of a subsection of the peptide. Thus, one can obtain information about regions of the protein smaller than the peptides covering it. In many cases, however, the orientation of the overlapping peptides is such that no additional information can be obtained. Also, in some cases, the error propagation through these calculations yields large variances that prevent further analysis. Because of these latter two reasons, peptides that could not provide additional information were eliminated. In the end, 59 peptide fragments, which cover 82% of the protein, were employed. In this article, when we use the term “peptide,” we are referring to an actual peptide that was identified in the pepsin digestion. When we use the term “region,” we are referring to a section of the protein for which the deuterium exchange has been calculated but may or may not correspond to an actual pepsin peptide. Deuterium On-exchange of GIVA PLA2—Full deuteration was also tried under various conditions such as 2 days of exchange in 0.5% formic acid, high temperature exchange for 4 h (50 °C), and partial denaturation in 2.5 m guanidine hydrochloride. The resulting low deuteration observed for the α/β hydrolase region indicated that the protein was not fully deuterated under all conditions. The peptide fragment 266-279 containing a solvent-exposed loop-helix structure had the highest deuteration level (89%). Hence, this peptide was used as a system back-exchange control. Back-exchange (12%) according to the fully deuterated control and the deuteration level (70.4%) was corrected for the centroid shifts. Deuterium on-exchange experiments of GIVA PLA2 (±) Ca2+ were incubated at pH 7.0, 23 °C for seven different time points ranging from 10 s to 200 min and were processed as described above. Under these conditions of temperature, pH, and time, the deuteration levels of the peptides were well distributed between 3 and 90%, and there was a 12% back-exchange. The deuteration level after deuterium on-exchange over the time course is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 1 shows the actual physical peptides that were isolated, detected, and analyzed via DXMS. Fig. 2 shows the deuterium exchange levels of various regions of the protein, not the peptides per se. The presence of overlapping peptides in Fig. 1 allows one to define the deuteration level of regions of the protein smaller than the peptides by comparing the deuterium levels of several overlapping peptides. Note that the first two N-terminal residues of each pepsin-digested DXMS peptide do not retain deuterium after the pepsin and C18 columns; this fact is also taken into account when calculating the deuteration levels of the protein regions shown in Fig. 2 (28Brudler R. Gessner C.R. Li S. Tyndall S. Getzoff E.D. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The deuteration level after 3000 s on-exchange was plotted onto the GIVA PLA2 structure (Protein data bank code 1cyj) using a color index to illustrate the H/D exchange results for the structure as shown in Fig. 3. The C2 domain consists of 8 antiparallel β-strands that are roughly divided into two domains. The first contains the β6-, β7-, and part of the β8-strands (which includes residues 6-13, 28-39, 73-76, and 125-129) and exhibits fast deuterium exchange. The second domain contains β1-, β2-, and β5-strands (which include residues 16-25, 41-48, and 91-101) and exhibits slow H/D exchange. The fast exchanging regions of the C2 domain tend to face away from the catalytic domain. The slow exchanging regions are on the opposite side of the C2 domain and face the cleft between the C2 and catalytic domains. The crystal structure indicates that there is a significant amount of open space between these two domains, but of course the crystallographic data reflect the crystal packing rather than the solution conformation. This would predict that there would be significant accessibility of water to the internal face of the C2 domain, see Fig. 3. The slow exchange in this region of the C2 domain could be due to the rigidity of the protein structure here, or it could be due to the fact that when free in solution, the C2 domain is folded against the catalytic domain. There are five regions in the x-ray crystal structure that could not be resolved because of the flexibility of the chains. These are indicated in Fig. 3 as dashed lines. It should be noted, that the DXMS method was able to detect and measure H/D exchange in each of these regions. As expected, these regions showed significant levels of exchange. Two of these regions are the hinges for the catalytic site lid (22Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain contains a cap region (residues 370-548), a central core (residues 139-369 and 549-719), and a C-terminal tail (residues 720-742). The cap region contains a high percentage of fast exchanging residues. They include residues 403-441, 458-478, 501-509, and 524-542. The lid (residues 413-457) in the cap region that regulates the active site also shows fast exchange. The central core contains two regions (335-342 and 622-632) that show fast exchange. Most of the α/β central core exhibits slow exchange (residues 207-211, 223-237, 294-298, 365-371, 572-576, 594-599, 633-642, 692-699, and 709-714). The C terminus (residues 720-742) and N terminus also exhibit fast exchange. Deuterium On-exchange of the C2 Domain and the Catalytic Domain of GIVA PLA2—To test the hypothesis that there is a dynamic interaction between the C2 domain and the catalytic domain, we expressed and purified His6-tagged C2 and His6-tagged catalytic domains individually and conducted DXMS experiments on both under the same conditions as the intact GIVA PLA2. The differences in the deuteration level between the C2 domain alone and the intact GIVA PLA2 are shown in Fig. 4. The C2 domain alone showed greater than a 20% increase of solvent accessibility (residues 41-48, 91-95, and 51-71) on β2, β3, β4, and β5 in the cleft. Most regions in β1, β6, β7, and β8 outside of the cleft were unchanged, except for region 125-129, which was the only one showing a greater than 10% increase, but it was not significant after 100 s. This result indicates that the catalytic domain either interacts with the C2 domain or it changes the conformation of the C2 domain through the linker region, leading to an increase in its solvent accessibility (Fig. 4). To find out if the increase in the solvent accessibility of the C2 domain is through the contact with the catalytic domain, we carried out hydrogen/deuterium exchange on the isolated catalytic domain (Fig. 5). The DXMS of the catalytic domain showed over a 20% increase in the region of residues 363-372, 373-388, 389-397, and 494-498 in the cleft. Also, several regions in the cap (residues 254-265, 266-279, 280-291, 292-298, 479-495, and 541-553) showed a 10-20% increase. The effect of the C2 domain on the catalytic domain is much more than the linker region and the contact region next to the linker region shown in the crystal structure, which indicates a more extensive interaction between the two domains. When we mixed the C2 domain and the catalytic domain in a 1:1 molar ratio for DXMS, the result was the same as running them individually (data not shown.) No evidence for an interaction between the two domains was observed. Clearly, the linker region is necessary for the interaction between the C2 and catalytic domains. Comparison of the DXMS results of the C2 domain and the catalytic domain alone to the intact GIVA PLA2 allowed us to localize where the C2 domain interacts with the catalytic domain. This result supports the hypothesis that there is an interaction between the C2 and the catalytic domain and allowed us to map out the interaction regions between them. Calcium Binding Effects on GIVA PLA2—The Ca2+-binding site on GIVA PLA2 consists of the three distinct Ca2+-binding loops CBL1, CBL2, and CBL3. This region has been shown to be important for lipid interface binding with the CBL1 and CBL3 regions playing a dominant role (23Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-Gonzalez S. Williams R.L. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 89: 1861-1873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We carried out the on-exchange in the presence and absence of 200 μm Ca2+.We first examined the residues that directly interact with Ca2+. The two Ca2+ ions coordinate with Asp-40, Thr-41, and Asp-43 in CBL1, with Asn-65 in the CBL2 region, and Asp-93, Ala-94, and Asn-95 in CBL3. Thr-41 and Asp-43 in CBL1 exhibit slow exchange in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6). There was only an additional 5% decrease in H/D exchange at 200 min when Ca2+ was bound. Residue Asp-40 in CBL2 is in a gap between two resolved DXMS peptides, and thus we have no H/D exchange information for this residue. Asp-93, Ala-94, and Asn-95 in CBL3 are located in the DXMS peptide 91-101, and this peptide exhibited only a 10% H/D exchange after 200 min without Ca2+. Its exchange rate did not change with Ca2+. Asn-65 in CBL2 is the only residue that is located on a DXMS peptide that showed a 10% decrease in H/D exchange upon Ca2+ binding (see Fig. 6). However, the resolution in this region was not sufficient to assign the H/D exchange changes to Asn-65. There were, however, dramatic changes in other areas of the C2 domain that indicated a conformational change in the protein. Four regions in the C2 domain had a significantly decreased H/D exchange rate; these were residues 26-39, 51-71, 102-106, and 125-129. The incorporated deuterium number over the time course in these four regions is plotted in Fig. 7. The average change in deuteration level of the FOUR time points from 5-200 min were also mapped onto the GIVA PLA2 structure in the same figure. Residues 28-35 on CBL1 exhibited a 22% decrease in deuteration levels upon Ca2+ binding. We have four DXMS peptides that cover the region from 26-39, including 26-35, 26-38, 26-39, and 26-48. All four peptides showed between a 1 and 2 deuteron decrease after Ca2+ binding. By comparing the H/D exchange of the peptides 26-35, 26-38, and 26-39, we determined that the protein region 36-39 is not affected by calcium binding and retained about 3 deuterons that accounts for 75-80% deuteration. Interestingly, residues 28-35 decreased the incorporation of 2 deuterons caused by binding of Ca2+. Two DXMS peptides, 49-71 and 49-74 containing CBL2, showed an 11% deuteration level decrease upon Ca2+ binding in this region. Residues 102-106, which are next to CBL3, showed a 22% deuteration level decrease upon Ca2+ binding. Comparing DXMS peptides 115-129 and 115-124 showed that protein residues 125-129 on the β6-β7 loop showed a 13% deuteration level decrease upon Ca2+ binding. We also examined H/D exchange levels on the rest of the protein and found no significant change in the H/D exchange levels in the catalytic domain. It is worth noting that the linker region (residues 139-146) showed a 6% solvent accessibility decrease upon calcium binding, which suggests minor interaction or orientation changes between the C2 and the catalytic domain. DXMS results provide a detailed H/D exchange rate profile of the catalytic domain. The crystal structure of the GIVA PLA2 contains a lid in the cap region that is tethered to the rigid catalytic core by two very flexible peptides and that blocks the catalytic site in the crystal structure. The lid apparently must move out of the way so that substrate can bind to the catalytic site. It has also been suggested that the cap is involved in membrane association (24Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23838-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our deuterium exchange results are consistent with these hypotheses. The lid and the tethers on either side of it show fast exchange. Interestingly, the deuterium DXMS method was able to detect and measure the exchange of the two tethers that could not be seen via x-ray crystallography and have confirmed that they have fast exchange. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the lid is a flexible regulatory structure that can move when the enzyme interacts with lipid interfaces to expose the active site in the rigid catalytic domain. The GIVA PLA2 has been shown to translocate to the Golgi and perinuclear regions of cells upon the release of Ca2+ (36Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Glover S. de Carvalho M.S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

This movement has been suggested to be one important way for the cell to control the action of this enzyme and eicosanoid production. The C2 domain is clearly responsible for this action. The Ca2+-dependent membrane docking of the C2 domain alone of this and many other proteins has been extensively studied to understand how its structure affects membrane penetration and the sequestration of the enzyme at the lipid surface. It is believed that the C2 domain allows the GIVA PLA2 to bind to the membrane and that it positions the active site in a way that facilitates the binding of the substrate. Two Ca2+ ions coordinate with Asp and Asn residues in the anion hole on the tip of the C2 domain to neutralize negative charges in this region. The hydrophobic residues on the tip of CBL1 (Phe-35, Met-38, and Leu-39) and CBL3 (Tyr-96, Val-97, and Met-98) interact with the hydrophobic phospholipid headgroup (21Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). After the binding to the phospholipid bilayer, the dissociation rate of Ca2+ decreases (39Corbin J.A. Evans J.H. Landgraf K.E. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4322-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding may cause a conformational change of the C2 domain, which effectively hides the hydrophilic residues and exposes the hydrophobic residues. One of the most dramatic differences that we observed occurred in the C2 domain. The surface of the C2 domain that faces away from the catalytic domain showed significant H/D exchange, whereas the opposite surface that faces the catalytic domain showed slow exchange. H/D exchange rates are affected by accessibility to water and can reflect the rigidity of the protein secondary structure and the strength of the hydrogen bonds. Both of these regions are composed of antiparallel β-sheets, and one might expect that they would have the same structural characteristics, and thus the H/D exchange rates would be similar. The decreased exchange on the surface facing the catalytic domain could be due to the fact that in solution the C2 domain rests up against the catalytic domain, and thus water accessibility is decreased. The slow exchange regions in the cleft between the C2 domain and the catalytic domain had over a 20% increase of the solvent accessibility when we conducted the DXMS experiments on the C2 domain or the catalytic domain alone. This would imply that the cleft delineated in the x-ray structure is in a different orientation of the protein when there is no calcium binding. It should be noted that the C2 and catalytic domains are held together by a single short peptide linker that should be fairly flexible. The interaction or the contact regions between the C2 domain and the catalytic domain can be mapped out by the solvent accessibility difference of the two individual domains and the intact GIVA PLA2 (Figs. 4 and 5). To compare the effects of calcium binding on structural perturbations and charge neutralization, the electrostatic potential and the Ca2+ binding effects measured by DXMS were plotted onto the molecular model of GIVA PLA2 (Fig. 8). The anion hole surrounded by CBL1, CBL2, and CBL3 on the top of the C2 domain is highly negatively charged. The cleft between the C2 and catalytic domains has a low to positive electrostatic potential (Fig. 8a). We also showed low solvent accessibility of the β2 and β5 sheets (Fig. 3). The linker region between the C2 domain and the catalytic domain is possibly a flexible loop, because the regions 132-136 and 147-156 may be overdigested by pepsin and were not covered in the peptide map (Fig. 1). This evidence suggests that the C2 domain is probably in physical contact with the catalytic domain. Additionally, the two Ca2+ ions bind directly to the anion hole to neutralize the negative charge (Fig. 8a). We observe the largest change in electrostatics in the anion hole; however, the overall decreased H/D exchange regions do not occur in this region (Fig. 8b). The most significantly decreased regions are on either side of the anion hole. Fig. 6 shows that the regions that directly bind Ca2+ have very slow exchange that did not change upon calcium binding. This suggests that the anion hole has either a low D2O accessible/exchanging location or is very rigid. On the other hand, the surfaces surrounding the anion hole showed more exchange without calcium and showed decreased H/D exchange rates upon calcium binding. Both the C2 surface facing away from the catalytic site and the surface facing it showed decreased H/D exchange upon Ca2+ binding. Because both of these surfaces have a decreased exchange and there is nothing on the outside surface that would hinder access to water, we conclude that the observed effects are due to Ca2+ tightening up the pleated sheet structure in these regions and thus stabilizing the hydrogen bonds. CBL1 and CBL3 are both components of the anion hole. These two loops show slow exchange on the side of the anion hole and fast exchange on the molecular surface. These results are consistent with the proposed membrane penetration model (24Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23838-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and indicate that the conformational change and negative charge neutralization occurs immediately after Ca2+ binding. In conclusion, DXMS has allowed us to observe the interaction between the C2 domain and the catalytic domain and the effects of Ca2+ binding on the intact GIVA PLA2 from a unique perspective. The C2 domain shows extensive interaction with the catalytic domain beyond the linker region. While the calcium binding effects are mainly on the C2 domain, Ca2+ binding may extend its effects and have implications for the catalytic domain. Binding of two Ca2+ ions cause a conformational change on the C2 domain, tightening up the regions surrounding the anion hole. The rigidified conformation of the C2 domain constitutes an initial step leading to enzyme interfacial activation, but this work shows clearly that changes in the cap and lid of the catalytic domain also play a critical role in enzyme interactions and the full catalytic activity of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1985233886,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells exposed to genotoxic agents arrest their cell cycle at the G2/M checkpoint and are inherently chemoresistant. To understand the mechanism of this chemoresistance, we compared the ability of immature CD34+ versus mature CD34− AML cell lines (KG1a and U937, respectively) to recover from a DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint in G2. Here, we report that KG1a cells have a more stringent G2/M checkpoint response than U937 cells. We show that in both cell types, the CDC25B phosphatase participates in the G2/M checkpoint recovery and that its expression is upregulated. Furthermore, we show that CHK1 inhibition by UCN-01 in immature KG1a cells allows checkpoint exit and induces sensitivity to genotoxic agents. Similarly, UCN-01 treatment potentializes genotoxic-induced inhibition of colony formation efficiency of primary leukemic cells from AML patients. Altogether, our results demonstrate that checkpoint stringency varies during the maturation process and indicate that targeting checkpoint mechanisms might represent an attractive therapeutic opportunity for chemoresistant immature AML cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028013973,"This paper demonstrates that collective social dynamics resulting from individual donations can be well described by an epidemic model. It captures the herding behavior in donations as a non-local interaction between individual via a time-dependent mean field representing the mass media. Our study is based on the statistical analysis of a unique dataset obtained before and after the tsunami disaster of 2004. We find a power-law behavior for the distributions of donations with similar exponents for different countries. Even more remarkably, we show that these exponents are the same before and after the tsunami, which accounts for some kind of universal behavior in donations independent of the actual event. We further show that the time-dependent change of both the number and the total amount of donations after the tsunami follows a logistic growth equation. As a new element, a time-dependent scaling factor appears in this equation which accounts for the growing lack of public interest after the disaster. The results of the model are underpinned by the data analysis and thus also allow for a quantification of the media influence."
https://openalex.org/W2079848013,"Inhibition of p53-activated transcription is an integral part of the mechanism by which early region 1B 55K oncoprotein (E1B-55K) from adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) contributes to complete cell transformation in combination with Ad E1A. In addition, more recent data suggest that the mode of action of the Ad protein during transformation may involve additional functions and other protein interactions. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis to assign further transforming functions of Ad5 E1B-55K to distinct domains within the viral polypeptide. Results from these studies show that the functions required for transformation are encoded within several patches of the 55K primary sequence, including several clustered cysteine and histidine residues, some of which match the consensus for zinc fingers. In addition, two amino-acid substitutions (C454S/C456S) created a 55K mutant protein, which had substantially reduced transforming activity. Interestingly, the same mutations neither affected binding to p53 nor inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation. Therefore, an activity necessary for efficient transformation of primary rat cells can be separated from functions required for inhibition of p53-stimulated transcription. Our data indicate that this activity is linked to the ability of the Ad5 protein to bind to components of the Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 DNA double-strand break repair complex, and/or its ability to assemble multiprotein aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transformed rat cells. These results introduce a new function for Ad5 E1B-55K and suggest that the viral protein contributes to cell transformation through p53 transcription-dependent and -independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2064516748,"Previous studies investigated the effects of crossmodal spatial attention by comparing the responses to validly versus invalidly cued target stimuli. Dynamics of cortical rhythms in the time interval between cue and target might contribute to cue effects on performance. Here, we studied the influence of spatial attention on ongoing oscillatory brain activity in the interval between cue and target onset. In a first experiment, subjects underwent periods of tactile stimulation (cue) followed by visual stimulation (target) in a spatial cueing task as well as tactile stimulation as a control. In a second experiment, cue validity was modified to be 50%, 75%, or else 25%, to separate effects of exogenous shifts of attention caused by tactile stimuli from that of endogenous shifts. Tactile stimuli produced: 1) a stronger lateralization of the sensorimotor beta-rhythm rebound (15–22 Hz) after tactile stimuli serving as cues versus not serving as cues; 2) a suppression of the occipital alpha-rhythm (7–13 Hz) appearing only in the cueing task (this suppression was stronger contralateral to the endogenously attended side and was predictive of behavioral success); 3) an increase of prefrontal gamma-activity (25–35 Hz) specifically in the cueing task. We measured cue-related modulations of cortical rhythms which may accompany crossmodal spatial attention, expectation or decision, and therefore contribute to cue validity effects. The clearly lateralized alpha suppression after tactile cues in our data indicates its dependence on endogenous rather than exogenous shifts of visuo-spatial attention following a cue independent of its modality."
https://openalex.org/W2151633314,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) constitute a family of neuron-specific voltage-insensitive sodium channels gated by extracellular protons. Functions of ASICs in mammals include nociception, mechanosensation, and modulation of synaptic transmission. However, the role protons play in mediating the effects of ASICs remains elusive. We have examined ASICs from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a simple chordate organism whose nervous system in the larval stage exhibits high similarity to that of higher vertebrates. We found that the ascidian genome contains a single ASIC gene that gives rise to two splice forms analogous to the mammalian ASIC1 and ASIC2. CiASIC is expressed in most neurons of the larva but is absent in the adult. Despite high sequence similarity with mammalian counterparts, CiASIC is proton-insensitive when examined in heterologous systems or in larval neurons; the latter rules out the possibility that proton sensitivity is conferred by accessory proteins or particular factors present only in Ciona neurons. Down-regulation of the CiASIC transcript by double-stranded RNA disrupted the regular pattern of larval swimming, implying that proton-independent mechanisms mediate the effects of ASIC in vivo. Together the data identify ASIC as a highly conserved channel distinctive of chordate nervous systems and show that protons are not essential for ASIC function."

Here we report that a 25-kDa protein purified from rat liver lysosomes possesses a long standing potent Bid cleavage activity at neutral pH, and the truncated Bid can in turn induce rapid mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. This protease was revealed as chymotrypsin B by biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis. Although it was long recognized as a digestive protease exclusively secreted by the exocrine pancreas, our data support that it also expresses and intracellularly resides in rat liver lysosomes. Translocation of lysosomal chymotrypsin B into cytosol was triggered by apoptotic stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α, and intracellular delivery of chymotrypsin B protein induced apoptotic cell death with a potency comparable with cathepsin B, suggestive of a lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis regulated by chymotrypsin B following its release. Noteworthily, either knockdown of chymotrypsin B expression by RNA interference or pretreatment with chymotrypsin B inhibitor N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-α-induce apoptosis.

Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved process critical in various biological events, such as embryonic development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and removal of damaged cells.

Recently accumulating evidence has indicated that, in addition to mitochondria, lysosomes also play important roles in the apoptosis (5Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). As reported, several lysosomal acid-dependent proteases, known as cathepsins, have been implicated in apoptosis induction following their relocalization to the cytosol as a result of moderate lysosomal rupture, probably via activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (6Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Brmme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, proteolytic activation of Bid may present a mechanism through which extralysosomal cathepsins can elicit MMP and subsequent caspase activation. Many isoforms of cathepsins (cathepsins B, H, L, S, K, X, C, and D) have been identified to be Bid-cleaving proteases. Incubation of full-length Bid with cathepsins B, H, L, and S, respectively, resulted in Bid activation and subsequent rapid cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. The physiological functions of cathepsins, however, have been controversial because they are usually autolyzed or denatured in the physiological conditions of the cytosol (9Cirman T. Oresic K.

In the course of our study of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (10Zhai D.Y. Miao Q. Xin X.F. Yang F.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Yan L. Miao Q. Sun Y. Yang F.Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), an unknown caspase 8-like activity capable of converting Bid into truncated Bid at neutral pH was detected in highly purified rat liver lysosomal extracts. This gave us an impetus to purify the responsible lysosomal protease(s). In this study, we report the purification and characterization of one of the proteases termed lysosomal Bid cleavage protease (LBCP). The cleavage site on Bid by LBCP is different from that of caspase 8, lysosomal cathepsins, granzyme B, and calpain. By mass spectrometric assays, analysis of inhibitor specificity, and a determination of its Bid cleavage sites, LBCP was found to be identical to chymotrypsin B, a robust and stable serine endopeptidase previously known as an intestinal digestive enzyme expressed and secreted solely by the exocrine pancreas. Upon stimulation with TNF-α, the intralysosomal chymotrypsin B was released into the cytosol, triggered the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and resulted in apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Mouse Bid expression plasmid constructed in pET-23d vector was kindly provided by Dr. Bruno Antonsson (Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Switzerland). The Bid protein was expressed and purified as described previously (10Zhai D.Y. Miao Q. Xin X.F. Yang F.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of cystatins A and B in pHD389 vector, kindly provided by Dr. Ingemar Björk (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden), essentially followed this method. The SERPINB3 and SERPINB4 expression constructs (the coding sequences inserted into the pGEX-2T vector) were obtained from Dr. Gary A. Silverman (Harvard Medical School). The recombinant proteins glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SERPINB3 and -SERPINB4 were batch-purified using glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). The c-IAP-1 expression plasmid constructed in pGEX4T was a gift from Dr. Xiaodong Wang (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The GST-c-IAP-1 fusion protein was affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose by standard methods. The rat chymotrypsinogen B expression vector constructed in pET-17b was a generous gift from Dr. László Gráf (Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary). The vector was transformed into the BL21 (DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli strain. After induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, the cells were collected in a 1/10 volume of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA and frozen. The cells were then thawed and sonicated, and the inclusion body fraction was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in ∼30 ml of Triton wash solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl) using a homogenizer. The inclusion bodies were pelleted at 25,000 × g for 10 min. This wash was repeated four times, and one final wash was performed to remove any remaining Triton using the homogenizer again in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl. For renaturation of the expressed protein, the inclusion body fraction was solubilized with 6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm dithiothreitol. The solubilized protein was dialyzed against the refolding buffer containing 5 mm cysteine, 1 mm cystine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and guanidine-HCl with its concentration continually decreasing from 3 to 1 m. The renaturation process was conducted at 4 °C for 24 h. The renatured protein solution was then dialyzed against 2 mm HCl, 10 mm CaCl2 and ultracentrifuged (78,100 × g, 30 min). The zymogen was activated by trypsin (Sigma) at a 200:1 (w/w) zymogen/trypsin ratio. After treatment with l-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK; ICN), the active form was purified by affinity chromatography on an SB-TI-Sepharose column (Sigma). Immediately after chymotrypsin B was eluted from the column with 1 mm HCl, the solution was neutralized with ammonia and then lyophilized. The purity of the preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme concentration was determined by active site titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-trimethylammoniocinnamate chloride (Sigma). Preparation of Lysosomes and Mitochondria—Lysosomes were purified from the livers of Sprague-Dawley rats according to the method described by Stoka et al. (6Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H.

We analyzed all purifications with one lysosomal and two mitochondrial markers to minimize any cross-contamination between the two organelles. To eliminate the contamination of mitochondria, the lysosomal fractions were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C in the presence of CaCl2 (final concentration 1 mm). Soluble lysosomal constituents were released by three freezethaw cycles with a 15-s vortex between each cycle. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the lysosomal membranes, and the supernatant was collected. Mitochondria were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat livers according to the protocol described by Luo et al. (3Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). Purification of Lysosomal Bid Cleavage Protease—Five batches of lysosomal extracts from 20 rat livers were used as the starting material for the following purification procedures until the last step. All steps were carried at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. The Bid cleavage activity at pH 7.6 was followed after each step (Zhai et al. (10Zhai D.Y. Miao Q. Xin X.F. Yang F.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After dialysis against buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.5 m NaCl, the lysosomal extract was loaded onto a 3-ml lentil lectin column (Amersham Biosciences) and was recirculated to provide sufficient interaction with the medium. The flow-through from the affinity column was then dialyzed against buffer A, followed by acidification at a final concentration of 200 mm NaAc/HAc at pH 5.0. Following incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g, the supernatants were collected and dialyzed against buffer A. This solution was then loaded onto a Bio-Scale Q5 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 45 ml from buffer A to buffer A containing 600 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and at a final concentration of 1.0 m ammonium sulfate were loaded onto an MP7 HIC column (50 × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 1.0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A. 10 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm ammonium sulfate was applied to the column, and the eluate was collected and dialyzed against 25 mm ammonium formate, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm NaCl. The solution was lyophilized, redissolved in 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/30 column coupled with a Superdex 75 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The active fractions were stored at 4 °C until all five batches were processed to this point. At the last step, all batches of the active fractions from the gel filtration columns were pooled. After dilution to lower the concentration of NaCl to 100 mm, the solution was loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl and eluted with 30 ml of buffer A containing a linear gradient of NaCl increasing from 100 to 600 mm. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected and assayed for Bid cleavage activity. In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometric Identification—0.4 ml of the active peak fraction from the last purification step was lyophilized, redissolved in 120 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. After staining with colloidal blue (Invitrogen), the ∼25-kDa band that corresponded with the activity were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (10 ng/μl). The tryptic peptides were extracted and dried in a vacuum centrifuge and were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a nanoscale C18 column coupled in-line with an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Deca, Thermo Finnigan). The instrument was run in a data-dependent mode, cycling between one full MS scan and MS/MS scans of the three most abundant ions. The MS and MS/MS data were used to search the nonredundant NCBI protein data base using MASCOT software. Effect of Inhibitors on the Bid Cleavage Activity—Aliquots from the Mono Q fraction at the peak of Bid cleavage activity were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin (inhibitors were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated), 5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml SB-TI, 0.25 mm chymostatin, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 20 μm E-64, 0.2 mm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (ICN Biomedicals), 0.5 mm l-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK), 0.5 mm N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm o-phenanthroline, 1 μm caspase-1 inhibitor I (Ac-YVAD-CHO; Calbiochem), 100 μm caspase-3 inhibitor I (Ac-DEVD-CHO), 1 μm caspase-8 inhibitor I (Ac-IETD-CHO), 0.25 mm cathepsin inhibitor I (Z-FG-NHO-Bz), SERPINB3 (500:1, molar ratio), SERPINB4 (500:1), cystatin A (500:1), cystatin B (500:1), or c-IAP1 (500:1). 10 μg of Bid was then introduced into each incubation mixture, and the final volume adjusted to 20 μl. The reaction was stopped after incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. Appropriate solvent controls were run in parallel. N-terminal Sequencing of Bid Cleaved by Lysosomal Protease—Bid cleaved by the lysosomal protease was separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE on 15% gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Gelman). The appropriate band was excised, and the N-terminal sequence of the Bid cleavage product was determined with an ABI-491 amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Determination of Km—The enzyme assay was performed at 37 °C on an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi). A 1 mm stock solution of the substrate Suc-AAPF-AMC was made in Me2SO. The reaction cuvette contained 100 μl of the reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl) into which various volumes of the substrate solution and 5 μl of the sample to be tested were introduced. The progression of the fluorescence increase was measured at λem = 460 nm with fluorescence excitation at λex = 380 nm. The detected signals were converted into moles of substrate hydrolyzed per s. Initial velocities and substrate concentrations were fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Detection of Ctrb mRNA—Primary rat hepatocytes isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats and rat hepatoma RH-35 cells (Chinese Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For the RT-PCR analysis of Ctrb mRNA, total RNA was isolated by using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was carried out by using an Access RT-PCR kit (Promega), with primers specific for rat Ctrb (GATCGCACAGGTCTTTAAGAA and CATCGACGTTGGGTAGACAC; PCR product 133 bp; the primer sequences crosses an intron that could eliminate the disturbance of genomic DNA contaminations). The PCR products were subjected to 3% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by DNA sequencing. Western Blot Analysis of Ctrb Protein—RH-35 hepatoma cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylarsine oxide, 3 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and disrupted by sonication on ice. After ultracentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants containing solubilized proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with homemade antibody against Ctrb and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. After four washes with 0.05% TBST, the target protein was detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Bid—The cleavage site mutation of Bid was generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutagenic oligonucleotides are 5′-GCCAGCCGCTCCTTCAACCAAGGAAGAATA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TATTCTTCCTTGGTTGAAGGAGCGGCTGGC-3′ (antisense). In Vitro Assay for Cytochrome c Release Induced by Cleaved Bid—Bid was cleaved by LBCP at 37 °C for 1 h. An aliquot of rat liver mitochondria equal to 50 μg of protein was incubated with cleaved Bid at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in a final volume of 50 μl of MT buffer (400 mm mannitol, 10 mm KH2PO4, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mm succinate) at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the reaction mixture was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The cytochrome c in the supernatant and mitochondrial pellet was analyzed by Western blot with an anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—For observation of the intracellular Ctrb or cytochrome c by immunofluorescence, RH-35 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h, permeabilized with methanol at –20 °C for 5 min, blocked with 5% newborn calf serum at room temperature for 30 min, incubated with a rabbit anti-Ctrb antiserum (US Biological), a rabbit-anti cytochrome c antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a goat anti-cathepsin D antibody at 4 °C overnight, and probed with cy3-labeled or FITC-labeled secondary antibodies (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1.5 h. LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) was loaded into RH-35 cells by incubating the cells in probe-containing media at a final concentration of 50 nm for 1 h at 37 °C (28Werneburg N. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G947-G956Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed with an inverted Olympus Fluo-View FV500 laser scanning confocal microscope (Osaka) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm for GFP and FITC, 433 and 475 nm for CFP, 570 and 590 for LysoTracker, and 550 and 570 nm for cy3, respectively. Construction of Rat Pre-chymotrypsinogen B Expression Vector (Ctrb-GFP) and Transfection—With the rat chymotrypsinogen B expression vector pET-17b lacking 51 nucleotides encoding the N-terminal signal peptide of the chymotrypsinogen B precursor, the coding sequence was amplified using the following two primers: 5′-TTTAAGCTTATGGCATTCCTTTGGCTCGTGTCCTGCTTTGCCCTTGTGGGGGCCACCTTTGGCTGTGGAGTCCCTACCATCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAGGATCCTCAGTTGGCTTCCAAGATCTG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) were cut with HindIII and BamHI (Takara), followed by purification and ligation. Transformed competent cells (TianWei, China) were plated on selective agar plates, and colonies were selected and grown in LB media containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. To check whether the new construct generates functional proteins, the proteins were expressed in vitro using the Promega TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Efficiency of expression was monitored by analyzing the translation with SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Expression plasmids for transfection were purified using the plasmid midi kit (Qiagen). The expression plasmids were transfected into RH-35 cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The expression vector for LAMP-2-CFP was a generous gift from Dr. G. J. Gores (Mayo Medical School). In brief, RH-35 cells grown in 35-mm dishes at 60% confluence were transfected with 4 μgof the plasmid, 6 μl of lipid, and 6 μl of Plus reagent in 0.8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics. To obtain stable transfected cell lines, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks. Delivery of Ctrb into Rat RH-35 Hepatoma Cells—Recombinant chymotrypsin B was delivered to RH-35 rat hepatoma cells by using the BioPORTER protein transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of Ctrb solution (1 μm) was incubated in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm TPCK for 30 min at 37 °C. Ctrb solutions or phosphate-buffered saline was then used to hydrate the dried BioPORTER. The solution was pipetted up and down and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Finally, the volume of the complexes was brought to 0.5 ml with serum-free medium and then transferred directly onto the RH-35 cells. After incubation for 5 h, 2 ml of serum-containing medium was added. The cells were incubated overnight and then subjected to apoptosis assays. RNAi Studies—The mammalian expression vector, pSUPER.retro.neo (OligoEngine), was used for expression of short interfering RNA in RH-35 cells. The gene-specific insert specifies a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 421–439 of Ctrb. These sequences were inserted into the pSUPER.retro.neo backbone after digestion with BglII and HindIII. This vector was referred to as pSUPER-Ctrb. Considering bioinformatics studies revealed that the empty pSUPER.retro.neovector might form hairpin oligonucleotide(s) that could interfere with the stability of Ctrb mRNA and consequently induce nonspecific down-regulation of Ctrb, a control vector (pSUPER-LacZ) with no significant homology to the ctrb gene was used as a nonsilencing control. The transient transfections of the RH-35 rat hepatoma cells with pSUPER-Ctrb or pSUPER-LacZ (control) vectors were done with Nucleofector Solution V coupled with program T-030 (Amaxa). Transfected cells were analyzed by real time PCR for actin and Ctrb using the Bio-Rad MyIQ. Data were calculated by the relative quantitation method and compared with actin as internal control. To determine the effect of RNAi-mediated down-regulation of Ctrb on TNF-α-induced apoptosis, transiently transfected RH-35 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 h and subjected to flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis. Apoptosis Assays—Cells were harvested by mild trypsinization, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 70% ethanol. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and the percentage of hypodiploid (apoptotic) cells with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). The impetus for this study was our previous observation of an unknown caspase 8-like lysosomal protease capable of converting Bid into truncated Bid at neutral pH. We took painstaking effort to purify this protease. Fig. 1a shows the many steps involved in purification as we followed the Bid cleavage activity at pH 7.6. Starting with highly purified lysosome preparations (mitochondrial contaminations lower than 1%) from rat livers, a robust and stable Bid cleavage activity with maximum activity at pH 7.6 was detected in the supernatant (Fig. 1b) after incubation of the lentil lectin flow-through fraction at pH 5.0 (intralysosomal pH) and 37 °C. This enzymatic activity was designated as LBCP. We believe that it is the incubation that leads to the activation of the LBCP from its premature LBCP zymogen, although the reason so far is not understood. Next, the pH of the active supernatant was changed to 7.0 by dialysis and subjected to anion exchange chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1, b and c, the eluate fractions (fractions 26–32) at ∼270 mm NaCl (Fig. 1c) showed the apparent Bid cleavage activity at pH 7.6 and corresponded with the appearance of an ∼25-kDa protein observed on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1d). This band was excised and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (see under “Mass Spectrometric Identification of LBCP”). To the end, it was estimated that 2–6 μg of the protein (∼0.3–1 ng/μl) from liver lysosomes of 100 rats could be obtained. The purified LBCP shows a potent Bid cleavage activity because a 10,000-fold molar ratio excess of Bid could be cleaved by LBCP within minutes. Biochemical Characterization of LBCP—To biochemically characterize the LBCP, a wide range of peptidase inhibitors was assayed for their possible potential on the Bid cleavage activity of the purified LBCP. It can be seen that the proteolytic cleavage of Bid was abolished by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, SB-TI, and chymostatin but not by inhibitors of other classes (Fig. 2a and Table 1). Noticeably, in contrast to benzamidine and TLCK, TPCK, which belongs to the class of chymotrypsin-like peptidase inhibitors, specifically inhibited the activity of LBCP. Of five endogenous protein inhibitors tested, only SERPINB3 and SERPINB4 counteracted LBCP to some extent, whereas cystatins A and B and c-IAP-1 had no effect. Thus, the inhibition profile suggested that LBCP is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease.TABLE 1Specificity of various class inhibitors and their effects on the Bid cleavage activity of LBCPInhibitors specific forInhibitory effectSerine peptidases GeneralPMSF, DCI, SB-TIComplete Chymotrypsin-likeTPCKCompleteChymostatin UndefinedAprotininPartialSERPINB3, 4 Trypsin-likeTLCKNoBenzamidineCysteine peptidases GeneralIodoacetamideN-EthylmaleimideE-64 CaspaseAc-YVAD-CHONoAc-DEVD-CHOAc-IETD-CHOc-IAP1 Lysosomal cysteine proteasesCystatin A, BZ-FG-NHO-BzPartialAspartate peptidases Pepst"
https://openalex.org/W2004358444,"Taxol is a potent anti-mitotic drug used in chemotherapy, angioplastic stents, and cell biology research. By binding and stabilizing microtubules, Taxol inhibits their dynamics, crucial for cell division, motility, and survival. The drug has also been reported to induce formation of asters and bundles composed of stabilized microtubules. Surprisingly, at commonly used concentrations, Taxol forms crystals that rapidly bind fluorescent tubulin subunits, generating structures with an uncanny resemblance to microtubule asters and bundles. Kinetic and topological considerations suggest that tubulin subunits, rather than microtubules, bind the crystals. This sequestration of tubulin from the subunit pool would be expected to shift the equilibrium of free to polymerized tubulin to disfavor assembly. Our results imply that some previously reported Taxol-induced asters or bundles could include or be composed of tubulin-decorated Taxol crystals. Thus, reevaluation of certain morphological, chemical, and physical properties of Taxol-treated microtubules may be necessary. Moreover, our findings suggest a novel mechanism for chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in non-dividing cells, with far-reaching medical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2006733013,"The effect of interferon-γ (IFNγ) treatment on cell surface protein expression was studied in the human prostate cancer cell line 1542CP3TX. IFNγ increased both the number and abundance of proteins in membrane fractions. In contrast, the expression of annexin 2 and its binding partner p11 decreased by 4-fold after 24 h of exposure, with the remaining anx2t complexes localized to lipid rafts. Within the same time scale, IFNγ reduced the abundance of the peripherally attached, anx2t-associated proteases procathepsin B and plasminogen. The invasive capacity of the cancer cells was reduced by treatment with IFNγ or antibody to annexin 2 in 1542CP3TX cells, but not in LNCaP, an annexin 2-negative prostate cancer cell line. Expression of annexin 2 in LNCaP cells increased their invasiveness. IFNγ induced calpain expression and activation and increased the phosphorylation and degradation of the calpain substrate ABCA1 in 1542CP3TX cancer cells. Surface expression of annexin 2 was reduced in cells treated with glyburide, an ABCA1 inhibitor, whereas inhibition of calpain abrogated IFNγ-induced annexin 2 down-regulation and suppression of Matrigel invasion. The findings suggest annexin 2 externalization is coupled to lipid efflux in prostate epithelium and that IFNγ induces down-regulation of the protease-binding anx2t scaffold at the cell surface and consequently acts to suppress invasiveness through calpain-mediated degradation of the lipid transporter ABCA1.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in men and the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men. Whereas the cancer is contained within the prostate, the disease is curable with surgery or radiotherapy, but once it has spread there are no curative treatments. Thus a major challenge is to identify new methods to delay or prevent the progression of the disease. Cytokines are among the most potent extracellular regulators of protein expression at the cell surface.

Annexin 2 is a member of a family of peripheral membrane-binding proteins characterized by their ability to bind to acidic phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. This property is shared with two other protein families, namely the pentraxins and vitamin-K-dependent proteins (22Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar).

Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule and annexin 2 are implicated in the metastatic progression of tumor cells after chemotherapy with adriamycin (38Choi S. Kobayashi M. Wang J. Habelhah H.

Metastasis. 2000; 18: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and autoantibodies to annexin 2 are frequently observed in patients with lung cancer (39Brichory F.M. Misek D.E. Yim A.M.

Annexin 2 serves as a binding platform for procathepsin B on the surface of tumor cells (37Mai J. Finley Jr., R.L. Waisman D.M. Sloane B.F. J. Biol.

We have used a proteomics based strategy to identify new cell surface markers in prostate cancer and have identified several deregulated membrane proteins by comparing their expression and regulation by cytokines in normal and cancer cells (42Hastie C.

Here, long term treatment with IFNγ is shown to reduce the surface expression of annexin 2 and its binding partner p11 in 1542CP3TX prostate cancer cells. In consequence, the abundance of surface associated pre-proteases such as procathepsin B and plasminogen is reduced, as is invasiveness. This study demonstrates a novel anticancer action of IFNγ. Cells—The prostate cancer cell line 1542CP3TX was grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, as described by the originators (44Bright R.K. Vocke C.D. Emmert-Buck M.R. Duray P.H. Solomon D. Fetsch P. Rhim J.S. Linehan W.M. Topalian S.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Surface Labeling, Enrichment, and Separation of Membrane Proteins—Vectorial labeling with sulfonated succimidyl ester derivatives of biotin (42Hastie C. Saxton M. Akpan A. Cramer R. Masters J.R. Naaby-Hansen S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5905-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was performed prior to interferon exposure or at the end of each treatment period. For avidin affinity chromatography, sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin-labeled cells were lysed in 1% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OGP) in PBS, containing a protease inhibitor mixture with or without EDTA (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Where appropriate, OGP extractions were performed in the presence of the following phosphatase inhibitors: 1 μm okadaic acid, 5 μm α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl α-(4-chlorophenyl) isovalerate, and 5 μm potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate. Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry assay (RC DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). The OGP-solubilized SS-biotin-labeled membrane fractions were purified by avidin affinity chromatography as described previously (42Hastie C. Saxton M. Akpan A. Cramer R. Masters J.R. Naaby-Hansen S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5905-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The eluted fractions were dialyzed against distilled water, vacuum-concentrated, rehydrated in electrophoresis buffer, the isolated membrane proteins separated by SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and visualized by Coomassie or silver staining. In-gel digestion and mass spectrometry analysis of the generated peptide mixtures were performed as described previously (45Naaby-Hansen S. Nagano K. Gaffney P. Masters J. Cramer R. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 277-297PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments the enriched surface fractions were transferred to NC membranes following electrophoresis and probed with horseradish peroxidase-avidin or antibodies. Avidin- and antibody binding was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique. Secondary antibody-alone controls were included and were negative in all cases. High salt or chelating dissociation buffers were used to release peripherally attached proteins from the surface of intact cells. The cells were washed twice in PBS followed by a phosphate buffer with protease inhibitors and either CaCl2 (0.5-15 mm) or EDTA (0.5-5 mm), and surface proteins were released by gentle swirling. Calcium- and EDTA-free buffer treatments served as control. After 2 min the dissociation buffer was removed by aspiration, and the released proteins were concentrated by spin-vac centrifugation before being separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to blotting membranes, and stained with antibody. Alternatively, peripherally attached proteins were released from biotinylated cells by treatment with a hypertonic phosphate buffer containing 0.65 m NaCl and protease inhibitors, for 5 min at room temperature. The high salt buffer was removed by aspiration and diluted to isoosmolarity, and avidin-conjugated agarose beads (20 μl/ml) were added. After 15 min of mixing by rotation, proteins bound to the avidin beads were isolated by centrifugation. Following five washes in isotonic PBS, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors, the purified proteins were eluted from the beads by heating in a reducing Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Analysis of ABCA-1 Phosphorylation—[33P]Orthophosphate labeling was employed to investigate the phosphorylation status of ABCA1 in IFNγ-treated cells. Cells were grown to 70% confluence, washed twice in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum, incubated for 1 h in the same medium, and labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml [33P]orthophosphate for 6 h prior to exposure to interferon. After different stimulation periods, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.2% deoxycholate in PBS, pH 7.4, plus the protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. ABCA1 and associated binding partners were then isolated by immunoprecipitation with monospecific, purified rabbit antibody (Novus Biologicals NB 400-105). Following SDS-PAGE separation, the immunopurified radiolabeled proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, dried, and visualized by PhosphorImaging on a Molecular Imager FX scanner (Bio-Rad). Live Cell Immunofluorescence Staining—Live cell immunofluorescence was performed using the protocol of Groves (46Groves, A. (1992) DNA Amplification in Mammalian Cells, Ph.D. thesis, University College London, UKGoogle Scholar). Live cells were initially incubated with primary antibodies against annexin 2 and p11 and with cholera toxin. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with phalloidin to visualize the actin cortex, and finally stained with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cell Invasion Assays—The Biocoat Matrigel invasion chamber system (BD Biosciences) was used to assay the invasive potential of cells cultured in the presence or absence of IFNγ, employing the protocol of Falcone et al. (25Falcone D.J. Borth W. Khan K.M. Hajjar K.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of antibody blockage, the Matrigel was re-hydrated in normal medium or in a medium containing 25 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody against annexin 2 (catalog number 034400, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 4 °C. The same concentration of an isotypic mouse monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used as control. A similar protocol was used to assay the invasive effects of annexin 2-GFP transfection, with the exceptions that the cells here were obtained from a 24-well plate, and the migrants were counted using a fluorescence microscope. To study the effect instigated by inhibition of calpain, 1542CP3TX cells were pretreated for 3 h with 30 μm type-II calpain inhibitor (Calbiochem) or with a control solution of 0.01% Me2SO. The Biocoat Matrigel wells were rehydrated in media containing either Me2SO, IFNγ + calpain inhibitor + Me2SO, calpain inhibitor + Me2SO, or IFNγ + Me2SO, to ensure that seeded cells remained in the appropriate stimulant conditions during subsequent phases of the assay. After 22 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoescht. Migrants were quantified by fluorescence microscopy. Transfection of LNCaP Cells with a GFP-Annexin 2 Fusion Construct—LNCaP cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding an annexin 2-GFP fusion protein or with the GFP vector alone as a control, to examine how expression of annexin 2 affected their invasive capacity. A pEGFP-C1 vector-based wild type annexin 2 construct (47Merrifield C.J. Rescher U. Almers W. Proust J. Gerke V. Sechi A.S. Moss S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1136-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was transfected into LNCaP cells using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) twice at 18-h intervals, and cultures demonstrating high GFP and GFP-annexin 2 expression after 48 h were used in the Matrigel invasion assay described above. IFNγ Reduces Cell Surface Expression of Annexin 2—Vectorial labeling with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl derivatives of biotin was combined with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and avidin affinity blotting to study the effect of IFNγ treatment on surface composition in 1542CP3TX prostate cancer cells. IFNγ increased the number of biotinylated proteins and enhanced the membrane density of several surface proteins (Fig. 1A). Relatively few protein spots were down-regulated by IFNγ treatment (upward arrows in Fig. 1A), some because of altered abundance of the individual isoforms in charge trains (white rectangles in Fig. 1A). To identify proteins regulated by IFNγ and achieve optimal representation of hydrophobic and high molecular weight membrane proteins, avidin affinity-purified surface proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE prior to analysis by mass spectrometry (42Hastie C. Saxton M. Akpan A. Cramer R. Masters J.R. Naaby-Hansen S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5905-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although IFNγ increased both the repertoire and abundance of proteins in the avidin-isolated biotinylated membrane fractions, the surface density of an abundant 36-kDa protein was strongly reduced after 72 h of exposure to the cytokine (oblique arrows in Fig. 1B). The protein was identified as annexin 2 by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of peptides generated by trypsinization of the excised Coomassie-stained gel band (Fig. 1C). Densitometry analysis of gel images from three independent experiments revealed that the surface expression of the 36-kDa annexin 2 band was reduced by 4-fold after 72 h of IFNγ treatment. Immunoblotting of avidin-purified biotinylated membrane fractions from treated and untreated 1542CP3TX cells confirmed the identity of the 36-kDa band and the reduction in annexin 2 surface expression induced by IFNγ (inset in Fig. 1C). A 54-kDa protein that was strongly up-regulated in both whole cell extracts and membrane fractions from IFNγ-treated cells (horizontal arrow in Fig. 1B) was identified as interferon-induced protein 53 (IFP53) by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Annexin 2 was readily released from the cell surface by treatment with chelating or high salt dissociation buffers, suggesting that the protein is peripherally bound to the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1). To study the kinetics of annexin 2 down-regulation, EDTA-released membrane fractions were obtained at various times after addition of IFNγ and analyzed by immunoblotting. Although the membrane density of annexin 2 remained high during the first 2hofIFNγ treatment, it was strongly reduced after 4 h (Fig. 1D). Following6hof exposure to IFNγ, annexin 2 was barely detectable in EDTA-released surface fractions from 1542CP3TX cells (Fig. 1D and Fig. 4H). Long term IFNγ treatment did not alter the abundance of annexin 2 in whole cell detergent extracts from 1542CP3TX cells (Fig. 1E). The global expression levels of annexin 2 in the benign prostate epithelial cell line PRE 2.8 and in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 were likewise unaffected by cytokine treatment (supplemental Fig. 2). In accordance with previous findings (48Chetcuti A. Margan S.H. Russell P. Mann S. Millar D.S. Clark S.J. Rogers J. Handelsman D.J. Dong Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6331-6334PubMed Google Scholar), annexin 2 was not detected in LNCaP prostate cancer cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these findings show that IFNγ induces a significant reduction in the membrane density of annexin 2 in 1542CP3TX prostate cancer cells, and that the suppressive effect is specific for peripherally attached surface proteins. IFNγ Alters the Surface Localization of Annexin 2—The effects of IFNγ were next analyzed by surface staining of intact, viable cells. Cholera toxin was used to stain GM1 gangliosides, which are present in high abundance at lipid rafts, and phalloidin was used to stain F-actin after membrane permeabilization. Immunofluorescence staining with an antibody against annexin 2 confirmed that the protein is present on the surface of 1542CP3TX cells and that 24 h of treatment with IFNγ strongly reduces the membrane density of annexin 2 (Fig. 2A). In addition to the reduction in peripheral expression, IFNγ altered the distribution of annexin 2 on the cell surface. Whereas a generalized pattern of annexin 2 staining was observed over the surface of unstimulated cells, IFNγ treatment concentrated the remaining annexin 2 molecules to lipid rafts (Fig. 2A). Whereas the intensity of p11 surface staining also was strongly reduced following 24 h of IFNγ treatment, the localization of p11 remained unaltered closely mirroring that of the cholera toxin-positive lipid raft structures in both treated and untreated cells. 24 h exposure to IFNγ did not reduce the global expression level of p11 (supplemental Fig. 3), indicating that the suppressive effect of the cytokine again is specific for proteins expressed on the cell surface. One possible interpretation of these observations is that annexin 2 exists both as a monomer and in heterotetrameric complex with p11 on the surface of 1542CP3TX cells, and although the monomer binds to membrane lipids outside raft areas and is more susceptible to IFNγ-induced down-regulation, the heterotetramer is situated within the lipid rafts. IFNγ Suppresses the Invasive Capacity of Prostate Cancer Cells—To investigate whether IFNγ treatment affects the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, we compared 1542CP3TX and LNCaP cells in a Biocoat Matrigel invasion chamber assay. LNCaP cells do not express annexin 2 as a result of promoter silencing by hypermethylation (48Chetcuti A. Margan S.H. Russell P. Mann S. Millar D.S. Clark S.J. Rogers J. Handelsman D.J. Dong Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6331-6334PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2). Invasion was significantly reduced (p = 0.029) in 1542CP3TX cells after interferon treatment, but LNCaP cells were unaffected (Fig. 3A). Exposure to an antibody against annexin 2 significantly reduced the number of transmigrating 1542CP3TX cells (Fig. 3B), whereas a similar concentration of mouse IgG, raised against rabbit immunoglobulin, had no effect (Fig. 3C). To confirm that annexin 2 expression influences the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, annexin 2 was expressed in LNCaP cells as a GFP fusion protein. Although the annexin 2-GFP fusion protein was most abundant in the nucleus and cytosol, a peripheral staining pattern indicative of membrane-localized proteins was seen in most of the transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 4). A graphic representation of data from six independent experiments is shown in Fig. 3D, demonstrating a significant increase (p < 0.002) in the invasive capacity of LNCaP cells transfected with annexin 2 compared with empty vector alone. Consistent with the heterotetrameric anx2t complex function as an anchorage and activation site for procathepsin B and plasminogen on cell surfaces (37Mai J. Finley Jr., R.L. Waisman D.M. Sloane B.F.

https://openalex.org/W2016056467,"In a previous study we found that sumoylation of the DNA-binding protein heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is up-regulated during mitosis, but the mechanism that mediates this regulation was unknown. Here we show that HSF2 interacts with the polycomb protein MEL-18, that this interaction decreases during mitosis, and that overexpression and RNA interference-mediated reduction of MEL-18 result in decreased and increased HSF2 sumoylation, respectively. Other results suggest that MEL-18 may also function to inhibit the sumoylation of other cellular proteins. The results also show that MEL-18 is able to interact with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) enzyme UBC9 and that MEL-18 inhibits the ability of UBC9 to transfer the SUMO protein to target proteins. Together, the results in this work suggest a mechanism in which MEL-18 bound to HSF2 inhibits its sumoylation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of UBC9 enzymes in the vicinity of HSF2. These results provide an explanation for how mitotic HSF2 sumoylation is regulated and suggest that MEL-18, in contrast to the sumoylation-stimulating activities of the polycomb protein PC2, actually functions like an anti-SUMO ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), interacting both with HSF2 and the SUMO E2 UBC9 but acting to inhibit UBC9 activity to decrease sumoylation of a target protein, in this case that of HSF2."
https://openalex.org/W2091130037,"In the present study, we tested the role of CD63 in regulating ROMK1 channels by protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). Immunocytochemical staining shows that CD63 and receptor-linked tyrosine phosphatase α (RPTPα) are expressed in the cortical collecting duct and outer medulla collecting duct. Immunoprecipitation of tissue lysates from renal cortex and outer medulla or 293T cells transfected with CD63 reveals that CD63 was associated with RPTPα both in situ and in transfected cells. Expression of CD63 in 293T cells stimulated the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 416 of c-Src but decreased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 527, indicating that expression of CD63 stimulates the activity of c-Src. Furthermore, c-Src was coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPα and CD63 both in 293T cells transfected with CD63 and in lysates prepared from native rat kidney. Potassium restriction had no effect on the expression of RPTPα, but it increased the association between c-Src and RPTPα in the renal cortex and outer medulla. We also used two-electrode voltage clamp to study the effect of CD63 on ROMK channels in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of CD63 had no significant effect on potassium currents in oocytes injected with ROMK1; however, it significantly enhanced the c-Src-induced inhibition of ROMK channels in oocytes injected with ROMK1+c-Src. The effect of CD63 on the c-Src-induced inhibition was not due to a decreased expression of ROMK1 channels, because blocking PTK with herbimycin A abolished the inhibitory effect of c-Src on ROMK channels in oocytes injected with ROMK1+c-Src+CD63. Furthermore, coexpression of CD63 enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1. We conclude that CD63 plays a role in the regulation of ROMK channels through its association with RPTPα, which in turn interacts with and activates Src family PTK, thus reducing ROMK activity.

Tetraspan proteins contain four transmembrane domains and share a common topology as well as a number of highly conserved residues. Members of this large family have been shown to be expressed in a variety of cells, including those of the immune system, epithelial cells, and glial cells (1Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

They have been demonstrated to regulate numerous diverse cell functions through their interactions with a variety of proteins, including protein kinases, growth factor receptors, and membrane transporters (3Odintsova E.

Presumably, the physiological functions of a given tetraspan protein are determined in large measure by its repertoire of interacting proteins. Tetraspan proteins such as CD53 and CD63 have been shown to associate with proteins that have tyrosine phosphatase activity (6Israels S.J. Mcmillan-Ward E.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because proteintyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 2The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphatasePTKprotein-tyrosine kinaseRPTPreceptor-linked tyrosine phosphataseCCDcortical collecting ductOMouter medullaOMCDOM collecting ductGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineKDpotassium-deficientPKCprotein kinase C. can play a key role in activation of PTK (8Östman A. Hellberg C. Öhmer F.D.B Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), these associations have the potential to regulate critical cellular signaling processes. For instance, activation of RPTPα has been reported to stimulate the activation of c-Src by increasing the phosphorylation of c-Src on tyrosine residue 416 and decreasing its phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 527 (9Brandt D.T. Goerke A. Heuer M. Gimona M. Leitges M. Kremmer E. Lammers R. Hallaer H. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34073-34078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that tetraspan proteins could modulate PTK activity through interaction with PTP. We have previously demonstrated that low potassiumintake stimulates Src family PTK activity and expression (10Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J.

Therefore, the first aim of the present study is to explore the role of CD63 in activating c-Src activity, which can be taken as a representative member of non-receptor types of PTK. Also, CD63 has been shown to interact with adaptor proteins of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (13Rous B.A. Reaves B.J. Ihrke G. Briggs J.A.G. Gray S.R. Stephens D.J. Banting G. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol.

The cells were transfected at 50–70% confluency with CD63 DNA by FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer, and they were maintained for an additional 12 h after transfection. For harvesting, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer. Animals and Tissue Preparation—Sprague-Dawley rats (6–8 weeks, either sex) were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). The rats were maintained on either a normal potassium (1.1%) or a potassium-deficient (KD) diet for 7 days. The animals (<90 g) were killed by cervical dislocation, and the kidneys were removed immediately. The animal use protocol was approved by the independent animal use committee of New York Medical College. The renal cortex and OM were dissected and suspended in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitor mixture (1%) (Sigma) was added to the lysis buffer. The tissues were then homogenized and allowed to sit on the ice for an additional 30 min. The tissue sample was subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were measured in duplicate using a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Preparation of Xenopus Oocytes—Xenopus laevis females were obtained from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI). The method for obtaining oocytes has been described previously (16Macica C.M. Yang Y.H. Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F588-F594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viable oocytes were selected for injection with different cRNAs. The oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in a 66% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with freshly added 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The experiments were performed on days 1 and 2 after injection with two-electrode voltage clamp. Two-electrode Voltage Clamping—A Warner oocyte clamp OC-725C was used to measure the whole cell potassium current. Voltage and current microelectrodes were filled with 1000 mm KCl and had resistance of less than 2 mΩ. The current was recorded on a chart recorder (Gould TA240). To exclude leak currents, 2 mm Ba2+ was used to determine the Ba2+-sensitive K+ current. Confocal Microscope—Surface fluorescence detected by confocal microscopy at the equatorial plane of oocytes expressing GFP-tagged ROMK correlates with channel activity and has been used by us to assess channel expression in the plasma membrane (17Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R.M. Huang X.Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7156-7163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser beam and viewed with an inverted Olympus FV300 confocal system equipped with a ×10 oil lens. Scion image software (Scion Co., Frederick, MA) was used to determine the fluorescence intensity. All of the images were acquired and processed with identical parameters. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein was mixed with 4 μg of the relevant antibody and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. Protein A affinity gel was then added and mixed at 4 °C for additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBS. For Western blot, the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immuno-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer and incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C for 12 h. The membrane was washed four times for 5 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for additional 30 min. The membrane was then washed several times and scanned by an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at wavelength of 700–800 nm. Immunostaining—The kidneys were perfused with 50 ml of PBS containing heparin (40 unit/ml) followed by 200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h. A Leica1900 cryostat was used to cut kidney slices that were dried at 42 °C for 1 h. After washing with 1× PBS, the samples were permeabilized with 0.4% Triton dissolved in 1× PBS buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% lysine (pH 7.4) for 15 min. The kidney slices were blocked with 2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with antibodies to ROMK, CD63, and RPTPα for 12 h at 4 °C. The slides were washed with PBS buffer followed by incubation with second antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Experimental Materials and Statistics—Antibodies for RPTPα, AQP2, and CD63 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The phospho-Src (Tyr(P)416) and the phospho-Src(Tyr(P)527) antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), c-Src antibody, and ROMK were obtained from Upstate and Almone (Jerusalem, Israel), respectively. As a negative control, we have also used goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Rockland, Gilbertville, PA). Protein A affinity gel was purchased from Sigma. CD63 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector using the BamHI and XhoI sites. RPTPα cDNA was a gift from Dr. Michael P. Sheetz at Columbia University (18von Wichert G. Jiang G. Kostic A. De Vos K. Sap J. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the means ± S.E. We used one way analysis of variance or paired Student's t test to determine the statistical significance. If the p value is less than 0.05, the difference is considered to be significant. We first used confocal microscopy to examine the expression of CD63 in the kidney. Fig. 1A is an immunocytochemical staining showing that CD63 is widely expressed in both cortex and medulla. To examine whether CD63 is expressed in the ROMK-positive tubules such as thick ascending lim, we conducted the double staining with ROMK and CD63 antibodies. Fig. 1B is a confocal images in OM region showing that CD63 is highly positive in the tubules where ROMK channels are expressed. To demonstrate that CD63 is expressed in the CCD and OMCD, we carried out double staining with CD63 and AQP2 antibodies. From inspection of Fig. 1 (C and D), it is apparent that CD63 is expressed in the CCD (Fig. 1C) and OMCD (Fig. 1D) as indicated by AQP2-positive staining. Fig. 1C has also shown that CD63 is expressed in some proximal tubules. CD63 has been shown to associate with proteins that have tyrosine phosphatase activity (19Carmo A.M. Wright M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined whether CD63 is associated with tyrosine phosphatases such as RPTPα, which has been shown to be expressed in several nephron segments including thick ascending lim and CCD (20Kaneko T. Moriyama T. Imai E. Akagi Y. Arai M. Inoue T. Xia C. Noguchi T. Kamada T. Ueda N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1102-F1108PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether RPTPα protein is expressed in the collecting duct. Fig. 1 demonstrates that RPTPα is expressed in the CCD (Fig. 1E) and OMCD (Fig. 1F). Thus, these results indicate that CD63, ROMK channels, and RPTPα are coexpressed together in the epithelial cells of the CCD and OMCD. We then tested the possibility that CD63 may be associated with RPTPα by performing immunoprecipitation experiments. There are two forms of RPTPα with molecular masses of 100 and 130 kDa. The 100-kDa RPTPα represents phosphatase that is exclusively N-glycosylated, whereas the 130-kDa RPTPα contains both N- and O-linked carbohydrates. However, both forms exhibit similar enzymatic activities (21Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot detected only a 100-kDa form of RPTPα in the renal cortex and OM (Fig. 2A). We performed immunoprecipitations from tissue lysates of renal cortex and outer medulla using CD63 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and probed by Western blotting with RPTPα antibody. Fig. 2A shows a Western blot demonstrating that a 100-kDa protein band was detected by RPTPα antibody in the CD63 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that RPTPα was associated with CD63. This possibility was also supported by the experiments in which immunoprecipitation of tissue lysate with antibody directed against RPTPα was able to pull down CD63. Fig. 2B shows a Western blot demonstrating that CD63 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPα antibody. These results were not obtained in nonimmune IgG control immunoprecipitations. Therefore, our results indicate that CD63 interacts with RPTPα in the rat kidney. We then extended the study by examining the interaction between CD63 and RPTPα in 293T cells transfected with CD63. The cells were harvested and lysed 24 h after transfection, which was followed by immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with antibody directed against RPTPα. As shown in Fig. 2C, CD63 protein was also immunoprecipitated with RPTPα antibody from the transfected 293 cells. Because RPTPα has been shown to activate Src family PTK (22Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we speculated that expression of CD63 might stimulate the activity of PTK through its association with RPTPα. This hypothesis was tested by examining the phosphorylation of c-Src on tyrosine residues 416 and 527, respectively, It is well established that increased c-Src activity is associated with an enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 416 or decreased phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 527 (23Harrison S.C. Cell. 2001; 112: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 is a Western blot showing the effect of CD63 expression on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 416 (Fig. 3A) and 527 of c-Src (Fig. 3B). The data summarized in Fig. 3C show that the expression of CD63 significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 416 (2.5 ± 0.5-fold over the control, n = 5), whereas it decreased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 527 by 35 ± 5% (n = 4, p < 0.05). After showing that expression of CD63 stimulates c-Src activity, we then explored the possibility that CD63 stimulates the activity of c-Src through its association with RPTPα, which could activate c-Src by dephosphorylating tyrosine residue 527. Thus, we immunoprecipitated the lysates of 293T cells transfected with CD63 to determine whether RPTPα is able to associate with c-Src. Fig. 4A is a Western blot showing that c-Src was coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPα in cells transfected with CD63. To explore the possibility that CD63, RPTPα, and c-Src form a triplex, we conducted immunoprecipitation to determine whether c-Src is also associated with CD63 in 293T cells transfected with CD63. Fig. 4B is a Western blot demonstrating that CD63 is also coimmunoprecipitated with c-Src. We then examined whether CD63 is also associated with c-Src and RPTPα in the rat kidney. The tissue lysates from renal cortex and outer medulla (mixture) were immunoprecipitated with RPTPα antibody, followed by electrophoresis. Fig. 4C is a Western blot showing that c-Src was clearly coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPα in the renal cortex and OM (mixture) of rats fed a potassium-deficient diet, which stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK channels (24Lin D.H. Sterling H. Lerea K.M. Welling P. Jin L. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F671-F677Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, immunoprecipitation of renal tissue with CD63 antibody also reveals the association between CD63 and c-Src in rats on a KD diet (Fig. 4D). Thus, CD63, c-Src, and RPTP also form a triplex in the rat kidney. We then examined whether the dietary potassium intake affected the association among CD63, c-Src, and RPTPα. Fig. 5A is a Western blot showing that the association between RPTPα and c-Src is significantly decreased in renal cortex and outer medulla (mixture) in rats on a normal potassium intake diet. Potassium depletion increased the association between RPTPα and c-Src by 3.5 ± 0.6-fold. The increased association of c-Src with RPTPα was not the result of an augmented expression of RPTPα, because the expression of RPTPα was not altered by dietary potassium intake (Fig. 5B). In contrast, potassium intake did not affect the association between RPTPα and CD63 (Fig. 5C). Thus, the dietary potassium intake specifically increases the association between c-Src and RPTPα. If CD63 stimulates c-Src activity through an association with RPTPα, it is conceivable that expression of CD63 should modulate the effect of c-Src on ROMK1 channels, which are known to be substrates of c-Src (24Lin D.H. Sterling H. Lerea K.M. Welling P. Jin L. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F671-F677Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of CD63 on potassium current in oocytes injected with ROMK1 using two-electrode voltage clamp. Oocytes were injected with water (negative control), CD63 (5 ng), ROMK1 (5 ng), ROMK1+CD63, ROMK1+c-Src (5 ng), and ROMK1+c-Src+CD63. We confirmed the previous finding (19Carmo A.M. Wright M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that injection of c-Src significantly decreased the potassium current from 11 ± 1.4 to 6 ± 0.5 μA (n = 66 from five frogs). Although injection of CD63 had no effect on the potassium current in oocytes injected with ROMK1 in the absence of c-Src (n = 36 from 4 frogs), it significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of c-Src. The data summarized in Fig. 5A show that injection of CD63 decreased potassium current in oocytes injected with ROMK1+c-Src+CD63 from 11 ± 1.4 to 3 ± 0.3 μA, a value that was significantly lower than that in oocytes injected ROMK1+c-Src. The interpretation that CD63 enhanced the effect of c-Src on ROMK1 through stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation was further confirmed by examining the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1. We transfected 293T cells with GFP-ROMK1 (5 ng), GFP-ROMK1+c-Src (5 ng), or GFP-ROMK1+c-Src+CD63 (5 ng) and harvested ROMK protein by immunoprecipitation with GFP antibody. Fig. 5B is a Western blot showing that expression of c-Src increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 by 350 ± 60% and that coexpression of CD63 further enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK by 72 ± 10% (n = 5 experiments) as determined by Western blotting using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation is expected to stimulate the internalization of ROMK1 channels. This notion is supported by experiments in which confocal microscopy was used to examine the fluorescence intensity in oocytes injected with GFP-ROMK1 (R1), R1+c-Src, and CD63+c-Src+R1. From inspection of Fig. 6C, it is apparent that expression of c-Src decreased surface fluorescence intensity by 55 ± 10% and that coexpression of CD63 causes a further reduction of fluorescence intensity to 20 ± 5% (n = 8) of the control value. If the effect of CD63 on ROMK1 channels was due to facilitating the effect of c-Src on ROMK1 channels by stimulating association between RPTP and c-Src, overexpression of RPTPα should enhance the inhibitory effect of c-Src on ROMK channels. Thus, we examined the effect of c-Src on ROMK1 channels in the presence and absence of RPTPα. The data summarized in Fig. 6D show that injection of c-Src decreased ROMK1 channel activity by 60 ± 10% (n = 8, p < 0.01) and that coinjection of 10 ng of RPTPα further decreased the potassium current to 40 ± 6% of the control value (n = 8). The notion that CD63 enhances Src family PTK activity was further supported by the experiments in which the effect of herbimycin A on the potassium current in oocytes injected with ROMK1+c-Src + CD63 was measured. Fig. 7 summarizes the results showing that application of herbimycin A (2 μm) abolished the effect of c-Src on ROMK1 channels in oocytes injected with either c-Src or CD63+c-Src. Expression of c-Src (2.5 ng) decreased potassium current from 7.1 ± 0.6 to 4.4 ± 0.5 μA in oocytes injected with 2.5 ng of ROMK1 (n = 17 from three frogs), and the potassium currents falls from 7.3 ± 0.8 to 2.7 ± 0.5 μA in oocytes injected with ROMK1 (2.5 ng)+ c-Src (2.5 ng) + CD63 (2.5 ng) (n = 18 from three frogs). However, inhibition of PTK restored the potassium current to 6.5 ± 0.8 (n = 17) and 6 ± 0.7 μA (n = 24) in oocytes injected with ROMK1+c-Src and ROMK1+c-Src+Cd63, respectively. This suggests that the effect of CD63 on ROMK1 channels is the result of enhancing the PTK-induced inhibition of ROMK1 channels. In the present study, we have demonstrated that CD63 is expressed in the CCD and can be involved in the regulation of ROMK channels. CD63 has a tyrosine-based internalization motif in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail and has been shown to interact with adaptor protein complexes such as AP-2 and AP-3 (13Rous B.A. Reaves B.J. Ihrke G. Briggs J.A.G. Gray S.R. Stephens D.J. Banting G. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because AP-2 and AP-3 are involved in facilitating the clathrin-mediated endocytosis, it is possible that CD63 could be directly involved in the internalization of its membrane protein partners. Indeed, CD63 has been shown to bind directly to the β-subunit of the H-K-ATPase in parietal cells of the rat stomach and to be involved in the regulation of H-K-ATPase trafficking (7Duffield A. Kamsteeg E.J. Brown A.N. Pagel P. Caplan M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15560-15565Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CD63 appears to stimulate the internalization of the H-K-ATPase. Although we could not completely exclude the possibility that CD63 is directly involved in the internalization of ROMK, this notion was not supported by the finding that CD63 did not affect ROMK channel activity in the absence of c-Src. Also, we did not detect a direct association between the ROMK channel and CD63 in the kidney. 3W.-H. Wang, unpublished observation. However, we could not completely exclude the possibility that CD63 regulates ROMK channels through direct association. But it is safe to conclude that one way by which CD63 regulates ROMK channels is through interacting with RPTPα and c-Src. The notion that CD63 enhances the inhibitory effect of c-Src on ROMK1 is supported by three lines of evidence: 1) CD63 significantly decreased potassium currents only in oocytes injected with c-Src, but it had no effect on the activity of ROMK1 channels in the absence of c-Src; 2) c-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 was larger in CD63-transfected cells than non-CD63-transfected cells; and 3) inhibition of PTK completely abolished the effect of c-Src on ROMK1 channels in both CD63 or non-CD63 injected oocytes. Thus, our results suggest that CD63 regulates ROMK1 channels by stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 mediated by Src family PTK. We speculate that injection of c-Src stimulates the association between c-Src and unidentified endogenous PTP, which interacts also with CD63. Although we could not determine the type of PTP that interacts with c-Src and CD63 in the oocytes, the finding that c-Src, CD63, and RPTPα form a triplex in the kidney and 293T cells shed a light into the mechanism by which CD63 enhances the effect of c-Src on ROMK channels in oocytes. The mechanism by which CD63 enhances the inhibitory effect of c-Src on ROMK1 channels is most likely through its association with RPTPα. As consequence, RPTPα activates c-Src by dephosphorylation of tyrosine residue 527 in the C terminus of c-Src. This possibility is supported by four lines evidence: 1) CD63 and RPTPα are expressed in the CCD, which plays an important role in the regulation of renal potassium secretion (26Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F821-F825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) CD63 is coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPα and CD63 in the kidney and in 293T cells transfected with CD63; 3) RPTPα is coimmunoprecipitated with c-Src in the kidney; and 4) expression of CD63 decreases the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 527, whereas it increases the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 416. Thus, our study suggests that CD63 plays an important role in activating Src family PTK and the phosphorylation of ROMK channels through an association directly with RPTPα. A large body of evidence has suggested that tetraspan proteins are involved in transmembrane signal transduction. It has been reported that immunoprecipitation from cell lysates of lymph nodes and thymoma cells with antibodies directed against CD53 and CD63 reveals that immunocomplexes contain tyrosine phosphatase activity, which is able to dephosphorylate the tyrosine kinase LcK (19Carmo A.M. Wright M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CD63 has been reported to associate with Src family PTK such as Lyn in neutrophils (28Skubitz K.M. Campbell K.D. Lida J. Skubitz A.P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3617-3626PubMed Google Scholar). Tetraspan proteins have also been shown to associate with activated protein kinase C (PKC) through integrins, which are constitutively associated with tetraspan proteins such as CD81 and CD53 (5Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The formation of these triple complexes is essential to signal transduction from the extracellular matrix to intracellular space in fibrosarcoma cells. Therefore, we speculate that the formation of a complex among CD63, RPTPα, and Src family PTK could play an important role in activating PTK in the renal tubules such as CCD. Our previous study has demonstrated that potassium restriction increased the activity of PTK and the expression of Src family PTK (12Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which low potassium intake stimulates the activity of PTK is not understood. In the present study, we have demonstrated that association between c-Src and RPTPα was enhanced in the kidney from rats on a low potassium intake. Thus, it is possible that increased interaction between the phosphatase and PTK such as c-Src could be partially responsible for the stimulation of PTK induced by low potassium intake. Because low potassium intake did not affect the association between CD63 and RPTPα, whereas it enhanced the interaction between RPTPα and c-Src, we speculate that CD63 may constitutively associate with RPTPα in the cell membrane. However, the association between RPTPα and Src family PTK is enhanced by potassium restriction. As a consequence of an increased interaction between the RPTPα and Src family PTK, the PTK activity increased. It has been well established that RPTPα plays an important role in the activation of Src family PTK (8Östman A. Hellberg C. Öhmer F.D.B Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). For instance, RPTPα activates Src family PTK, which is essential for initiating the integrin signaling and cell migration in fibroblast cells (29Zeng L. Si X. Yu W.P. Le H.T. Ng K.P. Teng R.M. Ryan K. Wang D.Z. Ponniah S. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The association between RPTPα and Src family PTK has also been reported in mouse brain (22Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which RPTPα stimulates PTK activity has been demonstrated to involve PKCδ, which phosphorylates RPTPα and increases its activity (9Brandt D.T. Goerke A. Heuer M. Gimona M. Leitges M. Kremmer E. Lammers R. Hallaer H. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34073-34078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have shown that low potassium intake stimulates the expression of PKCϵ (30Sterling H. Lin D.H. Chen Y.J. Wei Y. Wang Z.J. Lai J. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1072-F1078Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that PKC may be partially involved in activation of PTK during the potassium restriction. This speculation is supported by the previous observation that inhibition of PKC attenuates the inhibitory effect of stimulating PTK on ROMK channels in the CCD (30Sterling H. Lin D.H. Chen Y.J. Wei Y. Wang Z.J. Lai J. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1072-F1078Google Scholar). ROMK1 channels play an important role in renal potassium secretion in the connecting tubule and the CCD (27Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Flagg T.P.

Wang W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 319-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated in a previous study that ROMK1 channel is a substrate of Src family PTK and that tyrosine residue 337 in the C terminus of ROMK1 is one major site of tyrosine phosphorylation (24Lin D.H. Sterling H. Lerea K.M. Welling P. Jin L. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F671-F677Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to inhibit the ROMK channel activity. The inhibitory effect of PTK on ROMK channel is due to stimulation of channel endocytosis (15Lin D.H. Sterling H. Yang B. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F881-F892Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) because expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin abolished the inhibitory effect of c-Src completely (37Sterling H. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Dong K. Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4317-4323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 is regulated by dietary potassium intake such that potassium restriction significantly increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK channels (12Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potassium depletion-induced increase in the internalization of ROMK channels has also been reported by other investigators (14Chu P.Y. Quigley R. Babich V. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1179-F1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because CD63 plays a role in the stimulation of Src family PTK, we speculate that CD63 and other tetraspan proteins are involved in the regulation of renal potassium secretion. Fig. 8 is a model illustrating the role of CD63 in the regulation of ROMK channels. According to this scenario, potassium restriction enhances the formation of a complex among CD63, RPTPα, and c-Src and thus activates Src family PTK, which in turn inhibits ROMK channels by tyrosine phosphorylation. In this model, c-Src is associated with RPTPα. However, it is possible that c-Src could also simultaneously interact with CD63 and RPTPα. In addition, although it is not known how ROMK channels interact with the triple complex, it is conceivable that ROMK channels must be in close proximity to the CD63-cSrc-RPTPα complex. It has been reported that CD63 and c-Src are highly concentrated in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (25Heijnen H.F. Van Lier M. Waaijenborg S. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Waheed A.A. Inomata M. Gorter G. Mobius W. Akkerman J.W. Slot J.W. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 6: 1173Google Scholar). In addition, tetraspan proteins including CD63 interact with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase to form large complexes in lipid raft-like microdomains of cells (4Class C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that ROMK channels may also be enriched in the cholesterol-rich lipid raft, which facilitates interaction of PTK with ROMK channels. In conclusion, CD63 plays a role in the regulation of ROMK channels through the formation of a triple complex among RPTPα, Src family PTK, and tetraspan proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2116477728,"Cell migration is a highly complex process, regulated by multiple genes, signaling pathways and external stimuli. To discover genes or pharmacological agents that can modulate the migratory activity of cells, screening strategies that enable the monitoring of diverse migratory parameters in a large number of samples are necessary.In the present study, we describe the development of a quantitative, high-throughput cell migration assay, based on a modified phagokinetic tracks (PKT) procedure, and apply it for identifying novel pro-migratory genes in a cancer-related gene library. In brief, cells are seeded on fibronectin-coated 96-well plates, covered with a monolayer of carboxylated latex beads. Motile cells clear the beads, located along their migratory paths, forming tracks that are visualized using an automated, transmitted-light screening microscope. The tracks are then segmented and characterized by multi-parametric, morphometric analysis, resolving a variety of morphological and kinetic features.In this screen we identified 4 novel genes derived from breast carcinoma related cDNA library, whose over-expression induces major alteration in the migration of the stationary MCF7 cells. This approach can serve for high throughput screening for novel ways to modulate cellular migration in pathological states such as tumor metastasis and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2078949915,"Transcription factor GATA-2 is vital for both hematopoietic progenitor cell function and urogenital patterning. Transgenic mapping studies have shown that the hematopoietic and urogenital enhancers are located hundreds of kbp 5′ and 3′ to the Gata2 structural gene, and both are vital for embryonic development. Because the size of mammalian genes, including all of their associated regulatory elements, can exceed a megabase, transgenic complementation in mice has, in specific instances, proven to be a formidable hurdle. After incorporating the Gata2 structural gene as well as the distant hematopoietic and urogenital enhancers into a single, contiguous piece of DNA by fusing two bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) into one, we formally tested the hypothesis that the functional boundaries of this locus are contained within this contiguous genomic span. We show that two independent lines of transgenic mice bearing a multicopy 413-kbp-linked Gata2 BAC transgene (bearing sequences from –187 to +226 kbp of the locus) are able to fully rescue Gata2 null mutant embryonic lethality and that the rescued animals behave and reproduce normally. Surprisingly, the linked BAC confers expression in the ureteric epithelium, whereas sequences within any of the overlapping parental BACs and a yeast artificial chromosome that were originally tested do not, and thus these experiments also define a novel synthetic enhancer activity that has not been previously described. These genetic complementation studies define the required outer limits of the Gata2 locus and formally demonstrate that enhancers lying beyond those boundaries are not necessary for Gata2-regulated viability or fecundity.

Transcription factor GATA-2 is exemplary of a vital developmental factor whose regulation reveals many of the intricacies of the controlling apparatus that is required for proper temporal and tissue-specific expression of a gene in many different tissues and organs that are critical for mammalian development. The evolutionarily conserved C4 zinc finger GATA transcription factors play demonstrably crucial roles in embryogenesis. GATA-2, originally cloned from a chicken cDNA library (1Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), was shown to be essential for the proliferation and/or differentiation of early hematopoietic progenitors, as Gata2 null mutant mice die around mid-gestation from a block in primitive hematopoiesis (2Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Further examination of Gata2 gain-of-function mice and in vitro differentiation of Gata2 null mutant ES cells underscored the fundamental conclusions from the initial loss of function experiments, and showed that GATA-2 plays a pivotal role in the proliferation of very early hematopoietic progenitors (3Briegel K. Lim K.C. Plank C. Beug H. Engel J.D. Zenke M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1097-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 4Kitajima K. Masuhara M. Era T. Enver T. Nakano T.

We showed several years ago that Gata2 null mutant embryonic lethality could be rescued by complementation with a 247-kbp transgenic yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) 3The abbreviations used are: YACyeast artificial chromosomeBACbacterial artificial chromosomeGFPgreen fluorescent proteinQ-PCRquantitative PCR. 3The abbreviations used are: YACyeast artificial chromosomeBACbacterial artificial chromosomeGFPgreen fluorescent proteinQ-PCRquantitative PCR. bearing sequences from –174 to +73 kbp (revised endpoints relative to the Gata2 translational initiation site); the YAC contains all of the regulatory information required to rescue Gata2 function in primitive and definitive hematopoiesis (6Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J. Minegishi N. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that Gata2 hematopoietic regulatory activity is conferred by at least two distinct cooperative cis elements, one lying about 170 kbp 5′ to the gene and another lying somewhere between 40 and 100 kbp 5′. 4N. Suwabe, R. Shimizu, T. Moriguchi, and J. D. Engel, unpublished observations. 4N. Suwabe, R. Shimizu, T. Moriguchi, and J. D. Engel, unpublished observations. However, compound mutant mice bearing this YAC, but lacking endogenous Gata2, expired perinatally of kidney failure and uretero-vesicular obstruction, because the YAC-rescued Gata2 null mutant mice failed to develop a patent connection between the ureters and the bladder, causing the mice to develop cystic, non-functional kidneys and megaureters (6Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J. Minegishi N. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because the rescuing YAC was not expressed in the urogenital system, while endogenous GATA-2 is prominently expressed there, we speculated that the development of hydroureters and cystic kidneys was due to the absence of tissue-specific enhancers that were responsible for directing proper Gata2-mediated patterning of the developing urogenital system in the YAC transgene. yeast artificial chromosome bacterial artificial chromosome green fluorescent protein quantitative PCR. yeast artificial chromosome bacterial artificial chromosome green fluorescent protein quantitative PCR. Several years ago, we devised a BAC transgenic founder mapping strategy (BAC-traps) that ultimately revealed the positions of the regulatory elements that control Gata2 expression in the developing urogenital system (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One cis element, responsible for Gata2 activation in the ureteric epithelium, was not specifically localized, but was predicted to lie very far, either upstream or downstream, from the structural gene. However, two enhancers that were finely localized are responsible for mesenchymal expression: one (UG2, located +113 kbp 3′ to the translational initiation site) controls Gata2 activation in the rostral metanephric mesenchyme, whereas a second (UG4, centered at +75 kbp) is responsible for Gata2 activation in the caudal periureteric mesenchyme and urogenital sinus. We have now regionally or precisely localized about a dozen individual cis elements that are required for Gata2 expression, including two hematopoietic (6Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J. Minegishi N. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), two central nervous system (8Zhou Y. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Development. 2000; 127: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one endothelial (9Khandekar M. Brandt W. Zhou Y. Dagenais S. Glover T.W. Suzuki N. Shimizu R. Yamamoto M. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Development. 2007; 134: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and three urogenital enhancers (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as well as the two Gata2 promoters (10Minegishi N. Ohta J. Suwabe N. Nakauchi H. Ishihara H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3625-3634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); these individual elements are scattered over 400 kbp 5′ and 3′ to (as well as within) the Gata2 structural gene. However, dozens of other elements must deductively exist, because Gata2 is involved in many other quite diverse organotypic developmental events (e.g. for the generation of placental trophoblasts, fat, and pituitary subtype specification (11Ma G.T.

Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1999; 97: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)), and indeed, our initial BAC-trap surveys demonstrated that other Gata2 enhancers lie even further away (e.g. a whisker follicle enhancer that maps to between +560 and +787 kbp 3′ to Gata2 (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). To determine whether the Gata2 urogenital enhancers that were identified in the initial BAC-trap survey defined the required functional domains of gene activity that are responsible for proper ureter/bladder morphogenesis, in this study we created a transgene that would recapitulate the expression of Gata2 in both the hematopoietic as well as the urogenital compartments. Although YACs have been generated that contain genomic inserts of the size required, numerous technical problems with YACs have also come to light, including chimerism (6Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J. Minegishi N. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Larionov V. Kouprina N. Nikolaishvili N. Resnick M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4154-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and innate replicative instability (15Kouprina N. Nikolaishvili N. Graves J. Koriabine M. Resnick M.A. Larionov V. Genomics. 1999; 56: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). BACs, while surmounting many of the problems encountered with YACs, posed a different problem, because the average genomic DNA insert size in BACs is only ∼200 kbp (16Osoegawa K. Tateno M. Woon P.Y. Frengen E. Mammoser A.G. Catanese J.J. Hayashizaki Y. de Jong P.J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 116-128PubMed Google Scholar), which is insufficient in this case to span the interval between the most distant Gata2 hematopoietic (–170 kbp) and urogenital (+113 kbp) enhancers. To circumvent the size limitation of BACs, we devised a new general strategy to precisely link two BACs together to generate a single recombinant that contained a very large but stable genomic DNA fragment. Generation of mice bearing this BAC were predicted to create a transgene spanning the entire interval between the distant enhancer elements that were either known (hematopoietic) or suspected (urogenital) of being required for Gata2 function. Following breeding between Gata2 BAC transgenic mice and Gata2 germ line null mutant mice, we were able to formally test whether complementation of both the hematopoietic and urogenital functions would fully rescue Gata2 null mutants. Alternatively, complementation with the linked BAC might only partially rescue, and thereby reveal novel Gata2 mutant phenotypes due to as yet undiscovered enhancers that lie beyond the boundaries of the linked BAC. The present experiments revealed that rescue of the Gata2 null mutant phenotype with a 413-kbp linked BAC was complete using either of two independent rescuing BAC transgenic lines. Both lines allowed animals to survive to adulthood, and the rescued mice exhibited no obvious behavioral or reproductive anomalies. Therefore, we can place outer boundaries on the size of the Gata2 locus, including all sequences that are required to fulfill its most vital developmental functions. These data suggest that documented enhancers that lie outside these boundaries are either unnecessary for vital GATA-2-mediated physiological functions in some tissues where that factor is expressed, or that those functions are fully complemented by other molecules. BACs—BACs spanning the mouse Gata2 locus were identified (16Osoegawa K. Tateno M. Woon P.Y. Frengen E. Mammoser A.G. Catanese J.J. Hayashizaki Y. de Jong P.J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 116-128PubMed Google Scholar), purified (17Marra M.A. Kucaba T.A. Dietrich N.L. Green E.D. Brownstein B. Wilson R.K. McDonald K.M. Hillier L.W. McPherson J.D. Waterston R.H. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1072-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and modified (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as previously described. Construction of Specialized Recombineering Plasmids—plox514Neo: Two loxP514 sites (18Siegel R.W. Jain R. Bradbury A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with convenient cloning sites were created. lox514nx oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S1) were annealed and digested with NotI and XbaI and then cloned into the EagI and SpeI sites of the pFrtNeo plasmid. The resulting plasmid was digested with PstI and EcoRI and ligated to annealed lox514 pm oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S1), which had been digested with NsiI and MfeI. The resulting plasmid, plox514Neo, was verified by sequencing and then used as a template for the generation of the BAC targeting constructs. pFrtAmp: to generate a plasmid containing the Frt-flanked ampicillin gene, we used Famp oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S1) containing Frt sites, sequences complementary to the pUC19 AmpR gene and convenient cloning sites. Using these primers, the AmpR gene was amplified from pUC19 by PCR, gel-purified, and digested with BamH1 and EcoR1. This fragment was cloned into the BamH1/EcoR1 sites of pIRES2-eGFP vector (Clontech). The fragment was sequenced to verify correct generation of the flanking Frt sites. Tn5FlpeTet: a plasmid that constitutively expresses Flp recombinase was generated in a manner similar to that described by Liu et al. (19Liu P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Generation of Targeting Constructs by PCR—To generate the bacterial targeting constructs, synthetic oligonucleotides were used as outlined in previous experiments (20Lee E.C. Yu D. Martinez de Velasco J. Tessarollo L. Swing D.A. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Targeting fragments were generated by PCR with ExTaq (Takara), purified from agarose using GenecleanII (Q-biogene), and digested with DpnI to remove (methylated) template DNA. 100–200 ng of targeting fragment was used in each experiment. To generate single lox sites, the same primers (supplemental Table S1) were used to amplify a targeting fragment containing tandem lox sites. After insertion of this fragment into the BAC by homologous recombination, induction of cre recombinase resulted in deletion of the intervening selection marker, leaving a single loxP site incorporated at the point of selectable marker insertion. cre Recombinase Induction—The EL350 strain was used for cre recombinase induction, as previously described (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because the frequency of recombination between loxP and loxP511 or loxP514 sites is finite, varying the duration of cre induction was used to optimize recovery of the desired homologous recombination product. Modification of Parental BACs 115E9 and 81F7—To generate the 5′ BAC, homologous recombination was used to insert a loxP514 site ∼13 kbp upstream of the Gata2 translational initiation site. Simultaneously, this insertion was designed to delete a loxP site in the pBACe3.6 vector backbone by directing the 3′ homologous recombination to position 4862 of the vector sequence (21Frengen E. Weichenhan D. Zhao B. Osoegawa K. van Geel M. de Jong P.J. Genomics. 1999; 58: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primers (–13lox514(f) and bacdellox(r); supplemental Table S1) and the template plasmid plox514Neo were used for PCR to generate a targeting fragment, which was then used to modify the 115E9 BAC by homologous recombination. The neomycin gene that was used as the positive selection marker was removed by cre induction, leaving a single loxP514 site at –13 kbp, and at the same time deleting the loxP site in the vector backbone. The resulting BAC was further modified to include an Frt-flanked PGK-directed neomycin resistance gene for positive selection. BacNeo primers (supplemental Table S1) were used to generate a targeting fragment by PCR using the pFrtNeo plasmid as template. The resulting fragment was then inserted into the 115E9lox BAC by homologous recombination. To generate the 3′ BAC, a loxP514 site was again inserted 13 kbp upstream of the Gata2 translational start site, at the same position that was modified in BAC 115E9. The –13lox514 forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table S1) and the ploxP514 plasmid were used to generate a fragment that was subsequently inserted into the 81F7 BAC by homologous recombination. The neomycin gene was again removed by cre induction, leaving a single loxP514 site at the –13 kbp position. This BAC was further modified to insert an Frt-flanked ampicillin resistance gene to allow for selection of products that had undergone intermolecular recombination. This was achieved by using Famp2977 and Famp4233 primers (supplemental Table S1) together with the FrtAmp plasmid to generate a targeting fragment that was then inserted into 81F7lox BAC by homologous recombination, and in doing so, inserted the FrtAmp cassette between positions 2977 and 4233 of the pBACe3.6 vector backbone (21Frengen E. Weichenhan D. Zhao B. Osoegawa K. van Geel M. de Jong P.J. Genomics. 1999; 58: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). cre-mediated BAC Recombination—To join the two modified BACs, Escherichia coli EL350 bearing the 115E9loxNeo BAC was grown in overnight culture. After diluting the culture 1:10 and allowing it to grow for 10 min, arabinose was added to 1 mg/ml before growing the culture for an additional 2 h. The cells were made competent for transformation (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and then electroporated with the 81F7loxAmp BAC; recombinants were selected on Cam/Kan/Amp plates. Homologous recombination was verified by HindIII fingerprinting, as well as by P1-SceI digestion and pulsed field gel electrophoresis under the conditions: 6 V/cm, linear ramp switch time (10–50 s) 24 h at 14 °C (Fig. 1C). Verification of Homologous Recombination—To verify recovery of the correct recombination products by Southern blot analyses, three probes from different regions of the recombined BAC were employed. A 5′ Nco/Spe probe fragment corresponding to –173.9 kbp of the Gata2 locus, which was predicted to yield a restriction fragment of 3.9 kbp only from the parental 115E9 BAC and the recombinants, was hybridized to HindIII-digested BAC DNAs (Fig. 1E). To generate a –13 kbp probe, a 600-bp fragment was generated by PCR from the 81F7 BAC using the G2–13 primers (supplemental Table S1). Using this probe and digesting the BACs with PmeI and PvuI was predicted to yield a 5-kbp restriction fragment in the case of the 115E9 parental BAC, or a 10-kbp fragment after appropriate recombination at the loxP514 site (Fig. 1F). For the 3′ probe, a 900-bp fragment corresponding to a position +200 kbp (relative to the Gata2 translational initiation site) was generated by PCR from the 81F7 BAC using G2 + 200 primers (supplemental Table S1). Digestion with HindIII followed by hybridization with this probe was predicted to yield a 7-kbp band from the 81F7 parental BAC as well as the homologous recombinants but not hybridize to the 115E9 BAC (Fig. 1G). Flp-mediated Removal of the Neomycin Selection Cassette—Because the neomycin resistance gene carries a eukaryotic promoter, it was removed from the linked BAC to avoid possible promoter interference effects. To accomplish this, the Tn5FlpeTet plasmid was transformed into bacteria carrying the linked BAC (R, Fig. 1B), which were then grown on plates containing Cam/Kan/Amp/Tet. The Tn5FlpeTet plasmid constitutively expresses Flp recombinase, which catalyzed excision of the Neo gene. To subsequently eliminate this plasmid from the bacteria bearing the linked BAC, we used nickel ion-based counterselection, because bacteria that are tetracycline-resistant are sensitive to nickel death (22Podolsky T. Fong S.T. Lee B.T. Plasmid. 1996; 36: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We reasoned that growth in L-broth containing NiSO4 would select for the rare bacteria that had lost the Tn5FlpeTet plasmid during cell division. Cam/Kan/Amp/Tet colonies were grown in 5 ml of L-broth plus Cam for 3 h, at which time NiSO4 was added to 5 mm. The cultures were grown until turbid and then streaked onto Tet/Cam, Kan/Cam/Amp, and Cam plates. Cultures that showed slower growth on Tet/Cam and Kan/Cam/Amp plates versus Cam plates were replica-spotted onto Cam and Kan/Cam plates to verify loss of neomycin resistance. Miniprep DNA from the resulting CamR/KanS clones was verified by HindIII restriction digest, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot analyses as described above. Transgenic and Knock-out Mice—BACs were purified by double banding on CsCl/EtBr gradients and then the purified supercoiled DNA was microinjected into oocytes as previously described (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Gata2 EII-KI mice have been previously described (23Suzuki N. Ohneda O. Minegishi N. Nishikawa M. Ohta T. Takahashi S. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Embryos were harvested and prepared as previously described (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Purified rat anti-chicken GATA-2 monoclonal antibody, RC1.1 (1:10) (6Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which is cross-reactive with murine GATA-2, was added along with an anti-green fluorescent protein (anti-GFP) antibody (Molecular Probes, A11122, 1:2000) to the embryo sections, which were then incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day the RC1.1 antibody was detected using a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), whereas the anti-GFP antibody was detected using Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Both secondary antibodies were incubated at 1:200 for 1 h. Finally the sections were treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were recorded electronically and merged as previously described (7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Linking BACs—In this strategy, we first identified two overlapping BACs, which together encompass the complete structural gene as well as the regulatory domains required for Gata2 hematopoietic and urogenital expression (6Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J. Minegishi N. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Khandekar M. Suzuki N. Lewton J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10263-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), from BAC library RPMI-23. The selected parental BACs, 115E9 (P1) and 81F7 (P2), bear genomic sequences from –187 to –10 kbp and from –34 to +226 kbp of the Gata2 locus, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). To fuse the two BACs precisely in register, we employed cre-mediated homologous recombination to exploit the documented differential recombination efficiency between homologous versus heterologous loxP sequences (24Hoess R.H. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A single loxP514 site (yellow arrow, Fig. 1B), which is distinct from the loxP511 sites (green arrows, Fig. 1B) in the pBACe3.6 vector backbone (21Frengen E. Weichenhan D. Zhao B. Osoegawa K. van Geel M. de Jong P.J. Genomics. 1999; 58: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was inserted at –13 kbp (relative to the Gata2 start codon) of the Gata2 locus in both BACs, P1 and P2. Next, Frt-flanked antibiotic resistance markers (neomycin or ampicillin) were introduced at the 5′ end of P1 or at the 3′ end of P2, respectively, to facilitate drug selection of intermolecular recombinants. The electroporation of P1 into P2-harboring bacteria, in conjunction with cre recombinase induction in the E. coli EL350 strain, led to simultaneous loxP514/514 and loxP511/511 homologous recombination in trans (Fig. 1B, gray bars) and the insertion of Gata2 genomic DNA from P1 into P2, thus generating the 413 kbp (from –187 to +226 kbp of the Gata2 locus) recombinant BAC (R, Fig. 1B). After Flp-mediated deletion of the Frt-flanked positive selection markers from this recombinant, the structural integrity of the resultant linked BAC (referred to hereafter as G2BAC) was confirmed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C), restriction digest fingerprinting (Fig. 1D), and Southern blotting analyses using three radiolabeled probes dispersed throughout the Gata2 locus (Fig. 1B, the positions of the probes are indicated as E, F, and G). Hence, we successfully generated a 413-kbp Gata2-linked BAC using cre-mediated intermolecular recombination. Linked BAC Transgenic Mice—Due to fragmentation problems encountered when very large linear or nicked circular BAC DNAs are used for microinjection, 5M. Khandekar, and J. D. Engel, unpublished observations. we injected supercoiled DNA into fertilized mouse ova. Founder animals were genotyped using PCR primers (supplemental Table S1) located at the junction between the BAC vector and the most 5′ end of the Gata2 genomic DNA insert at –187 kbp, at the loxP514 insertion site situated at –13 kbp of the Gata2 locus, and in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Fourteen founders were verified to be transgenic by Southern blot analyses of tail DNA (data not shown). Of these, at least two appeared to contain complete transgenes that were transmitted stably to progeny for multiple generations (below), so these two lines were investigated further. To simultaneously quantify the BAC copy number and roughly assess the integrity of the transgenes, we employed a quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) strategy. After breeding the lines for several generations to ensure that no further segregation of unlinked transgenes occurred, DNA was prepared from the tails of several transgenic littermates of each line. Q-PCR was performed on these DNA samples in triplicate using Sybr green (Applied Biosystems). PCR primer pairs were designed (supplemental Table S1) to amplify Gata2 genomic sequences at ∼50-kbp intervals throughout the length of the linked G2BAC. Gata2 genomic sequences lying immediately beyond the boundaries of the G2BAC (at approximate positions corresponding to –230 and +270 kbp) as well as the β-actin gene were used as diploid copy number controls to ensure the validity of the assay. As shown in Fig. 2, transgenic line 2.2 appears to have incorporated three stably integrated transgene copies (three transgenic plus two endogenous = 5 copies), whereas line 2.12 appears to bear two. Given the similarity of the quantified results reflected by PCR primer pairs spread across the entire locus, we assume that at least one of the integrated BAC transgenes is intact in each line, but we performed no additional experiments (e.g. pulsed field Southern mapping) to test this hypothesis.

https://openalex.org/W2015265421,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key mediators in a number of inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ROS, including hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), modulate intestinal epithelial ion transport and are believed to contribute to IBD-associated diarrhea. Intestinal crypt fluid secretion, driven by electrogenic Cl(-) secretion, hydrates and sterilizes the crypt, thus reducing bacterial adherence. Here, we show that pathophysiological concentrations of H(2)O(2) inhibit Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) secretion across T(84) colonic epithelial cells by elevating cytosolic Ca(2+), which contributes to activation of two distinct signaling pathways. One involves recruitment of the Ca(2+)-responsive kinases, Src and Pyk-2, as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). A separate pathway recruits p38 MAP kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling. The ion transport response to Ca(2+)-dependent stimuli is mediated in part by K(+) efflux through basolateral K(+) channels and Cl(-) uptake by the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter, NKCC1. We demonstrate that H(2)O(2) inhibits Ca(2+)-dependent basolateral K(+) efflux and also inhibits NKCC1 activity independently of inhibitory effects on apical Cl(-) conductance. Thus, we have demonstrated that H(2)O(2) inhibits Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) secretion through multiple negative regulatory signaling pathways and inhibition of specific ion transporters. These findings increase our understanding of mechanisms by which inflammation disturbs intestinal epithelial function and contributes to intestinal pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2013662088,"Three methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins in Arabidopsis, AtMBD5, AtMBD6, and AtMBD7, are functional in binding methylated CpG dinucleotides in vitro and localize to the highly CpG-methylated chromocenters in vivo. These proteins differ, however, in their subnuclear localization pattern; AtMBD5 and AtMBD6, each containing a single MBD motif, show preference for two perinucleolar chromocenters, whereas AtMBD7, a naturally occurring poly-MBD protein containing three MBD motifs, localizes to all chromocenters. Here we studied the significance of multiple MBD motifs for subnuclear localization and mobility in living cells. We found that the number of MBD motifs determines the subnuclear localization of the MBD protein. Furthermore, live kinetic experiments showed that AtMBD7-green fluorescent protein (GFP) has lower mobility than AtMBD5-GFP and AtMBD6-GFP, which is conferred by cooperative activity of its three MBD motifs. Thus, the number of MBD motifs appears to affect not only binding affinity and mobility within the nucleus, but also the subnuclear localization of the protein. Our results suggest that poly-MBD proteins can directly affect chromatin structure by inducing intra- and inter-chromatin compaction via bridging over multiple methylated CpG sites."
https://openalex.org/W2005440380,"Evidence for an RNA gain-of-function toxicity has now been provided for an increasing number of human pathologies. Myotonic dystrophies (DM) belong to a class of RNA-dominant diseases that result from RNA repeat expansion toxicity. Specifically, DM of type 1 (DM1), is caused by an expansion of CUG repeats in the 3′UTR of the DMPK protein kinase mRNA, while DM of type 2 (DM2) is linked to an expansion of CCUG repeats in an intron of the ZNF9 transcript (ZNF9 encodes a zinc finger protein). In both pathologies the mutant RNA forms nuclear foci. The mechanisms that underlie the RNA pathogenicity seem to be rather complex and not yet completely understood. Here, we describe Drosophila models that might help unravelling the molecular mechanisms of DM1-associated CUG expansion toxicity. We generated transgenic flies that express inducible repeats of different type (CUG or CAG) and length (16, 240, 480 repeats) and then analyzed transgene localization, RNA expression and toxicity as assessed by induced lethality and eye neurodegeneration. The only line that expressed a toxic RNA has a (CTG)240 insertion. Moreover our analysis shows that its level of expression cannot account for its toxicity. In this line, (CTG)240.4, the expansion inserted in the first intron of CG9650, a zinc finger protein encoding gene. Interestingly, CG9650 and (CUG)240.4 expansion RNAs were found in the same nuclear foci. In conclusion, we suggest that the insertion context is the primary determinant for expansion toxicity in Drosophila models. This finding should contribute to the still open debate on the role of the expansions per se in Drosophila and in human pathogenesis of RNA-dominant diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1975670899,"Background Isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) and multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD) are heterogeneous disorders with several different etiologies and they are responsible for most cases of short stature. Mutations in different genes have been identified but still many patients did not present mutations in any of the known genes. Chromosomal rearrangements may also be involved in short stature and, among others, deletions of 18q23 defined a critical region for the disorder. No gene was yet identified. Methodology/Principal Findings We now report a balanced translocation X;18 in a patient presenting a breakpoint in 18q23 that was surprisingly mapped about 500 Kb distal from the short stature critical region. It separated from the flanking SALL3 gene a region enriched in highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNE) that appeared to be regulatory sequences, active as enhancers or silencers during embryonic development. Conclusion We propose that, during pituitary development, the 18q rearrangement may alter expression of 18q genes or of X chromosome genes that are translocated next to the HCNEs. Alteration of expression of developmentally regulated genes by translocation of HCNEs may represent a common mechanism for disorders associated to isolated chromosomal rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2048765369,"The aims of this study were to investigate (1) if P2Y(12) polymorphisms defining the P2Y(12) H2 allele are associated with any other SNPs that may explain the previously reported association with increased ADP induced platelet activation and association with peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease and (2) if such variants are associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or classical risk factors for AMI.The P2Y(13) Met-158-Thr polymorphism was found to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the P2Y(12) H2 haplotype (all examined SNPs: D' = 1.0, r(2) = 0.936-1.0), defining a novel P2Y(12) H2/P2Y(13) Thr-158 haplotype. Genotyping of an AMI case control population (n = 1244 cases, 2488 controls) revealed no association of the P2Y(13) Thr-158 allele with AMI (OR = 0.96, 95% C.I. 0.82-1.12, P = 0.63). Also, no differences between the genotype frequencies of P2Y(13) Met-158-Met and Met-158-Thr/Thr-158-Thr were seen in AMI case-control subpopulations (early onset AMI OR = 1.06, 95% C.I. 0.85-1.31, P = 0.62); family history of AMI (OR = 0.98, 95% C.I. 0.78-1.22, P = 0.83) nor in early onset AMIs with family history of AMI (OR = 1.0, 95% C.I. 0.74-1.36, P = 1.0). Genotyping of the P2Y(13) Met-158-Thr polymorphism in a population based sample (n = 6055) revealed no association with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the P2Y(13) Met-158-Thr polymorphism was genotyped in a diabetes case-control population, and associations were found neither with DM nor with any examined DM risk factors. CONCLUSION GENOTYPING: The P2Y(13) Met-158-Thr polymorphism is in tight LD with the P2Y(12) locus but is not associated with AMI or classical cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2084463811,"Background We introduce the Gene Characterization Index, a bioinformatics method for scoring the extent to which a protein-encoding gene is functionally described. Inherently a reflection of human perception, the Gene Characterization Index is applied for assessing the characterization status of individual genes, thus serving the advancement of both genome annotation and applied genomics research by rapid and unbiased identification of groups of uncharacterized genes for diverse applications such as directed functional studies and delineation of novel drug targets. Methodology/Principal Findings The scoring procedure is based on a global survey of researchers, who assigned characterization scores from 1 (poor) to 10 (extensive) for a sample of genes based on major online resources. By evaluating the survey as training data, we developed a bioinformatics procedure to assign gene characterization scores to all genes in the human genome. We analyzed snapshots of functional genome annotation over a period of 6 years to assess temporal changes reflected by the increase of the average Gene Characterization Index. Applying the Gene Characterization Index to genes within pharmaceutically relevant classes, we confirmed known drug targets as high-scoring genes and revealed potentially interesting novel targets with low characterization indexes. Removing known drug targets and genes linked to sequence-related patent filings from the entirety of indexed genes, we identified sets of low-scoring genes particularly suited for further experimental investigation. Conclusions/Significance The Gene Characterization Index is intended to serve as a tool to the scientific community and granting agencies for focusing resources and efforts on unexplored areas of the genome. The Gene Characterization Index is available from http://cisreg.ca/gci/."
