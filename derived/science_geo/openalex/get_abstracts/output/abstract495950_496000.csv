https://openalex.org/W1965753097,"Multiple independent culture-based studies have identified the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in respiratory samples as a positive risk factor for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Yet, culture-independent microbiological techniques have identified a negative association between Pseudomonas species and BOS. Our objective was to investigate whether there may be a unifying explanation for these apparently dichotomous results.We performed bronchoscopies with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on lung transplant recipients (46 procedures in 33 patients) and 26 non-transplant control subjects. We analyzed bacterial communities in the BAL fluid using qPCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and compared the culture-independent data with the clinical metadata and culture results from these subjects.Route of bronchoscopy (via nose or via mouth) was not associated with changes in BAL microbiota (p = 0.90). Among the subjects with positive Pseudomonas bacterial culture, P. aeruginosa was also identified by culture-independent methods. In contrast, a distinct Pseudomonas species, P. fluorescens, was often identified in asymptomatic transplant subjects by pyrosequencing but not detected via standard bacterial culture. The subject populations harboring these two distinct pseudomonads differed significantly with respect to associated symptoms, BAL neutrophilia, bacterial DNA burden and microbial diversity. Despite notable differences in culturability, a global database search of UM Hospital Clinical Microbiology Laboratory records indicated that P. fluorescens is commonly isolated from respiratory specimens.We have reported for the first time that two prominent and distinct Pseudomonas species (P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa) exist within the post-transplant lung microbiome, each with unique genomic and microbiologic features and widely divergent clinical associations, including presence during acute infection."
https://openalex.org/W2041299023,"Cardiac malformations due to aberrant development of the atrioventricular (AV) valves are among the most common forms of congenital heart diseases. Normally, heart valve mesenchyme is formed from an endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of endothelial cells of the endocardial cushions. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) has been reported to regulate EMT in vitro, in addition to its known role as a major regulator of organ size and cell proliferation in vertebrates, leading us to hypothesize that YAP1 is required for heart valve development. We tested this hypothesis by conditional inactivation of YAP1 in endothelial cells and their derivatives. This resulted in markedly hypocellular endocardial cushions due to impaired formation of heart valve mesenchyme by EMT and to reduced endocardial cell proliferation. In endothelial cells, TGFβ induces nuclear localization of Smad2/3/4 complex, which activates expression of Snail, Twist1, and Slug, key transcription factors required for EMT. YAP1 interacts with this complex, and loss of YAP1 disrupts TGFβ-induced up-regulation of Snail, Twist1, and Slug. Together, our results identify a role of YAP1 in regulating EMT through modulation of TGFβ-Smad signaling and through proliferative activity during cardiac cushion development."
https://openalex.org/W2161321945,"Quantum fluctuations of the light field used for continuous position detection produce stochastic back-action forces and ultimately limit the sensitivity. To overcome this limit, the back-action forces can be avoided by giving up complete knowledge of the motion, and these types of measurements are called ""back-action evading"" or ""quantum nondemolition"" detection. We present continuous two-tone back-action evading measurements with a superconducting electromechanical device, realizing three long-standing goals: detection of back-action forces due to the quantum noise of a microwave field, reduction of this quantum back-action noise by 8.5 ± 0.4 decibels (dB), and measurement imprecision of a single quadrature of motion 2.4 ± 0.7 dB below the mechanical zero-point fluctuations. Measurements of this type will find utility in ultrasensitive measurements of weak forces and nonclassical states of motion."

But as development progresses, connections are refined into functional networks. In that process, many synapses get eliminated.

https://openalex.org/W2008443866,"Accumulating evidence has indicated the implication of angiotensin II in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) via its proinflammatory features. Telmisartan (TLM) is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist with marked anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions that mediated its cardio-, reno- and hepatoprotective actions. However, its impact on IBD has not been previously explored. Thus, we aimed to investigate the potential alleviating effects of TLM in tri-nitrobenezene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Pretreatment with TLM (10 mg/kg p.o.) attenuated the severity of colitis as evidenced by decrease of disease activity index (DAI), colon weight/length ratio, macroscopic damage, histopathological findings and leukocyte migration. TLM suppressed the inflammatory response via attenuation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity as a marker of neutrophil infiltration besides restoration of interleukin-10 (IL-10). TLM also suppressed mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and mRNA of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) proinflammatory genes with concomitant upregulation of PPAR-γ. The alleviation of TLM to colon injury was also associated with inhibition of oxidative stress as evidenced by suppression of lipid peroxides and nitric oxide (NO) besides boosting glutathione (GSH), total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). With respect to apoptosis, TLM downregulated the increased mRNA, protein expression and activity of caspase-3. It also suppressed the elevation of cytochrome c and Bax mRNA besides the upregulation of Bcl-2. Together, these findings highlight evidences for the beneficial effects of TLM in IBD which are mediated through modulation of colonic inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969754220,"Perilipin 2 (Plin2) is a lipid droplet protein that has roles in both lipid and glucose homeostasis. An increase in Plin2 in liver is associated with the development of steatosis, glucose intolerance, and ceramide accumulation in alcoholic liver disease. We investigated the role of Plin2 on energy balance and glucose and lipid homeostasis in wildtype and Plin2 knockout (Plin2KO) mice chronically fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid ethanol or control diet for six weeks.We performed in vivo measurements of energy intake and expenditure; body composition; and glucose tolerance. After sacrifice, liver was dissected for histology and lipid analysis.We found that neither genotype nor diet had a significant effect on final weight, body composition, or energy intake between WT and Plin2KO mice fed alcohol or control diets. Additionally, alcohol feeding did not affect oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production in Plin2KO mice. We performed glucose tolerance testing and observed that alcohol feeding failed to impair glucose tolerance in Plin2KO mice. Most notably, absence of Plin2 prevented hepatic steatosis and ceramide accumulation in alcohol-fed mice. These changes were related to downregulation of genes involved in lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis.Plin2KO mice chronically fed alcohol are protected from hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, and hepatic ceramide accumulation, suggesting a critical pathogenic role of Plin2 in experimental alcoholic liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W1983247852,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils have in recent years attracted new attention due to their ability to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These web-like extracellular structures deriving from nuclear chromatin have been depicted in ambiguous roles between antimicrobial defence and host tissue damage. NETs consist of DNA strands of varying thickness and are decorated with microbicidal and cytotoxic proteins. Their principal structure has in recent years been characterised at molecular and ultrastructural levels but many features that are of direct relevance to cytotoxicity are still incompletely understood. These include the extent of chromatin decondensation during NET formation and the relative amounts and spatial distribution of the microbicidal components within the NET. In the present work, we analyse the structure of NETs found in induced sputum of patients with acutely exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using confocal laser microscopy and electron microscopy. In vitro induced NETs from human neutrophils serve for purposes of comparison and extended analysis of NET structure. Results demonstrate that COPD sputa are characterised by the pronounced presence of NETs and NETotic neutrophils. We provide new evidence that chromatin decondensation during NETosis is most extensive and generates substantial amounts of double-helix DNA in 'beads-on-a-string' conformation. New information is also presented on the abundance and location of neutrophil elastase (NE) and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3). NE occurs in high densities in nearly all non-fibrous constituents of the NETs while citH3 is much less abundant. We conclude from the results that (i) NETosis is an integral part of COPD pathology; this is relevant to all future research on the etiology and therapy of the disease; and that (ii) release of 'beads-on-a-string' DNA studded with non-citrullinated histones is a common feature of in vivo NETosis; this is of relevance to both the antimicrobial and the cytotoxic effects of NETs."
https://openalex.org/W1981866159,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating condition. Existing preclinical ICH models focus largely on striatum but neglect other brain areas such as ventricle, cortex, and hippocampus. Clinically, however, hemorrhagic strokes do occur in these other brain regions. In this study, we established mouse hemorrhagic models that utilize stereotactic injections of autologous whole blood or collagenase to produce ventricular, cortical, and hippocampal injury. We validated and characterized these models by histology, immunohistochemistry, and neurobehavioral tests. In the intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) model, C57BL/6 mice that received unilateral ventricular injections of whole blood demonstrated bilateral ventricular hematomas, ventricular enlargement, and brain edema in the ipsilateral cortex and basal ganglia at 72 h. Unilateral injections of collagenase (150 U/ml) caused reproducible hematomas and brain edema in the frontal cortex in the cortical ICH (c-ICH) model and in the hippocampus in the hippocampal ICH (h-ICH) model. Immunostaining revealed cellular inflammation and neuronal death in the periventricular regions in the IVH brain and in the perihematomal regions in the c-ICH and h-ICH brains. Locomotor abnormalities measured with a 24-point scoring system were present in all three models, especially on days 1, 3, and 7 post-ICH. Locomotor deficits measured by the wire-hanging test were present in models of IVH and c-ICH, but not h-ICH. Interestingly, mice in the c-ICH model demonstrated emotional abnormality, as measured by the tail suspension test and forced swim test, whereas h-ICH mice exhibited memory abnormality, as measured by the novel object recognition test. All three ICH models generated reproducible brain damage, brain edema, inflammation, and consistent locomotor deficits. Additionally, the c-ICH model produced emotional deficits and the h-ICH model produced cognitive deficits. These three models closely mimic human ICH and should be useful for investigating the pathophysiology of ICH in ventricle, cortex, and hippocampus and for evaluating potential therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2019041199,"Colonizing commensal bacteria after birth are required for the proper development of the gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that bacterial colonization pattern in neonatal gut affects gut barrier function and immune system maturation. Studies on the development of faecal microbiota in infants showed that the neonatal gut was first colonized with enterococci followed by other microbiota such as Bifidobacterium. Other studies showed that babies who developed allergy were less often colonized with Enterococcus during the first month of life as compared to healthy infants. Many studies have been conducted to elucidate how bifidobacteria or lactobacilli, some of which are considered probiotic, regulate infant gut immunity. However, fewer studies have been focused on enterococi. In our study, we demonstrate that E. faecalis, isolated from healthy newborns, suppress inflammatory responses activated in vivo and in vitro. We found E. faecalis attenuates proinflammatory cytokine secretions, especially IL-8, through JNK and p38 signaling pathways. This finding shed light on how the first colonizer, E.faecalis, regulates inflammatory responses in the host."

https://openalex.org/W1977015834,"α-Synuclein (aS) is a major constituent of Lewy bodies, which are not only a pathological marker for Parkinson disease but also a trigger for neurodegeneration. Cumulative evidence suggests that aS spreads from cell to cell and thereby propagates neurodegeneration to neighboring cells. Recently, Nedd4-1 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was shown to catalyze the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of intracellular aS and thereby facilitate aS degradation by the endolysosomal pathway. Because Nedd4-1 exerts its activity in close proximity to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, we speculate that after the internalization of aS the membrane resident aS is preferentially ubiquitinated by Nedd4-1. To clarify the role of Nedd4-1 in aS internalization and endolysosomal sequestration, we generated aS mutants, including ΔPR1(1-119 and 129-140), ΔC(1-119), and ΔPR2(1-119 and 134-140), that lack the proline-rich sequence, a putative Nedd4-1 recognition site. We show that wild type aS, but not ΔPR1, ΔPR2, or ΔC aS, is modified by Nedd4-1 in vitro, acquiring a Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chain. Compared with the mutants lacking the proline-rich sequence, wild type-aS is preferentially internalized and translocated to endosomes. The overexpression of Nedd4-1 increased aS in endosomes, whereas RNAi-mediated silencing of Nedd4-1 decreased endosomal aS. Although aS freely passes through plasma membranes within minutes, a pulse-chase experiment revealed that the overexpression of Nedd4-1 markedly decreased the re-secretion of internalized aS. Together, these findings demonstrate that Nedd4-1-linked Lys-63 ubiquitination specifies the fate of extrinsic and de novo synthesized aS by facilitating their targeting to endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2050799733,"Stress during postnatal development is associated with an increased risk for depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse later in life, almost as if mental illness is able to be programed by early life stressors. Recent studies suggest that such “programmed” effects can be caused by epigenetic regulation. With respect to conditioned fear, previous studies have indicated that early life stress influences its development in adulthood, whereas no potential role of epigenetic regulation has been reported. Neurotensin (NTS) is an endogenous neuropeptide that has receptors densely located in the amygdala and hippocampus. Recently, NTS systems have constituted an emerging target for the treatment of anxiety. The aim of the present work is to clarify whether the NTS system is involved in the disturbance of conditioned fear in rats stressed by maternal separation (MS). The results showed that MS enhanced freezing behaviors in fear-conditioned stress and reduced the gene expression of NTS receptor (NTSR) 1 but not of NTS or NTSR2 in the amygdalas of adult rats. The microinjection of a NTSR1 antagonist into the amygdala increased the percentage of freezing in conditioned fear, whereas the microinjection of NTSR1 agonist decreased freezing. These results suggest that NTSR1 in the amygdala may play a role in the effects of MS on conditioned fear stress in adult rats. Moreover, MS increased DNA methylation in the promoter region of NTSR1 in the amygdala. Taken together, MS may leave epigenetic marks in the NTSR1 gene in the amygdala, which may enhance conditioned fear in adulthood. The MS-induced alternations of DNA methylation in the promoter region of NTSR1 in the amygdala may be associated with vulnerability to the development of anxiety disorders and depression in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W1986944772,"Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide that mediates numerous physiological responses, including transmission of pain and inflammation through the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. Previous mutagenesis studies and photoaffinity labeling using ligand analogues suggested that the binding site for SP includes multiple domains in the N-terminal (Nt) segment and the second extracellular loop (ECLII) of NK1. To map precisely the NK1 residues that interact with SP, we applied a novel receptor-based targeted photocross-linking approach. We used amber codon suppression to introduce the photoreactive unnatural amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (BzF) at 11 selected individual positions in the Nt tail (residues 11–21) and 23 positions in the ECLII (residues 170(C-10)–193(C+13)) of NK1. The 34 NK1 variants were expressed in mammalian HEK293 cells and retained the ability to interact with a fluorescently labeled SP analog. Notably, 10 of the receptor variants with BzF in the Nt tail and 4 of those with BzF in ECLII cross-linked efficiently to SP, indicating that these 14 sites are juxtaposed to SP in the ligand-bound receptor. These results show that two distinct regions of the NK1 receptor possess multiple determinants for SP binding and demonstrate the utility of genetically encoded photocross-linking to map complex multitopic binding sites on G protein-coupled receptors in a cell-based assay format.

https://openalex.org/W2002822731,"The inclusion of molecular data is increasingly an integral part of studies assessing species boundaries. Analyses based on predefined groups may obscure patterns of differentiation, and population assignment tests provide an alternative for identifying population structure and barriers to gene flow. In this study, we apply population assignment tests implemented in the programs STRUCTURE and BAPS to single nucleotide polymorphisms from DNA sequence data generated for three previous studies of the lichenized fungal genus Letharia. Previous molecular work employing a gene genealogical approach circumscribed six species-level lineages within the genus, four putative lineages within the nominal taxon L. columbiana (Nutt.) J.W. Thomson and two sorediate lineages. We show that Bayesian clustering implemented in the program STRUCTURE was generally able to recover the same six putative Letharia lineages. Population assignments were largely consistent across a range of scenarios, including: extensive amounts of missing data, the exclusion of SNPs from variable markers, and inferences based on SNPs from as few as three gene regions. While our study provided additional evidence corroborating the six candidate Letharia species, the equivalence of these genetic clusters with species-level lineages is uncertain due, in part, to limited phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, both the BAPS analysis and the ad hoc ΔK statistic from results of the STRUCTURE analysis suggest that population structure can possibly be captured with fewer genetic groups. Our findings also suggest that uneven sampling across taxa may be responsible for the contrasting inferences of population substructure. Our results consistently supported two distinct sorediate groups, ‘L. lupina’ and L. vulpina, and subtle morphological differences support this distinction. Similarly, the putative apotheciate species ‘L. lucida’ was also consistently supported as a distinct genetic cluster. However, additional studies will be required to elucidate the relationships of other L. columbiana s.l. populations with the two sorediate genetic clusters."

https://openalex.org/W2093962809,"As the prototypical member of the PTP family, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an attractive target for therapeutic interventions in type 2 diabetes. The extremely conserved catalytic site of PTP1B renders the design of selective PTP1B inhibitors intractable. Although discovered allosteric inhibitors containing a benzofuran sulfonamide scaffold offer fascinating opportunities to overcome selectivity issues, the allosteric inhibitory mechanism of PTP1B has remained elusive. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, coupled with a dynamic weighted community analysis, were performed to unveil the potential allosteric signal propagation pathway from the allosteric site to the catalytic site in PTP1B. This result revealed that the allosteric inhibitor compound-3 induces a conformational rearrangement in helix α7, disrupting the triangular interaction among helix α7, helix α3, and loop11. Helix α7 then produces a force, pulling helix α3 outward, and promotes Ser190 to interact with Tyr176. As a result, the deviation of Tyr176 abrogates the hydrophobic interactions with Trp179 and leads to the downward movement of the WPD loop, which forms an H-bond between Asp181 and Glu115. The formation of this H-bond constrains the WPD loop to its open conformation and thus inactivates PTP1B. The discovery of this allosteric mechanism provides an overall view of the regulation of PTP1B, which is an important insight for the design of potent allosteric PTP1B inhibitors."

Here we present a detailed study of the structure and self-organization of naïve cytosolic Hsp60 in solution. Results were obtained by different biophysical methods (light and X ray scattering, single molecule spectroscopy and hydrodynamics) that all together allowed us to assay a wide range of concentrations of Hsp60.

https://openalex.org/W2084139333,"Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is a focal adhesion adaptor protein induced by the profibrotic cytokine TGF-β1. We have demonstrated previously that TGF-β1 induces myofibroblast differentiation and lung fibrosis by activation of the reactive oxygen species-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4). Here we investigated a potential role for Hic-5 in regulating Nox4, myofibroblast differentiation, and senescence. In normal human diploid fibroblasts, TGF-β1 induces Hic-5 expression in a delayed manner relative to the induction of Nox4 and myofibroblast differentiation. Hic-5 silencing induced constitutive Nox4 expression and enhanced TGF-β1-inducible Nox4 levels. The induction of constitutive Nox4 protein in Hic-5-silenced cells was independent of transcription and translation and controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system. Hic-5 associates with the ubiquitin ligase Cbl-c and the ubiquitin-binding protein heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). The interaction of these proteins is required for the ubiquitination of Nox4 and for maintaining low basal levels of this reactive oxygen species-generating enzyme. Our model suggests that TGF-β1-induced Hic-5 functions as a negative feedback mechanism to limit myofibroblast differentiation and senescence by promoting the ubiquitin-proteasomal system-mediated degradation of Nox4. Together, these studies indicate that endogenous Hic-5 suppresses senescence and profibrotic activities of myofibroblasts by down-regulating Nox4 protein expression. Additionally, these are the first studies, to our knowledge, to demonstrate posttranslational regulation of Nox4."
https://openalex.org/W1968612782,"Although stem cell-mediated treatment of ischemic diseases offers significant therapeutic promise, the limitation in the therapeutic efficacy of transplanted stem cells in vivo because of poor engraftment remains a challenge. Several strategies aimed at improving survival and engraftment of stem cells in the ischemic myocardium have been developed, such as cell transplantation in combination with growth factor delivery, genetic modification of stem cells, and/or cell therapy using scaffolds. To improve therapeutic efficacy, we investigated the effects of genistein on the engraftment of transplanted ECFCs in an acute myocardial ischemia model. Results: We found that genistein treatment enhanced ECFCs' migration and proliferation, which was accompanied by increases in the expression of ILK, α-parvin, F-actin, and phospholylation of ERK 1/2 signaling. Transplantation of genistein-stimulates ECFCs (GS-ECFCs) into myocardial ischemic sites in vivo induced cellular proliferation and secretion of angiogenic cytokines at the ischemic sites and thereby enhanced neovascularization and decreased myocardial fibrosis as well as improved cardiac function, as shown by echocardiography. Taken together, these data suggest that pretreatment of ECFCs with genistein prior to transplantation can improve the regenerative potential in ischemic tissues, providing a novel strategy in adult stem cell therapy for ischemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2061603582,"The CDK/Rb/E2F pathway is commonly disrupted in lung cancer, and thus, it is predicted that blocking the E2F pathway would have therapeutic potential. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the activity of HLM006474 (a small molecule pan-E2F inhibitor) in lung cancer cell lines as a single agent and in combination with other compounds. HLM006474 reduces the viability of both SCLC and NSCLC lines with a biological IC50 that varies between 15 and 75 µM, but with no significant difference between the groups. Combination of HLM006474 with cisplatin and gemcitabine demonstrate little synergy; however, HLM006474 synergizes with paclitaxel. Surprisingly, we discovered that brief treatment of cells with HLM006474 led to an increase of E2F3 protein levels (due to de-repression of these promoter sites). Since paclitaxel sensitivity has been shown to correlate with E2F3 levels, we hypothesized that HLM006474 synergy with paclitaxel may be mediated by transient induction of E2F3. To test this, H1299 cells were depleted of E2F3a and E2F3b with siRNA and treated with paclitaxel. Assays of proliferation showed that both siRNAs significantly reduced paclitaxel sensitivity, as expected. Taken together, these results suggest that HLM006474 may have efficacy in lung cancer and may be useful in combination with taxanes."

ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters actively transport various xenobiotics across biological membranes. Objective To investigate the role of ABC polymorphisms as modifiers of prenatal exposure to MeHg. Methods The study population consisted of participants (n = 1651) in two birth cohorts, one in Italy and Greece (PHIME) and the other in Spain (INMA). Women were recruited during pregnancy in Italy and Spain, and during the perinatal period in Greece. Total mercury concentrations were measured in cord blood samples by atomic absorption spectrometry. Maternal fish intake during pregnancy was determined from questionnaires. Polymorphisms (n = 5) in the ABC genes ABCA1, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCC2 were analysed in both cohorts. Results ABCB1 rs2032582, ABCC1 rs11075290, and ABCC2 rs2273697 modified the associations between maternal fish intake and cord blood mercury concentrations. The overall interaction coefficient between rs2032582 and log2-transformed fish intake was negative for carriers of GT (β = −0.29, 95%CI −0.47, −0.12) and TT (β = −0.49, 95%CI −0.71, −0.26) versus GG, meaning that for a doubling in fish intake of the mothers, children with the rs2032582 GG genotype accumulated 35% more mercury than children with TT. For rs11075290, the interaction coefficient was negative for carriers of TC (β = −0.12, 95%CI −0.33, 0.09), and TT (β = −0.28, 95%CI −0.51, −0.06) versus CC. For rs2273697, the interaction coefficient was positive when combining GA+AA (β = 0.16, 95%CI 0.01, 0.32) versus GG. Conclusion The ABC transporters appear to play a role in accumulation of MeHg during early development."

Here we show that GluA2 trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons requires Ca2+ release from internal stores, the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin activated kinase II (CaMKII), and GluA2 interaction with the PDZ protein, PICK1. We show that upon Ca2+ release from the ER via the IP3 and ryanodine receptors, CaMKII that is activated enters a complex that contains PICK1, dependent upon the PICK1 BAR (Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain, and that interacts with the GluA2 C-terminal domain and stimulates GluA2 ER exit and surface trafficking. This study reveals a novel mechanism of regulation of trafficking of GluA2-containing receptors to the surface under the control of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and CaMKII activity. The GluA2 subunit of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) dominantly blocks AMPAR Ca2+ permeability, and its trafficking to the synapse regulates AMPAR-dependent synapse Ca2+ permeability. Here we show that GluA2 trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons requires Ca2+ release from internal stores, the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin activated kinase II (CaMKII), and GluA2 interaction with the PDZ protein, PICK1. We show that upon Ca2+ release from the ER via the IP3 and ryanodine receptors, CaMKII that is activated enters a complex that contains PICK1, dependent upon the PICK1 BAR (Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain, and that interacts with the GluA2 C-terminal domain and stimulates GluA2 ER exit and surface trafficking. This study reveals a novel mechanism of regulation of trafficking of GluA2-containing receptors to the surface under the control of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and CaMKII activity."

https://openalex.org/W2034457721,"The efficient delivery of nucleic acids as therapeutic agents is a major challenge in gene therapy. Peptides have recently emerged as a novel carrier for delivery of drugs and genes. C6M1 is a designed amphipathic peptide with the ability to form stable complexes with short interfering RNA (siRNA). The peptide showed a combination of random coil and helical structure in water but mainly adopted a helical conformation in the presence of anions or siRNA. Revealed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and microscopy techniques, the interaction of C6M1 and siRNA in water and HEPES led to complexes of ∼70 and ∼155 nm in size, respectively, but showed aggregates as large as ∼500 nm in PBS. The time-dependent aggregation of the complex in PBS was studied by DLS and fluorescence spectroscopy. At molar ratio of 15∶1, C6M1 was able to completely encapsulate siRNA; however, higher molar ratios were required to obtain stable complexes. Naked siRNA was completely degraded in 4 h in the solution of 50% serum; however C6M1 protected siRNA against serum RNase over the period of 24 h. Western blotting experiment showed ∼72% decrease in GAPDH protein level of the cells treated with C6M1-siRNA complexes while no significant knockdown was observed for the cells treated with naked siRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1835070095,"Interaction of a given G protein-coupled receptor to multiple different G proteins is a widespread phenomenon. For instance, β2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) couples dually to Gs and Gi proteins. Previous studies have shown that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of β2-AR causes a switch in receptor coupling from Gs to Gi. More recent studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of β2-AR by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, particularly GRK2, markedly enhances the Gi coupling. We have previously shown that although most β2-AR agonists cause both Gs and Gi activation, (R,R')-fenoterol preferentially activates β2-AR-Gs signaling. However, the structural basis for this functional selectivity remains elusive. Here, using docking simulation and site-directed mutagenesis, we defined Tyr-308 as the key amino acid residue on β2-AR essential for Gs-biased signaling. Following stimulation with a β2-AR-Gs-biased agonist (R,R')-4'-aminofenoterol, the Gi disruptor pertussis toxin produced no effects on the receptor-mediated ERK phosphorylation in HEK293 cells nor on the contractile response in cardiomyocytes expressing the wild-type β2-AR. Interestingly, Y308F substitution on β2-AR enabled (R,R')-4'-aminofenoterol to activate Gi and to produce these responses in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner without altering β2-AR phosphorylation by PKA or G protein-coupled receptor kinases. These results indicate that, in addition to the phosphorylation status, the intrinsic structural feature of β2-AR plays a crucial role in the receptor coupling selectivity to G proteins. We conclude that specific interactions between the ligand and the Tyr-308 residue of β2-AR stabilize receptor conformations favoring the receptor-Gs protein coupling and subsequently result in Gs-biased agonism."
https://openalex.org/W2055495882,"Since nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus precedes invasive pneumococcal disease, characteristics of carriage isolates could be incorrectly assumed to reflect those of invasive isolates. While most pneumococci express a capsular polysaccharide, nontypeable pneumococci are sometimes isolated. Carriage nontypeables tend to encode novel surface proteins in place of a capsular polysaccharide synthetic locus, the cps locus. In contrast, capsular polysaccharide is believed to be indispensable for invasive pneumococcal disease, and nontypeables from population-based invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance have not been extensively characterized. We received 14,328 invasive pneumococcal isolates through the Active Bacterial Core surveillance program during 2006–2009. Isolates that were nontypeable by Quellung serotyping were characterized by PCR serotyping, sequence analyses of the cps locus, and multilocus sequence typing. Eighty-eight isolates were Quellung-nontypeable (0.61%). Of these, 79 (89.8%) contained cps loci. Twenty-two nontypeables exhibited serotype 8 cps loci with defects, primarily within wchA. Six of the remaining nine isolates contained previously-described aliB homologs in place of cps loci. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that most nontypeables that lacked capsular biosynthetic genes were related to established non-encapsulated lineages. Thus, invasive pneumococcal disease caused by nontypeable pneumococcus remains rare in the United States, and while carriage nontypeables lacking cps loci are frequently isolated, such nontypeable are extremely rare in invasive pneumococcal disease. Most invasive nontypeable pneumococci possess defective cps locus genes, with an over-representation of defective serotype 8 cps variants."
https://openalex.org/W2053802810,"Usher syndrome (USH) is a group of disorders manifested as retinitis pigmentosa and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, with or without vestibular dysfunction. Here, we recruited three Chinese families affected with autosomal recessive USH for detailed clinical evaluations and for mutation screening in the genes associated with inherited retinal diseases. Using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach, three new alleles and one known mutation in MYO7A gene were identified in the three families. In two families with USH type 1, novel homozygous frameshift variant p.Pro194Hisfs*13 and recurrent missense variant p.Thr165Met were demonstrated as the causative mutations respectively. Crystal structural analysis denoted that p.Thr165Met would very likely change the tertiary structure of the protein encoded by MYO7A. In another family affected with USH type 2, novel biallelic mutations in MYO7A, c.[1343+1G>A];[2837T>G] or p.[?];[Met946Arg], were identified with clinical significance. Because MYO7A, to our knowledge, has rarely been correlated with USH type 2, our findings therefore reveal distinguished clinical phenotypes associated with MYO7A. We also conclude that targeted NGS is an effective approach for genetic diagnosis for USH, which can further provide better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationship of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2132550743,"We exploit the fact that generosity and trustworthiness are highly correlated and the former can thus be a sign of the latter. Subjects decide between a generous and a mean split in a dictator game. Some of them are informed from the start that afterwards they will participate in a trust game and that their choice in the dictator game may matter; others are not informed in advance. In the trust game, before trusters decide whether or not to trust, some trustees can reveal (or conceal) only their true choice in the dictator game, while others can say to trusters, truthfully or otherwise, what they chose. We find that a generous choice made naturally by uninformed trustees and reliably revealed is more effective in persuading trusters to trust than a generous choice that could be strategic or a lie. Moreover, we find that, when they can, mean subjects lie and go on to be untrustworthy."
https://openalex.org/W2018454803,"Mammary epithelial (ME) cells cultured under conventional conditions senesce after several passages. Here, we demonstrate that mouse ME cells isolated from normal mammary glands or from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu-induced mammary tumors, can be cultured indefinitely as conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) on irradiated fibroblasts in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Cell surface progenitor-associated markers are rapidly induced in normal mouse ME-CRCs relative to ME cells. However, the expression of certain mammary progenitor subpopulations, such as CD49f+ ESA+ CD44+, drops significantly in later passages. Nevertheless, mouse ME-CRCs grown in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix gave rise to mammary acinar structures. ME-CRCs isolated from MMTV-Neu transgenic mouse mammary tumors express high levels of HER2/neu, as well as tumor-initiating cell markers, such as CD44+, CD49f+, and ESA+ (EpCam). These patterns of expression are sustained in later CRC passages. Early and late passage ME-CRCs from MMTV-Neu tumors that were implanted in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic or nude mice developed vascular tumors that metastasized within 6 weeks of transplantation. Importantly, the histopathology of these tumors was indistinguishable from that of the parental tumors that develop in the MMTV-Neu mice. Application of the CRC system to mouse mammary epithelial cells provides an attractive model system to study the genetics and phenotype of normal and transformed mouse epithelium in a defined culture environment and in vivo transplant studies."
https://openalex.org/W2017198347,"Understanding the basic mechanism of the spatio-temporal self-control of genome-wide gene expression engaged with the complex epigenetic molecular assembly is one of major challenges in current biological science. In this study, the genome-wide dynamical profile of gene expression was analyzed for MCF-7 breast cancer cells induced by two distinct ErbB receptor ligands: epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heregulin (HRG), which drive cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively. We focused our attention to elucidate how global genetic responses emerge and to decipher what is an underlying principle for dynamic self-control of genome-wide gene expression. The whole mRNA expression was classified into about a hundred groups according to the root mean square fluctuation (rmsf). These expression groups showed characteristic time-dependent correlations, indicating the existence of collective behaviors on the ensemble of genes with respect to mRNA expression and also to temporal changes in expression. All-or-none responses were observed for HRG and EGF (biphasic statistics) at around 10-20 min. The emergence of time-dependent collective behaviors of expression occurred through bifurcation of a coherent expression state (CES). In the ensemble of mRNA expression, the self-organized CESs reveals distinct characteristic expression domains for biphasic statistics, which exhibits notably the presence of criticality in the expression profile as a route for genomic transition. In time-dependent changes in the expression domains, the dynamics of CES reveals that the temporal development of the characteristic domains is characterized as autonomous bistable switch, which exhibits dynamic criticality (the temporal development of criticality) in the genome-wide coherent expression dynamics. It is expected that elucidation of the biophysical origin for such critical behavior sheds light on the underlying mechanism of the control of whole genome."

Here we describe the mechanisms of catalytic activation of PCTK3 by cyclin A2 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Using a pulldown experiment with HEK293T cells, cyclin A2 and cyclin E1 were identified as proteins that interacted with PCTK3. An in vitro kinase assay using retinoblastoma protein as the substrate showed that PCTK3 was specifically activated by cyclin A2 but not by cyclin E1, although its activity was lower than that of CDK2. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry analysis showed that PCTK3 colocalized with cyclin A2 in the cytoplasm and regulated cyclin A2 stability. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that PCTK3 contained four putative PKA phosphorylation sites. In vitro and in vivo kinase assays showed that PCTK3 was phosphorylated by PKA at Ser12, Ser66, and Ser109 and that PCTK3 activity significantly increased via phosphorylation at Ser12 by PKA even in the absence of cyclin A2. In the presence of cyclin A2, PCTK3 activity was comparable to CDK2 activity. We also found that PCTK3 knockdown in HEK293T cells induced polymerized actin accumulation in peripheral areas and cofilin phosphorylation.

Barbacid M. Mammalian cyclin-dependent kinases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 630-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Their activities are regulated by associations with different cyclins and phosphorylation at specific sites by protein kinases (2Kaldis P. The cdk-activating kinase (CAK): from yeast to mammals.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because cyclins are differentially expressed and degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis at specific cell cycle phases, CDK activity oscillates during cell cycle transitions (3Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Ubiquitin ligases: cell-cycle control and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Canonical CDKs contain the PSTAIRE helix, which has been implicated in binding to cyclins in the kinase domain (4Morgan D.O. Cyclin-dependent kinases: engines, clocks, and microprocessors.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The PCTAIRE kinase (PCTK) subfamily of CDKs includes three members, PCTK1/CDK16, PCTK2/CDK17, and PCTK3/CDK18, which contain the PCTAIRE sequence instead of the PSTAIRE sequence. PCTK family members have high sequence homology in their central kinase domains, whereas the structures of their N-terminal and C-terminal regions differ. PCTK genes are conserved in higher eukaryotes, from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. However, there are no PCTK orthologs in yeast. The PCTK subfamily is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and is relatively more abundant in post-mitotic cells, suggesting that they may function in higher eukaryotes and have different biological functions from those during the cell cycle (5Cole A.R. PCTK proteins: the forgotten brain kinases?.Neurosignals. 2009; 17: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PCTK1 is the best-characterized member of this kinase family and regulates neurite outgrowth in the Neuro2A neuroblastoma cell line (6Graeser R. Gannon J. Poon R.Y. Dubois T. Aitken A. Hunt T.

It is also involved in membrane trafficking through the early secretory pathway via phosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (7Palmer K.J. Konkel J.E. Stephens D.J.

A recent study reported that PCT-1, the C. elegans ortholog of PCTK1, is complexed with CYY-1 (ortholog of mammalian cyclin Y, a novel membrane-associated cyclin) and is also necessary for targeting presynaptic components to the axons (9Ou C.Y.

Furthermore, human PCTK1 is activated by cyclin Y and is essential for spermatogenesis (10Mikolcevic P. Sigl R. Rauch V. Hess M.W. Pfaller K. Barisic M. Pelliniemi L.J. Boesl M. Geley S.

Although exogenously expressed PCTK1 and PCTK2 phosphorylate myelin basic protein and histone H1 in vitro, PCTK3 kinase activity has not been detected.

Mammalian cyclin A consists of two isoforms: cyclin A1 and cyclin A2. In male mice, cyclin A1 is predominantly expressed in germ cells and is required for the entry of germ cells into the first meiotic division (13Liu D. Matzuk M.M. Sung W.K. Guo Q. Wang P. Wolgemuth D.J. Cyclin A1 is required for meiosis in the male mouse.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In contrast, cyclin A2 is ubiquitously expressed in somatic cells and has a major role in S-phase progression and the G2/M phase transition by activating CDK2 and CDK1, respectively. Although cyclin A is predominantly localized in the nucleus during S phase, it also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis during the G2 phase. Cyclin A/CDK2 is transiently maintained by SCAPER (S phase cyclin A-associated protein residing in the endoplasmic reticulum), an S phase cyclin A-associated protein, in the cytoplasm (14Tsang W.Y. Wang L. Chen Z. Sánchez I. Dynlacht B.D. SCAPER, a novel cyclin A: interacting protein that regulates cell cycle progression.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, a recent study showed cyclin A2 is involved in the regulation of cell migration and invasiveness through its direct interaction with RhoA, suggesting a novel function of cyclin A in a CDK1- and CDK2-independent manner (15Arsic N.

Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates numerous proteins involved in various cellular phenomena and preferentially to phosphorylates a serine or threonine within the following consensus sequence: Arg-Arg-X-Ser/Thr (X represents any amino acid) (16Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). PKA also plays an important role in maintaining meiotic arrest (17Eyers P.A. Liu J. Hayashi N.R. Lewellyn A.L. Gautier J. Maller J.L. Regulation of the G2/M transition in Xenopus oocytes by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24339-24346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, PKA phosphorylates and inactivates Cdc25C phosphatase, whereas Wee1B kinase activity is enhanced by PKA (18Shibuya E.K. G2 cell cycle arrest: a direct link between PKA and Cdc25C.Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Han S.J. Conti M. New pathways from PKA to the Cdc2/cyclin B complex in oocytes: Wee1B as a potential PKA substrate.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The activity of the cyclin B-CDK1 complex is controlled by Wee1 kinase and Cdc25C phosphatase (20Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H.

Cell cycle regulation by the Cdc25 phosphatase family.Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).

G2 cell cycle arrest: a direct link between PKA and Cdc25C.Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PKA inhibits the interaction between PCTK1 and cyclin Y via phosphorylation of PCTK1 at Ser153, resulting in PCTK1 inactivation (6Graeser R. Gannon J. Poon R.Y. Dubois T. Aitken A.

Thus, PKA regulates the activities of CDKs in either a direct or an indirect manner. In this study we demonstrated that PCTK3 is activated by its association with cyclin A2 and phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (Rb) in vitro. In addition, we found that PCTK3 contains four putative PKA phosphorylation sites (Arg-Arg-X-Ser/Thr) and that PCTK3 phosphorylation by PKA results in an increase in its catalytic activity even in the absence of cyclin A2. These findings provide some insights into the functions of PCTK3.

PCR products were cloned into TA-cloning vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and the inserted DNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

The bacterial expression plasmid of Rb, pMAL-Rb C, was introduced into the bacterial strain BL21 Star DE3 (Invitrogen). An overnight culture in LB medium was diluted in fresh LB medium and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with continuous shaking. After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, the culture was incubated at 30 °C for an additional 6 h. The cells were resuspended in ice-cold extraction buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After freezing and thawing, suspended cells were sonicated on ice in short bursts. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with ice-cold extraction buffer A and incubated with 10 mm maltose at 4 °C to elute fusion protein from the beads. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against PBS. The purified protein was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard.

After incubation on ice for 15 min, the cells were mixed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and homogenized by vortex for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 3 min to sediment the nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at a 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was used as the cytoplasm fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed three times with buffer A to remove any contamination from cytoplasmic proteins. To extract nuclear proteins, the isolated nuclei were resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclear lysates were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The purity of nuclear and cytoplasm fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting using an anti-lamin B1 antibody (MBL) as a nuclear marker and α-tubulin antibody as a cytoplasmic marker, respectively. Pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (23Yuasa K. Matsuda T. Tsuji A. Functional regulation of transient receptor potential canonical 7 by cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα.Cell Signal. 2011; 23: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped in an ice-cold TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C before immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. Equal protein amounts of the lysates were analyzed for protein expression. For pulldown assays, lysates were incubated with Strep-Tactin Sepharose (IBA GmbH) or glutathione Sepharose (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 or anti-PCTK3 antibody in the presence of protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA). Precipitated proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase assay or immunoblot analysis. Protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates. The synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides for PCTK3 (PCTK3 siRNA#1 (ID# SASI_Hs02_00334101), PCTK3 siRNA#2 (ID# SASI_Hs01_00015477), and PCTK3 siRNA#3 (ID# SASI_Hs02_00374212)) were purchased from Sigma. A MISSION siRNA Universal Negative Control #1 was used as the negative control. The transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro kinase assays were carried out as previously described (23Yuasa K. Matsuda T. Tsuji A. Functional regulation of transient receptor potential canonical 7 by cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα.Cell Signal. 2011; 23: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For in vitro kinase assay of PCTK3, cell lysates were incubated with a glutathione-Sepharose or immunoprecipitated with anti-PCTK3 antibody and protein G Sepharose overnight at 4 °C by rotation. The beads were washed 3 times with wash buffer and twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The kinase reaction was carried out by resuspending the complexes in 100 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 20 or 50 μm ATP and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque)) including 5 μg/ml purified MBP-Rb C in the absence or presence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubating for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated MBP-Rb C was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with a BAS-1500 Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji Film) or subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-Rb (Ser795) antibody. To assay the phosphorylation of PCTK3 by PKA, cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody overnight at 4 °C by rotation. The kinase reaction was carried out by resuspending the complexes in 100 μl of kinase buffer with 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and incubating for 30 min at 30 °C. Immunocomplexes were released by heating at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by BAS-1500 Bioimaging Analyzer. Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using Image J software. HEK293T cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin for 30 min in the presence of 10% FBS and scraped in an ice-cold TNE buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor mixture. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-PCTK3 antibody with protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C by rotation. The beads were washed with wash buffer, and immunocomplexes were released by heating at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using anti-phospho-RRX(S/T) antibody. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described (23Yuasa K. Matsuda T. Tsuji A. Functional regulation of transient receptor potential canonical 7 by cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα.Cell Signal. 2011; 23: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293T cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides were cotransfected with Myc-cyclin A2 together with either FLAG-PCTK3 or FLAG-CDK2. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde. After sequential washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized for 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100, washed 3 times with PBS, and then treated with 5% BSA for 30 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M2 IgG or rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-rabbit IgG directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen). The slides were washed thoroughly with PBS and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). A confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS-SP5) was used to obtain staining profiles. PCTK1, a member of the PCTK subfamily, is activated by membrane-associated cyclin Y (10Mikolcevic P. Sigl R.

Analysis of substrate specificity and cyclin Y binding of PCTAIRE-1 kinase.Cell. Signal. 2012; 24: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PCTK3 was also activated by cyclin family members. To identify PCTK3 activators, we expressed Strep-tagged mouse PCTK3 in HEK293T cells and conducted Strep pulldown experiments. The proteins that coprecipitated with PCTK3 were analyzed by immunoblot assay using anti-cyclin A, B1, D1, E1, E2, and H antibodies. Immunoblot analysis revealed that PCTK3 interacted with cyclin A and cyclin E1, but not cyclin B1, D1, E2, or H, in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A). To confirm the interaction between PCTK3 and cyclin A2 or E1, we performed GST pulldown experiments using lysates prepared from COS-7 cells expressing GST-fused PCTK3 and FLAG-tagged cyclins. We also examined whether cyclin K and cyclin Y bound to PCTK3, because PCTK3 was found to interact with cyclin K in a large-scale interaction study (25Rual J.F. Venkatesan K. Hao T. Hirozane-Kishikawa T. Dricot A. Li N. Berriz G.F. Gibbons F.D. Dreze M. Ayivi-Guedehoussou N. Klitgord N. Simon C. Boxem M. Milstein S. Rosenberg J. Goldberg D.S. Zhang L.V. Wong S.L. Franklin G.

As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-PCTK3 associated with FLAG-cyclin A2 and cyclin E1 but not with cyclin K or cyclin Y. Subsequently, to determine whether PCTK3 activity was regulated by binding to cyclin A2 or cyclin E1, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using retinoblastoma protein (Rb) as the substrate. Rb is phosphorylated by some CDKs in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and PFTK1, which is activated by cyclin D3 and cyclin Y, also phosphorylates Rb (26Shu F. Lv S. Qin Y. Ma X. Wang X. Peng X. Luo Y. Xu B.E. Sun X. Wu J. Functional characterization of human PFTK1 as a cyclin-dependent kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9248-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Jiang M. Gao Y. Yang T. Zhu X. Chen J. Cyclin Y, a novel membrane-associated cyclin, interacts with PFTK1.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Rb contains a cluster of seven candidate CDK phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr-Pro motifs: Ser780, Ser788, Ser795, Ser807, Ser811, Thr821, and Thr826) (28Adams P.D. Li X. Sellers W.R. Baker K.B. Leng X. Harper J.W. Taya Y. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Retinoblastoma protein contains a C-terminal motif that targets it for phosphorylation by cyclin-cdk complexes.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For this in vitro kinase assay, we produced recombinant MBP-fused Rb C (amino acids 779–928) in Escherichia coli. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with GST-PCTK3 in the presence or absence of FLAG-cyclin A2 or E1, after which cell lysates were subjected to glutathione-Sepharose pulldown. In an in vitro kinase analysis with [γ-32P]ATP, MBP-Rb C was phosphorylated by PCTK3 in the presence of cyclin A2, whereas cyclin E1 did not activate PCTK3 (Fig. 1C). We also performed an in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein (MyBP) and histone H1 as substrates. As shown in Fig. 1D, cyclin A2-CDK2 complex strongly phosphorylated all three of the substrates tested (Rb, MyBP, and histone H1). However, the catalytic activity of PCTK3 was much lower than that of CDK2 even in the presence of cyclin A2. Among the three substrates tested, Rb was the most efficiently phosphorylated by cyclin A2-PCTK3 complex. In addition, phosphorylated MBP-Rb C was detected using antibodies against phospho-Rb (Ser795) and phospho-Rb (Ser807/811) (Fig. 1E). Both of these antibodies detected Rb phosphorylation only when PCTK3 and cyclin A2 were cotransfected, indicating that cyclin A2-PCTK3 complex phosphorylates Rb at least at Ser795 and Ser807/811 in vitro. These results showed that PCTK3 is activated through its association with cyclin A2. Cyclin A2 interacts with CDK1 and CDK2 during cell cycle progression (29Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. A family of human cdc2-related protein kinases.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). We performed GST pulldown experiments to evaluate whether Rb phosphorylation was dependent on PCTK3 or other kinases that coprecipitated with cyclin A2. As shown in Fig. 2A, endogenous CDK1 and CDK2 were specifically coprecipitated with GST-cyclin A (lane 4), whereas GST-PCTK3, GST-PCTK3/FLAG-cyclin A2 complex, and FLAG-cyclin A2 did not coprecipitate with endogenous CDK1 and CDK2 (lanes 1–3). In addition, we designed a PCTK3 inactive mutant on the basis of amino acids that are conserved among various members of the CDK family. An analogous K194R mutation at the putative ATP binding site of PCTK1 generates a kinase dead mutant (6Graeser R. Gannon J. Poon R.Y. Dubois T. Aitken A. Hunt T. Regulation of the CDK-related protein kinase PCTAIRE-1 and its possible role in neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A cells.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3479-3490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We created a kinase-dead mutant of PCTK3, in which the putative ATP binding site was replaced by arginine (PCTK3 K150R), and evaluated its catalytic activity with an in vitro kinase assay. Although both PCTK3 wild type and K150R interacted with cyclin A2, no kinase activity of PCTK3 K150R was detected (Fig. 2B). Thus, Rb phosphorylation is dependent on PCTK3 but not on other protein kinases, and it is highly likely that cyclin A2 is an activator of PCTK3. We also examined whether other members of the PCTK subfamily, PCTK1 and PCTK2, were activated by cyclin A2, because PCTK2 activators have not yet been identified. Although PCTK1 and PCTK2 interacted with cyclin A2, only PCTK3 was activated by cyclin A2 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, PFTK1, with high homology to PCTK3, was not associated with cyclin A2 and did not phosphorylate Rb C (Fig. 2D). However, GST pulldown and in vitro kinase assays suggested that CDK2 had a higher affinity for cyclin A2 than PCTK3 and that the catalytic activity of PCTK3 was lower than that of CDK2 in the presence of cyclin A2 (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrated that cycli"
https://openalex.org/W2017403649,"The serotonin and circadian systems are two important interactive regulatory networks in the mammalian brain that regulate behavior and physiology in ways that are known to impact human mental health. Previous work on the interaction between these two systems suggests that serotonin modulates photic input to the central circadian clock (the suprachiasmatic nuclei; SCN) from the retina and serves as a signal for locomotor activity, novelty, and arousal to shift the SCN clock, but effects of disruption of serotonergic signaling from the raphe nuclei on circadian behavior and on SCN function are not fully characterized. In this study, we examined the effects on diurnal and circadian behavior, and on ex vivo molecular rhythms of the SCN, of genetic deficiency in Pet-1, an ETS transcription factor that is necessary to establish and maintain the serotonergic phenotype of raphe neurons. Pet-1−/− mice exhibit loss of rhythmic behavioral coherence and an extended daily activity duration, as well as changes in the molecular rhythms expressed by the clock, such that ex vivo SCN from Pet-1−/− mice exhibit period lengthening and sex-dependent changes in rhythmic amplitude. Together, our results indicate that Pet-1 regulation of raphe neuron serotonin phenotype contributes to the period, precision and light/dark partitioning of locomotor behavioral rhythms by the circadian clock through direct actions on the SCN clock itself, as well as through non-clock effects."
https://openalex.org/W2060373131,"Group life involves both advantages and disadvantages, meaning that individuals have to compromise between their nutritional needs and their social links. When a compromise is impossible, the group splits in order to reduce conflict of interests and favour positive social interactions between its members. In this study we built a dynamic model of social networks to represent a succession of temporary fissions involving a change in social relations that could potentially lead to irreversible group fission (i.e. no more group fusion). This is the first study that assesses how a social network changes according to group fission-fusion dynamics. We built a model that was based on different parameters: the group size, the influence of nutritional needs compared to social needs, and the changes in the social network after a temporary fission. The results obtained from this theoretical data indicate how the percentage of social relation transfer, the number of individuals and the relative importance of nutritional requirements and social links influence the average number of days before irreversible fission occurs. The greater the nutritional needs and the higher the transfer of social relations during temporary fission, the fewer days will be observed before an irreversible fission. It is crucial to bridge the gap between the individual and the population level if we hope to understand how simple, local interactions may drive ecological systems."

PmDsbA exhibits the characteristic properties of a DsbA, including an oxidizing potential, destabilizing disulfide, acidic active site cysteine, and dithiol oxidase catalytic activity.

Proteus mirabilis is a significant Gram-negative extra-intestinal human pathogen that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which also includes other important pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae.

McGovern K. Beckwith J. Identification of a protein required for disulfide bond formation in vivo.Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). This reaction involves the transfer of a disulfide bond from the active site 30CXXC33 motif of DsbA to cysteine thiols in newly translocated proteins (28Shouldice S.R. Heras B. Walden P.M. Totsika M. Schembri M.A. Martin J.L. Structure and function of DsbA, a key bacterial oxidative folding catalyst.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1729-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Through this disulfide-exchange reaction, the active site cysteines of DsbA become reduced. The enzymatic cycle is completed through oxidation of DsbA by the inner membrane partner protein, DsbB (29Inaba K. Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K.

DsbA from E. coli (EcDsbA) is a highly promiscuous enzyme that catalyzes disulfide bond formation in many cysteine-containing proteins (28Shouldice S.R. Heras B. Walden P.M. Totsika M. Schembri M.A. Martin J.L. Structure and function of DsbA, a key bacterial oxidative folding catalyst.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1729-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, EcDsbB has a very strict binding specificity for EcDsbA (29Inaba K. Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K.

The interaction between EcDsbA and EcDsbB involves the formation of a mixed disulfide between Cys30 of the 30CXXC33 motif of EcDsbA and Cys104 of EcDsbB in the P2 periplasmic loop, which has the sequence 98PSPFATCDF106 (30Inaba K.

Dynamic nature of disulphide bond formation catalysts revealed by crystal structures of DsbB.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex between EcDsbA and EcDsbB also revealed non-covalent binding of EcDsbB P2 loop residues to the EcDsbA hydrophobic groove (30Inaba K. Murakami S. Nakagawa A.

The P2 periplasmic loop sequence of P. mirabilis DsbB (PmDsbB) is identical to that of EcDsbB, suggesting a similar interaction occurs between PmDsbA and PmDsbB. Here we characterize PmDsbA from P. mirabilis, which shares 59% sequence identity with EcDsbA, and confirm its activity as a DsbA enzyme. We demonstrate that the heptapeptide PWATCDS, derived from the DsbB P2 loop sequence, binds to wild type PmDsbA and to a C30S active site variant (PmDsbAC30S). We report three high-resolution crystal structures including the PmDsbAC30S·PWATCDS complex, which represents to our knowledge the first reported example of a peptide bound non-covalently to a DsbA structure. This non-covalent complex provides the critical starting point for the design of non-covalent drugs that act as anti-virulence agents targeting Enterobacteriaceae DsbAs. Codon-optimized wild type P. mirabilis dsbA (GenBank® accession number CAR45574), lacking the sequence coding for the predicted signal peptide (amino acids 1–19), was cloned into a modified pMCSG7 (31Eschenfeldt W.H.

The cytoplasmic expressed PmDsbA contained an N-terminal His6 affinity tag followed by a linker region including a tobacco etch virus (TEV) 6The abbreviations used are: TEVtobacco etch virusBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolHbtUO-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphateITCisothermal titration calorimetryPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.root mean square. protease cleavage site. The PmDsbAC30S variant was generated from the wild type construct using QuikChange® (Agilent Technologies). The following primers were used to introduce the point mutation, forward, GAATTTTTCTCATTTTATTCTCCGCATTGTTACC and reverse, GGTAACAATGCGGAGAATAAAATGAGAAAAATTC. Transformed BL21(DE3)pLys cells containing plasmids for either PmDsbA or PmDsbAC30S were grown (1 liter) at 30 °C in 2.5-liter baffled shaker flasks for 16–20 h using autoinduction media (32Studier F.W. Protein production by autoinduction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4100) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (10 g of cells/100 ml of buffer), and protease inhibitor mixture (diluted 1 in 1000 into the lysate) (BioPioneer Inc., San Diego, CA) and DNase (1300 units/100 ml of lysate) (Roche Applied Science) were added. Lysis was performed in a Cell Disruptor (TS-Series, Constant Systems LTD., UK) applying a single run with a constant pressure of 25 Kpsi. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (18,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C, rotor JM-25.5, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The proteins were further purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using 12 ml/1-liter cells of equilibrated Talon (Clontech) and eluted with 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole after incubation of 30 min at room temperature. Total protein was determined at 280 nm with a NanoDropTM 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The His6 affinity tag was removed by TEV cleavage using a 50:1 (w/w) ratio (protein/TEV-protease) incubated in a 50-ml Falcon tube including 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 2 h on a rotary mixer at room temperature. After cleavage, the PmDsbA proteins had an additional two non-native residues (Ser−2–Asn−1) at the N terminus. To remove imidazole, the mixture was rapidly buffer exchanged into 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl using a Sephadex G-25 fine 16/60 column connected to an ÄKTA system (GE Healthcare). The His6-tagged TEV protease was removed by reverse metal ion affinity chromatography using Talon resin (0.5 ml of resin/2 mg of TEV protease) (Clontech, Australia) and the PmDsbA proteins were recovered in the flow through. The final step of purification was performed using a Superdex S75 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare). Peak fractions were then combined and the protein was oxidized using copper(II)/1,10-phenanthroline at 1.7 mm final concentration or reduced using DTT at ×25 molar excess. To remove oxidizing or reducing agent, the mixture was then buffer-exchanged into 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 using a Sephadex G-25 fine 16/60 column. Finally, the protein was concentrated to 100 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra filter devices with a 10-kDa cutoff (Millipore). Yield was generally 120–150 mg/liter of culture. Protein quality was assessed by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE® system, 4–12% BisTris gel, Invitrogen, Australia). Molar protein concentrations were determined from calculated extinction coefficients derived from ProtParam (33Gasteiger E.H.C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A.

Yields were generally 120 and 80 mg/liter of culture, respectively. E. coli membrane extracts containing over-expressed EcDsbB (GenBank accession number AAC74269) were prepared as described previously (34Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J.

E. coli ΔdsbA (JCB817) and ΔdsbA/ΔdsbB (JCB818) non-motile strains were used for motility assays as described previously (35Shouldice S.R. Heras B. Jarrott R. Sharma P. Scanlon M.J. Martin J.L.

As a positive control, EcDsbA was expressed within the same pBAD33 vector background. 2 × 106 non-motile E. coli ΔdsbA (JCB817) and ΔdsbA/ΔdsbB (JCB818) double-mutant (JCB818) (27Bardwell J.C.

Plates were incubated at 37 °C and cell motility was monitored after 4–5 h using a Molecular Imager® Gel DocTM system from Bio-Rad. Complementation experiments were performed as biological triplicates. A synthetic peptide substrate of EcDsbA (CQQGFDGTQNSCK) with a europium 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid group amide coupled to the N terminus and a methylcoumarin amide coupled to the ϵ-amino group of the C-terminal lysine was purchased from AnaSpec (Fremont, CA) and prepared as previously reported (37Vivian J.P.

Structure and function of the oxidoreductase DsbA1 from Neisseria meningitidis.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assays were performed using a Synergy H1 multimode plate reader (BioTek) as described previously (38Walden P.M. Heras B. Chen K.E. Halili M.A. Rimmer K. Sharma P. Scanlon M.J. Martin J.L. The 1.2-Å resolution crystal structure of TcpG, the Vibrio cholerae DsbA disulfide-forming protein required for pilus and cholera toxin production.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

In brief, fluorescence (excitation λ = 340 nm and emission λ = 615 nm) corresponding to disulfide formation in the substrate peptide was measured in a white 384-well plate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences OptiPlate-384, number 6007290) in 50 mm MES, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA at pH 5.5 buffer. The total reaction volume in each well was 50 μl, containing 40, 80, or 160 nm PmDsbA or EcDsbA, 1.6 μm EcDsbB membrane, and 8 μm peptide substrate (added last to initiate the reaction). Controls used were: PmDsbA or EcDsbA + buffer + substrate (no DsbB); EcDsbB + buffer + substrate (no DsbA); buffer + substrate (no DsbA or DsbB); and no components (fluorescence background of the plate, which was subtracted from all other measurements). Three independent experiments (biological replicates) were performed, using three technical replicates for each measurement. The reaction rate was estimated by calculating the increase in fluorescence over the first 8 min of reaction. The fluorescence rates were plotted including the standard deviation calculated from the three biological replicates. Temperature-induced unfolding of native PmDsbA was recorded by UV circular dichroism as previously reported for other DsbA enzymes (39Heras B. Kurz M. Jarrott R. Shouldice S.R. Frei P. Robin G.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4261-4271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). The initial redox state of PmDsbA was confirmed by Ellman's assay (40Ellman G.L. Tissue sulfhydryl groups.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21351) Google Scholar). The maximum difference in CD signal was determined by subtraction of the CD spectra of the folded protein (25 °C) from the unfolded (95 °C) protein, for the oxidized and the reduced forms of the protein. Unfolding of oxidized PmDsbA (210 nm) and reduced PmDsbA (213 nm) was monitored in a 1-mm quartz cuvette using a heating rate of 1 °C/min from 25 to 95 °C. Measurements were carried out using 10 μm protein in a buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. To ensure PmDsbA remained reduced throughout the entire measurement, reduced samples contained 0.75 mm DTT. Data were fitted to a two-state unfolding model and errors were calculated using Prism 6 (GraphPad) as described previously (41Kurz M. Iturbe-Ormaetxe I. Jarrott R. Shouldice S.R.

Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1485-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The standard redox potential of PmDsbA was measured utilizing the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues in PmDsbA, similar to the method used for EcDsbA (42Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Redox properties of protein disulfide isomerase (DsbA) from Escherichia coli.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In brief, oxidized PmDsbA was equilibrated for 3 h at 25 °C in degassed 100 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, containing 1 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and a range of reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations (0–2000 μm). 200 μl of PmDsbA from each redox condition was dispensed into a 96-well plate (TPP AG, Switzerland, number 92096) and tryptophan fluorescence was measured (excitation wavelength 280 nm, emission 332 nm) using a Synergy H1 microplate reader and Gen5 2.0 software (Biotek). Data were analyzed in Prism 6 (GraphPad) and the redox potential was calculated as described previously for EcDsbA (42Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Redox properties of protein disulfide isomerase (DsbA) from Escherichia coli.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 240 nm of the catalytic thiolate anion is pH-dependent allowing the equilibrium between protonated and deprotonated Cys30 to be measured (43Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Reactivity and ionization of the active site cysteine residues of DsbA, a protein required for disulfide bond formation in vivo.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (CARY 50, Agilent Technologies). Absorbance at 240 and 280 nm were measured over pH values starting at 6.5 and decreasing to 2.0, in 0.25 pH unit increments. Samples contained either oxidized or reduced PmDsbA (40 μm) in composite buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm KH2PO4, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA) at 22 °C. The pKa value was calculated from the fitted curves using the Henderson Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa − log ([A240/A280]red/[A240/A280]ox)). Average and mean ± S.D. from triplicate measurements are plotted. DsbA enzymes can reduce the intermolecular disulfide bonds between insulin chains A and B under mild reducing conditions (27Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Identification of a protein required for disulfide bond formation in vivo.Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond reduction of insulin can be followed spectrophotometrically at λ = 650 nm (A650 nm). The A650 nm value gives a measure of turbidity, which occurs as a result of the increase in production of insoluble B chain of insulin (44Holmgren A. Thioredoxin catalyzes the reduction of insulin disulfides by dithiothreitol and dihydrolipoamide.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were prepared in 1-cm cuvettes containing 10 μm protein (PmDsbA, EcDsbA, or EcDsbC), 0.33 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA in 100 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.0. Catalysis was initiated by the addition of 0.131 mm insulin (I0516, Sigma) to the mixture. The assay was repeated three times and the mean ± S.D. of the measurement at each time point was calculated. Peptides were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis on rink-amide (4-methyl)benzhydrylamine resin (ChemImpex International, Wood Dale, IL) with a loading of 0.65 mmol/g. De-protection of the resin and amino acids was performed using an 80:20 (v/v) mixture of dimethylformamide/piperidine (Rci Labscan, Bangkok Thailand/Auspep, Australia) for 2 × 5 min. l-Amino acids (ChemImpex International) were activated using 4 resin equivalents (eq) and 4 eq of HbtU (O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, ChemImpex International) (500 mm) and 5 eq of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Auspep, Australia) for 5 min before coupling to the de-protected resin for 60 min. After the final coupling, all peptides were acetylated at the N terminus using 4 eq of acetic acid (Chem Supply, Australia), 4 eq of HbtU, and 5 eq of N,N-diisopropylethylamine for 30 min. Cleaving was executed using a 95:2.5:1.25:1.25 (v/v) mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/ethanedithiol/triisopropylsilane/water (H2O) (chemicals from Sigma). Cleaved peptides resulted in an amidated C terminus from the resin rink-amide and dried using N2 gas"
https://openalex.org/W2050931386,"Müller cells, the principal glial cells of the vertebrate retina, are fundamental for the maintenance and function of neuronal cells. In most vertebrates, including humans, Müller cells abundantly express Kir4.1 inwardly rectifying potassium channels responsible for hyperpolarized membrane potential and for various vital functions such as potassium buffering and glutamate clearance; inter-species differences in Kir4.1 expression were, however, observed. Localization and function of potassium channels in Müller cells from the retina of crocodiles remain, hitherto, unknown.We studied retinae of the Spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus fuscus), endowed with both diurnal and nocturnal vision, by (i) immunohistochemistry, (ii) whole-cell voltage-clamp, and (iii) fluorescent dye tracing to investigate K+ channel distribution and glia-to-neuron communications.Immunohistochemistry revealed that caiman Müller cells, similarly to other vertebrates, express vimentin, GFAP, S100β, and glutamine synthetase. In contrast, Kir4.1 channel protein was not found in Müller cells but was localized in photoreceptor cells. Instead, 2P-domain TASK-1 channels were expressed in Müller cells. Electrophysiological properties of enzymatically dissociated Müller cells without photoreceptors and isolated Müller cells with adhering photoreceptors were significantly different. This suggests ion coupling between Müller cells and photoreceptors in the caiman retina. Sulforhodamine-B injected into cones permeated to adhering Müller cells thus revealing a uni-directional dye coupling.Our data indicate that caiman Müller glial cells are unique among vertebrates studied so far by predominantly expressing TASK-1 rather than Kir4.1 K+ channels and by bi-directional ion and uni-directional dye coupling to photoreceptor cells. This coupling may play an important role in specific glia-neuron signaling pathways and in a new type of K+ buffering."
https://openalex.org/W2031396537,"The transition from healthy myocardium to hypertensive heart disease is characterized by a series of poorly understood changes in myocardial tissue microstructure. Incremental alterations in the orientation and integrity of myocardial fibers can be assessed using advanced ultrasonic image analysis. We used a modified algorithm to investigate left ventricular myocardial microstructure based on analysis of the reflection intensity at the myocardial-pericardial interface on B-mode echocardiographic images. We evaluated the extent to which the novel algorithm can differentiate between normal myocardium and hypertensive heart disease in humans as well as in a mouse model of afterload resistance. The algorithm significantly differentiated between individuals with uncomplicated essential hypertension (N = 30) and healthy controls (N = 28), even after adjusting for age and sex (P = 0.025). There was a trend in higher relative wall thickness in hypertensive individuals compared to controls (P = 0.08), but no difference between groups in left ventricular mass (P = 0.98) or total wall thickness (P = 0.37). In mice, algorithm measurements (P = 0.026) compared with left ventricular mass (P = 0.053) more clearly differentiated between animal groups that underwent fixed aortic banding, temporary aortic banding, or sham procedure, on echocardiography at 7 weeks after surgery. Based on sonographic signal intensity analysis, a novel imaging algorithm provides an accessible, non-invasive measure that appears to differentiate normal left ventricular microstructure from myocardium exposed to chronic afterload stress. The algorithm may represent a particularly sensitive measure of the myocardial changes that occur early in the course of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2085885318,"The Loz1 transcription factor from Schizosaccharomyces pombe plays an essential role in zinc homeostasis by repressing target gene expression in zinc-replete cells. To determine how Loz1 function is regulated by zinc, we employed a genetic screen to isolate mutants with impaired zinc-dependent gene expression and analyzed Loz1 protein truncations to map a minimal zinc-responsive domain. In the screen, we isolated 36 new loz1 alleles. 27 of these alleles contained mutations resulting in the truncation of the Loz1 protein. The remaining nine alleles contained point mutations leading to an amino acid substitution within a C-terminal double zinc finger domain. Further analysis of two of these substitutions revealed that they disrupted Loz1 DNA activity in vitro. By analyzing Loz1 protein truncations, we found that the last 96 amino acids of Loz1 was the smallest region that was able to confer partial zinc-dependent repression in vivo. This 96-amino acid region contains the double zinc finger domain and an accessory domain that enhances DNA binding. These results were further supported by the findings that MtfA, a transcription factor from Aspergillus nidulans that contains a related double zinc finger, is unable to complement loz1Δ, whereas a chimera of MtfA containing the Loz1 accessory domain is able to complement loz1Δ. Together, our studies indicate that the double zinc finger domain and adjacent accessory domain preceding zinc finger 1 are necessary for DNA binding and zinc-dependent repression."
https://openalex.org/W1965248584,"In Trichomonas vaginalis, a Myb1 protein was previously demonstrated to repress transcription of an iron-inducible ap65-1 gene. In this study, a human cyclophilin A homologue, TvCyclophilin 1 (TvCyP1), was identified as a Myb1-binding protein using a bacterial two-hybrid library screening system. The recombinant TvCyP1 exhibited typical peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity with kcat/Km of ∼7.1 μm(-1) s(-1). In a pulldown assay, the His-tagged Myb1 interacted with a GST-TvCyP1 fusion protein, which had an enzymatic proficiency half that of recombinant TvCyP1. Both the enzymatic proficiency of GST-TvCyP1 and its binding to His-Myb1 were eliminated by mutation of Arg(63) in the catalytic motif or inhibited by cyclosporin A. TvCyP1 was primarily localized to the hydrogenosomes by immunofluorescence assay, but it was also co-purified with Myb1 in certain vesicle fractions from differential and gradient centrifugations. Transgenic cells overexpressing HA-TvCyP1 had a higher level of nuclear Myb1 but a much lower level of Myb1 associated with the vesicles than control and those overexpressing HA-TvCyP1(R63A). Myb1 was detected at a much higher level in the HA-TvCyP1 protein complex than in the HA-TvCyP1(R63A) protein complex immunoprecipitated from P15 and P100, but not S100, fractions of postnuclear lysates. A TvCyP1-binding motif, (105)YGPKWNK(111), was identified in Myb1 in which Gly(106) and Pro(107) were essential for its binding to TvCyP1. Mutation of Gly(106) and Pro(107), respectively, in HA-Myb1 resulted in cytoplasmic retention and elevated nuclear translocation of the overexpressed protein. These results suggest that TvCyP1 may induce the release of Myb1 that is restrained to certain cytoplasmic vesicles prior to its nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2040214100,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibition inhibits cancer cell proliferation through depleting client oncoproteins and shutting down multiple oncogenic pathways. Therefore, it is an attractive strategy for targeting human cancers. Several HSP90 inhibitors, including AUY922 and STA9090, show promising effects in clinical trials. However, the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors may be limited by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-mediated feedback mechanisms. Here, we identify, through an siRNA screen, that the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase MLL1 functions as a coactivator of HSF1 in response to HSP90 inhibition. MLL1 is recruited to the promoters of HSF1 target genes and regulates their expression in response to HSP90 inhibition. In addition, a striking combination effect is observed when MLL1 depletion is combined with HSP90 inhibition in various human cancer cell lines and tumor models. Thus, targeting MLL1 may block a HSF1-mediated feedback mechanism induced by HSP90 inhibition and provide a new avenue to enhance HSP90 inhibitor activity in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2089051561,"Although the bactericidal effect of copper has been known for centuries, there is a current resurgence of interest in the use of this element as an antimicrobial agent. During this study the use of dendritic copper microparticles embedded in an alginate matrix as a rapid method for the deactivation of Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 was investigated. The copper/alginate produced a decrease in the minimum inhibitory concentration from free copper powder dispersed in the media from 0.25 to 0.065 mg/ml. Beads loaded with 4% Cu deactivated 99.97% of bacteria after 90 minutes, compared to a 44.2% reduction in viability in the equivalent free copper powder treatment. There was no observed loss in the efficacy of this method with increasing bacterial loading up to 106 cells/ml, however only 88.2% of E. coli were deactivated after 90 minutes at a loading of 108 cells/ml. The efficacy of this method was highly dependent on the oxygen content of the media, with a 4.01% increase in viable bacteria observed under anoxic conditions compared to a >99% reduction in bacterial viability in oxygen tensions above 50% of saturation. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the beads indicated that the dendritic copper particles sit as discrete clusters within a layered alginate matrix, and that the external surface of the beads has a scale-like appearance with dendritic copper particles extruding. E. coli cells visualised using SEM indicated a loss of cellular integrity upon Cu bead treatment with obvious visible blebbing. This study indicates the use of microscale dendritic particles of Cu embedded in an alginate matrix to effectively deactivate E. coli cells and opens the possibility of their application within effective water treatment processes, especially in high particulate waste streams where conventional methods, such as UV treatment or chlorination, are ineffective or inappropriate."

The Nedd4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases interacts with a number of transporters and channels via PY motifs. A comparison of NHE3 sequences revealed the presence of PY motifs in NHE3s from human and several non-human primates but not in non-primate NHE3s. In this study we evaluated the differences between human and non-primate NHE3s in ubiquitination and interaction with Nedd4-2. We found that Nedd4-2 ubiquitinated human NHE3 (hNHE3) and altered its expression and activity. Surprisingly, rat NHE3 co-immunoprecipitated Nedd4-2, but its expression and activity were not altered by silencing of Nedd4-2. Ubiquitination by Nedd4-2 rendered hNHE3 to undergo internalization at a significantly greater rate than non-primate NHE3s without altering protein stability. Insertion of a PY motif in rabbit NHE3 recapitulated the interaction with Nedd4-2 and enhanced internalization. Thus, we propose a new model where disruption of Nedd4-2 interaction elevates hNHE3 expression and activity.

https://openalex.org/W2010080293,"Regular intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is used to replace antibody deficiency in primary immunodeficiency diseases; however the therapeutic effect seems to be related not only to antibody replacement but also to an active role in the modulation of the immune response. Common variable immunodeficiency is the most frequent primary immunodeficiency seen in clinical practice.We have studied the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin replacement in patients with common variable immunodeficiency by evaluating the gene-expression profiles from Affimetrix HG-U133A. Some of the gene array results were validated by real time RT-PCR and by the measurement of circulating cytokines and chemokines by ELISA. Moreover we performed FACS analysis of blood mononuclear cells from the patients enrolled in the study.A series of genes involved in innate and acquired immune responses were markedly up- or down-modulated before therapy. Such genes included CD14, CD36, LEPR, IRF-5, RGS-1, CD38, TNFRSF25, IL-4, CXCR4, CCR3, IL-8. Most of these modulated genes showed an expression similar to that of normal controls after immunoglobulin replacement. Real time RT-PCR of selected genes and serum levels of IL-4, CXCR4 before and after therapy changed accordingly to gene array results. Interestingly, serum levels of IL-8 remained unchanged, as the corresponding gene, before and after treatment. FACS analysis showed a marked decrease of CD8+T cells and an increase of CD4+T cells following treatment. Moreover we observed a marked increase of CD23⁻CD27⁻IgM⁻IgG⁻ B cells (centrocytes).Our results are in accordance with previous reports and provide further support to the hypothesis that the benefits of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy are not only related to antibody replacement but also to its ability to modulate the immune response in common variable immunodeficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2168538763,"The distribution of radiocesium was examined in bamboo shoots, Phyllostachys pubescens, collected from 10 sites located some 41 to 1140 km from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Japan, in the Spring of 2012, 1 year after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Maximum activity concentrations for radiocesium ¹³⁴Cs and ¹³⁷Cs in the edible bamboo shoot parts, 41 km away from the Fukushima Daiichi plant, were in excess of 15.3 and 21.8 kBq/kg (dry weight basis; 1.34 and 1.92 kBq/kg, fresh weight), respectively. In the radiocesium-contaminated samples, the radiocesium activities were higher in the inner tip parts, including the upper edible parts and the apical culm sheath, than in the hardened culm sheath and underground basal parts. The radiocesium/potassium ratios also tended to be higher in the inner tip parts. The radiocesium activities increased with bamboo shoot length in another bamboo species, Phyllostachys bambusoides, suggesting that radiocesium accumulated in the inner tip parts during growth of the shoots."
https://openalex.org/W1983688836,"This study investigated the neuromagnetic activities of self-paced finger lifting task and electrical median nerve stimulation in ten writer's cramp patients and fourteen control subjects. The event-related de/synchronizations (ERD/ERS) of beta-band activity levels were evaluated and the somatosensory cortical activity levels were analyzed using equivalent-current dipole modeling. No significant difference between the patients and control subjects was found in the electrical stimulation-induced beta ERS and electrical evoked somatosensory cortical responses. Movement-related beta ERD did not differ between controls and patients. Notably, the amplitude of the beta ERS after termination of finger movement was significantly lower in the patients than in the control subjects. The reduced movement-related beta ERS might reflect an impairment of motor cortex deactivation. In conclusion, a motor dependent dysregulation of the sensorimotor network seems to be involved in the functional impairment of patients with writer's cramp."
https://openalex.org/W1969465999,"The neurological bases of spatial navigation are mainly investigated in rodents and seldom in primates. The few studies led on spatial navigation in both human and non-human primates are performed in virtual, not in real environments. This is mostly because of methodological difficulties inherent in conducting research on freely-moving monkeys in real world environments. There is some incertitude, however, regarding the extrapolation of rodent spatial navigation strategies to primates. Here we present an entirely new platform for investigating real spatial navigation in rhesus monkeys. We showed that monkeys can learn a pathway by using different strategies. In these experiments three monkeys learned to drive the wheelchair and to follow a specified route through a real maze. After learning the route, probe tests revealed that animals successively use three distinct navigation strategies based on i) the place of the reward, ii) the direction taken to obtain reward or iii) a cue indicating reward location. The strategy used depended of the options proposed and the duration of learning. This study reveals that monkeys, like rodents and humans, switch between different spatial navigation strategies with extended practice, implying well-conserved brain learning systems across different species. This new task with freely driving monkeys provides a good support for the electrophysiological and pharmacological investigation of spatial navigation in the real world by making possible electrophysiological and pharmacological investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2089236771,"Staphylococcus aureus forms giant colonies on soft-agar surfaces, which is called colony-spreading. In the present study, we searched for host factors that influence S. aureus colony-spreading activity. The addition of calf serum, porcine serum, or silkworm hemolymph to soft-agar medium stimulated S. aureus colony-spreading activity. Gel filtration column chromatography of calf serum produced a high molecular weight fraction and a low molecular weight fraction, both of which exhibited colony-spreading stimulatory activity. In the low molecular weight fraction, we identified the stimulatory factor as bovine serum albumin. The stimulatory fraction in the high molecular weight fraction was identified as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Delipidation of HDL abolished the stimulatory activity of HDL. Phosphatidylcholine, which is the major lipid component in HDL particles, stimulated the colony-spreading activity. Other phosphatidylcholine-containing lipoprotein particles, low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein, also showed colony-spreading stimulatory activity. These findings suggest that S. aureus colony-spreading activity is stimulated by albumin and lipoprotein particles in mammalian serum."
https://openalex.org/W1969146785,"Background A recent meta-analysis found that secreted phosphoprotein-1 (SPP1) can predict the risk of both osteoporosis and fracture. No study has explored the association of SPP1 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) and haplotypes with bone mineral density (BMD). Methods This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 1,313 healthy Taiwanese women aged 40 to 55 years were recruited from MJ Health Management Institute from 2009 to 2010. BMD was dichotomized into high and low BMD groups. Three common (allele frequency ≥5%) htSNPs were selected to examine the association between sequence variants of SPP1 and BMD. Results Homozygosity for the T allele of rs4754 were protective from low BMD [TT vs. CC: adjusted OR (AOR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83–0.89]. A protective effect was also found for women carrying 2 copies of Hap3 TCT (AOR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34–0.95). Menopausal status marginally interacted with SPP1 rs6839524 on BMD (p = 0.049). Postmenopausal women carrying variant rs6839524 (GG+GC vs. CC: AOR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.06–5.20) or Hap1 TGC (AOR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.06–5.24) were associated with 2.4-fold risk of low BMD. For women with low BMI (<18.5 kg/m2), variant rs6839524 (AOR = 7.64) and Hap1 (AOR = 6.42) were associated with increased risk of low BMD. These findings did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple tests. Conclusions SPP1 htSNP protected against low BMD in middle-aged women. SPP1 genetic markers may be important for the prediction of osteoporosis at an early age."
https://openalex.org/W2093152159,"The use of siRNAs to knock down gene expression can potentially be an approach to treat various diseases. To avoid siRNA toxicity the less transcriptionally active H1 pol III promoter, rather than the U6 promoter, was proposed for siRNA expression. To identify highly efficacious siRNA sequences, extensive screening is required, since current computer programs may not render ideal results. Here, we used CCR5 gene silencing as a model to investigate a rapid and efficient screening approach. We constructed a chimeric luciferase-CCR5 gene for high-throughput screening of siRNA libraries. After screening approximately 900 shRNA clones, 12 siRNA sequences were identified. Sequence analysis demonstrated that most (11 of the 12 sequences) of these siRNAs did not match those identified by available siRNA prediction algorithms. Significant inhibition of CCR5 in a T-lymphocyte cell line and primary T cells by these identified siRNAs was confirmed using the siRNA lentiviral vectors to infect these cells. The inhibition of CCR5 expression significantly protected cells from R5 HIV-1JRCSF infection. These results indicated that the high-throughput screening method allows efficient identification of siRNA sequences to inhibit the target genes at low levels of expression."
https://openalex.org/W1993232393,"Specific protein interactions are responsible for most biological functions. Distinguishing Functionally Linked Interfaces of Proteins (FLIPs), from Functionally uncorrelated Contacts (FunCs), is therefore important to characterizing these interactions. To achieve this goal, we have created a database of protein structures called FLIPdb, containing proteins belonging to various functional sub-categories. Here, we use geometric features coupled with Kortemme and Baker's computational alanine scanning method to calculate the energetic sensitivity of each amino acid at the interface to substitution, identify hotspots, and identify other factors that may contribute towards an interface being FLIP or FunC. Using Principal Component Analysis and K-means clustering on a training set of 160 interfaces, we could distinguish FLIPs from FunCs with an accuracy of 76%. When these methods were applied to two test sets of 18 and 170 interfaces, we achieved similar accuracies of 78% and 80%. We have identified that FLIP interfaces have a stronger central organizing tendency than FunCs, due, we suggest, to greater specificity. We also observe that certain functional sub-categories, such as enzymes, antibody-heavy-light, antibody-antigen, and enzyme-inhibitors form distinct sub-clusters. The antibody-antigen and enzyme-inhibitors interfaces have patterns of physical characteristics similar to those of FunCs, which is in agreement with the fact that the selection pressures of these interfaces is differently evolutionarily driven. As such, our ECR model also successfully describes the impact of evolution and natural selection on protein-protein interfaces. Finally, we indicate how our ECR method may be of use in reducing the false positive rate of docking calculations."
