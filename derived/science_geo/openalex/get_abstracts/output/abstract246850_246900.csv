https://openalex.org/W2067102106,"To investigate the role of astrocytes in regulating synaptic transmission, we generated inducible transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative SNARE domain selectively in astrocytes to block the release of transmitters from these glial cells. By releasing adenosine triphosphate, which accumulates as adenosine, astrocytes tonically suppressed synaptic transmission, thereby enhancing the dynamic range for long-term potentiation and mediated activity-dependent, heterosynaptic depression. These results indicate that astrocytes are intricately linked in the regulation of synaptic strength and plasticity and provide a pathway for synaptic cross-talk."
https://openalex.org/W1968220278,"Increases in p53 protein levels after DNA damage have largely been attributed to an increase in the half-life of p53 protein. Here we demonstrate that increased translation of p53 mRNA is also a critical step in the induction of p53 protein in irradiated cells. Ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26) and nucleolin were found to bind to the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of p53 mRNA and to control p53 translation and induction after DNA damage. RPL26 preferentially binds to the 5′UTR after DNA damage, and its overexpression enhances association of p53 mRNA with heavier polysomes, increases the rate of p53 translation, induces G1 cell-cycle arrest, and augments irradiation-induced apoptosis. Opposite effects were seen when RPL26 expression was inhibited. In contrast, nucleolin overexpression suppresses p53 translation and induction after DNA damage, whereas nucleolin downregulation promotes p53 expression. These findings demonstrate the importance of increased translation of p53 in DNA-damage responses and suggest critical roles for RPL26 and nucleolin in affecting p53 induction."
https://openalex.org/W2147276820,"A fundamental assumption of theories of decision-making is that we detect mismatches between intention and outcome, adjust our behavior in the face of error, and adapt to changing circumstances. Is this always the case? We investigated the relation between intention, choice, and introspection. Participants made choices between presented face pairs on the basis of attractiveness, while we covertly manipulated the relationship between choice and outcome that they experienced. Participants failed to notice conspicuous mismatches between their intended choice and the outcome they were presented with, while nevertheless offering introspectively derived reasons for why they chose the way they did. We call this effect choice blindness."

In patients, PDE inhibitors have been linked to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, although the mechanisms are not understood. We show that PDE4D gene inactivation in mice results in a progressive cardiomyopathy, accelerated heart failure after myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrhythmias. The phosphodiesterase 4D3 (PDE4D3) was found in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium-release-channel complex (required for excitation-contraction [EC] coupling in heart muscle). PDE4D3 levels in the RyR2 complex were reduced in failing human hearts, contributing to PKA-hyperphosphorylated, “leaky” RyR2 channels that promote cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias and dysfunction associated with PDE4 inhibition or deficiency were suppressed in mice harboring RyR2 that cannot be PKA phosphorylated. These data suggest that reduced PDE4D activity causes defective RyR2-channel function associated with heart failure and arrhythmias.

These data suggest that reduced PDE4D activity causes defective RyR2-channel function associated with heart failure and arrhythmias. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) control the temporal and spatial dynamics of the second messenger 3′,5′ cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), allowing for highly localized cAMP gradients in cells (Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002Zaccolo M. Pozzan T. Discrete microdomains with high concentration of cAMP in stimulated rat neonatal cardiac myocytes.Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Localization of PDEs in close proximity to cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is thought to control access of cAMP to the regulatory kinase subunit (Conti et al., 2003Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C.

PKA phosphorylation of proteins mediates a wide variety of signals, including those generated during activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as part of the “fight or flight” response. On the other hand, chronic activation of the SNS is a characteristic finding in heart failure, and acute stimulation of the SNS has been linked to triggered arrhythmias associated with sudden cardiac death. In the heart, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) contributes to the regulation of cAMP levels in cardiac myocytes. In particular, PDE4 cAMP-hydrolyzing activity has been localized to the transverse (T) tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) junctional space that is involved in excitation-contraction coupling (Mongillo et al., 2004Mongillo M.

PDEs have been shown to be components of macromolecular signaling complexes via binding to targeting proteins including muscle A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (Dodge et al., 2001Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S. Mouton R. Hill E.V. Houslay M.D. Langeberg L.K.

PDEs in cardiac muscle are complexed with proteins that mediate signals from SNS, including β-adrenergic receptors and β-arrestin (Mongillo et al., 2004Mongillo M. McSorley T. Evellin S. Sood A.

USA. 2005; 102: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The PDE superfamily is subgrouped into 11 families that include at least 20 genes and 50 unique isoforms. Of these PDE families, only PDE4, PDE7, and PDE8 are cAMP specific (Conti et al., 2003Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C. Livera G. Park J.Y. Jin C. Cyclic AMP-specific PDE4 phosphodiesterases as critical components of cyclic AMP signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5493-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Through alternative splicing and the use of multiple promotors, the PDE4D gene encodes nine variants (PDE4D1–9) with identical catalytic domains and carboxyl termini and unique amino termini important for subcellular localization. For example, PDE4D3 binds to the targeting protein mAKAP via its unique N-terminal region, creating a mAKAP-PKA-PDE4D3 signaling module (Dodge et al., 2001Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S.

Moreover, mAKAP colocalizes with the ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium-release channel in cardiac muscle (Ruehr et al., 2003Ruehr M.L. Russell M.A. Ferguson D.G. Bhat M. Ma J. Damron D.S. Scott J.D.

PKA-PDE signaling has been identified as a therapeutic target in several major diseases (Conti et al., 2003Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C. Livera G. Park J.Y. Jin C.

However, nonspecific PDE inhibition with theophylline, commonly used to treat asthma and COPD, and trials using PDE3 inhibition to treat heart failure have demonstrated increased mortality due to cardiac arrhythmias (Barnes, 2003Barnes P.J.

We now show that PDE4D deficiency in mice is associated with a cardiac phenotype comprised of a progressive, age-related cardiomyopathy and exercise-induced arrhythmias, despite normal global cAMP signaling. Furthermore, PDE4D3 was found to be an integral component of the RyR2 macromolecular signaling complex. RyR2 located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the major Ca2+-release channel required for excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle. RyR2 channels were PKA hyperphosphorylated and exhibited a “leaky” phenotype in PDE4D-deficient mice, similar to RyR2 defects observed in patients with heart failure and sudden cardiac death (SCD) (Marx et al., 2000Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R.

In failing human hearts, PDE4D3 levels were reduced in the RyR2 complex. Moreover, mice with PDE4D deficiency exhibited accelerated progression of heart failure following myocardial infarction associated with RyR2 channels that were PKA hyperphosphorylated and exhibited a “leaky” phenotype. Pharmacological PDE4 inhibition was associated with exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmias that were suppressed in mice harboring a mutation that prevents PKA phosphorylation of the RyR2 channel. Our data suggest that PDE4D deficiency may contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias by promoting defective regulation of the RyR2 channel. To explore the consequences of chronic PDE4D deficiency on cardiac function, we used a mouse model of PDE4D gene inactivation (Jin et al., 1999Jin S.L. Richard F.J. Kuo W.P. D’Ercole A.J. Conti M. Impaired growth and fertility of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11998-12003Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Echocardiography of PDE4D−/− mice showed a progressive, age-dependent increase in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), a hallmark of cardiac dysfunction (Figure 1A ; n = 12 each for wild-type [wt] and PDE4D−/−). PDE4D−/− mice exhibited increased heart-weight-to-body-weight (HW/BW) ratios compared to wt controls (Figure 1B). PDE4D−/− mice had reduced ejection fractions (EF) and cardiac contractility (dP/dt)/Pid, documented by cardiac catheterization (Figures 1C and 1D). Histologic examination of PDE4D−/− hearts confirmed that the 15-month-old hearts were dilated, with no other structural abnormalities (Figure 1E). These data show that PDE4D deficiency is associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction consistent with a dilated cardiomyopathy similar to that seen in patients with chronic heart failure. It is well established that chronic hyperadrenergic signaling is associated with heart failure. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the mechanism underlying the observed cardiac phenotype in PDE4D−/− mice was increased global cAMP signaling. However, there were no significant differences in global cAMP levels and β-adrenergic receptors in hearts from PDE4D−/− mice (Figures 2A–2C ). Total cAMP-hydrolyzing activity of PDE in the heart was only slightly decreased in PDE4D−/− mice (data not shown), consistent with PDE4D activity representing only a fraction of total cytosolic PDE cAMP-hydrolyzing activity in the heart (Mongillo et al., 2004Mongillo M. McSorley T. Evellin S. Sood A. Lissandron V. Terrin A. Huston E. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. Pozzan T. et al.Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based analysis of cAMP dynamics in live neonatal rat cardiac myocytes reveals distinct functions of compartmentalized phosphodiesterases.Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, Richter et al., 2005Richter W. Jin S.L. Conti M. Splice variants of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase PDE4D are differentially expressed and regulated in rat tissue.Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, rolipram-sensitive PDE4 activity in PDE4D−/− heart was reduced by ∼50% (data not shown). Whereas global cAMP signaling was not perturbed in PDE4D-deficient mice, there was a significant increase in localized cAMP levels at the cardiomyocyte Z line (corresponding to the location of the RyR2 channel) in cardiomyocytes isolated from PDE4D−/− mice following a low dose (1 nM) of isoproterenol (Figures 2D and 2E). Thus, the abnormalities observed in cardiac function of PDE4D−/− mice must be explained by defects in localized cAMP-dependent signaling. While many proteins in the heart are regulated by PKA phosphorylation and therefore can be affected by altered PDE4D gene expression, only a limited number of these PKA substrates are known to be dysregulated by PKA during heart failure. For example, it has been shown that PKA phosphorylation of phospholamban, a regulator of the SR Ca2+ uptake pump (SERCA2a), is decreased in heart failure. In contrast, of the other proteins known to be involved in regulating cardiac contractility, the SR Ca2+-release channel, RyR2, has been shown to be PKA hyperphosphorylated in heart failure (Antos et al., 2001Antos C.L.

Lokuta A.J. Farrell E.F. Wolff M.R. Haworth R.A. Valdivia H.H. Abnormal Ca2+ release, but normal ryanodine receptors, in canine and human heart failure.Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Given that RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation has been linked to cardiac dysfunction in humans and animal models and that cAMP concentrations are increased in the compartment of RyR2 Ca2+ release (Figures 2D and 2E), we sought to determine whether RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation might play a role in the observed cardiac phenotype in PDE4D−/− mice. Indeed, there was a progressive, age-dependent increase in PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 on Ser2808 (detected using a phosphoepitope-specific antibody) in PDE4D−/− mouse hearts (Figures 3A and 3B ). PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in PDE4D−/− mouse hearts was associated with depletion of the RyR2-stabilizing protein calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) that prevents Ca2+ leak from the SR into the cytosol through RyR2 during diastole in the heart (Figure 3C) (Marx et al., 2000Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R.

Increased PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 was not caused by increased protein levels of PKA catalytic and regulatory subunits in the RyR2 complex (Figure 3A). Moreover, no changes in PP1 or PP2A phosphatase levels in the RyR2-complex levels were detected (data not shown). Phosphorylation of RyR2 by another kinase that phosphorylates the channel, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase A (CaMKII) (detected using a phosphoepitope-specific antibody), was not altered in PDE4D−/− mouse hearts (Figures 3A and 3D). In wt mice, PDE activity was associated with immunoprecipitated RyR2 channels (Figure 3E). RyR2-associated PDE activity was almost completely inhibited by the PDE4 antagonist rolipram but not by the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone. Moreover, PDE activity specifically associated with RyR2 channels was reduced to zero in the PDE4D−/− mice (Figure 3E). Taken together, these data suggested that one consequence of PDE4D deficiency is PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2, which has previously been associated with heart failure (Marx et al., 2000Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R.

Moreover, it appeared that the PDE activity associated with the RyR2 complex was encoded by the PDE4D gene. To ascertain the functional consequences of PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in hearts from PDE4D-deficient mice, we examined the single-channel properties of RyR2 in planar lipid bilayers. Compared to channels from wt mice, RyR2 from PDE4D−/− mice exhibited significantly increased open probability (Po) and frequency of openings (Fo) and decreased mean open and closed times when channels were examined under conditions that mimic diastole in the heart (cytosolic (cis) [Ca2+] 150 nM) (Figures 3F and 3G). Thus, PKA hyperphosphorylation of cardiac RyR2 in PDE4D-deficient mice was associated with the same defects in RyR2-channel function (“leaky” channels) previously linked to human heart failure (Marx et al., 2000Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R.

The finding that the PDE activity that coimmunoprecipitates with RyR2 was abrogated in channels from PDE4D−/− mouse hearts (Figure 3E) raised the possibility that a protein encoded by the PDE4D gene is an integral component of the RyR2 macromolecular signaling complex. Four genes constitute the type 4 phosphodiesterase family (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D), and all are expressed as multiple splice variants (Conti et al., 2003Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C.

We generated an isoform-specific antibody against the unique N-terminal epitope of PDE4D3 (Figure 4A ). PDE4D splice variants were identified by RT-PCR in heart (data not shown), and PDE4D3, PDE4D8, and PDE4D9 expression in the heart was demonstrated using isoform-specific antibodies (Figure 4B), confirming that these are the major PDE4D isoforms expressed in heart muscle (Richter et al., 2005Richter W.

J. 2005; 388: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that a specific PDE4D isoform is part of the cardiac RyR2 channel complex, immunoprecipitations were performed using human heart extracts. RyR2 channels were immunoprecipitated with anti-RyR2 antibody and assayed for coimmunoprecipitation of PDE4D3, PDE4D8, or PDE4D9 with RyR2 by immunoblotting. Using isoform-specific PDE4D antibodies, only PDE4D3 was detected in the RyR2 complex. In addition, anti-PDE4D3 antibody was used to coimmunoprecipitate RyR2 (Figure 4B). The interaction between PDE4D3 and RyR2 was specific because PDE4D3 was excluded from immunoprecipitates using control IgG (Figure 4B). Moreover, we used the PDE4D3-specific antibody to show that total PDE4D3 protein was decreased ∼37% in haploinsufficient PDE4D+/− mouse hearts and by 100% in homozygous PDE4D−/− hearts (Figure 4C). Finally, PDE4D3 in the RyR2 macromolecular signaling complex was also decreased by ∼44% in PDE4D+/− mouse hearts and by 100% in PDE4D−/− heart (Figure 4D). Taken together, these data show that PDE4D3 is an integral component of the RyR2 macromolecular complex in the heart and that PDE4D3 is the only PDE isoform in the RyR2 complex. PDE4D3 was also associated with RyR2 from human hearts (Figure 5A ). In human heart failure (HF), PDE4D3 levels in the RyR2 complex were decreased by 43% (normal, n = 6 versus HF, n = 9; p < 0.001), and the RyR2 channels in the human HF samples were PKA hyperphosphorylated (Figure 5B). We have previously shown that PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 depletes calstabin2 from the RyR2 complex and significantly increases channel activity, consistent with a diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in human heart failure (Marx et al., 2000Marx S.O.

The cAMP-hydrolyzing activity of RyR2 bound PDE4D3 was decreased by 42% in human HF samples (n = 6, each experiment was performed in triplicate; p < 0.001), providing a possible explanation for chronic RyR2-Ser2808 PKA hyperphosphorylation observed in failing human hearts (Figure 5C). This reduction in PDE4D3 activity in the human HF RyR2 complex was comparable to that observed in the RyR2 complexes in PDE4D+/− mice (Figure 4D). To explore the basis for the observed reduction in PDE4D3 amount and activity in the HF RyR2 complex, we examined PKA phosphorylation of PDE4D3, which has been shown to increase its activity (Sette and Conti, 1996Sette C.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the coiled-coil protein centriolin localized to the midbody during cytokinesis and was required for abscission. Here we show that centriolin interacts with proteins of vesicle-targeting exocyst complexes and vesicle-fusion SNARE complexes. These complexes require centriolin for localization to a unique midbody-ring structure, and disruption of either complex inhibits abscission. Exocyst disruption induces accumulation of v-SNARE-containing vesicles at the midbody ring. In control cells, these v-SNARE vesicles colocalize with a GFP-tagged secreted polypeptide. The vesicles move to the midbody ring asymmetrically from one prospective daughter cell; the GFP signal is rapidly lost, suggesting membrane fusion; and subsequently the cell cleaves at the site of vesicle delivery/fusion.

We propose that centriolin anchors protein complexes required for vesicle targeting and fusion and integrates membrane-vesicle fusion with abscission. Cytokinesis is a fundamental process that results in division of a single cell with replicated DNA into two daughters with identical genomic composition (see (Glotzer, 2001Glotzer M.

Early events in animal cell cytokinesis include assembly and contraction of the actomyosin ring to form the cleavage furrow. Continued furrowing results in constriction of the plasma membrane to form a narrow cytoplasmic bridge between the two nascent daughter cells. Within this intercellular bridge are bundled microtubules and a multitude of proteins that together form the midbody. In a poorly understood final step called abscission, the cell cleaves at the intercellular bridge to form two daughter cells. Membrane trafficking is required for late stages of cytokinesis (Albertson et al., 2005Albertson R. Riggs B. Sullivan W.

More recent studies in mammalian cells using dominant-negative approaches showed that the membrane-fusion-inducing SNARE components, syntaxin-2 and endobrevin/VAMP8, are required for a final step in cell cleavage (Low et al., 2003Low S.H. Li X. Miura M. Kudo N. Quinones B. Weimbs T. Syntaxin 2 and endobrevin are required for the terminal step of cytokinesis in mammalian cells.Dev.

Recycling endosomes and associated components localize to the midbody and are required for cell cleavage (Monzo et al., 2005Monzo P. Gauthier N.C. Keslair F. Loubat A. Field C.M.

However, little is known about the spatial and temporal control of dynamic membrane compartments and molecules during abscission or how these activities are coordinated to achieve cell cleavage. The role of membrane-vesicle-tethering exocyst complexes in animal cell abscission is poorly understood. The exocyst is a multiprotein complex that targets secretory vesicles to distinct sites on the plasma membrane. In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, exocyst components localize to the mother-bud neck, the site of cytokinesis (Finger et al., 1998Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P.

Exocyst disruption results in accumulation of vesicles at this site (Salminen and Novick, 1989Salminen A. Novick P.J.

Cell cycle-regulated trafficking of Chs2 controls actomyosin ring stability during cytokinesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2529-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast S. pombe, exocyst components localize to the actomyosin ring (Wang et al., 2002Wang H. Tang X. Liu J. Trautmann S. Balasundaram D. McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. The multiprotein exocyst complex is essential for cell separation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mutants for the exocyst component Sec8 accumulate 100 nm “presumptive” secretory vesicles near the division septum and cannot complete extracellular separation of the two daughter cells. A screen for cytokinesis mutants in Drosophila melanogaster identified the exocyst component sec5 (Echard et al., 2004Echard A. Hickson G.R. Foley E. O’Farrell P.H. Terminal cytokinesis events uncovered after an RNAi screen.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1685-1693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and proteomic analysis of the midbody in mammalian cells showed that the exocyst protein sec3 is at the midbody (Skop et al., 2004Skop A.R. Liu H. Yates J. Meyer B.J. Heald R. Dissection of the mammalian midbody proteome reveals conserved cytokinesis mechanisms.Science. 2004; 305 (10.1126/science.1097931) (Published online May 27, 2004.): 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Mammalian exocyst components are involved in secretion in polarized epithelial cells (Yeaman et al., 2004Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J.

Cell. 2005; 16: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but the function of the exocyst during cytokinesis is unclear. Components of membrane-vesicle-tethering and -fusion complexes have been identified in some organisms and linked to cytokinesis, but the pathway that integrates these complexes with vesicle trafficking during cell cleavage is unknown. Little is known about how SNAREs and the exocyst are anchored at the midbody or how they modulate membrane-vesicle organization and fusion to coordinate abscission. Moreover, the origin and dynamics of membrane compartments involved in abscission have not been investigated. In this manuscript, we describe a multistep pathway for abscission that requires a scaffold protein to anchor SNARE and exocyst complexes at a unique midbody site and also requires asymmetric transport and fusion of secretory vesicles at this site. We previously showed that centriolin localized to the midbody during cytokinesis (Gromley et al., 2003Gromley A. Jurczyk A. Sillibourne J. Halilovic E. Mogensen M. Groisman I. Blomberg M. Doxsey S. A novel human protein of the maternal centriole is required for the final stages of cytokinesis and entry into S phase.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Using high-resolution deconvolution microscopy, we now demonstrate that centriolin is part of a unique ring-like structure within the central portion of the midbody, which we call the midbody ring (observed in ∼75% of all telophase cells, Figures 1A–1C ). The midbody ring was 1.5–2 μm in diameter (Figure 1C), contained γ-tubulin (Figure 1D), and colocalized with the phase-dense Flemming body (Figure 1B, inset) (Paweletz, 1967Paweletz N. On the function of the ‘Flemming body’ during division of animal cells.Naturwissenschaften. 1967; 54: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fact, high-magnification phase-contrast imaging revealed that the Flemming body was organized into a ring-like structure (Figure 1E). The midbody ring was flanked by Aurora B kinase, which colocalized with microtubules on either side of the ring (Figure 1B, inset). Several other proteins localized to the midbody ring including ectopically expressed GFP-GAPCenA, a GTPase-activating protein previously shown to localize to centrosomes (Cuif et al., 1999Cuif M.H. Possmayer F. Zander H. Bordes N. Jollivet F. Couedel-Courteille A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Langsley G. Bornens M. Goud B. Characterization of GAPCenA, a GTPase activating protein for Rab6, part of which associates with the centrosome.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Time-lapse imaging of GFP-GAPCenA and other proteins in living cells showed that the midbody ring was dynamic, moving between cells and tipping from side to side to reveal the ring structure (Figure 1F; see also Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In addition, midbody-ring localization of GFP-GAPCenA confirmed the ring structure seen by immunofluorescence microscopy and demonstrated that there were no antibody penetration problems in this midbody region as seen for other antigens (Saxton and McIntosh, 1987Saxton W.M. McIntosh J.R. Interzone microtubule behavior in late anaphase and telophase spindles.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The midbody ring was distinct from the actomyosin ring and did not change in diameter during cytokinesis (Figures 1A and 1B). It appeared during the early stages of actomyosin-ring constriction and persisted until after cell cleavage (see below). The centralspindlin components MKLP-1/CHO1/ZEN-4 (Figure 1G) and MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 (data not shown) also localized to the midbody ring and appeared earlier than centriolin during actomyosin-ring constriction. Depletion of MKLP-1 by RNAi to 18% of control levels (n = 2 experiments) prevented recruitment of centriolin to the ring (Figures 1H and 1I). In contrast, depletion of centriolin had no effect on the localization of MKLP-1 or MgcRacGAP (data not shown). These data suggested that centralspindlin anchored centriolin to the midbody ring. To determine the molecular function of centriolin in cytokinesis, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a 120 amino acid domain of centriolin that is required for the cytokinesis function of centriolin and shares homology with budding- and fission-yeast genes (Nud1/Cdc11) involved in cytokinesis and mitotic exit (Gromley et al., 2003Gromley A. Jurczyk A. Sillibourne J. Halilovic E. Mogensen M. Groisman I. Blomberg M. Doxsey S. A novel human protein of the maternal centriole is required for the final stages of cytokinesis and entry into S phase.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A screen of approximately 12 million clones from a human testis cDNA library yielded two potential interacting proteins: sec15, a member of the exocyst complex, and snapin, a SNARE-associated protein. Additional biochemical analysis confirmed the yeast two-hybrid interactions and demonstrated that centriolin was in a large complex associated with membranes (Figure 2). The centriolin Nud1 domain fused to the DNA binding domain (DBD) and sec15 fused to the activation domain (AD) were coexpressed in the same yeast cells. Immunoprecipitation of the Nud1 fusion protein effectively coprecipitated the sec15 fusion protein (Figure 2C). To test whether other members of the exocyst complex were bound to centriolin, we immunoprecipitated endogenous centriolin from HeLa cell lysates with affinity-purified centriolin antibodies and showed that sec8 and sec5 coprecipitated (Figure 2D). Gel filtration experiments (Superose 6) using MDCK cell lysates demonstrated that centriolin coeluted with fractions containing the exocyst complex (detected with antibodies to sec8 and sec3, Figure 2A). Centriolin was eluted as a single peak that overlapped with peaks of sec3 and sec8. We next asked if centriolin coimmunoprecipitated with the exocyst. Antibodies to sec8 were added to each of the fractions from the gel filtration column, and immune complexes were collected and probed with affinity-purified centriolin antibodies as described (Gromley et al., 2003Gromley A. Jurczyk A. Sillibourne J. Halilovic E. Mogensen M. Groisman I. Blomberg M. Doxsey S. A novel human protein of the maternal centriole is required for the final stages of cytokinesis and entry into S phase.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Centriolin was found only in fractions containing exocyst components (Figure 2A). The centriolin-containing fractions eluted earlier than the peak of sec 3 or sec8, suggesting that the exocyst fraction to which centriolin was bound was different from the cytosolic and lateral plasma-membrane fractions of the exocyst (Yeaman et al., 2004Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Mechanism of recruiting Sec6/8 (exocyst) complex to the apical junctional complex during polarization of epithelial cells.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The exocyst-centriolin fractions did not cofractionate with the bulk of the cellular protein and eluted considerably earlier than thyroglobulin (MW 669,000) suggesting it was part of a large complex. Since the exocyst associates with membrane vesicles, we next tested whether centriolin was also present in membranous fractions. Cell homogenates were prepared in the absence of detergent and underlain at the bottom of linear iodixanol gradients. Isopycnic centrifugation was performed, and fractions were probed for both centriolin and the exocyst component sec8. Centriolin “floated up” to fractions lighter than the cytosol having a buoyant density of δ ∼ 1.14 g/ml (Figure 2B). The centriolin peak cofractionated with a major peak of Sec8 that was slightly less dense than the junction-associated peak of Sec8 described previously in confluent MDCK cells (δ ∼ 1.16 g/ml; Yeaman et al., 2004Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Mechanism of recruiting Sec6/8 (exocyst) complex to the apical junctional complex during polarization of epithelial cells.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Little to no centriolin was observed at other positions in the gradient or in the major protein peak, suggesting that most if not all centriolin was associated with membranes. Taken together, the density gradient, immunoprecipitation, and chromatography data support the conclusion that centriolin associates with the exocyst in a very large complex bound to cellular membranes. The yeast two-hybrid interaction between centriolin and the low-abundance protein snapin was confirmed by showing that endogenous centriolin coimmunoprecipitated a His6-tagged snapin fusion protein expressed in HeLa cells (Figure 2E) and by the centriolin-dependent midbody localization of snapin (see below). Further support for the centriolin-exocyst interaction was obtained by showing that exocyst-complex components localized to the midbody ring with centriolin. HeLa cells were colabeled with antibodies against one of several exocyst components (sec3, sec5, sec8, sec15, exo70, or exo84) and either microtubules or centriolin (Figure 3A ). We found that all these exocyst components localized to the midbody ring during cytokinesis and formed a ring-like structure similar to that seen for centriolin. In fact, double-stained images revealed considerable overlap between sec8 and centriolin, indicating that they were part of the same structure (Figure 3A, panel 1). We also showed that a myc-tagged form of sec8 localized to the midbody ring when expressed in HeLa cells (Figure S1), confirming the localization seen with antibodies directed to the endogenous protein. We next tested whether centriolin was required for midbody-ring localization of the exocyst. siRNA-mediated depletion of centriolin resulted a in ∼70% reduction in centriolin protein levels and complete loss of midbody staining in 24% of cells compared with control cells treated with lamin siRNA (Figures 3B and 3E). Immunofluorescence quantification of midbody signals performed as in our previous studies (Gromley et al., 2003Gromley A. Jurczyk A. Sillibourne J. Halilovic E. Mogensen M. Groisman I. Blomberg M. Doxsey S. A novel human protein of the maternal centriole is required for the final stages of cytokinesis and entry into S phase.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) demonstrated that many of the remaining centriolin-depleted cells had lower levels of midbody staining than controls (48%, n = 23 cells), bringing the total percentage of midbody depleted cells to 72%. Cells that lacked detectable midbody-associated centriolin usually lacked midbody labeling of sec8 (10/10, Figure 3B, panels 1 and 6). Although other exocyst components could not be costained with centriolin because all were detected with rabbit antibodies like centriolin, all were lost from or reduced at midbodies in centriolin-depleted cells (Figure 3B, panels 2–5). For example, Exo84 was undetectable at midbodies in 22% of centriolin-depleted cells (n = 9 cells) or had levels below the lowest control midbody staining in 42% of centriolin-depleted cells (n = 19 cells). Significant reduction in midbody staining of centriolin and other exocyst components was observed with a second siRNA targeting a different centriolin sequence (Gromley et al., 2003Gromley A. Jurczyk A. Sillibourne J. Halilovic E. Mogensen M. Groisman I. Blomberg M. Doxsey S. A novel human protein of the maternal centriole is required for the final stages of cytokinesis and entry into S phase.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To test whether centriolin was dependent on the exocyst complex for localization to the midbody, we initially targeted sec5 for siRNA depletion. Recent studies showed that mutants of sec5 in D. melanogaster disrupted exocyst function (Murthy and Schwarz, 2004Murthy M. Schwarz T.L. The exocyst component Sec5 is required for membrane traffic and polarity in the Drosophila ovary.Development. 2004; 131: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and that RNAi-mediated depletion of sec5 inhibited exocyst-dependent processes in vertebrate cells (Prigent et al., 2003Prigent M. Dubois T. Raposo G. Derrien V. Tenza D. Rosse C. Camonis J. Chavrier P. ARF6 controls post-endocytic recycling through its downstream exocyst complex effector.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We found that depletion of sec5 resulted in loss of midbody-associated sec5 as well as other exocyst components, including sec3, sec8, and sec15 (Figures 3C and 3E). These results show that sec5 depletion disrupts midbody-ring localization of the exocyst. In contrast, neither sec5 nor sec8 loss from the midbody affected the association of centriolin with the midbody ring (Figures 3D and 3E). These data demonstrate that centriolin is required for midbody localization of the exocyst, while localization of centriolin appears to be independent of the exocyst. Localization of the exocyst to the midbody and its interaction with centriolin suggested that the complex might play a role in cytokinesis. To examine this, we disrupted the midbody-associated exocyst using siRNAs targeting sec5 and examined cytokinesis by time-lapse imaging over a 20 hr time period. We found that over half the cells exhibited severe cytokinesis defects, including failure in the final abscission step (42%, Figures 4B and 4C , Movie S3) and delays during cytokinesis (24%, n = 18) compared with control lamin siRNA-treated cells (Figures 4A and 4C, Movie S2). Some cells remained interconnected by thin cytoplasmic bridges (Figure 4B, panel 17:05 and Movie S3) and sometimes entered one or more additional rounds of mitosis while still connected to their partner cells. Sec5-depleted cells viewed for an additional 24 hr showed a similar level of cytokinesis defects (data not shown), suggesting that nearly all cells in the culture experienced cytokinesis problems over time. Cytokinesis defects were also observed when the exocyst was disrupted by siRNA depletion of sec15 and sec8 (data not shown). Cells remained healthy, as no differences in cell morphology or mitochondrial function were observed. These data show that disruption of the exocyst produces late-stage cytokinesis defects similar to centriolin (Gromley et al., 2003Gromley A. Jurczyk A. Sillibourne J. Halilovic E. Mogensen M. Groisman I. Blomberg M. Doxsey S. A novel human protein of the maternal centriole is required for the final stages of cytokinesis and entry into S phase.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and demonstrates a requirement for the exocyst in the final stages of animal cell cytokinesis. Snapin was originally considered to be a neuron-specific protein, but recent studies demonstrated that it is also expressed in nonneuronal cells (Buxton et al., 2003Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Identification and characterization of Snapin as a ubiquitously expressed SNARE-binding protein that interacts with SNAP23 in non-neuronal cells.Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Snapin may facilitate assembly of SNARE complexes and may define a limiting step in vesicle fusion mediated by PKA phosphorylation (Chheda et al., 2001Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Phosphorylation of Snapin by PKA modulates its interaction with the SNARE complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the role of snapin in neurotransmission has been questioned (Vites et al., 2004Vites O. Rhee J.S. Schwarz M. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Reinvestigation of the role of snapin in neurotransmitter release.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26251-26256Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), recent results indicate that it is essential for this process (Thakur et al., 2004Thakur P. Stevens D.R. Sheng Z.H. Rettig J. Effects of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Snapin on synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6476-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The role of snapin in cytokinesis is currently unknown. Using previously characterized antibodies to snapin (Thakur et al., 2004Thakur P. Stevens D.R. Sheng Z.H. Rettig J. Effects of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Snapin on synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6476-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the protein localized to the midbody ring at the same time as the exocyst and shortly after centriolin (Figure 5A , panel 2). Previous immunofluorescence studies showed that the v-SNARE endobrevin/VAMP8 and t-SNARE syntaxin-2 were enriched in the region of the midbody flanking the Flemming body and coincident with microtubules and Aurora B staining (Low et al., 2003Low S.H. Li X. Miura M. Kudo N. Quinones B. Weimbs T. Syntaxin 2 and endobrevin are required for the terminal step of cytokinesis in mammalian cells.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 753-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Using the same antibodies, we confirmed the localization pattern of endobrevin/VAMP8 (Figure 5A, panel 1) and syntaxin-2 (data not shown). Very late in cytokinesis, the intercellular bridge narrows to ∼0.5 μm, and microtubule bundles are reduced in diameter to 0.2–0.5 μm. At this time, endobrevin/VAMP8 and syntaxin-2 joined centriolin, snapin, and the exocyst at the midbody ring (Figure 5A, panels 3 and 4). siRNA depletion of centriolin eliminated the midbody-ring localization of snapin (>35% of cells, Figure 5B), endobrevin/VAMP8 (>20% of cells, Figure 5C), and syntaxin-2 (Figure 5C). Of the remaining cells, 24% and 36% showed midbody staining levels below those of controls for snapin (n = 22) and endobrevin/VAMP8 (n = 25), respectively. As shown earlier, midbody-ring integrity was not compromised under these conditions, as MKLP-1 and MgcRacGAP remained at this site in cells with reduced centriolin. These results indicated that centriolin was required for midbody-ring localization of v- and t-SNARE proteins and the SNARE-associated protein snapin. Midbodies in 41% of snapin-depleted cells showed no detectable snapin staining (Figure 5D). Time-lapse imaging over a 22 hr period showed that 40% of snapin-depleted cells experienced late-stage cytokinesis failure (Figure 5E, Movie S4). Other cells showed long delays and often remained connected by a thin intercellular bridge (data not shown). When cultures were imaged for an additional 24 hr, we observed multicellular syncytia resulting from multiple incomplete divisions and additional individual cells undergoing cytokinesis failure. This suggested that most cells in the population ultimately failed cytokinesis and that some failed multiple times. Occasionally, cells separated when one of the attached daughters re-entered mitosis, possibly due to tensile forces generated by cell rounding during mitosis (Figure 5E, Movie S4). These results demonstrated that snapin was necessary for abscission and suggested that it functioned by anchoring SNARE complexes at the midbody. We next tested whether the late-stage cytokinesis defects observed in this study resulted from changes in membrane trafficking to the midbody. As a first test of this idea, we used brefeldin A, which disr"

Here, we report that in addition to maintaining vacuolar pH, the H + -pyrophosphatase, AVP1, controls auxin transport and consequently auxin-dependent development. AVP1 overexpression results in increased cell division at the onset of organ formation, hyperplasia, and increased auxin transport. In contrast, avp1-1 null mutants have severely disrupted root and shoot development and reduced auxin transport. Changes in the expression of AVP1 affect the distribution and abundance of the P–adenosine triphosphatase and Pinformed 1 auxin efflux facilitator, two proteins implicated in auxin distribution.

Importantly, known mechanisms that ensure the mutually exclusive splicing of pairs of exons cannot explain this phenomenon in Dscam. I have identified two classes of conserved elements in the Dscam exon 6 cluster, which contains 48 alternative exons--the docking site, located in the intron downstream of constitutive exon 5, and the selector sequences, which are located upstream of each exon 6 variant. Strikingly, each selector sequence is complementary to a portion of the docking site, and this pairing juxtaposes one, and only one, alternative exon to the upstream constitutive exon. The mutually exclusive nature of the docking site:selector sequence interactions suggests that the formation of these competing RNA structures is a central component of the mechanism guaranteeing that only one exon 6 variant is included in each Dscam mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2024236819,"Vertebrate female reproduction is limited by the oocyte stockpiles acquired during embryonic development. These are gradually depleted over the organism's lifetime through the process of apoptosis. The timer that triggers this cell death is yet to be identified. We used the Xenopus egg/oocyte system to examine the hypothesis that nutrient stores can regulate oocyte viability. We show that pentose-phosphate-pathway generation of NADPH is critical for oocyte survival and that the target of this regulation is caspase-2, previously shown to be required for oocyte death in mice. Pentose-phosphate-pathway-mediated inhibition of cell death was due to the inhibitory phosphorylation of caspase-2 by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). These data suggest that exhaustion of oocyte nutrients, resulting in an inability to generate NADPH, may contribute to ooctye apoptosis. These data also provide unexpected links between oocyte metabolism, CaMKII, and caspase-2."

DHA is also essential for proper T cell development in neonates (11Field C.J. Clandinin M.T. Van Aerde J.E.

Consequently, TH2 cells are potent suppressors of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, particularly in the central nervous system (14Kuchroo V.K. Das M.P. Brown J.A. Ranger A.M. Zamvil S.S.

Along these lines, the question of whether DHA is a precursor to novel potent lipid mediators was of interest. This laboratory recently identified several novel 17-hydroxyl-containing bioactive chemical mediators derived from DHA that were termed docosatrienes and 17S series resolvins (15Hong S. Gronert K.

Neuroprotectin D1 ((10,17S)-dihydroxydocosatriene; NPD1) appears to be a major bioactive effector from this novel series of docosatrienes that possesses a conjugated triene system with alcohol groups at the 10 and 17 carbon positions as distinguishing features (17Serhan C.N.

At picogram to nanogram levels, NPD1 reduces the infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) into both peritoneal exudates and murine ischemic brain (i.e. experimental stroke), resulting in both anti-inflammation and neuroprotection (15Hong S.

NPD1 was also found recently to inhibit oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (18Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. Serhan C.N. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence indicates that both the generation and resolution of a localized inflammatory or immune response are governed by the migration of leukocytes into the site of injury and proliferation in situ and then by the removal of these cells after antigenic clearance (19Lawrence T. Willoughby D.A. Gilroy D.W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Aberrant leukocyte behavior can lead to chronic inflammation (20D'Ambrosio D. Panina-Bordignon P. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 273: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Greaves D.R. Channon K.M.

Med. 2001; 15: 516-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One of the important mechanisms essential to resolution of the immune response involves the clearance of T cells from the local microenvironment. Hence the efflux or death of T cells in situ significantly contributes to the resolution of inflammatory responses. Conversely, decreased clearance with accumulation of T cells and/or additional inflammatory cells may result in chronic inflammation (23Orteu C.H. Poulter L.W. Rustin M.H. Sabin C.A. Salmon M. Akbar A.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1619-1629PubMed Google Scholar, 24Geng J.G. Cell Res. 2001; 11: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms mediating T cell clearance and resolution are still not fully appreciated, recent results indicate that cytokine deprivation and/or their decreased production by T cells plays an essential role in the clearance of T cells from inflamed tissues and consequently in the resolution of inflammation (25Hanada T. Yoshimura A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 26Riffo-Vasquez Y. Pitchford S. Spina D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 833-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report that human TH2-skewed PBMC specifically express 15-LO type 1 that converts DHA to novel docosatrienes by serving as a 17-lipoxygenase with DHA as substrate. Neuroprotectin D1 is a major product of this novel pathway that regulates leukocyte migration and protein deposition in inflamed tissues, as well as TNFα and IFNγ secretion by activated T cells. This DHA-derived product is also produced by neural and inflammatory tissues (15Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 16Marcheselli V.L. Hong S. Lukiw W.J. Hua Tian X. Gronert K. Musto A. Hardy M. Gimenez J.M. Chiang N.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Because this docosatriene possesses a broader scope of formation and actions and is not restricted to neuronal tissue, we proposed protectin D1 (PD1) in recognition of its wider range of activities and functions in biological systems other than neural systems. Also, PD1 promotes T cell apoptosis via the formation of lipid raft-encoded signaling complexes. Reagents—The following materials were obtained as indicated: DHA, bovine serum albumin, Histopaque-1077, nystatin, FITC-labeled CTX, and alkaline phosphatase substrate from Sigma; 14C-labeled DHA from ARC (St. Louis, MO); RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD); purified and biotinylated mouse anti-human TNFα and IFNγ, and FITC- or PE-conjugated mouse IgG, and GolgyPlug™ from Pharmingen; FITC-conjugated mouse anti-IFNγ and PE-conjugated mouse anti-IL-4 from eBioscience (San Diego, CA); purified Texas Red-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA); Fas ligand from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

PD1 was prepared by biologic synthesis and purified as described previously (15Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Preparation of Human PBMC and T Cells—PBMC were freshly isolated from the venous blood of healthy volunteers by Histopaque-1077 gradient centrifugation as in Ariel et al. (28Ariel A. Chiang N. Arita M. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6266-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). T cells were isolated by incubating PBMC for 2 h on a plastic surface to deplete the monocytes. The nonadherent cells were collected and separated on a human CD3+ enrichment column (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were cultured for use. The purity of these T cells was typically >92%. Human PBMC were skewed to a TH1 or TH2 phenotype by culturing with concanavalin A (1 μg/ml), IL-12 (5 ng/ml), IFNγ (50 ng/ml), and anti-IL-4 (1 μg/ml) or with concanavalin A (1 μg/ml), IL-4 (25 ng/ml), and anti-IFNγ (1 μg/ml), respectively. On days 3 and 6 of culture, IL-2 (5 ng/ml) was added to both cultures, and TH2 cells were added with anti-IFNγ (1 μg/ml). To confirm the skewing, PBMC were collected on day 6 and activated by immobilized anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) + anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml) in the presence of GolgyPlug™ (1:500). After 5 h the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained by FITC-conjugated mouse anti-IFNγ and PE-conjugated mouse anti-IL-4 and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. FITC- or PE-conjugated mouse IgG were used as controls. The stained cells were used for analysis by FACSort (BD Biosciences). Expression and Function of 15-LO in Skewed PBMC—Skewed human PBMC (toward TH1 or TH2 phenotype) were collected after 3–9 days of culture, and their RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse-transcribed for 30 min (50 °C) using the Thermo-Script system (Invitrogen), which was followed by 40 cycles of PCR with specific primers for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 15-LO, and 5-LO using the HotStartTaq-MasterMix kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Amplified cDNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The appropriate nucleotide primers were used to amplify and sequence human 15-LO type 1 (sense, 5′-CAGCCTAGGCAACGTGGTGAAACC-3′; antisense, 5′-CCTCCTGGGTCGTCTCTGTCCTCA-3′) and 5-LO (sense, 5′-ATCAGGACGGACATGAGGAACAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCAGGAACAGCTCGTTTTCCTG-3′). Sequencing was done by the Brigham and Women's Hospital Automatic Genotyping and Sequencing Facility. Expression of 15-LO-1 protein was determined by lysing cells and subjecting the lysate to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotting with anti-15-LO-1 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). LC-MS-MS Analysis—Skewed human PBMC (TH1- or TH2-directed) were collected on days 3–4 and incubated with or without DHA or IL-4 (20 μm or 10 ng/ml respectively, 60 min, 37 °C). In other experiments, PBMC were transfected with 36 pmol of a mixture of three siRNA species directed against 15-LO-1 (ID numbers 2306, 2399, and 2486; Ambion, Austin, TX) or control siRNA (nonspecific control IX siRNA; Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) for 2 h, and then were cultured under TH2-skewing conditions for 4 days with daily additions of the same siRNA species. On day 3 the cells were added with IL-4 and anti-IFNγ as in the initial culturing. Next, the cells were harvested, and samples of the cells were taken for determination of 15-LO-1 expression using FACSort analysis with sheep anti-15-LO-1 and PE-conjugated goat anti-sheep antibodies. Sheep IgG was used as a negative control. The remaining cells were incubated with DHA as above. The incubation was stopped and extracted with high performance liquid chromatography-grade MeOH. The products were isolated with C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) for identification and then subjected to LC-MS-MS as described in Hong et al. (15Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In brief, an MS-MS-based informatic analysis of lipid mediators was performed to determine the production of PD1, (17S)-HDHA, and other DHA-derived oxygenated products using a Finnigan LCQ liquid chromatography ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with a LUNA C18-2 (100 × 2 mm × 5 μm) column, and a photodiode array detector that monitored UV absorbance before the samples entered the MS-MS. The percentage of inhibition of product formation was calculated as follows: (1-(amount of product with control siRNA/amount of product with 15-LO-1 siRNA)) × 100. Murine Peritonitis—Peritonitis was performed using 6–8-week-old FVB male mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) fed with Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001 (Purina Mills), as described previously (17Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were first anesthetized with isoflurane and injected intravenously with 100 ng of PD1, DHA, or vehicle and then injected with 1 ml of zymosan A (1 mg/ml) into the peritoneum. After 2 h the mice were killed, and the peritoneal lavages were rapidly collected for enumeration of leukocytes. For identification of T and B cells in the lavage, the recovered cells were double stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3e and PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD19 (0.5 and 0.2 μg/0.5 × 106 cells, clones 145-2C11 and 1D3, respectively, Pharmingen) and analyzed by FACSort. In some mice, the peritoneal tissues were removed and fixed in 10% neutral formalin for morphologic examination. The peritoneal lining was then excised, and histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. T Cell Incubations—Cytokines (TNFα and IFNγ) produced by human T cells were determined as described in Ariel et al. (28Ariel A. Chiang N. Arita M. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6266-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, human peripheral blood T cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of PD1 or vehicle (0.05% EtOH) for 6 h at 37°C and then in 48-well plates coated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml each) or anti-CD3 alone and cultured for 41 h. The supernatants were collected from the wells and evaluated for TNFα and IFNγ content by a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The percentage inhibition for CD28 co-stimulation was calculated as follows: (amount of cytokine induced by (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28)-amount of cytokine induced by (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 + PD1))/(amount of cytokine induced by (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28)-amount of cytokine induced by anti-CD3). T Cell Apoptosis—Apoptosis of human peripheral blood T cells was detected using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science), which is a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-labeling (TUNEL), as in Lu et al. (29Lu B. Wang L. Medan D. Toledo D. Huang C. Chen F. Shi X. Rojanasakul Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C831-C838Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Human T cells were incubated with 0.1–10 nm PD1 or vehicle for 48 h at 37 °C. In some experiments the cells were pretreated with nystatin (5 μg/ml) prior to incubation with PD1 or vehicle. The cells then were fixed on slides with 4% paraformaldehyde, immersed in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase buffer, and incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase buffer and fluorescein-dUTP for 60 min at 37 °C. Next, the slides were washed with PBS, counterstained with propidium iodide and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Lipid Raft Patches—For fluorescence microscopy, Jurkat cells were immobilized on glass coverslips coated with 1% (v/v) poly-l-lysine for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with PD1 (0.1–50.0 nm), Fas ligand (2 ng/ml), (18R)-THEPE (10 nm), or DHA (1 μm). In some experiments the cells were pretreated with nystatin (5 μg/ml) before being incubated with PD1 or Fas ligand. After 30 min, the cells were fixed (10 min, 4% paraformaldehyde) and washed. The cells were then stained with anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody, washed 3–5 times with PBS, and then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated F(ab)2-fragments of rabbit anti-mouse antibodies. The cells were then washed and stained for 45 min with 200 ng/ml FITC-labeled CTX in PBS. Negative control staining was performed with isotype-matched mouse antibodies. Images were obtained with a conventional Zeiss fluorescence microscope with a digital camera or with a Leica TCS NT scanning confocal microscope. For quantitative analysis, the images of 20 randomly selected cells/slide were examined in a double-blind fashion. The number of positive cells with co-patching of CTX-FITC and Texas Red anti-Fas and the percentage of those cells in the cell population in at least 6–8 independent experiments were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistics—Results are presented as means ± S.E. The significance of the differences in mean values between and within multiple groups was examined using analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by Duncan's multiple range tests. Student's t test was used to evaluate statistical significance of differences between two-paired observations. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PD1 Generation by Human TH2-skewed PBMC Is Dependent on Expression and Activity of 15-Lipoxygenase-1—By using LC-MS-MS lipidomic analysis, we examined whether TH2-skewed PBMC produce PD1 from DHA (Fig. 1), because the expression of 15-LO-1, a major enzyme that appears to be involved in the conversion of DHA to PD1 (15Hong S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), is induced by TH2-polarizing cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, in alveolar macrophages (30Levy B.D. Romano M. Chapman H.A. Reilly J.J. Drazen J. Serhan C.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 1572-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), peripheral blood monocytes (31Nassar G.M. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Lakkis F.G. Badr K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27631-27634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dendritic cells (32Spanbroek R. Hildner M. Kohler A. Muller A. Zintl F. Kuhn H. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Habenicht A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5152-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Incubation of TH2 PBMC with DHA, but not TH1 PBMC, led to the production of the (17S)-hydroxy-containing series compounds (Fig. 1), among which (17S)-hydroxy-DHA ((17S)-HDHA) and PD1 were identified as major products, as well as residual amounts of (14S)-hydroxy-DHA products (Fig. 1A). (17S)-HDHA was identified (Fig. 1B) from its characteristic MS-MS spectrum, which displayed diagnostic ions at m/z 343 (M-H), 325 (M-H-H2O), 299 (M-H-CO2), 281 (M-H-H2O-CO2), 273 and 255 (273-H2O), 245 and 229 (273-CO2), and 201 (245-CO2); and its retention time and UV spectrum confirmed the presence of a conjugated diene in the structure (an asymmetric peak with a maximal absorbance wavelength [λmax] at 236 nm) (Fig. 1B, inset). (17S)-HDHA is produced by reduction from its (17S)-hydro(peroxy)-DHA precursor, the major product of 15-LO action with DHA (15Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), an intermediate that can be converted by further action of 15-LO to PD1, identified in these incubation extracts by its characteristic ions present in its MS-MS spectrum. These results are consistent with the physical properties of NPD1 (15Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol.

Additional diagnostic ions demonstrated the presence of the 10 and 17 alcohol-containing carbon positions, including those at m/z 153 and 163 (181-H2O); 181, 205, and 217 (261-CO2); 227 (289-H2O-CO2); 243 (261-H2O); and 261 and 289 (M-H-CH3CH2CHCHCH3). The UV spectrum of this dihydroxydocosatriene in methanol gave a λmax at 270 nm with shoulders at 261 and 281 nm, a triple band of absorption consistent with the conjugated triene structure present in PD1 (data not shown) (15Hong S.

The complete stereochemical assignment of NPD1 (15Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol.

N., Gotlinger, K., Hong, S., Lu, Y., Siegelman, J., Baer, T., Yang, R., Colgan, S. P., and Petasis, N. A. (2005) J. Immunol., in press. NPD1/PD1 generated by human PBMC carried the complete stereochemistry of (10R,17S)-dihydroxydocosa-4Z,7Z,11E, 13E,15Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid and was matched to the several dihydroxytriene-containing DHA-derived products isolated from human PBMC. To assess the biosynthesis and to determine whether an epoxide-containing intermediate or alternatively a double dioxygenation was involved in PBMC production of this bioactive product, alcohol trapping experiments were carried out as earlier reported with microglial cells (15Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Briefly, methanol trapping of the potential epoxide-containing intermediates during the exposure of DHA to TH2 PBMC led to the production and identification of 10-methoxy-17-hydroxy DHA (n = 4); diagnostic ions in its MS/MS spectrum were at m/z 373,152, 221, 275, 323, 329, 341, and 355, which were essentially identical to those reported earlier in microglial cells from the brain (15Hong S.

These results indicate that the main route for formation of bioactive PD1 by PBMC is via an epoxide-containing intermediate (see Fig. 1H for illustration). It was shown previously that the DHA content in the membranes of lymphoblasts increases during their activation (33Anel A. Naval J. Gonzalez B. Torres J.M. Mishal Z. Uriel J. Pineiro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether TH2 PBMC produce PD1 from endogenous DHA, we incubated these cells in the absence of exogenous DHA, and we determined the levels of DHA-derived products formed. We found that TH2 PBMC produce PD1 and (17S)-HDHA (0.5–2.4 and 1.1–3.8 ng per 20.0 × 106 cells, respectively). Of interest, we found that addition of IL-4 during the incubation time led to a significant reduction in the production of DHA-derived lipid mediators (Fig. 1C). Both PD1 and (17S)-HDHA levels were reduced (83.5 ± 3.1 and 26.0 ± 6.5% of control, respectively), although the preferential production of PD1 over (17S)-HDHA suggests an important role for this product in the skewing of TH2 PBMC.

Our data suggest that the four proteins act in a complex common pathway. At the cellular level, the components function by regulating the cortical actin and thereby stabilizing the extended morphology of the surface glia, which in turn is necessary for the formation of septate junctions of sufficient length to achieve proper sealing of the nerve cord.

Our study demonstrates the importance of morphogenetic regulation in blood-brain barrier development and places GPCR signaling at its core. The complex nervous systems of higher animals are insulated from the body fluid by an impenetrable blood-brain barrier. In Drosophila, as in other insects, this barrier serves primarily as a shield against the high potassium levels of the hemolymph: if the barrier is compromised, action potentials can no longer propagate, and the animal is paralyzed. The barrier is established at the end of embryonic development by a thin layer of epithelial cells, which are thought to be glia derived from the neural ectoderm, named surface glia. This glial epithelium ensheathes the entire nerve cord and generates an ionic seal by forming intercellular septate junctions (SJs) (Carlson et al., 2000Carlson S.D. Juang J.L. Hilgers S.L.

Comp. Neurol. 1993; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A similar process occurs in the PNS, where peripheral glia form a single-cell tube that envelops the nerve and is sealed by autic SJs (Auld et al., 1995Auld V.J. Fetter R.D. Broadie K. Goodman C.S.

The cellular and molecular processes involved in the ensheathment of the nervous system are generally not well understood. In the CNS, the study of the blood-brain barrier has been hampered by technical difficulties. The surface glia are extremely thin and delicate and complete their seal only at the very end of embryogenesis, making their visualization and phenotypic analysis challenging. In the PNS, Rho family GTPases and a PAK-like serine-threonine kinase (Fray) have been shown to be required for establishing or maintaining the glial ensheathment of peripheral nerves (Leiserson et al., 2000Leiserson W.M.

By contrast, SJ formation has been studied extensively, but mostly in columnar epithelia such as the ectoderm and the trachea (for review, see Tepass et al., 2001Tepass U. Tanentzapf G. Ward R. Fehon R. Epithelial cell polarity and cell junctions in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 747-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). SJs contain regularly spaced, electron-dense septa that give them a ladder-like appearance. The septa are thought to serve as a series of filters that impede the penetration of small molecules through the intercellular cleft; the more septa are arrayed, the tighter the seal (Abbott, 1991Abbott N.J. Permeability and transport of glial blood-brain barriers.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1991; 633: 378-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The SJ consists of a large complex of transmembrane and intracellular proteins, including Neurexin IV, Neuroglian, Contactin, Coracle, and the sodium pump. It is not clear to what extent the glial SJ mirrors the ectodermal SJ; to date, two of the molecular components of the ectodermal SJ have been shown to be functional in peripheral glia. The fly SJ shows striking structural, molecular, and functional similarity to the vertebrate paranodal junction, which is formed between neurons and myelinating glial cells (Poliak and Peles, 2003Poliak S.

Nodes of Ranvier come of age.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 2-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large and diverse superfamily of receptors that share a seven-transmembrane-domain structure and interact with a wide range of extracellular ligands. They transduce their signal mostly through trimeric G proteins, which consist of three subunits (α, β, and γ). Upon ligand binding, the GPCR catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP at Gα, leading to dissociation of the complex into Gα and Gβγ. Once separated, Gα-GTP and Gβγ can each interact with downstream effectors. Signaling is terminated by GTP hydrolysis, which is stimulated by RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) molecules; reassociation of Gα-GDP with Gβγ completes the cycle (Neer, 1995Neer E.J. Heterotrimeric G proteins: organizers of transmembrane signals.Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the role of GPCRs and trimeric G proteins in metazoan development is limited to relatively few examples, including germ-cell migration; asymmetric cell division; and, most recently, Wnt and planar polarity signaling (Katanaev et al., 2005Katanaev V.L.

A role for G protein signaling in Drosophila blood-brain barrier formation was first suggested by the identification of the RGS loco, which is expressed in the surface glia and shows locomotion defects as a mutant (Granderath et al., 1999Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O’Kane C.J. Klambt C. loco encodes an RGS protein required for Drosophila glial differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar). However, Loco’s cellular function has not been elucidated, nor has it been placed in a genetic pathway. In a reverse genetic screen for factors with glial expression and function, we identified two GPCRs of a small novel Rhodopsin family, moody and tre1, as well as loco. Here we show that moody, loco, and the Gα genes Gi and Go are (differentially) expressed in the surface glia; Moody and Loco colocalize at the plasma membrane, and Loco physically interacts with both Gi and Go, suggesting that the four proteins are part of a common signaling pathway. Using dye penetration into the nerve cord as an assay, we show that all four factors are required for proper insulation of the nervous system. Interestingly, loss and gain of signal cause qualitatively similar insulation defects, strongly suggesting that the signal is graded or localized within the cell. Using live imaging and transmission electron microscopy, we examine the cellular function of the signaling components in the morphogenesis of the surface glia and in the establishment of the intercellular SJs that generate the seal. The Drosophila nerve cord is ensheathed by a thin single-layer epithelium, which in turn is surrounded by an acellular layer of extracellular matrix material. Ultrastructural analysis had revealed that SJs between the epithelial cells are responsible for the insulation of the nerve cord (Carlson et al., 2000Carlson S.D. Juang J.L. Hilgers S.L. Garment M.B.

Comp. Neurol. 1993; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Independent fate-mapping studies showed that the nerve cord is enveloped by glia expressing the glial-specific marker Repo (Halter et al., 1995Halter D.A. Urban J. Rickert C. Ner S.S. Ito K.

Biol. 1997; 189: 186-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), but to date there has been no direct proof that it is these surface glia that form intercellular SJs and thus the insulating sheath. Moreover, the time course for the formation of the sheath and of the SJ-mediated seal has not been established. We developed several assays to follow the morphogenesis of the surface glial sheath. Due to the onset of cuticle formation, immunohistochemistry becomes unreliable after 16 hr of development. We therefore used live imaging of GFP-tagged marker proteins to visualize cell shapes, in particular the actin cytoskeleton marker GFP/RFP-Moesin (Edwards et al., 1997Edwards K.A. Demsky M. Montague R.A. Weymouth N. Kiehart D.P. GFP-moesin illuminates actin cytoskeleton dynamics in living tissue and demonstrates cell shape changes during morphogenesis in Drosophila.Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the SJ marker Neuroglian (Nrg)-GFP (Morin et al., 2001Morin X. Daneman R. Zavortink M. Chia W. A protein trap strategy to detect GFP-tagged proteins expressed from their endogenous loci in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 15050-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We find that Nrg-GFP expressed under its own promoter and RFP-Moesin driven by repo-Gal4 are colocalized in the same cells, establishing that the SJ-forming cells are repo positive (Figure 1N ) and thus conclusively demonstrating the insulating function of the surface glia. To probe the permeability of the transcellular barrier, we injected fluorescent dye into the body cavity and quantified dye penetration into the nerve cord by determining mean pixel intensity in sample sections (see Experimental Procedures). The surface glia are born in the ventrolateral neuroectoderm and migrate to the surface of the developing nerve cord (Ito et al., 1995Ito K. Urban J. Technau G.M.

Biol. 1997; 189: 186-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), where they spread until they touch their neighbors (17 hr of development). The glia then join to form a contiguous sheet of square or trapezoidal cells, tiled to form three-cell corners (Figures 1A–1C). SJ material is visible as a thin contiguous belt by 18 hr but continues to accumulate until the end of embryogenesis (Figures 1D–1F). Similar to other secondary epithelia, the surface glia do not form a contiguous adherens-junction belt (zonula adherens), but only spotted adherens junctions, as visualized by Armadillo-GFP (driven by own promoter; McCartney et al., 2001McCartney B.M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar; Figure 1M). At 16 hr, the fluorescent dye freely penetrates into the nerve cord, but by 20 hr the nerve cord is completely sealed (Figures 1G–1I). The completion of the seal thus coincides with the onset of visible movements in the late embryo. To further gauge our dye-penetration assay, we examined embryos mutant for known septate-junction components: Neurexin IV, which is required for blood-nerve barrier formation in the PNS (Baumgartner et al., 1996Baumgartner S. Littleton J.T. Broadie K. Bhat M.A. Harbecke R. Lengyel J.A. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Prokop A. Bellen H.J.

Fehon R.G. Neuroglian, Gliotactin, and the Na+/K+ ATPase are essential for septate junction function in Drosophila.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In all three mutants, we found severe penetration of dye well after the nerve cord is sealed in wild-type (22 hr, Figures 1J–1L). These findings provide further evidence that the sealing of the nerve cord is achieved by SJs and suggest that the components of the ectodermal SJs are required for the function of surface glial SJs as well. In a genome-wide screen for glial genes, using FAC sorting of GFP-labeled embryonic glia and Affymetrix microarray expression analysis (H. Courvoisier, D. Leaman, J. Fak, N. Rajewsky, and U.G., unpublished data), we identified two novel GPCRs, Moody (CG4322; Bainton et al., 2005Bainton R.J. Tsai L.T.-Y. Schwabe T. DeSalvo M. Gaul U.

Both are orphan receptors belonging to the same novel subclass of Rhodopsin-family GPCRs (Kunwar et al., 2003Kunwar P.S. Starz-Gaiano M. Bainton R.J. Heberlein U. Lehmann R.

We examined their expression by RNA in situ hybridization; different subtypes of glia in the embryonic nerve cord can be distinguished based on their position and morphology (Ito et al., 1995Ito K. Urban J. Technau G.M. Distribution, classification, and development of Drosophila glial cells in the late embryonic and early larval ventral nerve chord.Rouxs Arch. Dev. Biol. 1995; 204: 284-307Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In the CNS, moody is expressed in surface glia from embryonic stage 13 onward (10 hr); in addition to cells surrounding the nerve cord (subperineurial glia), this includes cells lining the dorsoventral channels (channel glia). moody is also expressed in the ensheathing glia of the PNS (exit and peripheral glia) (Figure 2A ). Both CNS and PNS expression of moody are lost in mutants for the master regulator of glial fate, glial cells missing (gcmN17; Jones et al., 1995Jones B.W. Fetter R.D. Tear G. Goodman C.S. glial cells missing: a genetic switch that controls glial versus neuronal fate.Cell. 1995; 82: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), confirming that they are indeed glial (Figure 2B). tre1 is expressed in all longitudinal glia and a subset of surface glia, as well as in cells along the midline. As expected, the (lateral) glial expression is lost in gcm mutants, while midline expression is not (Figures 2C and 2D). Both moody and tre1 are also expressed outside the nervous system in a largely mutually exclusive manner, specifically in the germ cells, the gut, and the heart. Several additional G protein signaling components are found in the surface glia. The six extant Gα genes show broad and overlapping expression in embryogenesis, with three of them (Go, Gq, and Gs) expressed throughout the nervous system and Gi expressed more specifically in surface glia (Figures 2G and 2H; Parks and Wieschaus, 1991Parks S.

USA. 1988; 85: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, the RGS loco is uniformly expressed in early embryos due to a maternal contribution but is then transcriptionally upregulated in surface and longitudinal glia, as well as in other tissues outside the nervous system. The nervous-system expression of loco is lost in gcm mutants (Figures 2E and 2F; Granderath et al., 1999Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O’Kane C.J. Klambt C. loco encodes an RGS protein required for Drosophila glial differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of both Moody and Loco protein in the surface glia is confirmed using immunohistochemistry (Figures 2I and 2J), but at 17 hr of development, when staining is feasible, the protein levels are still quite low. In sum, the GPCR Moody, the RGS Loco, and Gi are differentially expressed in surface glia. This expression precedes and accompanies the morphogenesis and sealing of the surface glial sheath. To examine protein expression and distribution of the GPCR signaling components in greater detail, we turned to third-instar larval nerve cords. By this stage, the surface glia have doubled in size and show robust protein expression of GPCR signaling and SJ components. Moody immunostaining is found at the plasma membrane, where it shows strong colocalization with the SJ marker Nrg-GFP (Figure 3C ). Loco immunostaining is punctate and more disperse throughout the cytoplasm, with some accumulation at the plasma membrane, where it colocalizes with Moody (Figure 3A). To avoid fixation and staining artifacts, we generated fluorescent-protein fusions (Moody-mRFP; Loco-GFP) and expressed them using moody-Gal4, which drives weak surface glial expression (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In the live nerve-cord preparations, Loco-GFP is much less disperse and shows strong colocalization with Moody-mRFP at the plasma membrane (Figure 3B). In the absence of a known ligand, the coupling of G proteins to receptors is difficult to establish, but their binding to RGS proteins is readily determined. Loco physically binds to and negatively regulates Gi (Granderath et al., 1999Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O’Kane C.J. Klambt C. loco encodes an RGS protein required for Drosophila glial differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2005Yu F. Wang H. Qian H. Kaushik R. Bownes M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In S2 tissue-culture assays, we find that Loco binds to Gi and Go, but not to Gs and Gq, in line with the previous results (Figure 3F). Double-label immunohistochemistry confirms that both Gi and Go are expressed in the surface glia (Figures 3D and 3E). Thus, Loco physically interacts with Gi and Go and shows subcellular colocalization with Moody, suggesting that the four signaling components are part of a common molecular pathway. Using dye penetration as our principal assay, we examined whether the GPCR signaling components that are expressed in surface glia play a role in insulation. moody genomic (Δ17; Bainton et al., 2005Bainton R.J. Tsai L.T.-Y. Schwabe T. DeSalvo M. Gaul U.

The embryos are able to hatch but show mildly uncoordinated motor behavior and die during larval or pupal stages. The dye-penetration defect of moodyΔ17 is completely rescued by genomic rescue constructs containing only the moody ORF. Both moody splice forms (α and β; Bainton et al., 2005Bainton R.J. Tsai L.T.-Y. Schwabe T. DeSalvo M. Gaul U. Heberlein U. moody encodes two GPCRs that regulate cocaine behaviors and blood-brain barrier permeability in Drosophila.Cell. 2005; 123 (this issue): 145-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) are able to rescue the defect independently, as well as in combination (Figure 4E). tre1 genomic (Kunwar et al., 2003Kunwar P.S.

Tre1, a G protein-coupled receptor, directs transepithelial migration of Drosophila germ cells.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: e80https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000080Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and RNAi mutants show no significant dye-penetration defect and no synergistic effects when combined with moody using RNAi (data not shown). Thus, despite the close sequence similarity of the two GPCRs and their partially overlapping expression in surface glia, only moody plays a significant role in insulation. Overexpression of moody causes intracellular aggregation of the protein (data not shown). loco is expressed both maternally and zygotically. Granderath et al., 1999Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O’Kane C.J. Klambt C. loco encodes an RGS protein required for Drosophila glial differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar had shown that loco zygotic nulls are paralytic and suggested, on the basis of an ultrastructural analysis, a disruption of the glial seal (see below). In our dye-penetration assay, loco zygotic null mutants show a strong insulation defect, which can be rescued by panglial expression of Loco in its wt or GFP-tagged form (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4E). The extant null allele of loco (Δ13) did not yield germline clones; we therefore used loco RNAi to degrade the maternal in addition to the zygotic transcript. In loco RNAi embryos, dye penetration is indeed considerably more severe (Figures 4B and 4C). Overall, insulation as well as locomotor behavior is affected much more severely in loco than in moody and is close in strength to the SJ mutants. Overexpression of loco is phenotypically normal (data not shown). Thus, positive (moody) and negative (loco) regulators of G protein signaling show qualitatively similar defects in loss of function, suggesting that both loss and gain of signal are disruptive to insulation. Such a phenomenon is not uncommon and is generally observed for pathways that generate a localized or graded signal within the cell (see Discussion). Both Gi and Go have a maternal as well as a zygotic component. Gi zygotic null flies survive into adulthood but show strong locomotor defects (Yu et al., 2003Yu F. Cai Y. Kaushik R. Yang X. Chia W. Distinct roles of Galphai and Gbeta13F subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein complex in the mediation of Drosophila neuroblast asymmetric divisions.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In our assay, Gi maternal and zygotic null embryos show a mild dye-penetration defect, which is markedly weaker than that of moody (Figures 4A and 4B), suggesting redundancy among Gα subunits. To further probe Gi function, we overexpressed the wt protein (Gi-wt) as well as a constitutively active version (Gi-GTP) (Schaefer et al., 2001Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A.

Expression of Gi-wt results in very severe dye penetration, while overexpression of Gi-GTP is phenotypically normal (Figures 4A and 4B). Only"
https://openalex.org/W1997576057,"We identified moody in a genetic screen for Drosophila mutants with altered cocaine sensitivity. Hypomorphic mutations in moody cause an increased sensitivity to cocaine and nicotine exposure. In contrast, sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol is reduced. The moody locus encodes two novel GPCRs, Moody-α and Moody-β. While identical in their membrane-spanning domains, the two Moody proteins differ in their long carboxy-terminal domains, which are generated by use of alternative reading frames. Both Moody forms are required for normal cocaine sensitivity, suggesting that they carry out distinct but complementary functions. Moody-α and Moody-β are coexpressed in surface glia that surround the nervous system, where they are actively required to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in the adult fly. We propose that a Moody-mediated signaling pathway functions in glia to regulate nervous system insulation and drug-related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2023436568,"During 3′ end processing, histone pre-mRNAs are cleaved 5 nucleotides after a conserved stem loop by an endonuclease dependent on the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). The upstream cleavage product corresponds to the mature histone mRNA, while the downstream product is degraded by a 5′-3′ exonuclease, also dependent on the U7 snRNP. To identify the two nuclease activities, we carried out UV-crosslinking studies using both the complete RNA substrate and the downstream cleavage product, each containing a single radioactive phosphate and a phosphorothioate modification at the cleavage site. We detected a protein migrating at 85 kDa that crosslinked to each substrate in a U7-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation experiments identified this protein as CPSF-73, a known component of the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. These studies suggest that CPSF-73 is both the endonuclease and 5′-3′ exonuclease in histone-pre-mRNA processing and reveal an evolutionary link between 3′ end formation of histone mRNAs and polyadenylated mRNAs."

Advanced atherosclerosis is often associated with dystrophic calcification, and there is a relationship between calcification and the severity of coronary disease. Dystrophic calcification results in less compliant and more rupture-prone vessels, precipitating ischemic and thrombotic complications.

Virol. 2005; 79: 1099-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).This is the first report of calgranulins in macrophages and FC in human atheroma and in areas of vascular calcification. S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA and protein were also expressed by microvessels in areas of neovascularization. Monomeric and complexed forms of S100A9 were predominant in MVs isolated from human carotid artery and aorta suggesting a role in regulation of dystrophic calcification. We show high amounts of S100A8 and S100A9 complexes in plaque extracts and demonstrate the exquisite sensitivity, particularly of S100A8, to oxidation by HOCl, strongly suggesting it as a ready target for oxidation in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins and Antibodies—Recombinant (r) S100A8 and rS100A9 were generated as described (26Iismaa S.E. Hu S. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody against HOCl-modified LDL (HOP-1) (20Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin.

Valenzuela S.M. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33393-33401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or S100A9 were raised and purified as described (26Iismaa S.E. Hu S. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Preimmune IgGs were unreactive in Western blotting/immunohistochemistry. S100 proteins share regions of high sequence homology and cross-reactivities of antibodies were tested by Western blotting. Anti-S100A1/B (Dako Carpintaria, CA) recognized S100A1 and S100B (Sigma) but not the other S100 proteins; anti-S100A8, -OxS100A8, and -S100A9 were immunospecific. Anti-OxS100A8 reacted more strongly with OxS100A8 than S100A8 by ELISA (27Kocher M. Kenny P.A. Farram E. Majid Abdul Finlay-Jones K.B. Geczy J.J.C.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Carotid and Aortic Specimens—Aortic and carotid artery specimens containing atherosclerotic lesions and apparently normal mural areas, collected according to the Declaration of Helsinki, were obtained from 39 patients undergoing endarterectomy and 14 (aged 32-86 years) undergoing aortic reconstruction, respectively, at St Vincent's and Concord General Repatriation Hospitals, Sydney.Immunohistochemical Analysis—For immunohistochemistry, 11 carotid and 9 aortic specimens were used. Tissue processing and single and double immunostaining were performed as reported (28Bobryshev Y.V. Lord R.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 799-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Optimal antibody concentrations were determined by calibrating staining intensities in various tissues. Anti-S100A1/S100B, -S100A9, or -S100A8 IgGs were used at 6.4, 1, and 2 μg/ml, respectively. Anti-CD3 (T-cell marker; Sigma), anti-CD68 (monocyte/macrophage marker), anti-von-Will-ebrand factor (EC marker), and fascin (dendritic cell (DC) marker, all from Dako) were used at 1:50 dilution and anti-α-smooth muscle actin (Dako) at 1:400 v/v. Secondary antibodies were biotinylated equine anti-mouse, caprine anti-rabbit, and rabbit anti-caprine (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) IgGs. For negative controls, primary antibodies were omitted, or sections treated with pre-/nonimmune rabbit IgG. Control sections were negative. Immunostaining in sections stained with Alizarin red S, which identifies atherosclerotic calcification, was difficult, so calcified deposits were visualized by counterstaining with Mayer's hematoxylin.In Situ Hybridization—Tissue sections were washed (15 min) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 25 mm PO43−, 250 mm Cl-, pH 7.5) containing Triton X-100 (0.3%), treated with 0.2 m HCl (15 min), permeabilized with proteinase K (25 μg/ml, MERCK; Darmstadt, Germany) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl/50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (37 °C, 30 min), washed with 0.2% glycine followed by PBS, and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (5 min). Photobiotin-labeled cDNA as whole plasmids (vector and insert; 100 μl/slide) were used for hybridization. Stringency washes and detection were performed according to a sensitive method (29Markovic B. Kwan Y.L. Nicholls E.M. Walsh C. Crouch R.L. J. Pathol. 1992; 167: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with biotinylated alkaline phosphatase and streptavidin (both from Sigma) at 1:200 and 1:100 v/v, respectively, during four sequential 10-min applications for detection. S100A8 (360 bp) and S100A9 (413 bp) full-length cDNAs were synthesized from human neutrophil RNA and subcloned at BamHI-EcoRI and EcoRI-HindIII sites of pGEM-3Z vector (Promega). Integration was confirmed using restriction enzyme digestion. Vector alone, or unrelated plasmid vectors were used as negative controls; hybridizations with these were negative. Detection of GAPDH mRNA was the internal positive control.Arterial Tissue Extraction—Specimens from 11 endarterectomy patients were pulverized under liquid nitrogen. Samples of apparently normal carotid artery (taken from a 74-year-old male who died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 25-h post-mortem delay) were similarly processed and because of the low protein content, pooled extracts from two different mural sections analyzed. Samples (∼500 mg) in PBS/10 mm EGTA (1.5 ml, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) were sonicated for 5 min, rotated at 4 °C for 2 h then centrifuged (1,600 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were precleared with caprine anti-rabbit IgG (∼1 μg/ml, 1 h at 4°C) and protein A-Sepharose (∼25 μl/500 μl, 15 min, 4 °C) or agarose-conjugated caprine anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), centrifuged and ∼25-30 μg of total protein (bicinchoninic acid assay, Sigma) used for analysis. Because of the propensity of S100 proteins to form disulfide (30Deshpande R. Woods T.L. Fu J. Zhang T. Stoll S.W. Elder J.T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 477-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and sulfinamide cross-linking (17Raftery M.J. Yang Z. Valenzuela S.M. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33393-33401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) under oxidative conditions, five additional endarterectomy specimens were prepared in PBS containing 1 mm sodium azide (inhibits MPO that generates HOCl) (31Panasenko O.M. Spalteholz H. Schiller J. Arnhold J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; derivatizes free thiols) (18Harrison C.A.

Camacho N.P. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 143: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All buffers contained protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm NEM, 1 mm azide, and 1 mm benzamidine (Sigma). Specimens (∼1 × 2 cm2-1 × 4 cm2, ∼0.5 g-1.5 g) were preserved in 1% methyl cellulose and 1.15 m sucrose for 1 h at 4°C, subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to -80 °C before extraction. The MV pellets were dissolved in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris/250 mm Cl-; TBS) and precleared as above prior to Western analysis.The procedure for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was adapted from a previous study (33Bobryshev Y.V. Lord R.S. Warren B.A. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 118: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To quantitate the calcium and phosphorous content of MVs, suspensions (25 μl) were dried at 22 °C for 2 h and then mounted onto carbon disks coated with Balzes carbon fiber. Element content was assessed using a Cambridge S-360 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with Iridium software. The SEM was equipped with an EDS detector (1XRF Kevex with beryllium window) and 1-5 nA of beam current at 20 kV were used to acquire x-ray data. To confirm pyrophosphohydrolase activity, the nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPPH) assay was performed on duplicate samples as described (34Rachow J.W. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. Halverson P.C. Arthritis. Rheum. 1988; 31: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as nmol of p-nitrophenol formed/min/mg MV protein. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay.Extraction of cholesterol and lipids from isolated MVs was performed as described (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). To determine the cholesterol content, membrane samples (1 ml) were mixed with methanol (2.5 ml) and extracted into hexane (5.0 ml) (36Gelissen I.C. Brown A.J.

Cholesterol was analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography as described (37Brown A.J. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 320-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phospholipid content by the Bartlett assay (38Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Western Blotting and Immunoabsorption—SDS-PAGE (10% gels) was performed as described (26Iismaa S.E. Hu S. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using degassed buffers. Electroblotting (26Iismaa S.E. Hu S. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) used ovalbumin (7%, w/v) as blocking agent and Tween 20 (0.05%) in TBS for washes. Immunoreactivity with anti-S100A8 (20 μg), -OxS100A8 (10 μg), or -S100A9 (7 μg) IgGs in 10 ml of 2% ovalbumin in TBS for 2 h, or with HOP-1 (myeloma supernatant, 1:300 v/v), was visualized by chemiluminescence.Carotid artery extracts, pooled (1 ml) from 4 subjects, were diluted with PBS (4 ml) and pumped through Sepharose-4B-bound anti-S100A9 IgG (2.7 mg IgG/ml beads) at 4 °C as described (27Kocher M. Kenny P.A. Farram E. Majid Abdul Finlay-Jones K.B. Geczy J.J.C.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing (PBS), bound material was eluted with 6 × 200 μl 0.2 m glycine, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 2.0, eluates buffered to pH 7.0 with Tris-HCl (1 m, pH 9), desalted/concentrated (Microcon YM-3 minifilters, Millipore, Bedford, MA), precleared as for arterial tissue extracts, and examined by Western blotting.RESULTSS100B, S100A8, and S100A9 Expression in Plaque—Arteries lacking features of atherosclerotic transformation did not contain cells expressing S100A8 (Fig. 1A) or S100A9 (not shown) in the intima. Nerve endings in the adventitia were S100A1+/S100B+ in normal and diseased tissue, and some cells distributed irregularly throughout all layers of the arterial wall, and particularly frequent around neovessels, were S100A1-/S100B- and fascin-positive, identifying them as DC (28Bobryshev Y.V. Lord R.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 799-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (not shown).All vessel segments affected by early- and late-stage atherosclerosis contained large numbers of irregularly distributed, intensely stained S100A8+ FC and macrophages (Fig. 1, B and C), some of which were S100A8+-CD68+ although the majority around neovessels were CD68+-S100A8-. About 50% of neovascular EC were S100A8+ (Fig. 1B). In intimal areas containing CD68+ macrophages, many FC were S100A8+ (Fig. 1C). S100A9+ was present in FC and non-FC, particularly CD68 macrophages around neovessels, and in EC of all neovessels. The surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) exhibited relatively intense S100A9 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1D). In situ hybridization indicated S100A8 (not shown) and S100A9 mRNA in FC, extravasating monocytes around neovessels and microvessels in areas of neovascularization (Fig. 1E). S100A8 or S100A9 were not detected in the luminal endothelium of arteries or the larger vasa vasorum (not shown).Consecutive sections indicated no S100A8 or S100A9 expression in T lymphocytes or smooth muscle cells (not shown). Overlapping patterns of distribution of S100A8 and S100A9 were apparent in FC and non-FC (not shown), particularly CD68+ macrophages around neovessels.In particular, anti-S100A9 immunoreactivity was associated with early (Fig. 2A) and large advanced calcified deposits (Fig. 2, B-E) that were surrounded by S100A9+ cells, mainly macrophages (CD68+) and some FC, some of which were closely attached to calcified deposits (Fig. 2C). These deposits consistently contained S100A9 in the ECM (Fig. 2E). S100A9 associated with calcified deposits was evident in all 11 carotid and 9 aortic specimens examined. Serial sections of the same specimens stained with anti-S100A8 showed markedly less reactivity; some S100A8 was associated with calcified deposits in 4 carotid arteries and 2 aortas (not shown).FIGURE 2Co-localization of S100A9 (brown) with calcified deposits (violet) in early (A) and advanced (B-E) atherosclerotic plaques stained with anti-S100A9.

Size varied from 40-1,200 nm; some had electron-lucent content (Fig. 3A), whereas others were filled with material of middle electron density or contained an electron dense core (Fig. 3B). Some MVs were clustered (Fig. 3C), and the membrane was absent in the contact zones suggesting that MVs coalesced. NTPPPH activity in MV isolates from 8 carotid specimens (mean: 315 ± 173 nmol/min/mg protein) was similar to levels reported for human vascular MVs (32Hsu H.H. Camacho N.P. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 143: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The lipid composition of two MV isolates was analyzed. Total sterol was 762.8 ± 23.3 nmol/mg protein and total phospholipid 745.5 ± 141 nmol/mg protein (TABLE ONE). Cholesterol esters comprised ∼14% of total sterols. HPLC analysis indicated that cholesteryl dodecanoate was the major ester (∼79%); ∼9.5% was cholesteryl oleate, and ∼2.3% was cholesteryl arachidonate.FIGURE 3Characterization of MV isolates.

Extensive studies have shown that long-term potentiation (LTP) of the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) through glutamate receptors is induced by activation of N-methyl-D-asparate receptor (NMDA-R)—the coincidence detector—and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Here we report that the same signaling pathway in the postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neuron also causes LTP of the slow inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) mediated by metabotropic GABAB receptors (GABAB-Rs) and G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels, both residing in dendritic spines as well as shafts. Indicative of intriguing differences in the regulatory mechanisms for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, LTP of sIPSC but not EPSC was abolished in mice lacking Nova-2, a neuronal-specific RNA binding protein that is an autoimmune target in paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (POMA) patients with latent cancer, reduced inhibitory control of movements, and dementia.

Signaling between neurons involves not only ionotropic receptors, ligand-gated ion channels that generate fast synaptic potentials, but also metabotropic receptors—G protein-coupled receptors with prolonged effects (Hille, 1992Hille B. G protein-coupled mechanisms and nervous signaling.Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The spines, small protrusions from dendrites, harbor the great majority of excitatory synapses and both types of glutamate receptors (Harris, 1999Harris K.M.

Intrigued by the finding that metabotropic GABAB receptors (GABAB-Rs) and G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels reside on not only dendritic shafts but also the spines (Drake et al., 1997Drake C.T.

Intensive studies over decades have identified N-methyl-D-asparate receptor (NMDA-R) as the coincidence detector that allows the postsynaptic neuron to respond to synchronous excitatory inputs with long-lasting changes of synaptic excitation mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPA-Rs) (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9155) Google Scholar). Optimal NMDA-R activation requires glutamate binding concurrent with postsynaptic depolarization to relieve channel block by external Mg2+ ions, so as to allow Ca2+ and other cations to go through, thereby activating downstream second messengers such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and altering synaptic efficacy (Daw et al., 1993Daw N.W.

It is an open question whether the signaling cascade mobilized by activation of NMDA-Rs also has long-lasting effects on the slow inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) mediated by GABAB-Rs and GIRK channels that localize in dendritic spines of glutamatergic neurons, such as CA1 pyramidal neurons, and could be activated via “spillover” of GABA released from inhibitory nerve terminals. In this study, we found that coincidence detection of synaptic release of glutamate and CA1 pyramidal-neuron depolarization caused long-term potentiation (LTP) of sIPSC, a process dependent on postsynaptic NMDA-R activation, Ca2+ increase, and CaMKII activity. To further explore the functional requirement for this novel form of synaptic plasticity, we examined the role of the RNA binding protein Nova-2, an autoimmune target likely important for cognitive functions (Albert and Darnell, 2004Albert M.L.

Paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (POMA) patients, often with latent breast cancer, fallopian cancer, or small cell lung cancer, display ataxic movements and cognitive loss, probably due to the autoimmune responses developed against neuronal-specific antigens expressed by their cancer cells (Buckanovich et al., 1993Buckanovich R.J.

The proteins recognized by their autoimmune antibodies, Nova-1 and Nova-2, are RNA binding proteins that control alternative splicing of multiple gene products for the establishment and function of the central neuronal circuitry (Jensen et al., 2000Jensen K.B.

Interestingly, many of the targets of Nova-1 and Nova-2 contribute to inhibitory synaptic transmission and/or synaptic plasticity. Whereas Nova-1 acts primarily in the spinal cord, Nova-2 is expressed mostly in the brain and associates with the RNAs coding for GABAB-Rs and GIRK channels (Jensen et al., 2000Jensen K.B.

Interestingly, while the Nova-2 null mice exhibited basal sIPSC comparable to that in control sibling mice, they failed to show LTP of sIPSC, indicating that one of the physiological functions of Nova-2 is to enable activity-dependent modulation of the strength of slow synaptic inhibition. Because the Nova-2 null mice still exhibited LTP of EPSC, Nova-2 appears to be specifically involved in the NMDA-R-mediated synaptic plasticity of slow synaptic inhibition. GABA causes slow synaptic inhibition by stimulating GABAB-Rs so as to release Gβγ subunits for GIRK-channel activation (Lüscher et al., 1997Lüscher C. Jan L.Y. Stoffel M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A.

Whereas GABAB-Rs are obligate dimers of the R1 and R2 subunits (Marshall et al., 1999Marshall F.H. Jones K.A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. GABAB receptors - the first 7TM heterodimers.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 396-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), GIRK channels in most central neurons are heterotetramers containing GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits (Liao et al., 1996Liao Y.J.

We therefore began our study by testing whether GIRK2, like GABAB-Rs and GIRK1 (Drake et al., 1997Drake C.T. Bausch S.B. Milner T.A. Chavkin C. GIRK1 immunoreactivity is present predominantly in dendrites, dendritic spines, and somata in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Indeed, in cultured rat hippocampal neurons expressing the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) to highlight the spines, strong GIRK2 immunofluorescence was found in the spines (Figure 1A ), which house excitatory synapses and harbor the signaling cascade for the LTP of EPSC (Figure 1B) (Harris, 1999Harris K.M.

Postsynaptic signaling and plasticity mechanisms.Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). To ask whether activation of NMDA-R in the spines causes long-lasting changes of sIPSC, we used rat hippocampal organotypic slice culture, a well-established preparation for studying LTP of the EPSC (Hayashi et al., 2000Hayashi Y.

Because CA1 pyramidal neurons and their distal apical dendrites, which possess many GIRK1-containing spines (Drake et al., 1997Drake C.T. Bausch S.B. Milner T.A. Chavkin C. GIRK1 immunoreactivity is present predominantly in dendrites, dendritic spines, and somata in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), tend to receive inhibitory synaptic inputs from interneurons that straddle the border of stratum radiatum (s.r.) and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (s.l.m.) (Vida et al., 1998Vida I. Halasy K. Szinyei C. Somogyi P. Buhl E.H. Unitary IPSPs evoked by interneurons at the stratum radiatum-stratum lacunosum-moleculare border in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus in vitro.J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 755-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we placed the stimulation electrode 300–500 μm from stratum pyramidale (s.p.)—likely within s.l.m. By giving test stimuli at a low frequency to sample the sIPSC before and after the pairing, we asked whether NMDA-R activation via the pairing protocol could alter the sIPSC. We recorded sIPSC from CA1 pyramidal neurons with whole-cell patch-clamp in the presence of antagonists for AMPA-Rs (5 μM NBQX) and GABAA-Rs (100 μM picrotoxin) and used relatively large nerve stimulation to elicit detectable sIPSC with a single stimulus. With the resultant activation of a large number of glutamatergic nerve fibers, the basal NMDA-R activation (Collingridge et al., 1988Collingridge G.L. Herron C.E. Lester R.A. Synaptic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway of rat hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1988; 399: 283-300PubMed Google Scholar) yielded a detectable inward current (NMDA-R EPSC) while neurons were held at −60 mV (Figure 1C), though optimal NMDA-R activation still required depolarization to between −20 mV and 0 mV (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The NMDA-R EPSC (peak latency, 31 ± 9 msec) was followed with a slow outward current (peak latency, 320 ± 81 msec)—the sIPSC, which was blocked by two structurally unrelated GIRK-channel blockers, SCH23390 (10 μM, n = 6) (Kuzhikandathil and Oxford, 2002Kuzhikandathil E.V. Oxford G.S.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C) and tertiapin (100 nM, n = 4) (Bichet et al., 2004Bichet D. Lin Y.F. Ibarra C.A. Huang C.S. Yi B.A. Jan Y.N.

USA. 2004; 101: 4441-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D), and the GABAB-R antagonist SCH50911 (25 μM, n = 7) (Bolser et al., 1995Bolser D.C. Blythin D.J. Chapman R.W. Egan R.W. Hey J.A. Rizzo C. Kuo S.C. Kreutner W. The pharmacology of SCH 50911: a novel, orally-active GABA-beta receptor antagonist.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1393-1398PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). There was relatively little correlation between the amplitudes of NMDA-R EPSC and sIPSC (linear correlation coefficient R2 = 0.5), both of which remained stable when sampled at 0.33 Hz (sIPSC, 93% ± 10% at ∼20 min, n = 9, p = 0.3; NMDA-R EPSC, 110% ± 4% at ∼20 min, n = 9, p = 0.6) (Figure 2A ). Pairing 3 Hz stimulation with depolarization (between −5 mV and 0 mV) for ∼2.5 min caused potentiation of sIPSC recorded at −60 mV with 0.33 Hz stimulation. This sIPSC potentiation was robust and long lasting; the sIPSC amplitude increased by ∼4-fold (415% ± 40% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 12, p < 0.001), and the potentiation persisted for ∼30 min—throughout the duration of the experiment (Figure 2B)—without any changes of the input resistance or the series resistance (Figure 2C) or any significant pairing-induced changes of the NMDA-R EPSC peak amplitude (136% ± 50% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 12, p = 0.2) (Figure 2B) or decay time (measured in the presence of SCH50911, NBQX, and picrotoxin to isolate the NMDA-R EPSC; 97 ± 17 msec before pairing, n = 7; 90 ± 10 msec after pairing, n = 10, p = 0.7) (Figure 2D). Moreover, by measuring the area of sIPSC instead of the peak amplitude, we still observed a persistent and robust pairing-induced potentiation (normalized area, 2.9 ± 0.5 at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 12, p < 0.05) (Figure 2E). There was also no clear correlation between the extent of the sIPSC potentiation and the baseline amplitude of sIPSC (linear correlation R2 = 0.4) (Figure 2F) or NMDA-R EPSC (R2 = 0.1) (Figure 2G). Finally, whereas the potentiated sIPSC after pairing was sensitive to the GABAB-R antagonist SCH50911 (n = 4; Figure 3A ) and the GIRK-channel blocker SCH23390 (n = 3; Figure 3B), the GABAB-R activity was not required during pairing for the sIPSC potentiation (257% ± 35% at ∼30 min after pairing, n = 8, p < 0.005; Figure 3C). Thus, pairing synaptic glutamate release with CA1 pyramidal-neuron depolarization resulted in LTP of sIPSC. We then asked whether the pairing protocol could also cause potentiation of sIPSC in CA1 pyramidal neurons of acute hippocampal slices from 25- to 30-day-old rats. Because interneurons in the distal apical dendritic field of CA1 pyramidal neurons have a high target preference for not only dendritic shafts but also spines (Vida et al., 1998Vida I. Halasy K. Szinyei C. Somogyi P. Buhl E.H. Unitary IPSPs evoked by interneurons at the stratum radiatum-stratum lacunosum-moleculare border in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus in vitro.J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 755-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the spines in s.l.m. are particularly rich in GIRK1 immunoreactivity (Drake et al., 1997Drake C.T. Bausch S.B. Milner T.A. Chavkin C. GIRK1 immunoreactivity is present predominantly in dendrites, dendritic spines, and somata in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we selectively delivered stimuli to the perforant path at s.l.m. The baseline sIPSC sampled with 0.33 Hz stimulation exhibited modest rundown; the sIPSC amplitude ∼20 min after initiation of whole-cell patch-clamp recording was 80% ± 27% of the starting value (n = 13, p = 0.02) (Figure 3D). Nonetheless, the pairing protocol induced persistent potentiation of sIPSC (142% ± 13% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 14, p < 0.01) (Figure 3E). Perhaps because of the relatively large stimulation strength necessary for a single stimulus to elicit detectable sIPSCs in the acute slice, the pairing protocol caused some potentiation of NMDA-R EPSC, similar to what has been reported previously (Aniksztejn and Ben-Ari, 1995Aniksztejn L. Ben-Ari Y. Expression of LTP by AMPA and/or NMDA receptors is determined by the extent of NMDA receptors activation during the tetanus.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, Bashir et al., 1991Bashir Z.I. Alford S. Davies S.N. Randall A.D. Collingridge G.L.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, pairing postsynaptic depolarization with perforant-path stimulation was effective in inducing synaptic plasticity in the acute slice. Moreover, without concurrent postsynaptic depolarization, the 3 Hz stimulation failed to potentiate the sIPSC (65% ± 14% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 8, p < 0.01; Figure 3F), suggesting that pairing-induced NMDA-R activation is necessary for sIPSC LTP. To test whether NMDA-R activity is necessary for pairing-induced sIPSC potentiation in slice culture, we first applied the NMDA-R antagonist APV (100 μM) and found no pairing-induced LTP of the sIPSC (102% ± 20% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 7, p = 0.1) (Figure 4A ). However, not only was the inward current very small in the presence of antagonists for both NMDA-R and AMPA-R, the sIPSC amplitude was greatly reduced, likely due to inefficient synaptic excitation of the inhibitory interneurons to generate disynaptic sIPSC. We therefore conducted two additional controls. First, we stimulated presynaptic fibers at 3 Hz without depolarizing the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron and found that, analogous to our observations with the acute slice (Figure 3F), there was no persistent potentiation of the sIPSC (123% ± 26% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 6, p = 0.1) (Figure 4B). Second, when we treated the cultured slices only with antagonists of the GABAA-Rs and NMDA-Rs, there was no pairing-induced potentiation of the biphasic response composed of AMPA-R-mediated EPSC (AMPA-R EPSC) and the sIPSC (90% ± 12%, n = 6, p = 0.3) (Figure 4C). These experiments confirm that NMDA-R activation via the pairing protocol is required for LTP of the sIPSC. To ask whether sIPSC potentiation is due to Ca2+ influx through NMDA-Rs, we tested the effect of chelating internal Ca2+ and blocking Ca2+ channels and whether LTP of sIPSC is induced locally near the activated synapses on dendrites. Whereas the pairing protocol still caused LTP of sIPSC when the intracellular Ca2+ level was moderately buffered by 1.1 mM EGTA, no potentiation of sIPSC could be induced with 10 mM BAPTA in the patch pipette solution (87% ± 19% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 6, p = 0.6) (Figure 4D). A rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ is likely responsible for potentiating the sIPSC since Oregon green BAPTA 488-1 or lucifer yellow—fluorescent markers of sizes comparable to BAPTA—could diffuse from the pipette solution to distal apical dendrites within 5–10 min after whole-cell patch-clamp was established (Figure S2). Blocking voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with nifedipine (100 μM), however, did not eliminate pairing-induced LTP of sIPSC (295% ± 53% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 7, p < 0.01; Figure S3). Moreover, pairing depolarization with stimulation of nerve fibers near proximal dendrites (pathway 2) did not cause potentiation of sIPSC elicited by nerve stimulation near distal dendrites (pathway 1) of CA1 pyramidal neurons (107% ± 26% at ∼20 min after pairing for pathway 2, n = 8, p = 0.2; Figure S4). Taken together, these findings suggest that Ca2+ influx through NMDA-Rs is essential for the induction of LTP of sIPSC. Even though pairing-induced potentiation of the sIPSC requires postsynaptic NMDA-R activation and Ca2+ rise, a priori, it remains possible that this potentiation could result from increased GABA release, perhaps by retrograde signaling via endocannabinoids (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003Chevaleyre V. Castillo P.E.

Endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signalling at hippocampal synapses.Nature. 2001; 410: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). However, the CB1 cannabinoid-receptor antagonist AM251 (2 μM) did not affect pairing-induced LTP of sIPSC (370% ± 33% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 5, p < 0.001). Moreover, the pairing protocol did not alter GABA release to an extent that affected the paired-pulse ratio of the GABAA-R mediated fIPSC (before pairing, 0.74 ± 0.04; 10 min after pairing, 0.74 ± 0.05, p = 0.9; 20 min after pairing, 0.70 ± 0.04, p = 0.5; n = 5); the paired-pulse ratio’s sensitivity to transmitter release was verified by varying Ca2+ concentrations in control experiments. Thus, the pairing-induced LTP of sIPSC could not be attributed to CB1 receptor-mediated endocannabinoid retrograde signaling or increased GABA release. CaMKII activity is necessary for sIPSC potentiation because treatment of the slice culture with 10 μM KN-93, a selective inhibitor of CaMKII, eliminated pairing-induced LTP of sIPSC (90% ± 15% at ∼20 min after pairing, n = 11, p = 0.6) (Figure 5A ). To ask whether postsynaptic CaMKII activity is also sufficient for sIPSC potentiation, we utilized the Sindbis virus to introduce into CA1 pyramidal neurons the constitutively active enzyme fused with EGFP, CaMKII(1–290)-EGFP; the great majority of the infected neurons were glutamatergic pyramidal neurons. For internal control, we simultaneously recorded from an uninfected neuron and a nearby neuron expressing CaMKII(1–290)-EGFP (Figure 5B) and compared their sIPSCs that were elicited with the same condition for synaptic stimulation. The constitutively active CaMKII potentiated the sIPSC (neurons expressing CaMKII(1–290)-EGFP, 6.1 ± 0.5 pA; neighboring control neurons, 3.0 ± 1.0 pA; n = 16, p < 0.0005) but not the NMDA-R EPSC (neurons expressing CaMKII(1–290)-EGFP, 46.0 ± 10.7 pA; neighboring control neurons, 47.5 ± 12.5 pA; n = 17, p = 0.4) (Figure 5D). In control experiments, neurons expressing EGFP and their neighboring uninfected neurons yielded similar sIPSC (neurons expressing EGFP, 2.9 ± 0.7 pA; neighboring control neurons, 3.1 ± 0.9 pA; n = 18, p = 0.8) and NMDA-R EPSC (neurons expressing EGFP, 38.8 ± 5.1 pA; neighboring control neurons, 40.9 ± 6.0 pA; n = 24, p = 0.4) (Figure 5C). Not only was constitutively active CaMKII sufficient for potentiating the sIPSC, it occluded pairing-induced LTP of sIPSC; neurons expressing CaMKII(1–290)-EGFP showed no further potentiation of sIPSC after pairing (113% ± 54%, n = 7, p = 0.1), while control neurons expressing EGFP still exhibited pairing-induced LTP of sIPSC (287% ± 43"

We show that with a sexually antagonistic trait on the X chromosome (males XY, females XX), females evolve to prefer mates carrying alleles beneficial to daughters. In contrast, with a Z-linked trait (males ZZ, females ZW), females more often evolve mating preferences for mates carrying alleles beneficial to sons (that is, flashy displays)."

In the present study, we have investigated the hydrogen/deuterium exchange of Aβ-(1–42) fibrils under physiological conditions, using solution NMR spectroscopy. The obtained residue-specific and quantitative map of the solvent protection within the Aβ-(1–42) fibril shows that there are two protected core regions, Glu11-Gly25 and Lys28-Ala42, and that the residues in between, Ser26 and Asn27, as well as those in the N terminus, Asp1-Tyr10, are solvent-accessible. This result reveals considerable discrepancies when compared with a previous investigation on Aβ-(1–40) fibrils and suggests that the additional residues in Aβ-(1–42), Ile41 and Ala42, significantly increase the solvent protection and stability of the C-terminal region Lys28-Ala42.

The obtained residue-specific and quantitative map of the solvent protection within the Aβ-(1–42) fibril shows that there are two protected core regions, Glu11-Gly25 and Lys28-Ala42, and that the residues in between, Ser26 and Asn27, as well as those in the N terminus, Asp1-Tyr10, are solvent-accessible. This result reveals considerable discrepancies when compared with a previous investigation on Aβ-(1–40) fibrils and suggests that the additional residues in Aβ-(1–42), Ile41 and Ala42, significantly increase the solvent protection and stability of the C-terminal region Lys28-Ala42. Consequently, our findings provide a molecular explanation for the increased amyloidogenicity and toxicity of Aβ-(1–42) compared with shorter Aβ variants found in vivo Protein assemblies in the form of amyloid fibrils are today linked to a group of ∼20 different syndromes, of which Alzheimer disease (AD), 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAβamyloid-βH/Dhydrogen/deuteriumHFIP1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol-d2ADDLAβ-derived diffusible ligandHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationDIPSIdecoupling in the presence of scalar interactions. as well as various forms of prion disorders, are among the most well known. Amyloids, in general, are composed of predominantly β-sheet structures, where the β-strands are arranged perpendicular to the fibrillar axis into a common so-called cross-β pattern (1Sunde M.

The pathology is tightly linked to the aggregation of a 39–43-residue-long peptide fragment denoted amyloid-β (Aβ) derived as a result of proteolytic processing of the considerably larger amyloid precursor protein. Aggregated Aβ peptides are found in AD brains in the form of diffuse and senile plaques as well as in cerebrovascular tissues. Considerable experimental evidence suggests an important role of Aβ-(1–42/43) in the progress of AD, because it represents the main constituent of the first deposits found in the course of disease development (5Iwatsubo T.

The mechanisms by which a cytotoxic effect is exerted in vivo and the reasons why a pathologic self-aggregation is induced in certain individuals are complex and at present not completely understood. Prevention of Aβ assembly therefore constitutes a considerable therapeutic challenge, where an increased understanding regarding the properties of amyloid, and the pathways leading to its formation, is of utmost importance. Alzheimer disease amyloid-β hydrogen/deuterium 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol-d2 Aβ-derived diffusible ligand heteronuclear single quantum correlation decoupling in the presence of scalar interactions. Because of the generic quaternary structure and the large size of amyloid structures, elucidation of their architecture provides a complicated problem, where traditional methods, such as crystal diffraction and solution NMR, are not readily applicable. However, two recent crystallographic studies on fibrous micro-crystals, grown from peptides with either seven or twelve residues, have revealed many interesting structural details about the cross-β spine of fibrils (10Nelson R.

Solid-state NMR performed on dried fibrils provides an alternative to the above mentioned techniques and has been used extensively to investigate the structure of Aβ amyloid. Studies on Aβ-(10–35), Aβ-(1–40), and Aβ-(1–42) suggest an arrangement where fibrils are formed by extended parallel β-strands arranged into two sheets (12Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Balbach J.J.

The results suggest a fibrillar core involving residues Val12-Val24 and Ala30-Ala42 and a loop spanning between residues Val24-Ala30 (15Antzutkin O.N. Balbach J.J. Tycko R. Biophys.

The structural restraints obtained from these solid-state NMR studies suggest a model where parallel β-sheets are organized in exact register (16Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N.

Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2871-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and nanotube (18Perutz M.F. Finch J.T. Berriman J. Lesk A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5591-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) models. To gain information about the structural and dynamical properties of fibrils in an aqueous environment, a novel method using solution NMR spectroscopy in combination with hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange was developed (19Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20Ippel J.H. Olofsson A. Schleucher J. Lundgren E. Wijmenga S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This technique relies on the partial solvent protection of amide protons, either as a result of their involvement in hydrogen bonds between β-strands within the fibril or as a result of solvent exclusion. In aqueous solutions, amide protons located at the exterior of the fibril are more accessible to solvent compared with amide protons buried within the fibril interior, and consequently these will experience a higher hydrogen exchange rate. Through exchange of the surrounding water by D2O, followed by a rapid conversion of the fibrils into a monomeric NMR-detectable state, the H/D exchange pattern of the amyloid can be measured indirectly using solution NMR. The method pinpoints the fibrillar core in a residue-specific and quantitative manner and gives a view of the fibrillar dynamics in solution. This approach has therefore turned out to be a powerful complement to solid state measurement and has offered a more complete picture of the fibrillar properties of the amyloid in several cases (19Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20Ippel J.H. Olofsson A. Schleucher J. Lundgren E. Wijmenga S.S.

This study utilizes H/D exchange experiments and solution NMR spectroscopy to probe, for the first time, the fibrillar core of amyloid fibrils derived from Aβ-(1–42). The obtained solvent protection pattern identifies two well protected regions, a result that differs considerably from a similar study on Aβ-(1–40) (21Whittemore N.A. Mishra R. Kheterpal I. Williams A.D. Wetzel R. Serpersu E.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4434-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The additional residues, Ile41 and Ala42, appear to significantly stabilize the fibril assembly, in particular the C-terminal parts of the peptide. These results provide a molecular explanation to the increased amyloidogenicity of Aβ-(1–42) compared with the shorter variants of Aβ found in vivo. NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignment of Aβ-(1–42)—Isotope-enriched chemicals were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. According to a newly established procedure, 3A. Olofsson, unpublished data. uniformly 15N-labeled Aβ-(1–42) was produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli. A typical NMR sample contained 1 mm recombinant Aβ-(1–42), 80% 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol-d2 (HFIP)/20% H2O (v/v), and 150 mm NaCl buffered to pH 3.0 using d3-acetate and d6-acetic acid. NMR experiments were carried out at 15 °C on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 600 MHz (proton frequency) and equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance, pulsed field z-gradient cryoprobe. Recorded homonuclear two-dimensional clean total correlation spectroscopy and heteronuclear two-dimensional 15N-HSQC, as well as three-dimensional 15N-DIPSI-HSQC and 15N-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC experiments, were processed using NMRPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) or XWINNMR (Bruker Biospin) software. The sequence-specific backbone resonance assignment of Aβ-(1–42) was carried out in Ansig for Windows (27Helgstrand M. Kraulis P. Allard P. Härd T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) following the standard strategy for 15N-labeled proteins. H/D Exchange of Aβ-(1–42) Fibrils Analyzed by NMR—The fibrillar solution was prepared by incubating a sample of ∼1 mm 15N-labeled Aβ-(1–42) in double distilled H2O containing 50 mm NaCl at 37 °C for 10–12 days during slow agitation. The resulting gel-like solution was split into three samples, and the pellet was recovered by short centrifugations at 13000 × g. For two of the samples, the pellet (30 μl) was diluted 30 times using D2O, pD 7.0. To ensure an essentially complete removal of H2O, the washing procedure was repeated once. These two samples were subsequently incubated in D2O for 20 and 120 min, respectively, which includes the duration for the buffer exchange procedure. The third sample contained fully protonated fibrils and served as a control. The pelleted fibrils in the three samples were rapidly dissolved into monomers in 80% HFIP/20% D2O (v/v) and 150 mm NaCl, buffered to pD 2.6 using d3-acetate and d6-acetic acid. Each sample acquired a peptide concentration corresponding to ∼1 mm. Hydrogen exchange of each individual amide group of the Aβ-(1–42) peptide was monitored by recording a series of heteronuclear two-dimensional 15N-HSQC experiments, starting 7 or 8 min after dissolution of the fibrils. Each experiment was recorded with four transients/increment and 128 (t1) × 1024 (t2) complex data points, resulting in an acquisition time of 10 min. To quantitatively monitor dissolution of the fibrils into a monomeric species, the integrals of non-exchangeable methyl groups were determined in one-dimensional proton spectra, recorded prior to each 15N-HSQC spectrum. The H/D exchange experimental series on the fully protonated Aβ-(1–42) fibrils determined the solvent protection levels of amide protons within the monomeric species. With residual H2O present in the pellet, the exchange to deuterium reached ∼80%, a fact that is taken into account in the analysis. Data Analysis and Fitting—Processing of the recorded 15N-HSQC experiment was carried out with NMRPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar), whereas XWINNMR (Bruker Biospin) was used for processing and analysis of one-dimensional spectra. To monitor the post-trap H/D exchange after dissolution of the partly exchanged Aβ-(1–42) fibrils in D2O, peak volumes from base-line-corrected 15N-HSQC spectra were obtained by integration using NMRView software routines (28Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) and analyzed by non-linear fitting routines in the software Grace (plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace). The monomer concentration of the solution was determined from integration of the non-exchangeable methyl region in one-dimensional proton NMR spectra, which were recorded directly prior to each individual 15N-HSQC spectrum. The integral (I) of the amide resonance of each protected residue in the monomeric state was fitted to a single exponential function, I(t) = (I0-Iinf)·e[-ksolv(monomer)·t] + Iinf, where I0 is the extrapolated proton integral at time zero, ksolv is the post-trap H/D exchange rate, and Iinf is the integral at infinity. I0 describes the degree of protonation of amide groups that survived the deuterium exchange period with D2O in the fibrillar state prior to re-solubilization. The actual fraction of protection within the fibrillar state is calculated by a comparison of corresponding peak integrals in a similarly treated but fully protonated reference sample. By definition, the relative ratio between I0 in the two spectra is 100% in the absence of any H/D exchange process and 0% under conditions of complete H/D exchange. Atomic Force Microscopy—An aliquot of the Aβ-(1–42) fibril solution used for H/D exchange experiments was withdrawn and diluted to 5 μm with double distilled H2O. 10 μl of this sample was applied onto freshly cleaved ruby red mica (Goodfellow, Cambridge, UK). The material was further allowed to adsorb for 30 s and then washed three times with distilled water and air dried. The surface was analyzed with a Nanoscope IIIa multimode atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments) using Tapping Mode™ in air. A silicon probe was oscillated at 258 kHz, and images were collected at an optimized scan rate corresponding to 1–4 Hz. The image was flattened and presented in height mode using Nanoscope software (Digital Instruments). Structure Modeling—A model of the fibrillar structure of Aβ-(1–42) was generated from the coordinates of the structural model of the Aβ-(1–40) fibril kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tycko (16Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). The monomeric structure was modified manually in MOLMOL (29Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) by adding the missing N- and C-terminal residues, followed by energy minimization in Swiss-PdbViewer, version 3.7 (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar), using the GROMOS96 43B1 force field. Selecting a Suitable Solvent for Dissolution and NMR Analysis of Aβ-(1–42) Fibrils—The ability to quickly convert the fibrils into a monomeric state is essential for NMR detection of protected amide protons within the fibril. During this process, the H/D exchange pattern trapped by the secondary structures of the fibrils is transferred to and must be preserved in the monomeric state. By performing the experiments at a pH value of ∼3 and at low temperatures, amide proton exchange rates could be minimized. Furthermore, an induction of secondary structure in the monomer considerably reduced the amide proton exchange rates via the formation of new hydrogen bonds. We found that a mixture of 80% HFIP/20% water (v/v) at pH 3 had the capability of rapid dissolution of Aβ-(1–42) fibrils. In a previous investigation, performed under very similar conditions, the peptide formed a well structured conformation with two α-helices, comprising residues Ser8-Gly25 and Lys28-Gly38 and a bend centered at position Ser26-Asn27 (31Crescenzi O. Tomaselli S. Guerrini R. Salvadori S. D'Ursi A.M. Temussi P.A. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5642-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism measurements showed a further increase of α-helical structure with an increasing concentration of NaCl up to a nearly saturated solution of ∼150 mm salt (data not shown). The observed 15N-HSQC spectrum of the Aβ-(1–42) peptide in this HFIP/water solution and 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, displayed a well dispersed spectrum with an optimal separation of peaks at 15 °C, a temperature at which the hydrogen exchange rate is relatively slow. NMR Resonance Assignment of Aβ-(1–42) in Solution—Sequence-specific resonance assignment turned out to be straightforward with few overlapping resonances. Most resonances were assigned via a sequential walk between the backbone amide protons in the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectrum or via sequential or medium range nuclear Overhauser effect contacts, characteristic for α-helices. All 41 backbone amide resonances (residue 2–42) were identified. Our data are generally in agreement with the previously reported assignment and structure of Aβ-(1–42) performed in HFIP (31Crescenzi O. Tomaselli S. Guerrini R. Salvadori S. D'Ursi A.M. Temussi P.A. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5642-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Fibril Formation and Atomic Force Microscopy Analysis of Aβ-(1–42)—Fibril formation was induced by dissolving ∼1 mm 15N-labeled Aβ-(1–42) in double distilled H2O containing 50 mm NaCl, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10–12 days during slow agitation. The initially non-viscous solution acquired a gel-like appearance, and the presence of fibrils was verified using atomic force microscopy (Fig. 1). The fibrils formed were of varying length usually exceeding 1 μm in length and with an average height corresponding to 3.5 nm. A repetitive pattern of nodules could also be observed, indicating a twist of the fibril with an average pitch of ∼110 nm. H/D Experiments and Determination of Protection Factors of Aβ-(1–42) Fibrils—The fibrillar material was easily collected from the gel-like fibril solution by centrifugation. H/D exchange was carried out by resuspension and incubation of the fibrillar pellet in D2O, followed by re-collection of fibrils using centrifugation. This procedure was repeated once to efficiently remove water (residual water, ∼0.1% (v/v)) and non-aggregated material. After a total exchange period of either 20 or 120 min, the fibrils were converted into NMR-detectable monomers by dissolution in 80% HFIP/20% D2O (v/v) and 150 mm NaCl at pD 2.6. H/D exchange in the monomeric state was monitored by recording a series of 15N-HSQC spectra over time. Fig. 2A shows a spectrum of the fully protonated peptide, whereas the spectra in Fig. 2, B and C, were recorded 12 and 196 min, respectively, after dissolution of the H/D-exchanged fibril material. The observed signal intensity of each amide resonance is determined by the level of solvent protection in the fibrillar state, the concentration of monomers, the rate for which fibrils are converted into monomers, and the H/D exchange rate in the monomeric state. By recording one-dimensional proton NMR spectra prior to each 15N-HSQC spectrum and integrating the non-exchangeable methyl region of these spectra, the dissolution rates, as well as the relative concentration between samples, could be determined (data not shown). Our results showed that >94% of the total material was dissolved prior to the first recorded spectrum, and a correction was made by fitting a single exponential with a rate constant of 0.0015 min-1.Asa consequence of the H/D exchange, the intensity of the amide resonances will decline with time (Fig. 2). The signal decay rates of each individual amide resonance were obtained by fitting the corrected signal intensities to the equation under “Data Analysis and Fitting.” An extrapolation to time zero of fibril dissolution gives the signal intensity (I0) of each residue in the fibrillar state. Fig. 3 illustrates the curve fit of the post-trap decay for residues Ile31, Val39, and Ile40. This treatment enables identification of solvent-protected residues within the fibril and facilitates quantification of the protection level. The protection factors of individual residues are determined by calculating the ratio of the initial signal intensities obtained from samples pre-incubated in D2O and a fully protonated reference sample. Fig. 4 shows the obtained protection factors, which will be discussed below.FIGURE 3Hydrogen-deuterium exchange of Aβ-(1–42).

The protection is defined as the ratio of the observed intensity after a pre-incubation period in D2O over the intensity in a completely protonated sample (defined as 100%). Dark and light gray bars indicate the protection after 20 and 120 min of pre-incubation in D2O, respectively. # corresponds to 0% protection, and x represents residues that exchange too fast for detection.

Residue names are indicated with their one-letter codes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain a reliable H/D protection pattern, one must discriminate between the H/D amide proton exchange occurring as a result of the preceding incubation in D2O and H/D amide proton exchange occurring as a result of an unprotected position within the monomeric state. Therefore, the recorded series of 15N-HSQC spectra, which monitor the H/D exchange in fully protonated fibrils (no pre-incubation in D2O) serves as a highly important reference. The result showed that 35 of 41 possible amide protons can be used for probing the solvent protection pattern of the fibril. Residues Ala2, His6, Asp7, Ser8, His14, and Asp23 experienced an H/D exchange rate within the monomeric state, which is too fast to enable detection and thereby makes their level of protection within the fibril unattainable. This lack of protection is because of the solvent-exposed positions of these residues in the monomeric fold, either in the flexible N-terminal tail or, as in the case of Asp23, its position close to a turn. The solvent protection pattern of the fibrils was determined from fibrillar samples that were pre-incubated in D2O for 20 or 120 min (Fig. 4). By using two different pre-incubation times, valuable information about the solvent exchange rates and structural stability of the fibrils could be obtained. Our results showed that, after a pre-incubation of 20 min, a total of 28 amides were observed, showing a protection pattern essentially covering two regions of the fibril. Both regions showed a slightly bell-shaped protection curve, where the first covered residues Glu11-Gly25, except for residues His14 and Asp23, and the second region covered residues Lys28-Ala42 with a very high degree of protection. Residues Glu3, Phe4, Arg5, Gly9, Tyr10, Ser26, and Asn27 were all confirmed to be unprotected within the fibrillar state (Fig. 4). After 2 h of pre-incubation in D2O, the protection pattern was essentially the same for a majority of residues. However a slight decrease of protection was observed in the flanking residues of the first region (residues Glu11-Gly25), and one residue, Val12, was now completely exchanged. Fig. 5 shows the obtained protection factors mapped onto our model of the Aβ-(1–42) fibril. The Aβ peptide is the main protein component of plaques found in patients with the neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer disease. Production of Aβ is the result of proteolytic digestion of the significantly larger amyloid precursor protein resulting in a length of the peptide corresponding to 39–43 residues. Most of the amyloid precursor protein mutations that ultimately result in early onset of AD have now been linked to an increased concentration of Aβ peptides either via an enhanced expression (6Lemere C.A. Blusztajn J.K. Yamaguchi H. Wisniewski T. Saido T.C. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1996; 3: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) or through an increased proteolytic processing (32Citron M.

Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The aggregation propensity among Aβ fragments of different length differs significantly, and AD has moreover been linked to an increased proportion of longer variants, in particular the highly amyloidogenic 42-residue form (7Suzuki N.

https://openalex.org/W2000736649,"The receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) belongs to the neuregulin/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and is activated by RANK ligand (RANK-L), a homotrimeric, TNF-like cytokine. RANK is present on the surface of osteoclast cell precursors, where its interaction with RANK-L induces their terminal differentiation into osteoclasts, thus increasing bone breakdown. The secreted, soluble receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) interrupts this activation by binding directly to RANK-L. Therefore, osteoclast maturation (and bone homeostasis) is regulated in vivo by OPG levels of expression. We have studied the assembly state and affinity of OPG for RANK-L by sedimentation analyses and surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). Full-length, homodimeric OPG binds to RANK-L with a KD of 10 nm. OPG is also a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and contains four disulfide-rich ligand-binding domains, yet lacks a transmembrane region separating the ligand-binding region from the two death domains, as observed for other receptor family members. We showed that dimerization of OPG results from noncovalent interactions mediated by the death domains and to a lesser extent by a C-terminal heparin-binding region. In contrast, a C-terminal intermolecular disulfide bond does not contribute to the formation or stability of OPG dimers. A truncate of osteoprotegerin, containing the ligand-binding domains but lacking the dimerization domains, bound RANK-L with a KD of ∼3 μm, indicating that monomer oligomerization for the OPG provides an increase of 3 orders of magnitude in the affinity for RANK-L. Therefore, OPG dimer formation is required for the mechanism of inhibition of the RANK-L/RANK receptor interaction.

Bone remodeling, a coordinated equilibrium between bone synthesis and bone resorption, is a continuously occurring process that maintains skeletal integrity in vertebrates (1Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular differentiation signals responsible for the regulation of bone remodeling processes are ultimately determined by binding interactions between proteins localized at the cell surface of osteoblasts and osteoclasts (1Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoblasts are cells derived from bone marrow stem cells, responsible for bone formation (2Theill L.E. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Annu. Rev.

RANK-L present on the surface of osteoblasts binds to its receptor, RANK, on the surface of immature osteoclasts, inducing their maturation, thus shifting the balance toward bone breakdown (5Fuller K. Wong B. Fox S. Choi Y. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). This interaction requires cell-cell contact between, or in close proximity of, osteoblasts and osteoclasts (3Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). RANK-L is also an essential factor for the survival of mature osteoclasts (3Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Over the last 8 years, dramatic progress has been made toward understanding the pathophysiology of bone resorption because of the discovery of RANK-L and its two receptors, a signaling receptor that mediates osteoclast differentiation, function, and survival (RANK), and a soluble receptor, OPG. The regulation of the balance between bone breakdown and reformation is modulated to a large extent by the secreted, soluble receptor OPG (7Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R.

RANK-L is displayed as an intrinsic protein on the surface of osteoblasts, but it is also post-translationally cleaved.

The ectodomain or receptor-binding domain of RANK-L has been demonstrated to be the only region necessary for binding to the soluble receptor OPG and for activation of osteoclastogenesis through binding to RANK (7Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H. Sullivan J. Hawkins N. Davy E. Capparelli C. Eli A. Qian Y.X. Kaufman S. Sarosi I.

A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3588) Google Scholar). The domain structure of each protein is illustrated in Fig. 1. RANK-L is a 61-kDa homotrimer with equilibrium association constant for trimerization of 6.5 × 1020 m-2 (18Willard D. Chen W.J. Barrett G. Blackburn K. Bynum J. Consler T. Hoffman C. Horne E. Iannone M.A. Kadwell S. Parham J. Ellis B. Protein Expression Purif. 1920; 20: 48-57Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but it is likely to be even higher, as this affinity is at the limit of detection for an association that can be measured by sedimentation equilibrium using absorbance optics. The structure of the murine RANK-L homotrimeric ectodomain has been solved by x-ray crystallography and shown to have a “jelly roll” architecture comparable with other TNF-like cytokines (19Ito S. Wakabayashi K. Ubukata O. Hayashi S. Okada F. Hata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6631-6636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In similarity to other neuregulin/TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily members, the extracellular domain of RANK is characterized by four C-terminal cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). These TNFR-like domains are followed by a single transmembrane helix and a large cytoplasmic domain containing three TNFR-associated factor-binding sites (20Galibert L. Tometsko M.E. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34120-34127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). OPG is also a TNFR family secreted, soluble homodimeric receptor (50-kDa monomer) composed of four N-terminal CRDs, followed by two modules homologous to the death domains (DDs) of the TNFR that are extracellular because OPG lacks a transmembrane domain (21Aubin J.E. Bonnelye E. Osteoporosis Int. 2000; 11: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). DDs on all other known TNF receptor superfamily members are exposed only to the cytoplasmic environment (22Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). There is a C-terminal basic region involved in heparin binding, ending in a single cysteine (Cys-400), adjacent to the C-terminal leucine (Leu-401), known to form a disulfide bond in the intact homodimeric form of OPG (23Tomoyasu A. Goto M. Fujise N. Mochizuki S. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Merewether L.A. Le J. Jones M.D. Lee R. Shimamoto G. Lu H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Other TNFR superfamily members also exhibit soluble decoy forms, but they are generated by cleavage of the membrane-anchored receptor. So far, OPG is the only reported soluble decoy receptor in this superfamily with extracellular DDs stemming from the lack of a transmembrane domain (22Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The function of the DDs and the C-terminal basic region of OPG is presently unknown. OPG has been observed in vivo as both a covalent, intermolecular disulfide cross-linked dimer and as a species lacking the intermolecular disulfide bond because of C-terminal truncation (23Tomoyasu A. Goto M. Fujise N. Mochizuki S. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Yano K. Tsuda E. Washida N.

Watanabe N. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Both the truncated monomer and the dimer appeared to have similar IC50 values in osteoclastogenesis inhibition assays (23Tomoyasu A. Goto M. Fujise N. Mochizuki S. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the notion of direct competition between RANK and OPG for association with RANK-L. The binding of RANK-L to the RANK receptor has been demonstrated through immunoprecipitation assays using a soluble RANK-L ectodomain form and osteoclast progenitors as a source of RANK (28Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Ligation of RANK-L to the soluble OPG receptor was observed functionally through an in vitro osteoclastogenesis assay. In this assay, the induction of osteoclast maturation by RANK-L was detected by the production of tartrate-resistant phosphatase and cellular morphological changes. Osteoclastogenesis as measured in such a way was inhibited in a competitive manner by OPG (5Fuller K. Wong B. Fox S. Choi Y. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 23Tomoyasu A. Goto M. Fujise N. Mochizuki S. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Direct binding of RANK-L to a osteoprotegerin-IgG Fc domain fusion (OPG-Fc) has also been measured and reported to exhibit a KD of 6.7 nm, using surface plasmon resonance (18Willard D. Chen W.J. Barrett G. Blackburn K. Bynum J. Consler T. Hoffman C. Horne E. Iannone M.A. Kadwell S. Parham J. Ellis B. Protein Expression Purif. 1920; 20: 48-57Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although these studies provide convincing evidence of the cellular function and tight affinity of binding of OPG to RANK-L, much is still unknown about the mechanism of complex formation and the resulting inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. In fact, the high affinity interaction between OPG and RANK-L suggests an avidity model for their interaction. We hypothesize that the domain structure of OPG is important for the proper oligomerization and orientation of these multiple binding sites. In this study, we investigate the strength and stoichiometry of the OPG·RANK-L complex and the structural aspects of OPG determining its ability to ligate RANK-L. We also address the contribution of individual domains of OPG to its binding function. Therefore, our results provide for the first time a molecular context for previous functional analyses of the effect of OPG on osteoclast differentiation. All of our studies used the globular ectodomain of RANK-L, a trimer at concentrations above 40 pm (18Willard D. Chen W.J. Barrett G. Blackburn K. Bynum J. Consler T. Hoffman C. Horne E. Iannone M.A. Kadwell S. Parham J. Ellis B. Protein Expression Purif. 1920; 20: 48-57Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This form has been shown to contain the receptor-binding module and to fold independently of the remainder of the protein (7Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H. Sullivan J. Hawkins N. Davy E. Capparelli C. Eli A. Qian Y.X. Kaufman S. Sarosi I. Shalhoub V. Senaldi G. Guo J. Delaney J. Boyle W.J.

This truncated form is physiologically relevant, because membrane-bound RANK-L has been shown to undergo regulated shedding from the cell surface in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner to yield this ectodomain (17Schlondorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Viruses and Protein Expression—All constructs were prepared using the pFastBac1 (pFB; Invitrogen) expression vector. The pFB-RANK-L truncate was a generous gift from GlaxoSmithKline, and its preparation and characterization were published previously (18Willard D. Chen W.J. Barrett G. Blackburn K. Bynum J. Consler T. Hoffman C. Horne E. Iannone M.A. Kadwell S. Parham J. Ellis B. Protein Expression Purif. 1920; 20: 48-57Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The wild type pFB-OPG-H (His6) was a generous gift from GlaxoSmithKline, and its preparation was similar to that published for the pFB-OPG-Fc (18Willard D. Chen W.J. Barrett G. Blackburn K. Bynum J. Consler T. Hoffman C. Horne E. Iannone M.A. Kadwell S. Parham J. Ellis B. Protein Expression Purif. 1920; 20: 48-57Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The pFB-C + RANK-L construct was engineered with an N-terminal cysteine for Biacore surface coupling using PCR to insert the additional codon. The OPG constructs are depicted in Fig. 1 and are the same as those of Yamaguchi et al. (29Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Goto M. Kobayashi F. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5117-5123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) so that functional comparisons can be made. A cassette containing the C400A mutation was subcloned into the BstEII and NotI sites of pFB-OPG-H after a SalI/XbaI digest to remove a NotI site in the multiple cloning site. EcoNI/NotI digestion of pFB-OPGC400A-H followed by a Pfu polymerase fill-in reaction generated pFB-OPGΔDDB-H ending at residue 201 with a non-native tryptophan as residue 202, followed by the linker AAAKKG and the His6 tag. The sequence GLMHALKHSKTYHFPKTVTQSL365, followed by the linker and the His6 tag, was subcloned between the Eco0109I and NotI sites of pFB-OPGC400A-H to generate pFB-OPGΔB-H, a truncate ending at residue 365. The end of the signal peptide (ALVFLDISIKWTTQ) and reaching into the first four residues of the first death domain (DVTL) were subcloned into the BssHII and EcoNI sites of pFB-OPG-H to generate pFB-OPGΔCRD-H. All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant bacmids were produced by transformation of DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) with pFB plasmids. Bacmid DNA was isolated and purified. Sf9 insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda; Invitrogen) were transfected by using FuGENE (1μg of bacmid) to generate baculovirus as described (30Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses were amplified and titered using an agarose plaque-forming assay. T. ni insect cells (Trichoplusia ni; Invitrogen) were infected while growing logarithmically with each virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Cells were harvested at 24 h for OPGC400A-H, 72 h for OPGΔB-H, and 48 h for all other constructs. Protein Purification—The truncates OPGC400A-H, OPGΔCRD-H, and OPGΔB-H were adsorbed over Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose and then eluted with stepwise imidazole washes. OPGC400A-H and OPGΔCRD-H eluted at 1 m imidazole, and OPGΔB-H eluted at 300 mm. A Q-Sepharose column was used to purify OPGΔDDB-H, which elutes in the flow-through and was then adsorbed to Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose and eluted with 100 mm imidazole. C + RANK-L was purified over Q-Sepharose washed stepwise with NaCl. Elution occurred at 200-300 mm NaCl. T. ni-derived human OPG-IgG fusion (OPG-Fc), RANK-L, and OPG-H pure proteins were purified as described (18Willard D. Chen W.J. Barrett G. Blackburn K. Bynum J. Consler T. Hoffman C. Horne E.

Willard, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC. Sedimentation Analyses—Analytical ultracentrifugation of all proteins was performed at 20 °C using interference optics (for sedimentation velocity analysis of OPG-Fc and its complexes) in an XL-I ultracentrifuge, employing an 8-hole rotor, or using absorbance optics (for sedimentation velocity of all other constructs and complexes and for sedimentation equilibrium analysis) in an XL-A ultracentrifuge, employing a 4-hole rotor. Samples were buffer-matched in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The partial specific volumes (v̄) of the protein were estimated from the amino acid composition plus a glycosylation estimate, and the solvent density and viscosity were estimated from the sum of the density/viscosity increments of the buffer components using Sedenterp (D. Hayes (Magdalen College, Warner, NH), T. Laue (University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH), and J. Philo (Alliance Protein Laboratories, Thousand Oaks, CA)). Sedimentation velocity analysis was performed using two-channel Epon centerpieces with sapphire windows, spinning at 50,000 rpm.

Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the number of sedimenting boundaries was confirmed by continuous c(s) distribution analysis using SedFit 8.4 (P. Schuck, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) (33Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed using two-channel Epon centerpieces with quartz windows, spinning at 25,000, 30,000, and 35,000 rpm for RANK-L; 16,000 and 20,000 for OPG-H; 16,000, 20,000, and 24,000 rpm for OPGΔB-H; 24,000 and 29,000 rpm for OPGΔDDB-H; 20,000, 24,000, and 30,000 rpm for OPGΔCRD-H; 8,000, 11,000, and 14,000 rpm for OPGC400A-H; 8,000 or 9,000 and 12,000 rpm for OPG-Fc; and formed complexes. Scans were collected at multiple wavelengths, and equilibrium was verified by subtraction of scans 4-6 h apart. Equilibrium was typically established after 28 h of centrifugation. Global nonlinear least squares fits were performed using WinNonlin1.06 (M. Johnson, Charlottesville, VA) and an XLA-Analysis macro running in IgorPro 4.08 (J. Cole, Storrs, CT). Both programs fit the sum of exponential equations for A(r) = A(ro)(exp(σ(r2 - ro2))) + O, where σ = (M(1 - v̄ρ)ω2)/2RT. A(r) is the absorbance at r (radial position); A(ro) is the absorbance amplitude at ro (reference radius); O is the base-line offset; M is the mass in daltons; v̄ is the partial specific volume of the protein; ρ is the solvent density; ω is the rotor angular velocity; R is the gas constant; and T is the absolute temperature. Shape analysis of the sedimentation velocity data using the s values and the solution mass from sedimentation equilibrium is described in detail in the Supplemental Material. The measured axial ratios were compared with axial ratios predicted from an α-carbon homology model for OPG and the crystal structure of RANK-L with the addition of 23 residues of disordered sequence (not observed in the crystal structure). Models were built and measured using Swiss-pdb Viewer version 3.7b2 (34Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar). The structures used for the model were Protein Data Bank codes 1JMA (cysteine-rich domains), 1ICH (death domains), and 1JTZ (RANK-L truncate). Additional disordered regions were modeled as random coil except for the first 30 residues of the basic region, which were predicted to be α-helical (3D-PSSM) (35Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) and thus modeled as such. Protein Data Bank code 1JMA found to have limited homology to the CRDs of OPG using Psi-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) was used to generate the model of the OPG CRDs. The measured axial ratio was divided by the model predicted axial ratio to get the degree of flexibility estimate. This parameter provides a relative comparison of dynamic flexibility of the different proteins and complexes with a higher value indicating increased dynamic motion. Circular Dichroism Spectoscopy—CD spectra were collected at 25 °C using an Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer (model 202) from 300 to 190 nm in 2-nm increments using a 1-nm bandwidth and an averaging time of 30 s. The buffer-subtracted spectra were converted to mean residue ellipticity using the path length, number of residues, and molar concentration as measured by absorbance at 280 nm. Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)—Kinetic analysis was performed on a Biacore X, Biacore 1000, or a Biacore 2000 (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) SPR instrument. Assays to measure OPG-Fc binding to RANK-L used a CM5 carboxymethyl-dextran sensor chip with protein A/G (Pierce) immobilized via amine coupling at 500 RUs per flow cell. Approximately 150 RUs of OPG-Fc were captured (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) during a 1-min injection at 10 μl/min for each cycle. RANK-L at varying concentrations was then injected for 3.3 or 4 min at 30 μl/min followed by 10 min of dissociation using kinject. The surface was regenerated back to the base-line level of immobilized protein A/G with a 1.5-min injection of 50 mm NaOH and a 1.5-min injection of 0.1 m H3PO4. Global analysis of at least six concentrations around the KD was performed using BiaEvaluation 3.1 using a 1:1 Langmuir model that fits for the integrated version of these association and dissociation Equations 1 and 2 (36Oshannessy D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2041841530,"Delta oscillations, characteristic of the electroencephalogram (EEG) of slow wave sleep, estimate sleep depth and need and are thought to be closely linked to the recovery function of sleep. The cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of delta waves at the cortical and thalamic levels are well documented, but the molecular regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here we demonstrate in the mouse that the gene encoding the retinoic acid receptor beta determines the contribution of delta oscillations to the sleep EEG. Thus, retinoic acid signaling, which is involved in the patterning of the brain and dopaminergic pathways, regulates cortical synchrony in the adult."
https://openalex.org/W2053168161,"Formation of thrombin is triggered when membrane-localized tissue factor (TF) is exposed to blood. In closed models of this process, thrombin formation displays an initiation phase (low rates of thrombin production cause platelet activation and fibrinogen clotting), a propagation phase (>95% of thrombin production occurs), and a termination phase (prothrombin activation ceases and free thrombin is inactivated). A current controversy centers on whether the TF stimulus requires supplementation from a circulating pool of blood TF to sustain an adequate procoagulant response. We have evaluated the requirement for TF during the progress of the blood coagulation reaction and have extended these analyses to assess the requirement for TF during resupply (“flow replacement”). Elimination of TF activity at various times during the initiation phase indicated: a period of absolute dependence (<10 s); a transitional period in which the dependence on TF is partial and decreases as the reaction proceeds (10–240 s); and a period in which the progress of the reaction is TF independent (>240 s). Resupply of reactions late during the termination phase with fresh reactants, but no TF, yielded immediate bursts of thrombin formation similar in magnitude to the original propagation phases. Our data show that independence from the initial TF stimulus is achieved by the onset of the propagation phase and that the ensemble of coagulation products and intermediates that yield this TF independence maintain their prothrombin activating potential for considerable time. These observations support the hypothesis that the transient, localized expression of TF is sufficient to sustain a TF-independent procoagulant response as long as flow persists.

Binding of plasma factor VIIa to membrane-bound TF results in an ∼2 × 107-fold increase in the enzymatic activity of factor VIIa toward its natural substrates factor IX and factor X (4Bjoern S.

Most studies have concluded that membrane-bound TF, expressed by inflammatory cells and cells outside the vasculature, are the key initiators of the blood coagulation process (5Nemerson Y.

The generation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for clot formation as well as other procoagulant and anticoagulant functions during the blood coagulation process occurs in a nonlinear fashion (8Mann K.G. Butenas S. Brummel K.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). During an initiation phase, tiny amounts of thrombin are generated, platelets, zymogens, and procofactors are activated, and complex enzymes assembled (9Butenas S. van't Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21527-21533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Brummel K.E. Paradis S.G. Butenas S. Mann K.G. Blood. 2002; 100: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a propagation phase of thrombin generation occurs, characterized by dramatic increases in both the rate of thrombin generation and levels of thrombin. The duration of the initiation phase, which roughly corresponds to the clotting time of blood and plasma, is predominantly dependent upon the concentration of the factor VIIa-TF enzyme complex and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (11Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12van't Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin generation during the propagation phase, however, is almost independent of this complex and TFPI (12van't Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). TFPI is a multivalent Kunitz-type plasma proteinase inhibitor (15Wun T.C. Kretzmer K.K.

Blood. 1991; 78: 394-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is the principal stoichiometric inhibitor of the factor VIIa-TF complex and thus is a key regulator of the initiation phase of thrombin generation (12van't Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). TFPI inhibits the factor VIIa-TF complex in a factor Xa-dependent manner (17Broze Jr., G.J. Warren L.A.

The mechanistic dependence of factor VIIa-TF inhibition by TFPI on one of the products of factor VIIa-TF catalysis works against premature neutralization of the TF stimulus. The centrality of the TFPI regulatory mechanism to normal hemostasis is apparent by the lack of reports of individuals with a TFPI–/– genotype and the lethality in utero of the TFPI–/– genotype in transgenic mice (20Huang Z.F. Higuchi D. Lasky N. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 944-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, controversy has emerged concerning the presence and functionality of TF species circulating in blood. Reports of circulating TF can be divided into those showing TF localized on the surface of blood cells and microparticles and those describing a TF species that circulates as a soluble protein (21Diamant M.

These blood TF species are invoked in support of a new hypothesis that TF-dependent thrombin generation requires a continuous infusion of this cofactor. It has, for example, been hypothesized that circulating TF plays an important role in clot growth (26Bogdanov V.Y. Balasubramanian V. Hathcock J. Vele O. Lieb M. Nemerson Y. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, data from our laboratory and others have indicated that there is little or no TF-related activity in the blood of healthy individuals (28Santucci R.A. Erlich J. Labriola J. Wilson M.

The standard simulation sets zymogen, cofactor, and inhibitor concentrations at their mean physiological values and the concentration of the TF stimulus at 5 pm. Simulations designed to define the minimum time interval of TF function were conducted by arresting the standard simulation at selected times, setting the concentrations of free TF and all TF containing species to zero, and then allowing the electronic simulation to proceed. Numerical simulations of resupply were constructed to mimic the equal volume addition of fresh “plasma” material used in the empirical models. Electronic reactions were allowed to proceed for a given time and then stopped. The starting concentrations of all species for the resupplied reaction were then calculated as follows: the concentration of each product or intermediate species at any time (t = x) in the initial reaction was divided in half for the start of the resupplied reaction; for each zymogen, cofactor, and inhibitor, the concentration present at the start of the resupplied reaction was calculated as follows: ((unreacted component concentration at t = x)/2 + (resupply component concentration)/2). TF was not included in the resupplying material. With the initial state of the resupplied reaction defined, the simulation was then restarted. The procedure used is a modification of Lawson et al. (11Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and van't Veer et al. (12van't Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Packham M.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Procofactor Solution—Relipidated TF (10 pm; molar ratio PCPS:TF = 5000) was incubated with 4 μm PCPS or 4 × 108 platelets/ml in HBS (20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 2 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Factor V (40 nm) and factor VIII (1.4 nm) were added prior to the initiation of the reaction. Zymogen-Inhibitor Solution—Prothrombin (2.8 μm), factor VII (20 nm), factor VIIa (0.2 nm), factor X (340 nm), factor IX (180 nm), factor XI (60 nm), TFPI (5 nm), and AT-III (6.8 μm) were preheated in HBS, 2 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 3 min. The reaction was started by mixing equal volumes of both Ca+2 preequilibrated solutions resulting in physiological concentrations of the zymogens, pro-cofactors, and inhibitors, 5 pm TF, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm PCPS or 2 × 108 platelets/ml. Following the start of the reaction, at selected time points, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and quenched in 20 mm EDTA in HBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm Spectrozyme TH and assayed immediately for thrombin activity. The hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Vmax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). Thrombin generation was calculated from a standard curve prepared by serial dilutions of α-thrombin. In the antibody quenching experiments αTF-5 and αFVII-1 (0.25 mg of each; diluted in HBS, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) were added at selected time points to the reaction mixture. Resupply was conducted at selected times by the addition of an equal volume of freshly constituted, TF-free, procofactor/zymogen-inhibitor mixture to an ongoing reaction. The same protocol of sampling, quenching, and assay was then followed. The protocol used is a modification of Rand et al. (13Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A healthy donor was recruited, advised according to a protocol approved by the University of Vermont Human Studies Committee, and his consent obtained. The individual selected exhibited normal values for the parameters of blood coagulation, protein levels, and platelet counts. Experiments were performed in tubes placed on a rocking table enclosed in a 37 °C temperature-controlled glove box using fresh blood. Blood was drawn by venipuncture and immediately delivered into the reagent-loaded tubes. All tubes (two series per experiment) were loaded with corn trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml). No additional reagents were added to the phlebotomy control series (2 tubes). Thirty-two tubes (15 tubes in series A and 17 tubes in series B) were loaded with relipidated TF (TF/PCPS, 5 pm/25 nm) in HBS, 2 mm CaCl2. The zero time tube of each series is pretreated with 1 ml of 50 mm EDTA and 10 μl of 10 mm FPRck (diluted in 10 mm HCl). After blood was delivered, the tubes were periodically (60–1,200 s) quenched with EDTA and FPRck. In TF quenching experiments, antibodies αTF-5 and αFVII-1 (0.25 mg of each; diluted in HBS, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) were added to two series B tubes at 0 s and to 12 tubes (quenching time 180–1,200 s) at 120 s. An equal volume of HBS, 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4) was added to the A series tubes. In all experiments, no more than 35 μl of reagents (3.5% of blood volume) were loaded in each tube. The clotting time was observed visually by two observers and was called when “clumps” were observed on the side of the tube. After the experiment, tubes were centrifuged and the supernatants were aliquoted and analyzed for TAT levels. In resupply experiments, the setup was similar but the B series tubes were not quenched during the first 20 min. At 20 min after initiation with TF, these tubes all received an equal volume of new blood, drawn from the same individual 1 min prior to its use. In some experiments, inhibitory antibodies (αTF-5 and αFVII-1: 0.25 mg of each; diluted in HBS, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) were added to the ongoing reactions 1 min prior to resupply. These tubes were then periodically quenched (1260–2400 s) with EDTA and FPRck. Within this experimental format several additional tubes were quenched at 20 min, prior to resupply, and at 40 min with EDTA only. Sera derived from TF-initiated whole blood quenched only with EDTA was assessed for the presence of active thrombin and for its residual capacity to inhibit thrombin. Active thrombin was measured in a clotting based assay using purified fibrinogen (42Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of a5 mg/ml fibrinogen stock in HBS + 5 mm CaCl2 + 0.1% PEG 8000 was brought to 37 °C and then 50 μl of the thrombin containing sample was added. Clotting times were determined using a ST-4 clotting instrument (Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ). Clotting times obtained in the presence of sera samples were converted to thrombin concentrations by reference to a standard curve constructed with thrombin concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 40 pm. To assess the remaining thrombin inhibitor capacity of these same sera, exogenous thrombin (100 nm or 50 nm final) was added to a 50-μl aliquot of sera at 37 °C. Individual reactions were quenched at different times by a 30-fold dilution with HBS and then assayed immediately as described above. The efficacy of the quenching scheme was established by experiments in which the sera samples were diluted 30-fold prior to the addition of thrombin: assays conducted within 1 min of thrombin addition to a diluted plasma sample showed no decay in thrombin activity. Analysis of the observed decay in thrombin activity as a first-order process yielded a good fit to the data. In empirical models the initiation phase of thrombin generation is defined as a time interval from the start of the reaction (represented by 0 on the horizontal (x) axis in figures) to the point of intersection of the x axis and a tangent to the maximum slope of thrombin generation. This point roughly corresponds to the clotting time in blood and plasma. In numerical simulations the initiation phase is defined as the time to reach an active thrombin level of 2 nm (∼10 nm TAT). The propagation phase of thrombin generation is defined as a time interval from the end of the initiation phase to the maximum thrombin (or TAT) concentration. The termination phase is defined as the period of the reaction in which prothrombin consumption is over and active thrombin levels are falling as a result of inactivation by endogenous protease inhibitors. Data from empirical studies of the regulation of the TF-factor VIIa complex have indicated that TFPI is a rapid and efficient suppressor of the procoagulant consequences of TF expression (12van't Veer C.

Fig. 1 presents simulation data detailing the partitioning of an introduced bolus (5 pm) of TF between catalytically inert (panel A) and active complexes (panel B). Twenty seconds after the introduction of TF to the system, greater than 98% of TF remains inert, either complexed with uncleaved factor VII zymogen (A, •) or unassociated with a protein partner (A, ×). By 100 s into the reaction, ∼80% of TF was bound to factor VII, a condition that persists throughout the propagation phase, whereas ∼9% is free and ∼9% tied up in complexes with TFPI. As the reaction progresses, TF continues to be found primarily in inert complexes, although the predominant species becomes the TF-factor VIIa-factor Xa-TFPI complex (A, ♦). At 1200 s, ∼93% of the TF is bound to TFPI, ∼6% is bound to factor VII, and ∼0.1% (∼5 fm) is unassociated with other proteins. Fig. 1B presents the evolution of functional catalytic TF complexes. This process is characterized by two maxima of functional TF-VIIa complex with each maxima primarily reflecting a different source of factor VIIa. The first occurs 20 s into the reaction, with levels of active TF species (defined as the sum of free TF-factor VIIa complex and TF-factor VIIa complex bound to its substrates and products) of ∼80 fm. This maxima derives primarily from the association of endogenous (circulating) factor VIIa (100 pm) with the introduced TF stimulus (B, ○). This episode of TF-factor VIIa complex formation was short lived because of rapid factor Xa-dependent sequestration by TFPI (B, ♦). The second phase of TF-VIIa accumulation initiates at ∼260 s and reaches its maximum level, ∼120 fm, at 460 s, a time that corresponds to the active thrombin maxima and the end of the propagation phase (B, □). This factor VIIa derives primarily from activation of factor VII by the rapidly increasing levels of thrombin and factor Xa that characterize the propagation phase (34Hockin M.F. Jones K.C. Everse S.J. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18322-18333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In these simulations, the previously formed pool of TF-factor VII complex supplies the TF via an exchange reaction controlled by off-rate defining the TF factor VII binding equilibrium (t½ = 220 s) (A, •). At 1200 s, functional TF-VIIa constitutes ∼0.5% (∼20 fm) of the total TF pool. Numerical Simulations—Fig. 2A displays simulations in which thrombin generation induced with 5 pm TF was allowed to proceed for selected time periods before the TF stimulus was mathematically removed and the reaction allowed to proceed without further contributions from the factor VIIa-TF complex. In a control experiment (♦) with TF-related activity only regulated by the natural inhibitors of the factor VIIa-TF complex, i.e. TFPI and AT-III, thrombin generation enters the propagation phase after an initiation phase of 240 s. During the propagation phase, thrombin was generated at a maximum rate of 2.0 nm/s and the maximum active thrombin achieved was 275 nm. Electronic nullification of TF activity at 240 s (▪) has little effect on these parameters: the duration of the initiation phase remains 240 s and the maximum rate of thrombin generation and its maximum level were only slightly decreased (1.9 nm/s and 240 nm). Nullification of TF-related activity at 120 s from the start of the reaction (▵) slightly alters the initiation phase with a more pronounced effect on the maximum rate of thrombin generation (1.3 nm/s) and the maximum thrombin level. When TF nullification time occurs earlier (60 s; ▴), all three parameters of thrombin generation undergo more significant changes, especially the initiation phase, which was prolonged to 330 s. No thrombin generation was observed over 1,200 s, when TF-related activity was nullified at the initiation of the reaction (×) or at 10 s post-initiation (•). However, TF nullification at 20 s (not shown) results in significant thrombin generation, indicating that sufficient other procoagulant products have been mobilized to sustain the process between 10 and 20 s. In Fig. 2B, the influence of quenching on the production of factor Xa is shown. Factor Xa generated over the first 300 s of the control simulation was dissected into that produced by the factor VIIa-TF complex (♦) and that by the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex (⋄). Factor Xa production after the mathematical elimination of the TF containing species has only one significant route in these simulations, the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex. Thus, time courses of factor Xa production after TF quenching at 10 (•), 20 (○), 60 (▴), and 120 s (▵) are shown emanating from the control simulation of the factor IXa-factor VIIIa derived factor Xa. As can be seen, the post-quenching rate and extent of factor Xa production by the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex approaches that of the unquenched reaction (⋄) as the interval between initiation and quenching increases. A convenient marker for comparing the performance of the TF-depleted systems with the complete system is the time at which the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex becomes the predominant source of new factor Xa. In the control simulation this time is ∼210 s (see Fig. 2B, inset). The reaction quenched at 120"

Because mutations in F-ATPase subunit a also confer resistance to oligomycin, we investigated whether the a subunit of the V-ATPase might participate in binding bafilomycin. Twenty-eight subunit a mutations were constructed just N-terminal to the critical Arg735 residue in transmembrane 7 required for proton transport, a region similar to that shown to participate in oligomycin binding by the F-ATPase. The mutants appeared to assemble normally and all but two showed normal growth at pH 7.5, whereas all but three had at least 25% of wild-type levels of proton transport and ATPase activity. Of the functional mutants, three displayed Ki values for bafilomycin significantly different from wild-type (0.22 ± 0.03 nm). These included E721K (Ki 0.38 ± 0.03 nm), L724A (0.40 ± 0.02 nm), and N725F (0.54 ± 0.06 nm). Only the N725F mutation displayed a Ki for concanamycin (0.84 ± 0.04 nm) that was slightly higher than wild-type (0.60 ± 0.07 nm).

One striking conclusion that emerged from the mutagenesis studies was that mutations conferring resistance to bafilomycin were in very similar locations on the V-ATPase c subunit to those on the F-ATPase c subunit that conferred resistance to oligomycin (34Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This suggested that these two classes of drugs were binding to related sites on the two classes of ATPase. Because mutations on F-ATPase subunit a have been identified that confer resistance to oligomycin (37Manfredi G. Gupta N. Vazquez-Memijei M.E. Sadlock J.E. Spinazzola A. De Vivo D.C. Schon E.A. J.

Chem. 1986; 261: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this suggested the possibility that V-ATPase subunit a, although not homologous to the F-ATPase subunit a, might similarly be participating in drug binding. The results of the present study support this conclusion and provide further insight into how bafilomycin may inhibit the V-ATPase. Materials and Strains—Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. Concanamycin A and bafilomycin A1 were purchased from Fluka. Protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The mouse monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast V-ATPase A subunit and the mouse monoclonal antibody 10D7 against the 100-kDa subunit a were from Molecular Probes. Escherichia coli and yeast culture media were purchased from Difco. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were from GIBCO, Promega, and New England Biolabs. ATP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strain MM112 (MATa vph1::LEU2 stv1::LYS2 his3-Δ200 leu2 lys2 ura3-52) and strain MM112 transformed with VPH1 in pRS316 (MM322) (40Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to generate and study the Vph1p mutants. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium or synthetic dropout medium (41Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EcoRI-BamHI fragments or SalI-BamHI fragments of the VPH1 cDNA plasmid with Altered Sites II In Vitro Mutagenesis Systems (Promega). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fragments containing the indicated mutations were then substituted back into the vector pRS316 containing the wild-type VPH1. Cloned vectors were again confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transformation and Selection—Plasmids carrying mutations of VPH1 on pRS316 were transformed into yeast strain MM112 by the lithium acetate method (42Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), with wild-type pRS316-VPH1 as a positive control and the pRS316 vector alone as a negative control. The transformants were selected on uracil minus (Ura-) plates. Growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or 5.5. Whole Cell Lysates and Isolation of Vacuolar Membrane Vesicles— Whole cell lysates and vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as previously described (43Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For vacuolar membrane preparation, yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C to 5 × 107 cells/ml in 1 liter of selective medium. Cells were pelleted, washed twice with water, and resuspended in 50 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, cells were pelleted again, washed once with 25 ml of YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm MES-Tris (pH 7.5), resuspended in 25 ml of YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm MES-Tris (pH 7.5), and 2 mg of Zymolase 100T and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min with gentle shaking. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and the vacuoles were isolated by flotation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients and diluted in transport buffer (15 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.0, 4.8% glycerol). Subunit Expression and V-ATPase Assembly—Whole cell lysates and vacuolar membranes were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-15% gradient acrylamide gels. The presence of Vph1p on vacuolar membranes was detected by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody 10D7. Assembly of the V-ATPase was assessed by measurement of the amount of subunit A relative to the amount of subunit a present on the vacuolar membrane vesicle with mouse monoclonal antibodies 8B1-F3 against the Vma1p or 10D7 against the Vph1p, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) (43Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. ATPase Activity—ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (43Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 30 °C and vacuolar membrane vesicles were incubated with Me2SO or different concentrations of bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin A (in Me2SO) for 5 min prior to measurement of ATPase activity. Other Procedures—ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by fluorescence quenching with the fluorescence probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine in transport buffer (50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol (pH 7.0)) as described (44Forgac M. Cantley L. Wiedenmann B. Altstiel L. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (46Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Mutants of Vph1p—Fig. 1 shows the location of F-ATPase mutations conferring resistance to oligomycin (37Manfredi G. Gupta N. Vazquez-Memijei M.E. Sadlock J.E. Spinazzola A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen, the mutations fall just N-terminal to Arg210 in TM4 (E. coli numbering) and in the polar loop just preceding this transmembrane segment. Although not homologous to F-ATPase subunit a, subunit a of the V-ATPase serves a similar function in proton translocation (23Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 47Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 48Leng X.H. Manolson M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In particular, Arg735 in TM7 of V-ATPase subunit a plays a similarly critical role in proton transport to Arg210 of the F-ATPase subunit a (23Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 49Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were therefore introduced into the sequence just N-terminal to Arg735, including residues both within TM7 and in the polar loop connecting TM6 and TM7. Each residue from Glu721 to Thr730 was replaced with alanine and each residue from Thr719 to Thr730 (except Phe722) was also replaced with phenylalanine. In addition, several mutations were constructed on the basis of observed changes in F-ATPase subunit a conferring oligomycin resistance, including I720M, E721K, and S732R (37Manfredi G. Gupta N. Vazquez-Memijei M.E. Sadlock J.E. Spinazzola A. De Vivo D.C. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9386-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38John U.P. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Breen G.A. Miller D.L. Holmans P.L. Welch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, three further mutations in this region, L724T, L724C, and S728T, and the double mutation, E721K/L724A (see below), were also constructed. The mutant forms of Vph1p were expressed in yeast strain MM112 disrupted in both Vph1p and Stv1p using the expression plasmid pRS316. Growth Phenotype of Yeast Strains Expressing Mutant Forms of Vph1p—We first determined the effect of each Vph1p mutation on the growth phenotype of the strain expressing the mutant protein. Disruption of V-ATPase function leads to a conditional growth phenotype (vma-) in which cells are able to grow in media buffered to pH 5.5 but not in media buffered to pH 7.5 (50Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 51Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the mutants tested, only S728F severely compromised growth at pH 7.5. The E721F mutant grew weakly at pH 7.5, whereas the remaining mutants all showed near wild-type growth at neutral pH, suggesting the formation of V-ATPase complexes possessing significant levels of V-ATPase activity in vivo. Assembly of V-ATPase Complexes Containing Mutant Forms of Vph1p—To test whether the mutations introduced into Vph1p caused destabilization of subunit a, Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates using the monoclonal antibody 10D7 specific for Vph1p. All the mutants tested showed levels of Vph1p similar to that observed for the wild-type strain (data not shown). As an indication of the effects of the mutations in Vph1p on assembly of the V-ATPase, partially purified vacuolar membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against both Vph1p and Vma1p (subunit A). Disruption of assembly of the V1 and V0 domains results in the loss of subunit A (and other V1 subunits) relative to subunit a on vacuolar membranes (43Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2, vacuolar membranes from all of the mutant strains showed near wild-type levels of subunit A, suggesting that none of the mutations resulted in gross defects in assembly of the V-ATPase complex, although more subtle changes in assembly because of loss of particular subunits has previously been observed. Because both proton transport and ATPase activities of each mutant were assessed to determine the effect of the mutations on function (see below), a more detailed analysis of V-ATPase assembly by Western blot using other V-ATPase subunit antibodies was not performed. ATPase and Proton Transport Activity of Mutants of Vph1p—To determine the effect of the mutations in Vph1p on activity of the V-ATPase, both ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent proton transport (using the fluorescent dye 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine) were measured in isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown in Fig. 3 represents the ATPase and proton transport activities sensitive to a high concentration (1 μm) of concanamycin. The activities are expressed relative to those measured for vacuolar membranes isolated from a yeast strain expressing wild-type Vph1p. For ATPase activity this corresponds to 0.81 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein. As can be seen, all but three of the mutants have at least 25% of wild-type levels of both proton transport and ATPase activity. The three exceptions are S728F (3-5% of wild-type), E721F (7-10% wild-type), and the E721K/L724A double mutant (17-19% wild-type). These data are thus generally consistent with the previous observation that a wild-type growth phenotype requires V-ATPase activities on the order of 20-25% of wild-type (52Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 53MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutations generally result in parallel changes in both proton transport and ATPase activity, although a partial uncoupling is observed with the S732R mutant. Because mutations were constructed in a region of subunit a postulated to confer resistance to bafilomycin or concanamycin, it was possible that a decrease in concanamycin-sensitive activity might be coupled with an increase in concanamycin-resistant activity. To determine whether this was the case, the ATPase activity that is either sensitive or resistant to 300 nm bafilomycin is shown in Fig. 4 for each of the Vph1p mutants. As can be seen, there is no significant change in the bafilomycin-resistant ATPase activity for any of the mutant"
https://openalex.org/W2090828570,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that modulate cellular Ca2+ signals by interacting with Ca2+ transporters on the plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To study how mitochondria dynamics affects cell Ca2+ homeostasis, we overexpressed two mitochondrial fission proteins, hFis1 and Drp1, and measured Ca2+ changes within the cytosol and the ER in HeLa cells. Both proteins fragmented mitochondria, decreased their total volume by 25-40%, and reduced the fraction of subplasmalemmal mitochondria by 4-fold. The cytosolic Ca2+ signals elicited by histamine were unaltered in cells lacking subplasmalemmal mitochondria as long as Ca2+ was present in the medium, but the signals were significantly blunted when Ca2+ was removed. Upon Ca2+ withdrawal, the free ER Ca2+ concentration decreased rapidly, and hFis1 cells were unable to respond to repetitive histamine stimulations. The loss of stored Ca2+ was due to an increased activity of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) pumps and was associated with an increased influx of Ca2+ and Mn2+ across store-operated Ca2+ channels. The increased Ca2+ influx compensated for the loss of stored Ca2+, and brief Ca2+ additions between successive agonist stimulations fully corrected subsequent histamine responses. We propose that the lack of subplasmalemmal mitochondria disrupts the transfer of Ca2+ from plasma membrane channels to the ER and that the resulting increase in subplasmalemmal [Ca2+] up-regulates the activity of PMCA. The increased Ca2+ extrusion promotes ER depletion and the subsequent activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels. Cells thus adapt to the lack of subplasmalemmal mitochondria by relying on external rather than on internal Ca2+ for signaling.

[Ca2+]mit signals during cell stimulation activate mitochondrial dehydrogenases and boost ATP production, but excessive [Ca2+]mit increases can damage mitochondria and trigger apoptosis (1Demaurex N.

Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ca2+ handling by mitochondria has numerous effects on cell Ca2+ homeostasis. By taking up Ca2+, mitochondria generate microdomains of low Ca2+ that enable the full activation of Ca2+ channels that are normally inhibited at high Ca2+ concentrations (3Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 4Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol.

In addition, mitochondria have been shown to recycle the Ca2+ released from the ER back to this intracellular Ca2+ store, preventing the Ca2+ depletion of the ER (5Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh Jr., J.V. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and to relay the Ca2+ entering across plasma membrane Ca2+ channels directly to the ER, short circuiting the cytosol (6Malli R.

Mitochondria thus not only integrate intracellular Ca2+ signals to produce the appropriate metabolic response but also control the fluxes of Ca2+ inside cells to shape Ca2+ signals.Ca2+ enters mitochondria down its electrochemical gradient via a Ca2+ uniporter, using the negative mitochondrial membrane potential generated by the electron transport chain, and is released from mitochondria by a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger or by the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Because of the low Ca2+ affinity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, micromolar Ca2+ concentrations are required for efficient Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. Such high Ca2+ concentrations occur only transiently in cells at the mouth of Ca2+ channels, implying that mitochondria are in close proximity to plasma membrane Ca2+ entry channels or to intracellular Ca2+ release channels (7Rizzuto R.

Accordingly, morphological and functional evidence indicate that mitochondria are very close and are possibly physically connected to Ca2+ release channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (8Filippin L.

This constant remodeling regulates the morphology, number, and function of mitochondria and ensures the proper transmission of mitochondria to daughter cells during cell division. In most cells, mitochondria fusion and fission are usually balanced, leading to the formation of a tubular network of interconnected mitochondria. This cable-like architecture facilitates the transfer of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) from oxygen-rich to oxygen-poor cellular regions (13Skulachev V.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 23-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and allows the rapid transmission of Ca2+ signals along the interconnected mitochondria (14Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Disruption of the mitochondrial network by excessive mitochondrial fission or impaired fusion is a common feature of apoptosis, and the breakdown of the mitochondrial network is associated with a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, and the loss of the mitochondrial DNA (10Yaffe M.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar).Mitochondrial fusion and fission reactions are regulated by a highly evolutionary conserved set of dynamin-related proteins. Mitochondrial fission is operated by Drp1, a GTPase located in the cytosol that is recruited to mitochondria by hFis1, a small adapter protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (15Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 16James D.I. Parone P.A. Mattenberger Y. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36373-36379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial fusion is regulated by the transmembrane GTPases mitofusin and OPA-1, located on the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 17Bossy-Wetzel E. Barsoum M.J. Godzik A. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). By overexpressing or ablating the genes coding for these mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins, it is now possible to selectively manipulate the mitochondrial network toward fusion or fission. Using this strategy, we previously showed that the overexpression of hFis1 induced a complete fragmentation of the mitochondrial network in HeLa cells (18Frieden M. James D. Castelbou C. Danckaert A. Martinou J.C. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22704-22714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The fragmented mitochondria clustered around the nucleus but retained a normal membrane potential and pH and normally took up the Ca2+ released from the ER upon stimulation with agonists.In the present study, we investigated the impact of a hFis1 or Drp1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation on the cytosolic and ER Ca2+ homeostasis. Our data show that the lack of subplasmalemmal mitochondria in cells overexpressing hFis1 or Drp1 is associated with an increased activity of plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps, which, in turn, induces a faster Ca2+ depletion of the ER and a subsequent activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx. These defects are balanced as long as Ca2+ is present in the extracellular medium and become apparent only when Ca2+ is removed. The lack of mitochondria below the plasma membrane thus renders cells more dependent on extracellular Ca2+ for signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown on minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin along with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were plated on 25-mm diameter glass coverslips 2-3 days before use. After reaching 40-60% of confluence, cells were transiently transfected with the different plasmids using the TransFast reagent according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). For measurements of [Ca2+]cyt, hFis1 or Drp1 were co-transfected with a GFP targeted to the nucleus in order to identify cells expressing the mitochondrial fission proteins. All experiments were performed between 16 and 20 h after transfection with hFis1, and after 48 h with Drp1. To measure endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, [Ca2+]ER, cells were transfected with the cameleon YC4.1 targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (YC4.1ER; a gift from Dr. R. Y. Tsien, University of California at San Diego) and 24 h later with hFis1.Materials—Minimum essential medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Histamine and thapsigargin were obtained from Sigma. The acetoxymethyl ester form of Fura-2 (Fura-2/AM) and MitoTracker Red were obtained from Molecular Probes Europe. TransFast transfection reagent was purchased from Promega (Catalysis AG).Cysotolic Ca2+ Measurements—Experiments were performed in Hepes-buffered solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The Ca2+-free solution contained 1 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2 except in the Mn2+ quench experiments, where no EGTA was added. The low Na+ solution contained 121 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 19 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with HCl. Glass coverslips were mounted in a thermostatic chamber (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) equipped with gravity feed inlets and a vacuum outlet for solution changes. Cells were imaged on an Axiovert S100 TV using a 100×, 1.3 numerical aperture, oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss AG, Feldbach, Switzerland). Cells were loaded for 30 min with 2 μm Fura-2/AM at room temperature in the dark, washed twice, and equilibrated for 15-20 min to allow de-esterification. To monitor [Ca2+]cyt, cells were alternatively excited at 340 and 380 nm with a monochromator (DeltaRam, Photon Technology International Inc., Monmouth Junction, NJ) through a 430 DCLP dichroic mirror, and emission was monitored through a 510WB40 filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Transfected cells were recognized by the fluorescence of the nuclear-targeted GFP (480-nm excitation, 535-nm emission), and the characteristic morphology of mitochondria (globular versus tubular) was verified by imaging the MitoTracker labeling (577-nm excitation, 590-nm emission). For this purpose, cells were loaded prior the experiments with 500 nm MitoTracker Red for 90 s and washed 2-3 times with experimental buffer. To minimize cross-talk of the nuclear GFP fluorescence into the 380 nm Fura-2 signal, we only selected cells with a moderate nuclear fluorescence, and the region of the cytosol used to estimate [Ca2+]cyt did not include the nucleus. Fluorescence emission was imaged using a cooled, 16-bit, charge-coupled device, back-illuminated, frame transfer Micro-Max camera (Princeton Instruments, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Image acquisition and analysis were performed with the MetaFluor 6.2 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA).ER Ca2+ Measurements—HeLa cells transfected with the YC4.1ER were excited at 430 nm through a 455 DRLP dichroic mirror (Omega Optical), and emissions were collected alternatively at 475 and 535 nm (475DF15 and 535DF25, Omega Optical) through emission filters mounted on a filter wheel (Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorn, NY). To recognize the fragmented aspect of the mitochondria due to hFis1 overexpression, HeLa cells were loaded with 500 nm MitoTracker Red prior to the experiments. A low intensity threshold was applied to define the fluorescent signal associated with the ER. The total fluorescent area was taken for measurement.Measurements of Mitochondria Morphology.—Cells were imaged on an Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with an array laser confocal spinning disk (QLC100; VisiTech, Sunderland, UK) using a 63×, 1.4 numerical aperture, oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss AG). Cells were alternately excited at 488 and 568 nm to image the green emission (525/50 nm) from the nuclear targeted enhanced GFP (EGFP) or the membrane-targeted yellow cameleon YC3.6pm and the red (615/60 nm) emission from MitoTracker Red or RFPmit. These fluorescent images were acquired using a cooled, 12-bit, charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap HQ; Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) operated by the Metamorph 6.2 software (Universal Imaging). Optical slices of 300-nm step size z sections were acquired, and the green and red channels were further deconvoluted with the Huygens algorithm (Scientific Volume Imaging BV, Hilversum, The Netherlands). Three-dimensional rendering of the deconvoluted z stacks (shadow projections or cross-sections) was done with the Imaris 4.2 software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). For measurements of mitochondrial volume, complete series of the deconvoluted z stacks were processed with the “measure volume” routine from the Metamorph software after application of a low intensity threshold on the MitoTracker Red or RFPmit fluorescence. The percentage of membrane volume colocalized with mitochondria was calculated in the whole cell volume using the colocalization option from the Imaris software after restriction of each fluorescence signal by a low intensity threshold to define the respective structures.Measurements of Ca2+ Entry—Mn2+ (100 μm) was substituted for Ca2+ to estimate the ion flux through Ca2+ entry channels according to the Mn2+-quench technique (19Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were excited at 356-358 nm, which corresponded to the isosbestic point of Fura-2. The rate of fluorescence decrease reflects the rate at which Mn2+ enters the cells, and the slope during the first 1-2 min was used as an indicator for Ca2+ entry.Statistics—Unless indicated, statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test.RESULTSEffects on hFis1 and Drp1 on Mitochondria Distribution—To study the impact of hFis1 or Drp1 overexpression on mitochondria morphology, we analyzed the structure of mitochondria by confocal imaging. HeLa cells were co-transfected with a nuclear targeted GFP together with the fission protein, labeled with MitoTracker Red, and imaged on a spinning wheel confocal microscope. As shown in Fig. 1, overexpression of either hFis1 or Drp1 induced the fragmentation of mitochondria, but the organelles redistributed very differently inside the cells. hFis1-fragmented mitochondria clustered around the nucleus, whereas Drp1-fragmented mitochondria remained scattered throughout the cell. Interestingly, the expression of the fission proteins was associated with a reduction in the mitochondrial volume (Fig. 1, bottom right panel). The total volume labeled with MitoTracker in the confocal stacks was reduced by 39% upon the expression of hFis1 and by 25% upon the expression of Drp1. A 34% reduction in mitochondrial volume was also observed upon the expression of hFis1 using RFPmit as a mitochondrial marker. The reduction in mitochondrial volume was not associated with a change in cellular volume (data not shown). Thus, the two fission proteins not only caused the fragmentation of mitochondria but also reduced the total mitochondrial content. In addition, the two proteins redistributed mitochondria differently within cells, with hFis1 inducing a collapse of mitochondria around the nucleus, whereas Drp1-fragmented mitochondria remained distributed throughout the cell.We showed previously that hFis1 expression removed mitochondria from the cell periphery (18Frieden M. James D. Castelbou C. Danckaert A. Martinou J.C. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22704-22714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but this analysis has not been performed with Drp1. Because of the different fragmentation pattern obtained with Drp1, mitochondria could still be close to the plasma membrane in the z axis in our fairly thin HeLa cells. To establish the location of mitochondria relative to the plasma membrane, cells were transfected with a fluorescent protein bearing the membrane anchor sequence CAAX of ki-Ras (YC3.6pm) (20Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10554-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (green channel), the membrane-targeted probe was expressed at the cell periphery and in filopodial and lamellipodial structures. In control cells, mitochondria decorated the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, as seen in the xz and yz cross-section images. In contrast, in cells expressing hFis1 or Drp1, mitochondria were not distributed evenly below the plasma membrane. As a result, large contiguous regions of the plasma membrane were devoid of neighboring mitochondria. Using the complete series of the z stacks, we performed a quantitative analysis of the interactions between mitochondria and the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, bottom right panel). The fraction of the plasma membrane bearing mitochondria decreased from 10.1 ± 2.5 to 2.5 ± 0.3 and 2.9 ± 0.4% upon hFis1 and Drp1 expression, respectively (p < 0.01). Thus, both fission proteins reduced the fraction of the plasma membrane bearing mitochondria by 4-fold.FIGURE 2Effect of hFis1 and Drp1 overexpression on mitochondria location. HeLa cells were transfected with hFis1 or Drp1 cDNA together with a membrane-targeted yellow cameleon YC3.6pm, labeled with MitoTracker Red, and imaged as in Fig. 1. Images are xy, xz, and yz cross-sections of the two fluorescence channels, shown as green/red overlay. The cross-hairs indicate the location of the sectioning within the stack. Scale bar, 10 μm. Bottom right, the extent of co-localization between the MitoTracker and membrane labeling is expressed as a percentage of the total membrane volume.

The effects of hFis1, which induced the most dramatic mitochondrial redistribution, were analyzed in detail. The resting Ca2+ concentrations were not different between control and hFis1-overexpressing cells, but the responses elicited by histamine differed markedly depending on the presence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 3). When Ca2+ was present in the extracellular medium the application of a low dose of histamine (1 μm) elicited Ca2+ elevations of similar amplitude and duration in control and hFis1-overexpressing cells (Δratio was 0.77 ± 0.08 and 0.75 ± 0.10 for control and overexpressing cells, n = 18 and n = 14, respectively; Fig. 3A). In contrast, in the absence of external Ca2+ the histamine-induced Ca2+ elevation was reduced by 40% in hFis1-expressing cells (Δratio was 0.53 ± 0.04 versus 0.95 ± 0.04, n = 32 and n = 77, p < 0.0001; Fig. 3B). An even more severe reduction was observed when cells were kept for a longer duration in Ca2+-free medium before the application of histamine (15 min; Fig. 3C). The integrated Ca2+ responses measured in control and hFis1-expressing cells, expressed as the area under the curve, are illustrated in Fig. 3E for the different protocols. The Ca2+ responses were similar in the presence of Ca2+ but were reduced by 60% when Ca2+ was omitted for 2 min and by 80% when Ca2+ was omitted for 15 min. Interestingly, a normal response was observed in Ca2+-free medium when hFis1-expressing cells were stimulated with supramaximal doses of histamine (50 μm; data not shown). However, in all conditions tested (1 and 50 μm histamine in Ca2+ or Ca2+-free medium), the percentage of cells displaying an oscillatory response was lower in hFis1 overexpressers, suggesting that these cells had a defect in intracellular Ca2+ handling.FIGURE 3Effect of hFis1 overexpression on cytosolic Ca2 + responses. HeLa cells were loaded with 2μm Fura-2 and stimulated with histamine or thapsigargin. A, responses elicited by the application of 1 μm histamine to cells maintained in a medium containing 2 mm Ca2+. Traces are averages of 18 and 14 recordings for control and hFis1, respectively. B and C, responses elicited by the application of 1 μm histamine to cells maintained in Ca2+-free medium for 2 min (B, n = 77 and 32 for control and hFis1, respectively) or for 15 min (C, n = 21 and 15 for control and hFis1, respectively). D, cells maintained in Ca2+-free medium for 2 min were stimulated with 1 μm thapsigargin (TG). Traces are the average of 17 and 12 recordings for control and hFis1, respectively.

F, statistical evaluation of the Ca2+ increase induced by 1 μm thapsigargin done under normal (145 mm) and low (19 mm) extracellular Na+ conditions, expressed as the area under the curve (A.U.C.). Bars are mean ± S.E; *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that the reduced Ca2+ response was due to a decreased release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, cells were stimulated with 1 μm thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ to indirectly assess the ER Ca2+ content. As shown in Fig. 3D, the thapsigargin-induced response of hFis1-expressing cells was reduced by 58%, suggesting that the Ca2+ content of the ER was reduced by an equivalent amount. ER Ca2+ content was also assessed at low extracellular Na+ concentration (19 mm NaCl) to prevent the activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In this condition, the response to thapsigargin was reduced by 47% in hFis1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3F).Effects of hFis1 on ER Ca2+ Content—To study the effect of hFis1 on ER Ca2+ handling, we directly measured the free ER Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]ER, using the genetically encoded yellow cameleon probe YC4.1ER. Cells were sequentially exposed to a Ca2+-free medium and then to a maximal dose of 50 μm histamine followed by 1 μm thapsigargin to release Ca2+ from the ER (Fig. 4A). Neither the resting [Ca2+]ER levels nor the [Ca2+]ER levels attained after extensive store depletion with histamine and thapsigargin differed significantly between control and hFis1-overexpressing cells (resting: 0.984 ± 0.018 with n = 33 and 1.035 ± 0.034 with n = 18 for untransfected and hFis1, respectively; depleted: 0.904 ± 0.014 with n = 11 and 0.876 ± 0.026 with n = 10 for untransfected and hFis1, respectively). However, detailed analysis of the kinetics of Ca2+ release revealed that the [Ca2+]ER decreased more rapidly in hFis1-overexpressing cells upon switching to a Ca2+-free medium and during the application of histamine (Fig. 4A, first two arrows from the left). Consequently, the drop in [Ca2+]ER elicited by Ca2+ removal or by histamine application was significantly larger in hFis1-overexpressing cells (Ca2+ removal: 0.008 ± 0.002 with n = 33 and 0.026 ± 0.007 with n = 18 for untransfected and hFis1, respectively, with p < 0.05; histamine application: 0.038 ± 0.006 with n = 11 and 0.069 ± 0.010 with n = 10 for untransfected and hFis1, respectively, with p < 0.05; Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the [Ca2+]ER is decreasing more rapidly in hFis1-overexpressing cells upon the removal of extracellular Ca2+ and during cell stimulation with agonists.FIGURE 4Effect of hFis1 overexpression on ER Ca2+ homeostasis. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the ER-targeted cameleon probe YC4.1ER and 1 day later with hFis1. A, original recordings of ER Ca2+ following transition from Ca2+ to Ca2+-free medium and subsequent stimulation with 50 μm histamine and 1 μm thapsigargin. B, statistical evaluation of the ER Ca2+ decrease elicited by Ca2+ removal and by application of 50 μm histamine (n = 11 and 10 for control and hFis1, respectively). Bars are mean ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of hFis1 on Plasmalemmal Ca2+ Fluxes—Because both the cytosolic and the ER [Ca2+] were decreasing faster in hFis1 cells kept in Ca2+-free medium even without agonist stimulation, we assessed whether the fluxes of Ca2+ at the plasma membrane were altered. To test the basal activity of the Ca2+ extrusion and Ca2+ influx machinery, we used a simple Ca2+ switch protocol, alternating the bath solution from Ca2+-containing to Ca2+-free media. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, Ca2+ removal caused a more pronounced [Ca2+]cyt decrease in hFis1 overexpressers, whereas the readdition of Ca2+ produced a faster and larger [Ca2+]cyt increase in these cells. The increased Ca2+ entry was confirmed by using the Mn2+ quench technique. The addition of 100 μm Mn2+ to cells kept for 3 min in nominal Ca2+-free medium caused a significantly faster decrease in Fura-2 fluoresc"

Mutagenesis of P450 2A6 was done to expand its capability in the oxidization of bulky substituted indole compounds, which are not substrates for the wild-type enzyme or the double mutant L240C/N297Q, as determined in our previous work (Wu, Z.-L., Aryal, P., Lozach, O., Meijer, L., and Guengerich, F. P. (2005) Chem. Biodivers. 2, 51-65). Error-prone PCR and site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of two critical amino acid residue changes (N297Q and I300V) that achieve the purpose. The new mutant (N297Q/I300V) was able to oxidize both 4- and 5-benzyloxy(OBzl)indoles to form colored products. Both changes were required for oxidation of these bulky substrates. The colored product derived from 5-OBzl-indole was mainly 5,5′-di-OBzl-indirubin, whereas the dominant blue dye isolated upon incubations with 4-OBzl-indole was neither an indigo nor an indirubin. Two-dimensional NMR experiments led to assignment of the structure as 4-OBzl-2-(4′-OBzl-1′,7′-dihydro-7′-oxo-6′H-indol-6′-ylidene)indolin-3-one, in which a pyrrole ring and a benzene ring are connected with a double bond instead of the pyrrole-pyrrole connection of other indigoids. Monomeric oxidation products were also isolated and characterized; three phenols (4-OBzl-1H-indol-5-ol, 4-OBzl-1H-indol-6-ol, and 4-OBzl-1H-indol-7-ol) and one quinone (4-OBzl-1H-indole-6,7-dione, the postulated immediate precursor of the final blue dye) were identified. The results are interpreted in the context of a crystal structure of a P450 2A6-coumarin complex. The I300V change opens an additional pocket to accommodate the OBzl bulk. The N2297Q change is postulated to generate a hydrogen bond between Gln and the substrate oxygen.

These enzymes have been studied mostly as the principal catalysts involved in sterol synthesis, drug metabolism, and xenobiotic disposition. The use of P450 enzymes in the area of biocatalysis and fine chemical production is still largely unexploited (7Guengerich F.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Random mutagenesis is one of the main approaches in terms of developing P450 enzymes with new functions and can also be used to enhance the knowledge of structure-function relationships of these enzymes and thus provide more information for drug development.Random mutagenesis and molecular breeding approaches can be very useful when there is no crystal structure available to perform rational design, which is still the case for most P450 enzymes today. Furthermore, even rational designs based on crystal structures do have limitations because the enzymes possess both rigidity and flexibility. Predictions are even more complex in the case of oxidoreductase-catalyzed reactions when several factors are involved in the catalytic cycle. In addition to the active site (where substrate is bound) that is obvious in the crystal structure, other residues in the protein may also play important roles. With the availability of various high throughput screening methods and robotic systems, random mutagenesis has become a widely used tool in protein engineering both to improve catalytic efficiency and to investigate structure-function relationships (8Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 230Google Scholar). For P450 enzymes, random mutagenesis and molecular breeding are emerging areas. Bacterial P450 102A1 has been used as a starting point to develop catalysts that can hydroxylate alkanes in a regio- and enantioselective manner (9Peters M.W. Meinhold P. Glieder A. Arnold F.H. J.

The activity of the selected mutant was enhanced toward indole as well as some substituted indoles. This mutant has been used successfully to produce various substituted indigoids with enhanced activities as potent kinase inhibitors (18Guengerich F.P. Sorrells J.L. Schmitt S. Krauser J.A. Aryal P.

The active site is ∼6-fold smaller than that of P450 2C8 (Protein Data Bank code 1PQ2) (21Schoch G.A. Yano J.K. Wester M.R. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

In this work, error-prone PCR was used to construct randomized libraries, and a colorimetric colony-based method was used in the screening of mutants. Two critical amino acid residue changes that allow oxidization of both 4- and 5-benzyloxy(OBzl) indoles to form colored products were identified. The results are interpreted in the context of the x-ray crystal structure (20Yano J.K. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Indole, 4-chloroindole, and 4- and 5-OBzl-indoles were purchased from Aldrich or Lancaster Synthesis (Windham, NH). All other reagents and solvents were obtained from general commercial suppliers and used without further purification.Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra were recorded either with a Hewlett-Packard 1040A diode array detector (on-line with HPLC) or in Me2SO or H2O using a Cary 14/OLIS or Aminco DW2a/OLIS spectro-photometer for quantitative studies. Mass spectra were obtained in the Vanderbilt facility either on-line with HPLC or via direct infusion using a Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA) equipped with a standard API-1 atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source in the positive or negative ion mode. N2 was used as a sheath gas (50 p.s.i.). The vaporizer temperature was set to 500 °C, and the corona current was maintained at 5 μA. The capillary was set at 220 °C and 25 V (or -25 V in the negative mode). The tube lens voltage was set to 80 V (or to -96Vinthe negative mode). The collision-induced dissociation was set to -30Vin tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Data acquisition and spectral analysis were conducted with Finnigan ICIS software on a Digital Equipment Alpha workstation.All NMR experiments were carried out in the Vanderbilt facility at 298 K with Bruker Avance™ DRX 500- and 400-MHz instruments. Samples were dissolved in d6-Me2SO or CD3CN, and semiquantitative estimates of the amounts of indigoids were made by adding known amounts of CH3CO2H and referencing to this internal -CH3 signal (δ 1.91). Detailed structural information for four was obtained from four separate two-dimensional NMR experiments. Through-space 1H-1H proximity was observed using nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy (NOESY) with a mixing time of 500 ms. Single C-H bond connectivity was obtained using heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation methods. Long-range C-H bond connectivity (two to three bonds) was obtained using heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) with a 55-ms delay and 1H-13C CIGAR-HMBC with a delay for evolution of long-range couplings being modulated between 6 and 12 Hz and a low pass J-filter to suppress one-bond correlations. The NOESY and COSY spectra of compounds 6, 8, and 10 were recorded (mixing time of 600 ms for NOESY) to determine the hydroxylation positions. All NMR data were processed using XWIN-NMR™ software on an Octane workstation (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA).Expression Systems—The system involved expression of human P450 2A6 in Escherichia coli (25Soucek P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The P450 2A6 double mutant L240C/N297Q used to construct the library had been selected from libraries generated in selected regions of the P450 2A6 sequence on the basis of their ability to produce colored indigoids (14Nakamura K. Martin M.V. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All of the wild-type (WT) and mutant P450 2A6 enzymes and human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase were expressed using a bicistronic pCW′ vector (pCW2A6bc) (26Parikh A. Gillam E.M.J. Guengerich F.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and a tryptophanase-negative strain (trnA-)of E. coli as the host bacteria (19Wu Z.-L, Aryal, P. Lozach O. Meijer L. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Biodivers. 2005; 2: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The expression medium contained 48 g of Terrific Broth/liter (BD Biosciences), 2.0 g of Bacto-peptone/liter (BD Biosciences), 0.4% (v/v) glycerol, 1.0 mm 5-aminolevulinic acid, 100 μg of ampicillin/liter, 1.0 mm thiamin, 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, a 0.025% (v/v) mixture of trace elements (27Sandhu P. Baba T. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and 1% (v/v) starter cultures that had been grown with each newly transformed E. coli cell in LB medium (BD Biosciences) containing 100 μg of ampicillin/liter for 16 h at 32 °C with gyratory shaking at 200 rpm. The solid medium used in library screening contained 40 g of LB agar/liter (BD Biosciences), 1.0 mm 5-aminolevulinic acid, 100 μg of ampicillin/liter, 1.0 mm thiamin, 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, a 0.025% (v/v) mixture of trace elements (27Sandhu P. Baba T. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and 0.5 mm 5-OBzl-indole and was cast in large bioassay Q tray plates (25 × 25 cm; Genetix, Hampshire, UK).Construction of P450 2A6 Libraries—The open reading frame region of the P450 2A6 gene (1.5 kb) was mutated using a low fidelity PCR method and amplified in a 50-μl PCR mixture containing 250 ng of pCW2A6bc-L240C/N297Q or pCW2A6bc-WT plasmid, 120 ng of forward primer 5′-TAGGAGGTCATATGGCTGCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATTTCTAGACCGGAAGGCTT-3′, 2.5 units of Mutazyme ® DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 10× Mutazyme® reaction buffer (Stratagene). The 1.5-kb amplified PCR library fragment was purified by agarose gel electro-phoresis and cloned into the pCW2A6bc vector using the NdeI and XbaI restriction sites. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli DH10B ultracompetent cells (Invitrogen) by electroporation. The library plasmid DNA was purified using a QIAprep® miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc.).Phenotypic Selection Based on Color Formation—The bicistronic library DNA was transformed into the E. coli trnA- strain by heat shock at 41 °C, plated on large bioassay Q tray plates, and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 2 days. Individual colonies with blue color were picked and grown in 3 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as starter cultures for 15 h at 32 °C (see Fig. 1). Plasmid DNA was prepared from the cultures using a QIAprep ® miniprep kit. Verification of the new mutants was performed by inoculating the starter cultures into 1 ml of Terrific Broth expression medium (1%, v/v) fortified with 1 mm 5-OBzl-indole on 24-well plates. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 h with gyratory shaking at 250 rpm. Clones able to transform 5-OBzl-indole to form blue cultures were selected.Nucleotide Sequence Analysis—Sequencing of the plasmid DNA in the clones that produced blue cultures (following verification) was performed in the Vanderbilt facility using an Applied Biosystems Model 3700 fluorescence sequencing unit with a Taq dye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The mutated sequences were verified by comparing the sequences of the sense and antisense strands (entire open reading frame).Construction of Site-directed Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the QuikChange ® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the supplier's protocol. The primers were designed so that the mutation position was close to the middle with ∼10-15 bases of template complementary sequence on both sides and with a melting temperature of ≥75 °C (supplemental data, Table 1S). For practical purpose, a pBluescript SK(+) vector of the selected P450 2A6 mutant DNA (Bn1; ∼4.5 kb) was first constructed and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (see Fig. 1). The 1.5-kb mutated fragment was subcloned into the pCW2A6bc vector (∼8.5 kb) using the NdeI and XbaI restriction sites. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli, and positive clones were confirmed following purification of plasmids. The constructed site-directed mutant plasmids were verified by sequencing both strands of DNA (see above).Whole Cell Assay for Oxidation of Indoles—Cells were incubated at 28 °C for 14 h with gyratory shaking at 200 rpm. Cell pellets containing expressed mutant P450 2A6 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase were harvested from 500 ml of Terrific Broth expression medium of the E. coli trnA- strain by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min, washed with 200 ml of M9 minimal medium (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), resuspended in 100 ml of M9 minimal medium, and used directly (after measuring the P450 concentration). The reaction mixtures consisted of 200 pmol of P450 (whole cells), 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and varying concentrations of substrate in a total volume of 1 ml. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 24-well plates with gyratory shaking at 280 rpm and quenched by the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.5 m aqueous NaOH after 30 min (for indole and 4-chloroindole) or after 100 min (for 4- and 5-OBzl-indoles). The formation of colored products (indigo and indirubin) was measured by recording absorbance spectra in the visible region, and the estimated concentrations were calculated based on the extinction coefficient of the major product (subsequently determined). Estimates of kcat and Km were made using nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism software.Preparation of Membranes and Purification of Recombinant WT P450 2A6 and Mutants—Bacterial inner membranes containing mutant P450 2A6 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase were isolated from 500 ml of Terrific Broth expression medium of the E. coli trnA- strain. The pellets were resuspended in a final volume of 10 ml of 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.4) containing 250 mm sucrose and 0.25 mm EDTA and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenized membrane fractions were stored on ice until analysis.P450 enzymes were purified from cholate extracts of E. coli membranes as described previously for P450 1A2 mutants (12Yun C.-H. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11319-11329Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were solubilized at 4 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1.2 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.36% (w/v) Tergitol NP-10, and 0.36% (w/v) sodium cholate. The solubilized proteins (with a C-terminal His5 tag) were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen Inc.) eluted with 400 mm imidazole. The recovered proteins were dialyzed to remove imidazole and stored at -20 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) containing 1 mm EDTA and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The proteins were >95% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE; the apparent specific contents of WT P450 2A6 and the L240C/N297Q, Bn1, Bn1/1, and Bn1/4 mutants were 10.5, 10.3, 8.9, 11.2, and 9.6 nmol of P450/mg of protein, respectively, based on protein estimations done with a commercial BCA method (Pierce) used according to the manufacturer's instructions.Estimation of Substrate Binding Affinity—The binding affinity of P450 2A6 (WT and mutants) for indole or 5-OBzl-indole was estimated by titration (29Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates were dissolved in Me2SO and added to 1.0 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2-4 nmol of purified enzyme, and spectra were recorded following each addition (350-500 nm). The absorbance changes at 390 and 420 nm were used to estimate a spectral Kd (Ks) using GraphPad Prism software, with fitting to a one-site binding hyperbola equation using nonlinear regression.Coumarin 7-Hydroxylation Assay—The reaction mixtures contained 20 pmol of P450 (cell membranes), 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and varying concentrations of coumarin (from a 100-fold stock in H2O) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C and quenched with 0.1 ml of 2 m aqueous HCl after 5 min. The product was extracted as described (30Guengerich F.P. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia2001: 1625-1687Google Scholar) and assayed fluorometrically in a plate reader.Large Scale Biotransformation and Product Separation—The bio-transformations were performed in 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks with 500 ml of Terrific Broth expression medium. The cultures were incubated for 5 h at 30 °C with gyratory shaking at 250 rpm. At that time, the substrate (4- or 5-OBzl-indole) in Me2SO solution (1 m stocks) was added to the medium (0.5 ml), and shaking was continued for 22 h at 30 °C.The pelleted cells and supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 200 ml) and dried with Na2SO4. The pellet (from 500 ml of bacterial culture) was stirred with 500 ml of (CH3)2CO and filtered through Celite® (18Guengerich F.P. Sorrells J.L. Schmitt S. Krauser J.A. Aryal P. Meijer L. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 43: 3236-3241Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Wu Z.-L, Aryal, P. Lozach O. Meijer L. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Biodivers. 2005; 2: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ethyl acetate and (CH3)2CO extracts were combined and concentrated in vacuo, and the resulting solids were fractionated by semipreparative HPLC. HPLC was done on a Beckman Ultra[-sphere column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm) with a CH3CN/H2O mobile phase at a flow rate of 3 ml/min with 40% (v/v) CH3CN (in H2O) for 10 min, a 40-60% CH3CN linear gradient over 20 min, a 60-80% CH3CN linear gradient over 10 min, and a 80-100% CH3CN linear gradient over 5 min. To separate compounds 5 and 6, HPLC conditions of 30% (v/v) CH3CN (in H2O) for 10 min and a 30-35% CH3CN linear gradient over 20 min were used with the same column. Detection was at 254 or 600 nm (single wavelength) or with the on-line HPLC/diode array detector system. Peaks were collected manually, and CH3CN was removed with a rotary evaporator. The remaining aqueous phase was lyophilized to dryness. In analytical systems, a Beckman Ultrasphere HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) was used with a CH3CN/H2O or CH3OH/H2O mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.Substrate Docking and Modeling of the P450 2A6 N297Q/I300V Mutant—The coordinates of the P450 2A6 N297Q/I300V mutant were built by introducing substitutions into the WT P450 2A6 coordinates (20Yano J.K. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) in silico using interactive graphics techniques in the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar), followed by manual docking of each of the two substrates into the binding site cavity. A rotamer of Gln capable of donating a hydrogen bond to the substrate bound in the active site was selected. Subsequent energy minimization (conjugate gradient method) was performed using a CNS software routine with no experimental energy term (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). Energy minimization resulted in molecular models of P450 2A6 with bound substrates having a root mean square deviation of 0.55 Å for C-α atoms compared with the original structure. Subsequently, ligand coordinates were removed, and protein coordinates were used as a rigid receptor for docking of these same substrates using the FlexX Suite module of Tripos SYBYL software (33Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar), including the pharmacophore constraint of Gln297 in the enzyme active site as a hydrogen bond donor.RESULTSLibrary Screening—Two randomized libraries were constructed using error-prone PCR following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) to adjust the mutation rate to zero to three mutations/1000 bp using either WT P450 2A6 or the double mutant L240C/N297Q as a template (Fig. 1). The screening method was a convenient colorimetric colony-based method that allows rapid screening of thousands of colonies by simply plating them on LB expression plates fortified with the target substrate (5-OBzl-indole in this case) and picking up the blue colonies directly from the plate. LB expression medium was used instead of Terrific Broth to decrease the background color. A tryptophanase-negative strain (trnA-) of E. coli (19Wu Z.-L, Aryal, P. Lozach O. Meijer L. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Biodivers. 2005; 2: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used to avoid the contribution of indole to the products, i.e. to force the P450 2A6 mutants to use only OBzl-substituted indoles. Because of the temperature sensitivity of this strain (λ prophage can be switched on at 42 °C) (34Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), a slightly lower temperature than 42 °C was used for the heat shock to achieve a sufficient number of colonies to work with. A total number of ∼3 × 103 colonies were screened from each of the two libraries. No blue colonies were found upon screening the WT P450 2A6-derived library. The double mutant-derived library yielded three colonies, designated Bn1 (with a clear blue color), Bn2, and Bn3 (with a brown color), among which only Bn1 yielded a distinctive blue color when incubated in 1 ml of Terrific Broth expression medium fortified with 5-OBzl-indole (Fig. 1). This mutant was determined to be P450 2A6 I140M/L240C/N297Q/I300V/I366V by sequence analysis, with three more mutation positions added to the template DNA.Critical Residue Identification and Kinetic Parameters for WT P450 2A6 and Mutants—To determine which mutation positions were critical in gaining the ability to oxidize 5-OBzl-indole, 13 site-directed mutants were constructed from the Bn1 mutant, with one to four mutation sites recovered (Fig. 1 and"
https://openalex.org/W2166989247,"Rhythmic behaviors are a fundamental feature of all organisms. Pharyngeal pumping, the defecation cycle, and gonadal-sheath-cell contractions are three well-characterized rhythmic behaviors in the nematode C. elegans. The periodicities of the rhythms range from subsecond (pharynx) to seconds (gonadal sheath) to minutes (defecation). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these rhythmic behaviors are not well understood. Here, we show that the C. elegans Rho/Rac-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV-1, which is homologous to the mammalian Vav proto-oncogene, has a crucial role in all three behaviors. vav-1 mutants die as larvae because VAV-1 function is required in the pharynx for synchronous contraction of the musculature. In addition, ovulation and the defecation cycle are abnormal and arrhythmic. We show that Rho/Rac-family GTPases and the signaling molecule inositol triphosphate (IP3) act downstream of VAV-1 signaling and that the VAV-1 pathway modulates rhythmic behaviors by dynamically regulating the concentration of intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2084096026,"Depletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) represents one of the key molecular changes that underlie transdifferentiation (activation) of hepatic stellate cells in the genesis of liver fibrosis (Miyahara, T., Schrum, L., Rippe, R., Xiong, S., Yee, H.

A., Krishna, V., Chatterjee, K., and Tsukamoto, H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 11392-11401). In support of this notion, ectopic expression of PPARγ suppresses hepatic stellate cells activation markers, most notably expression of α1(I) procollagen. However, the mechanisms underlying this antifibrotic effect are largely unknown. The present study utilized deletion-reporter gene constructs of proximal 2.2-kb α1(I) procollagen promoter to demonstrate that a region proximal to -133 bp is where PPARγ exerts its inhibitory effect. Within this region, two DNase footprints with Sp1 and reverse CCAAT box sites exist. NF-I, but not CCAAT DNA-binding factor/NF-Y, binds to the proximal CCAAT box in hepatic stellate cells. A mutation of this site almost completely abrogates the promoter activity. NF-I mildly but independently stimulates the promoter activity and synergistically promotes Sp1-induced activity. PPARγ inhibits NF-I binding to the most proximal footprint (-97/-85 bp) and inhibits its transactivity. The former effect is mediated by the ability of PPARγ to inhibit p300-facilitated NF-I binding to DNA as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

Cirrhosis, the advanced stage of liver fibrosis, is the 12th leading cause of medial mortality in 2002 with 27,257 annual deaths according to a report by the Center for Disease Control. This mortality is even higher among those with productive ages between 45 and 54, ranking it as the fourth leading cause of death, highlighting medical and socioeconomic significance of the disease (1Kochanek K.D. Murphy S.L. Anderson R.N. Scott C. Natl. Vital Stat. Rep. 2004; 53: 1-115PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, there is no medical treatment for the disease other than liver transplantation. Therefore, the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver fibrogenesis is of primary importance for the development of new treatments. The effector cell type for liver fibrosis is the hepatic stellate cell (HSC). 2The abbreviations used are: HSChepatic stellate cellPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γPPREperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elementCBPCREB-binding proteinCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinFPfootprintGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationBSCbiliary fibrosis-derived stellate cell.2The abbreviations used are: HSChepatic stellate cellPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γPPREperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elementCBPCREB-binding proteinCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinFPfootprintGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationBSCbiliary fibrosis-derived stellate cell. HSCs are liver mesenchymal cells that are believed to function as pericytes for the liver microcirculatory system called sinusoids. They are located in the perisinusoidal space, an anatomical area nestled between the nonluminal surface of the sinusoidal endothelial cell and the microvilli surface of the hepatocyte (2Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). HSCs constitute 7-10% of the liver cell population and it stores 85% of the body's total vitamin A content (3Rojkind M. Giambrone M.A. Biempica L. Gastroenterology. 1979; 76: 710-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 4Friedman S.L. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 32: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). They also produce and maintain the normal matrix milieu (basement membrane components) of the perisinusoidal space. In addition, HSC provides direct and indirect homeostatic control over hepatocytes through communication via gap junctions (5Rojkind M. Novikoff P.M. Greenwel P. Rubin J. Rojas-Valencia L. de Carvalho A.C. Stockert R. Spray D. Hertzberg E.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J.

However, these cells are also responsible for a severalfold increase in the production of extracellular matrix components in the genesis of liver fibrosis (4Friedman S.L. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 32: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Upon fibrogenic stimulation, quiescent HSCs transdifferentiate to myofibroblastic cells to produce excessive extracellular matrix. This cellular transition process is characterized by the loss of vitamin A storage; cellular proliferation and migration; acquisition of a myofibroblastic phenotype, such as expression of α smooth muscle actin, induction of fibrogenic extracellular matrix genes (collagen type I and III), expression of autocrine cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor (9Kinnman N.

The present study investigated where in the proximal 2.2 kb α1(I) procollagen promoter PPARγ renders its inhibition and how it achieves this effect. Our results demonstrate that the 5′-flanking α1(I) procollagen promoter proximal to -133 bp is where PPARγ renders its inhibitory effect. This inhibition is mediated by the ability of PPARγ to suppress NF-I binding and transactivity via inhibition of p300-facilitated NF-I binding.MATERIALS AND METHODSHSC Isolation and Cell Culture—HSCs were isolated from normal male Wistar rats as previously described (21Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nonparenchymal cells were isolated via sequential digestion with Pronase and type IV collagenase, followed by differential low speed centrifugation. A pure fraction of HSC was isolated by arabinogalactan gradient ultracentrifugation and collecting the cells at the interface between the medium and a 1.035 density gradient. Cell purity was determined using phase-contrast microscopy and UV-excited fluorescence microscopy. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were cultured on a 100-mm dish in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were maintained in the culture medium for 7 days, at which time adenoviral vectors were added. Spontaneously immortalized, activated HSCs were established from a rat with cholestatic liver fibrosis and termed as biliary fibrosis-derived stellate cells (BSCs) (22Sung C.K. She H. Xiong S. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G722-G729Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These cells have the phenotype similar to activated HSC. BSCs were cultured in 10% low glucose medium and primarily used in transient transfection experiments.Adenoviral Vector Infection—Full-length PPARγ1 cDNA was cloned from pCMX-PPARγ1 into the transfer vector, subsequently allowing homologous recombination with the pAdEasy-1 adenoviral plasmid containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously described (18Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A control vector containing cytomegalovirus-driven GFP reporter gene was also constructed. On the seventh day of primary rat HSC culture, a vector was applied to HSCs at a multiplicity of infection of 100 to infect and transduce PPARγ or GFP. The following day, the medium was changed, and the cells were cultured for an additional four days to observe the effects on HSC as described (18Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from isolated HSC transduced with Ad.GFP and Ad.PPARγ using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Two nanograms of total RNA was used in a 20-μl reaction with reverse transcriptase for 30 min followed by 40 cycles of PCR to produce products using TaqMan Gold One Step PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the ABI 7700 SDS thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Synthesized cDNA was amplified using specific primers for α1(I) collagen (5′-TCGATTCACCTACAGCACGC, 5′-CATTAGCATCCGTGGGAACA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC). Probes were 5,6-carboxylfluorescein amidite labeled at the 5′-end and black hole quencher-1 labeled at the 3′-end (Biosearch Technologies Inc., Novoato, CA).Plasmids and Transient Transfection—pCMX and pCMX-PPARγ were gifts from Ron Evans (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). pSG5 and p300 were gifts from Michael Stallcup (University of Southern California). Mouse collagen promoter deletion constructs were as follows: pCol2-lucif, pCol3-lucif, pCol6-lucif, pCol7-lucif, and pUC-Cat (-220, -133, -120, and -92 bp/+115 bp) were used as previously described (19Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rippe R.A. Lorenzen S.I. Brenner D.A. Breindl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2224-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). pPac, pPac-NF-I and pPac-Sp1 were used to assess the effects of PPARγ on NF-I- or Sp1-driven promoter activity. Renilla pRL-TK was purchased from Promega. Luciferase promoter deletion constructs were created via restriction enzyme digestion (XbaI and XhoI) of the pUC-Cat constructs and insertion into the pGL3-luciferase (Promega) backbone. Briefly, BSC or NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 6- or 24-well plates and incubated overnight. A collagen promoter construct, an expression plasmid (pCMX or PPARγ), and F2 reagent (Targeting System, San Diego, CA) were mixed and added to serum-free, high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C and then placed onto the cells. Two hours later, the cells were supplemented with 10% high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The following day, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated for an additional 8 h. The cell lysates were collected using 5× passive lysis buffer (Promega) and dual luciferase assay (Promega) was performed using a luminometer (E&G Berthold). Mutations of three nucleotides (TGG to CAA) in the most proximal reverse CCAAT box was created by site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene). Primers were designed to introduce 3-nucleotide mutations into the wild type CCAAT of the FP-1 region of the luciferase promoter deletion construct (-133 bp/+115 bp). The DNA sequence of each construct was verified using an ABI Prism 377 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primers were used: FP-1-mutant NF-I (forward), 5′-gggccaggcagttctgatCAActgggggccgggctgctggctc-3′; FP-1-mutant NF-I (reverse), 5′-gagccagcagcccggcccccagTTGatcagaactgcctggccc-3′.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear proteins were extracted from HSC infected with Ad.GFP or Ad.PPARγ using Dignam A and C reagents (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3907) Google Scholar). Extracts (5-10 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 200 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) on ice for 10 min followed by an additional 20-min incubation on ice with 2 ng of α-32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides as described below: ARE-7, 5′-GCTTACTGGATCAGAGTTCACAGAT; FP-1, 5′-GATTGGCTGGGGGCCGGGCTGCT; FP-2, 5′-GGTTCCAAATTGGGGGCCGGGCCAG; Sp1, 5′-GATCAATGGGGCGGGGCAAT; NF-I, 5′-GGTTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGAG.The reaction mixture was resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to phosphorimaging for detection of shifted bands. For a supershift analysis, polyclonal antibodies against NF-I, Sp1, or Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added and incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. For competition analysis, a 200-fold molar excess of a cold probe was added to the reaction mixture just prior to the addition of α-32P-labeled probe.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). In brief, ChIP assay was performed on HSC cultured on plastic for 7 days or NIH3T3 cells without or with transfection with NF-I, PPARγ, and/or p300 expression plasmids or respective empty vectors. After a 48-h incubation, ∼4 ×106 cells/ChIP assay, were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were harvested by brief centrifugation and lysed in SDS-lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors). The lysates were sonicated on ice with two pulses at 15 s each to achieve chromatin fragments ranging between 200 and 1000 bp in size followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and diluted 10-fold in a ChIP dilution buffer (a 20-μl aliquot was removed to serve as an input sample) followed by preimmunoprecipitation clearing with 80 μl of a mixture of salmon sperm DNA/Protein A at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 1 μg of antibodies (anti-NF-I, anti-p300, and anti-CCAAT DNA-binding factor (CBF)/NF-Y antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. After immunoprecipitation, 60 μl of a mixture of salmon sperm DNA and Protein A was added and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min and followed by brief centrifugation. The precipitates were washed twice with low salt buffer, once with high salt buffer, and once with LiCl buffer. Then the precipitates were washed again with the TE buffer. The immune complexes were extracted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer. The extracted complexes and the input were heated at 65 °C for 4 h after the addition of 20 μl of 5 mol/liter NaCl to reverse cross-link. Following proteinase K treatment, DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform solution and precipitated with 20 μg of glycogen. The recovered DNA was resuspended and subjected to 35 cycles of PCR using the following primers: α1(I) procollagen promoter FP-1 region, 5′-TGGACTCCTTTCCCTTCCTTTCCCTCCT-3′ and 5′-TGGGCCCCTTTTATACCATC-3′; aP2 gene PPRE region, 5′-TGCACATTTCACCCAGAGAG-3′ and 5′-TGTTTGGGCTGTGACACTTC-3′. The PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel.RESULTSPPARγ Inhibits α1(I) Procollagen mRNA Expression and Promoter Activity—PPARγ is depleted in activated HSC, whereas activation markers including the α1(I) collagen gene are induced (15Miyahara T.

Ectopic expression of PPARγ in culture-activated HSC by an adenoviral vector reduces the level of α1(I) procollagen mRNA by half as compared with HSC transduced with a control GFP vector as determined by real time PCR (Fig. 1A). Transient transfection experiment using the HSC cell line (BSC cells) reveals that PPARγ expression also decreases by 50% the activity of a proximal 2.2-kb α1(I) procollagen promoter known to encompass the highest basal activity in fibroblasts (19Nehls M.C.

The relative activity of each of the deletion constructs was tested first by transfection experiments in BSCs (Fig. 2B). Our results reveal that two repressor elements: one between -2.2 and -1.8 kb and another between -1.1 and -220 bp. An enhancer element is also found between -1.8 and -1.1 kb. Of all four deletion constructs, the region proximal to -220 bp is shown to have the highest promoter activity in consistent with the previous findings (19Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rippe R.A. Lorenzen S.I. Brenner D.A. Breindl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2224-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of each deletion construct with a PPARγ or empty vector reveals that PPARγ inhibits all of the deletion constructs by ∼50% (Fig. 2C). Since the -220 bp region has the highest activity and PPARγ expression equally reduces the activity of each promoter construct, we concluded that PPARγ primarily exerts its inhibitory effect within the -220 bp proximal region and +115 bp of the first exon. Our review of the -220 bp proximal promoter sequence fails to reveal a PPRE. Thus, PPARγ must mediate the effect not via direct repression but via its interaction with other trans-acting factor(s) and/or cis-regulatory element(s).FIGURE 2PPARγ suppresses the collagen promoter within the -220 bp proximal promoter region.

This region is known to contain four protected footprints as determined by DNase footprinting analysis of activated HSC (24Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), and newly created deletions are designed to test these FP regions: -133/+115 (FP-3 and FP-4 deleted but intact FP-2 and -1); -120/+115 (distal region of FP-2 deleted but intact FP-1); and -92/+115 bp (only proximal region of FP-1). Transient transfection experiments reveal that the two distal footprints (FP-3 and FP-4) contribute minimally to basal collagen promoter activity (a statistically significant change in the promoter activity is not attained by this deletion: pCOL-133) (Fig. 3B). However, an additional deletion, including the distal half of FP-2 reduces the basal promoter activity to 50%, and a further deletion within FP-1 reduces the promoter activity by another 50%. Overexpression of PPARγ expression vector results in a 50% inhibition on the pCOL-133 promoter (Fig. 3C). This effect is attenuated when FP-2 is disrupted (pCOL-120). PPARγ also retains a modest inhibitory effect on the promoter activity rendered only by the most proximal portion of the FP-1 (pCOL-92). However, the absolute magnitude of the activity inhibited by PPARγ accounts only for 25% of the inhibition seen with pCOL-220 or pCOL-133. These results suggest that both FP-1 and FP-2 contain the sites via which PPARγ renders a major inhibitory effect on the promoter.FIGURE 3PPARγ inhibits the proximal 220 bp collagen promoter at the FP-1 and FP-2 sites.

The EIAV genome is the simplest among the lentivirus family and encodes three major structural proteins (Gag, Pol, and Env) along with three accessory gene products (Tat, Rev, S2). Like all retroviruses, EIAV Gag protein is synthesized as a polyprotein that upon virion maturation is processed by virus-encoded protease to yield four major structural proteins: matrix, capsid, nucleocapsid, and p9 protein. All four structural proteins of Gag polyprotein play critical and distinctive roles in retrovirus assembly and budding. Matrix proteins direct targeting of Gag polyproteins to cell membranes for viral assembly and budding (1Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The EIAV p9 protein contains a YPDL late (L) domain that is critical for virion release during the late stage of virus budding. Proline-rich L domains such as PTAP and PPPY with similar functions have also been identified from HIV-1, Rous sarcoma virus, and a variety of other enveloped viruses (7Demirov D.G. Freed E.O.

The HIV-1 PTAP motif specifically interacts with the N terminus of tumor suppression gene 101 products (Tsg101), an essential component of the ESCRT I complex responsible for multivesicular body (MVB) formation (8VerPlank L.

Interestingly, the EIAV YPDL motif has been shown to interact with two cellular proteins, ALG-2-interacting-protein-1 (AIP1/Alix) (AIP1 is used hereinafter) (12Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A.

Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6541-6546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these L domains appear to interact with different cellular proteins, certain functional interchangeability was previously reported. For example, both PTAP and PPPY motifs can substitute for the YPDL domain to support EIAV replication (15Li F. Chen C. Puffer B.A. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The PTAP function for HIV-1 budding and replication, however, can be replaced by the PPPY but not the YPDL motif (16Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Gagliardi T.D. Nagashima K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9038-9045Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that retroviruses, along with other enveloped viruses, may have evolved different L domains to exploit redundant cellular endocytic machineries to achieve virus budding and release. The L domain-interacting cellular proteins identified to date are endocytic components associated with the formation of either early endosomes (e.g. ubiquitin ligase, AP-2) or late MVBs (e.g. Tsg101, AIP1). Although it is currently assumed that MVBs play a central role in retrovirus budding, it remains uncertain whether and how components of other endosomal vesicles, including early endosomes, contribute to retroviral budding. It is reported that HLTV-1 Gag polyproteins interact first with Nedd4.1 at the plasma membrane and then with Tsg101 in late endosomes/MVB, suggesting a successive assembly and budding process through the endocytic pathway (17Segura-Morales C.

However, neither early nor late endosomes are optimally evolved for viral assembly and release. For example, the formation of early endosomes is topologically opposite that of viral budding, whereas budding into late endosome is topologically correct but imposes subsequent obstacles to virion release from infected cells. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether and how retroviruses combine and/or integrate early and late endosomal machinery to facilitate virion assembly and budding. In the light of previous observations that the EIAV YPDL L domain interacts with both AP-2 and AIP1 in different model systems, the current study was designed to examine the specificity of EIAV p9 binding to early and late endocytic factors and the effects of alterations in early and late endocytic protein expression on virion production. The results of these studies demonstrated a previously unrecognized involvement of both early and late endocytic machinery in EIAV virion assembly and budding, whether accessed by YPDL or PTAP L domains. Plasmids and DNA Mutagenesis—Construction of CMVuk proviral EIAV and the CMVuk PTAP derivative was described previously (15Li F. Chen C. Puffer B.A. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding LexA-*p9 was constructed by inserting the *p9 fragment of a GST-*p9 construct (14Puffer B.A. Parent L.J. Wills J.W. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6541-6546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the polylinker site of pLexA-(1-202)+PL (19Ruden D.M. Ma J. Li Y. Wood K. Ptashne M. Nature. 1991; 350: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Full-length AIP1, AIP1372-869, or AIP1409-715 were PCR-amplified and inserted into the Gal4 activation domain expression vector pACTII (Clontech). Plasmids encoding GST-*p2b, GST-*p6, and GST-*p9 or mutant derivatives were described previously (14Puffer B.A. Parent L.J. Wills J.W. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6541-6546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The gene segment encoding AIP1 residues 409-715 was PCR-amplified and inserted in-frame into pET32c(+) (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Plasmids expressing Tsg1011-204 were obtained from Dr. Eric Freed (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD) with the permission of Dr. Zijie Sun (Stanford University School of Medicine). Vectors expressing HA-tagged full-length and truncated AIP1/Alix proteins were generated by inserting PCR-amplified fragment into pCMV-HA (Clontech). pCDNA3.1 derivative expressing HA-tagged wild type μ2 was a gift from Dr. Alexander Sorkin (University of Colorado Health Science Center), and the mutant μ2DW was generated using standard molecular cloning protocols. pSilencer plasmid was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), and sequences of AIP1 (5′-gctcaagatggtgtgataa-3′) or (5′-gatcaagcgcatggcattcat-3′) were selected to generate pSilencer constructs that produce small hairpin RNA (shRNA), which was then spontaneously processed in vivo into siRNA. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium as described previously (20Chen C. Li F. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9762-9770Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. GenePorter II (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) was used to transfect cells according to the manufacturer's recommendation. SiRNA duplexes were synthesized in vitro and transfected into HeLa cells using GeneEraser™ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain used for two-hybrid studies was CTY10.5d (Mata ade2-101 his3-Δ200leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ901gal4 gal80 URA3::lexAop-lacZ). Yeast cells were grown in synthetic dextrose medium lacking appropriate supplements to maintain selection for plasmids. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed on permeabilized cells grown to mid-log phase in the selective synthetic dextrose medium and expressed in Miller units. Yeast protein extracts for immunoblot analysis were prepared as described previously (21Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6672-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics). GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins and N-terminally His-tagged AIP1409-715 were expressed from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI). Bacterial extracts were prepared in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) + 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), as described previously (22Vincent O. Rainbow L. Tilburn J. Arst Jr., H.N. Penalva M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Extracts containing GST-*p2b, GST-*p6, and GST-*p9 or mutant derivatives were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. After six washes with 1 ml of buffer STE/1% Triton X-100, beads with bound proteins were incubated with bacterial extract (500 μl) containing His-tagged AIP1409-715 at 4 °C for 1 h. After six washes with STE/1% Triton X-100, beads were boiled in sample buffer, and proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Bound His-tagged AIP1409-715 was detected by Western analysis with an anti-His tag antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence with reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Reverse Transcriptase (RT) and Western Blotting Assays—To measure virion production, culture medium collected from 24 to 48 h after transfection was clarified of cell debris by low speed centrifugation and then centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 3 h at 4°C to pellet virions. Virion pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and 10-μl samples were assayed in RT assays as described previously (20Chen C. Li F. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9762-9770Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine EIAV-specific protein content in transfected cells and pelleted virions, total cell lysates prepared as described previously (20Chen C. Li F. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9762-9770Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and pelleted virions were resolved by electrophoresis through 4-15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted using a reference immune serum from a field-infected horse (20Chen C. Li F. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9762-9770Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-horse IgG F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used as secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed by incubation with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated high affinity anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used to specifically detect HA-tagged proteins. Interaction between AIP1 and EIAV p9 Proteins—Interaction between AIP1 and EIAV p9 was previously demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays (12Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y.

Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). To serve as a starting point for a comprehensive comparison, we initially examined the p9-AIP1 interaction using similar approaches. We previously demonstrated interaction between the μ2 subunit of the AP-2 adaptor protein complex and EIAV p9 using GST pull-down assay (24Puffer B.A. Watkins S.C. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10218-10221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, a recombinant protein containing only the N-terminal 30 amino acids of EIAV p9 was fused to GST, in contrast to the full-length p9 protein (51 residues) used in studies of p9-AIP1 binding (12Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E. Davis T. He G.P. Cimbora D.M. Scott A. Krausslich H.G. Kaplan J. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I.

Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed p9-AIP1 binding assays using the N terminus of p9 (designated as *p9) in this study. Fig. 1 summarizes the yeast two-hybrid results using *p9 as bait to examine binding activities of full-length and two truncated AIP1 proteins. Full-length AIP1 bound to *p9 as expected (Fig. 1A), and interaction of two truncated fragments (AIP1372-869 and AIP1409-715) with *p9 was also detected. The stronger interaction of full-length AIP1 was not due to higher expression of the fusion protein as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). The observed binding properties are consistent with previous studies showing that both the N terminus (1-175) and the C-terminal proline-rich domain (717-869) of AIP1 are not required for this interaction (12Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M.

Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Additionally, the current studies further defined the p9 binding domain of AIP1 to residues 409-715. It is interesting to note that the EIAV p9 binding domain of AIP1 (residues 409-715) does not contain the PSAP motif (AIP1717-720) involved in interaction with Tsg101 (13von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E. Davis T. He G.P. Cimbora D.M. Scott A. Krausslich H.G. Kaplan J. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2003; 114: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). To compare the binding properties of AIP1 proteins and the μ2 subunit in parallel, we performed GST pull-down assays using GST-*p9 and the AIP1409-715 construct. Our data revealed that similar levels of GST fusion protein were produced from each construct (Fig. 2A) and that *p9 evidently bound to the AIP1409-715. Single alanine substitutions in the EIAV L domain at residues Tyr-23, Pro-24, or Leu-26 abolished detectable AIP1409-715 binding, suggesting their critical role for AIP1 interaction, whereas mutation of D25A reduced AIP1409-715 binding by about 70% when compared with *p9. The D25A substitution in p9 has previously been reported to have no effect on EIAV viral budding (24Puffer B.A. Watkins S.C. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10218-10221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data confirmed that the YPDL sequence is a critical determinant of AIP1-p9 interaction, consistent with other reports (12Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E. Davis T. He G.P.

Craig S. Popova E. Gottlinger H.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the YPDL sequence specificity for AIP1 binding reported here is similar to that for p9 binding to μ2 that we described previously (24Puffer B.A. Watkins S.C. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10218-10221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The *p6 protein (SRPEPTAPPEES) did not bind to AIP1409-715 as expected due to the absence of the p6 LYP motif responsible for AIP1 interaction in this construct. The observation that RSV *p2b failed to bind to AIP1409-715 further confirmed the specificity of AIP1 interaction. Taken together, these data demonstrated that interaction of EIAV p9 and AIP1 is dependent on the p9 YPDL sequence and on a small region (residues 409-715) of the AIP1 protein. Thus, it appeared that in vitro, both AIP1 and μ2 equally interact with EIAV p9 protein via the YPDL sequence, suggesting possible interactions with early and late endocytic proteins in infected cells. Effects of AIP1 Proteins on EIAV Budding—Previous studies of AIP1 interaction with the YPDL sequence of EIAV p9 protein were performed using Gag expression vectors and not with full-length EIAV proviral constructs. To examine the functional role of AIP1-p9 interactions in virion production in the context of complete proviral expression, we co-transfected COS-1 cells with an EIAV proviral construct and AIP1 expression vectors. As a specificity control, we also included an expression vector encoding the N-terminal moiety of Tsg1011-204 that contains the HIV-1 PTAP binding domain (25Demirov D.G. Ono A. Orenstein J.M. Freed E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 3, EIAV production was reduced by 50-70% from cells expressing AIP1 proteins when compared with cells transfected with vector DNA (Fig. 3A). Various AIP1 proteins differed slightly in their inhibitory effect on EIAV budding, with the full-length AIP1 apparently the most potent inhibitor despite the relatively low levels of full-length AIP1 detected in transfected cells. Another interesting observation is that co-expression of Tsg1011-204 reproducibly enhanced EIAV production by an average of 30-40% when compared with the vector control. Overexpression of AIP1 proteins and Tsg1011-204 seemed not to significantly affect the steady state levels of EIAV-specific protein as shown in Fig. 3B (upper panel). Thus, these data demonstrated that EIAV budding mediated by the YPDL domain is specifically inhibited by AIP1 protein overexpression. To further verify the specificity of the interactions observed above, we next examined the presence of HA-tagged AIP1 proteins in pelleted EIAV virions. Our data showed that all three AIP1 proteins as well as Tsg101 were detected in pelleted virions (Fig. 3B, lower panel). To exclude the possibility that overexpression of these endocytic proteins results in their appearance in the pelletable fraction of the culture medium, we transfected COS-1 cells with the various endocytic protein expression vectors in the absence of EIAV proviral DNA and centrifuged the culture medium under conditions used to pellet EIAV virions. No AIP1 or Tsg101 could be detected by immunoblotting in these control pelleted preparations in the absence of virion production (data not shown). Therefore, our results further confirmed specific incorporation of AIP1 into EIAV virions. The incorporation of Tsg101 into EIAV virions that we observed also suggested its involvement in EIAV budding, perhaps through indirect interactions mediated by AIP1-Tsg101 interaction (13von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E. Davis T. He G.P. Cimbora D.M. Scott A. Krausslich H.G. Kaplan J. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2003; 114: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Effects of AIP1 μ2 Expression on EIAV Budding—Results from the preceding experiments and previous reports have confirmed that both AIP1 and μ2 bind to the YPDL sequence of EIAV p9 protein in GST pull-down assays and that overexpression of AIP1 inhibits EIAV budding from transfected COS-1 cells. We next compared the roles of AIP1 and μ2 in EIAV budding using wild type EIAV (CMVukYPDL) and a mutant EIAV (CMVukPTAP) with its YPDL motif replaced by the HIV-1-derived PTAP motif. AIP1 and μ2 inhibited EIAV budding by 60 and 50%, respectively, as measured by pelleted virion-associated RT activity (Fig. 4A). The specificity of μ2 inhibition was further confirmed by the observation that overexpression of a mutant μ2(μ2DW) that is unable to bind to EIAV p9 protein had no significant effect on EIAV production (Fig. 4A). Thus, both AIP1 and μ2 contributed to EIAV budding. Overexpression of Tsg1011-204 enhanced CMVuk(YPDL) budding by about 30% (Fig. 4A) as observed in Fig. 3A, and budding of CMVuk(PTAP) was inhibited about 55% by overexpressed Tsg1011-204 as expected (Fig. 4B). These two proviral constructs only differ from each other in the specificity of the L domain sequences, and both are previously demonstrated to be replication-competent (15Li F. Chen C. Puffer B.A. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that Tsg101 is involved in both PTAP- and YPDL-mediated retrovirus budding but probably through different interaction mechanisms. Interestingly, expression of both wild type and mutant μ2 reduced CMVuk(PTAP) budding by about 80% (Fig. 4B), indicating that the AP-2 adaptor protein complex might also participate in PTAP-mediated budding, although direct interaction with the PTAP motif may not be required. The involvement of both early and late endocytic proteins in retrovirus budding is also supported by the observation that these proteins could be co-pelleted with the EIAV virion (Fig. 4, C and D). It appeared that there was more Tsg1011-204 and AIP1409-715 incorporated into pelleted EIAV virions when compared with the levels of μ2 subunit. There are several possible explanations for the observed differences. Although all proteins were detected via their HA epitope tags, the positions of these tags differ (N-terminal for Tsg101 and AIP1, internal for μ2), possibly affecting the level of antibody reactivity of each protein to the anti-HA conjugate used in our immunoblots. If equal reactivity is assumed, different incorporation of these proteins might be the result of varied levels of these proteins expressed in the transfected cells (cell lysate data not shown). In particular, AP-2 expression is under such a tight regulation that loss of one subunit leads to complete depletion of AP-2 (26Fraile-Ramos A. Kohout T.A. Waldhoer M. Marsh M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and robust expression of AP-2 complex is difficult to achieve by overexpressing only one subunit of the complex. Taken together, our results demonstrated that both AIP1 and the μ2 subunit of AP-2 contribute to YPDL-mediated EIAV budding and that AP-2 also participates in PTAP-mediated budding. Combined Effect of AIP1 μ2 Overexpression on EIAV Budding—As both AIP1409-715 and μ2 overexpression inhibited EIAV budding, we sought to determine whether they function independently or in cooperation. For this purpose, we individually titrated the minimum amounts of AIP1409-715 or μ2 expression vector for detectable inhibitory effect (data not shown). Based on these assays, we cotransfected 293T cells using 0.8μg of μ2 and 0.2 μg of AIP1409-715, individually or in combination, whereas keeping the total amount of DNA constant with blank vector plus EIAV proviral DNA. Virions released into the culture medium during the period from 24 to 48 h after transfection were pelleted, and RT activity associated with the resuspended pellet was measured to quantify EIAV budding (Fig. 5). Co-expression of μ2 and AIP1409-715 inhibited EIAV budding more than either protein expressed individually (80% versus 40 and 50% inhibition, respectively), indicating an additive effect of AIP1 and μ2 and further supporting the concept that both AIP1 andμ2 contribute to EIAV budding. To test whether the combined effect was cell type-dependent, we also carried out the same experiment in COS-1 cells and found similar results (Fig. 5B). Incorporation of AIP1409-715 and μ2 was also detected in pelleted EIAV virions (Fig. 5C). siRNA and shRNA Silencing of μ2 and AIP1 on EIAV Budding—It has been cautioned that overexpression of certain proteins might nonspecifically affect global cellular functions rather than specifically disturbing the precise cellular pathway under investigation. To complement our overexpression study on the roles of μ2 and AIP1 in EIAV budding, we examined the effects of μ2 and AIP1 down-regulation on EIAV budding. Fraile-Ramos et al. (26Fraile-Ramos A.

Traffic. 2003; 4: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) previously tested specific siRNA sequences against the μ2 subunit of AP-2 and demonstrated an average 50% reduction in μ2 expression in HeLa cells at 48 h after transfection. Based on the same siRNA sequence, we generated a pSilencer-derived DNA construct that produces small hairpin RNA (shRNAμ2) upon transfection, which is spontaneously processed into siRNA in the transfected cells. The silencing effect of this construct on COS-1 cells cotransfected with HA-tagged μ2 was examined (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the results of Fraile-Ramos et al. (26Fraile-Ramos A. Kohout T.A. Waldhoer M. Marsh M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), shRNAμ2 reduced μ2 expression by about 50% at 48 h after transfection. To knock down AIP1 expression, we cloned several sequences targeting various regions of AIP1 into the pSilencer vector and identified a specific sequence (5′-gctcaagatggtgtgataa-3′) to achieve efficient silencing (Fig. 6B). At 48 h after co-transfection, expression of full-length AIP1 was reduced by about 80% and expression of AIP1409-715 was reduced by about 70%, respectively. Our results revealed that 70-80% of AIP1 silencing could be achieved by shRNAAIP1, but only about 50% of μ2 silencing was observed using either siRNA or shRNA at 48 h after transfection. The long half-life of μ2 subunit (∼24 h) (27Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) might partially account for the relative inefficiency of knockdown procedures. Therefore, to more rigorously suppress AP-2 expression, assays at later time points (72-96 h after transfection) or two consecutive transfections were used to achieve higher levels of μ2 silencing (28Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). We therefore designed our experiments to first transfect 293T cells with siRNA duplex at day 0, and at day 2, cells were split, reseeded, and incubated for ∼12 h prior to transfection using the EIAV proviral DNA with or without pSilencer vectors encoding the specific shRNA. RT activity in culture medium collected from 24 to 48 h after the second transfection was quantitated as a measure of EIAV budding. In Fig. 6C, we first transfected 293T cells with increasing concentrations of μ2 siRNA and used only EIAV proviral DNA during the second transfection. Under these conditions, EIAV budding was inhibited by μ2 siRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C), i.e. no inhibition at 0 nm, 40% inhibition at 10 nm, and 60% inhibition at 25 nm μ2 siRNA. To assay the effect of the specific shRNA encoded by the pSilencers, we mock-transfected the 293T cells with the GeneEraser™. Following splitting and reseeding of the cells, we transfected them with EIAV proviral DNA along with the shRNA constructs. Our results in Fig. 6D showed that EIAV budding was reduced by about 15-20% by shRNAμ2 and shRNAAIP1, respectively, indicating that the shRNAs we generated affect EIAV budding as expected. In another experiment (Fig. 6E), 293T cells were first transfected with 10 nm μ2 siRNA and then transfected with EIAV proviral DNA and pSilencer constructs at 60 h after the first transfection. Expression of shRNAμ2 further reduced EIAV production by about 50% and shRNAAIP1 by about 60%, respectively. The inhibitory effect was cumulative for μ2 and AIP1 down-regulation, further confirming that both μ2 and AIP1 are involved in EIAV budding. It has become increasingly appreciated that retroviruses have evolved to adapt various host cellular machinery for their replication, and the number of identified cellular factors that interact with viral proteins is rapidly increasing (7Demirov D.G.

Virol. 1998; 72: 10218-10221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing strong evidence to link retrovirus budding with vesicular trafficking. However, the detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the adaptation of endocytic proteins by retroviruses to facilitate budding remain to be illustrated. In the current study, we compared the functions of the μ2 subunit of AP-2 and AIP1 in EIAV budding using complementary approaches. Our results revealed that disruption of μ2 or AIP1 expression, either up-regulation by transient transfection or down-regulation by siRNA silencing, reduced EIAV budding from cells cotransfected with an EIAV proviral construct. Furthermore, the effects of μ2 and AIP1 were cumulative, if not synergistic, as overexpression or knockdown of both resulted in more potent inhibition than that observed for either individual protein. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that HIV-1 PTAP L domain-mediated budding was also inhibited when μ2 subunit was overexpressed in the same cells. Therefore, the current report has provided evidence for a contribution of the AP-2 adaptor protein complex in both PTAP- and YPDL-mediated budding, in addition to the previously reported role of AIP1 in this process. The μ2 subunit of AP-2 is a critical component for the formation of early endosomes, and identification of its interaction with the EIAV L domain suggested the involvement of the early endocytic pathway in retrovirus budding (24Puffer B.A. Watkins S.C. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10218-10221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise role of early endocytic proteins in viral budding has been controversial as the topology of endocytosis is opposite to that of retrovirus budding. The past few years have seen a collection of evidence that AIP1, a cellular component involved in late endosome/MVB formation, interacts with the EIAV YPDL L domain and an LYP motif located downstream of the PTAP motif in HIV p6 (12Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M.

Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Along with the identification of Tsg101 (a component of the ESCRT I complex essential for MVB formation) as the binding partner of HIV PTAP motif, these results suggest that retroviruses can recruit late endocytic machinery for budding as both processes share the same topology. However, it remains unclear whether and how retroviruses bud into late endosomes before they exit host cells. The current results that both μ2 and AIP1 contribute to YPDL- and PTAP-mediated budding strongly indicated that retrovirus might actually combine both early and late endosomal machinery to facilitate budding. Consistent with this model, MLV Gag polyproteins have been shown to traffic between the plasma membrane and the late endosomes, although the functional significance of this trafficking remains to be defined (17Segura-Morales C. Pescia C. Chatellard-Causse C. Sadoul R. Bertrand E. Basyuk E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27004-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we have reported that PTAP-mediated budding is also sensitive to μ2 overexpression and that both wild type and mutant μ2 had similar effects on budding. These data indicated that the AP-2 adaptor protein complex might contribute to retrovirus budding via a general mechanism that remains to be defined. It is also worth noting that when the μ2 subunit was depleted using high concentrations of siRNA oligonucleotides (25 nm), no further reduction in EIAV budding was observed upon introduction of a second shRNA (shRNAμ2 or shRNAAIP1) by transfection (data not shown). These observations indicated that adaptation of μ2 and AIP1 might be sequential such that complete blockade of one interaction abolishes the entire chain. Further characterizations of the apparently complex interactions between the Gag proteins of different retroviruses and endocytic proteins involved in assembly and budding can provide further insights into the exact role of the endocytic machinery in Gag trafficking, assembly, and budding. In addition, the characterization of these critical Gag-endocytic protein interactions can provide new targets for the development of antiviral drugs."

The key step in the transformation of all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal is the isomerization reaction. Recently a candidate protein approach and expression cloning demonstrated that RPE65 exhibits Fe2+-dependent isomerization activity (9Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Proc.

We have suggested that the regeneration of the chromophore might occur through a retinyl carbocation intermediate (12McBee J.K. Kuksa V. Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that isomerization is inhibited by positively charged retinoids (13Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This mechanism would be consistent with Fe2+-catalyzed alkyl cleavage of the retinyl esters. Retinylamine (Ret-NH2) potently and selectively inhibits the isomerization step of the retinoid cycle in vitro and in vivo, whereas modifications of the amino group lead to loss of inhibitory potency. Surprisingly Ret-NH2 has a long lasting effect, and when mice were treated with a single dose of the inhibitor, its inhibitory effect on the cycle was observed for several days (13Golczak M. Kuksa V.

Inhibition of the retinoid cycle may have implications in averting light damage to photoreceptors in some instances or preventing the accumulation of toxic condensation side products of bleached chromophore, all-trans-retinal, in the RPE.

This fluorophore is accumulated during the course of the disease and, to a lesser extent, with age in normal individuals. It exerts a toxic effect on retinal cells, causing retinal degeneration and consequent loss of vision (17Finnemann S.C. Leung L.W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast with other less potent inhibitors such as 13-cis-retinoic acid or its metabolically active intermediates (19Radu R.A. Mata N.L. Nusinowitz S. Liu X. Sieving P.A. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4742-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), Ret-NH2 does not activate the transcription of genes (13Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), making it a safer candidate for therapeutic application. However, a total inhibition of 11-cis-retinoid production would resemble Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), an autosomal recessive rod-cone dystrophy that presents itself at birth or the first few months of life. Rod and cone photoreceptor functions of the LCA patients are either absent or severely compromised at birth as evidenced by extinguished or barely detectable photopic and scotopic electroretinograms (20Perrault I.

Thus, a reduced but not blocked regeneration of rhodopsin could be beneficial for some forms of retinal dystrophies, particularly for a low dose and long lasting inhibitor. Here we provide evidence that Ret-NH2 is converted to pharmacologically inactive retinylamides in vitro and in vivo in the liver and RPE. We demonstrate that the enzyme responsible for the amidation is LRAT and that the amidation products are stored in retinosomes in the RPE. An equilibrium maintained between retinylamide and free Ret-NH2 results in the long lasting and highly potent inhibitory effect of Ret-NH2.

N-Retinylacetamide and N-retinylpalmitamide were prepared by reacting Ret-NH2 with an excess of acetic anhydride and palmitoyl chloride, respectively, in anhydrous dichloromethane in the presence of N,N-dimethylaminopyridine at 0 °C for 1 h. After the reaction was completed (as judged by HPLC), water was added, and the product was extracted with hexane. The hexane layer was washed with saturated NaCl solution, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated in a SpeedVac. Radioactive Ret-NH2 and N-retinylamides were synthesized starting from 11,12-[3H]all-trans-retinol, which was first oxidized with MnO2 (CH2Cl2, 20 °C, 4 h) to 11,12-[3H]all-trans-retinal. Ret-NH2 and retinylamides were then prepared using methods described previously (13Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). N-Retinylheptanamide was prepared by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-promoted coupling reaction. First dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was reacted with heptanoic acid in dichloromethane. Ret-NH2 in dichloromethane was added. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h, extracted, and washed as described above. Mass spectrometry (MS) of synthesized retinoids was performed using a Kratos Analytical Instruments HV-3 direct probe mass spectrometer and electron-impact ionization. Inducible Expression of LRAT Protein in HEK Cells—Mouse LRAT cDNA was cloned as described elsewhere (7Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W.

For expression, the LRAT coding region was amplified using the primers 5′-GCCACCATGAAGAACCCAATGCTGGAAGCT-3′ and 5′-ACATACACGTTGACCTGTGGACTG-3′. The PCR product was ligated into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA4/TO. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative HEK293S cells (31Reeves P.J.

Khorana (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA), were transfected with the TetR expression plasmid pcDNA6-TR(blaR), and blasticidin-resistant colonies were selected and cloned. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and Zeocin and blasticidin antibiotics, and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. TetR-expressing HEK cells were transfected with the pcDNA4/TO-LRAT construct and selected with Zeocin. Stable clones were verified for expression of LRAT protein using the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody (7Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W.

LRAT Activity Assay—The reaction was carried out in 10 mm bis-Tris propane buffer, pH 7.5, 1% bovine serum albumin. All-trans-retinol or Ret-NH2 was delivered in 0.8 μlof N,N-dimethylformamide to the final concentration of 20 μm. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl of bovine RPE microsomes or 50 μl of LRAT-expressing HEK cell lysate (∼150 mg of protein). The total volume of the reaction mixture was fixed at 200 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the required times and then stopped by adding 300 μl of methanol followed by the same volume of hexane. Retinoids were extracted and analyzed on a Hewlett Packard 1100 series HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector. A normal phase column (Beckman Ultrasphere-Si, 5 μm, 4.5 × 250 mm) and a step gradient of ethyl acetate in hexane at a flow rate of 2 ml/min were used to elute N-retinylamides (10% ethyl acetate for 23 min and then 40% ethyl acetate up to 40 min). To detect Ret-NH2, retinoid separation was performed in 99.5% ethyl acetate with the addition of 0.5% of 7 n ammonia in methanol. Mouse Retinoid Extraction and Analysis—Two mouse eyes or 0.5 g of mouse liver were homogenized in a glass-to-glass homogenizer using 3 ml of 50% methanol in 20 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Retinoids were extracted with 4 ml of hexane. The organic phase was collected, dried down in a SpeedVac, and redissolved in 400 μl of hexane. In the case of the liver extract, 10 and 100 μl of retinoid solution were injected on an HPLC column for the detection of N-retinylamides and Ret-NH2, respectively. For samples from mouse eyes, 100 μl were analyzed for N-retinylamides and Ret-NH2. Separation conditions used for retinoid analysis were the same as described above. To determine the radioactivity distribution among retinoids found in the liver of animals gavaged with 11,12-[3H]all-trans-Ret-NH2 or 11,12-[3H]N-all-trans-retinylamide, products corresponding to the retinyl esters, retinol, retinylamides, and Ret-NH2 were collected during an HPLC run. Fractions containing retinoids were dried down in a SpeedVac and redissolved in 300 μl of N,N-dimethylformamide. The radioactivity of each fraction was examined by scintillation counting and normalized to total radioactivity of the sample injected on the column. Two-photon Vitamin A Imaging—Two-photon excitation microscopy was performed using a confocal/two-photon laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 MP-NLO; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with LSM510 software version 3.0. Detailed methods were described in previous publications (2Imanishi Y. Batten M.L. Piston D.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Imanishi Y. Gerke V. Palczewski K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For localization of Ret-NH2 in the RPE cells, eyecup preparations were exposed to 0.25 mm Ret-NH2 caged with 100 mm (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin for 15 min and washed briefly with Ames' medium (Sigma) for 3 min. Ames' medium was equilibrated with argon to purge O2 from the solution. Ret-NH2 Is Converted into N-Retinylamides upon Incubation with RPE Microsomes—HPLC analysis of the retinoids extracted from the standard isomerization assay (12McBee J.K. Kuksa V. Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed no significant changes (within 5%) in the amount of Ret-NH2. When Ret-NH2 was incubated with RPE microsomes in the absence of all-trans-retinol, the level of Ret-NH2 dropped significantly with time concomitantly with the appearance of a new peak that eluted with the front of the HPLC column (Fig. 1A, top panel). Putative products of Ret-NH2 conversion were separated in 10% ethyl acetate/hexane, revealing the presence of three different compounds (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Based on the elution time from a normal phase HPLC column and the shape and maximum of UV absorbance spectra, these products were retinoids less polar than Ret-NH2 (Fig. 1A). As measured by the disappearance of Ret-NH2, the observed reaction progress was much slower than the esterification of all-trans-retinol driven by LRAT (Fig. 1B). The unknown compounds 1, 2, and 3 were separated and purified by collecting the appropriate fractions from a normal phase HPLC column (Fig. 1A). The purity of biosynthetic products was examined by HPLC (Fig. 2A, a) prior to MS analysis. The biosynthetic compounds have an m/z of 551, 523, and 495 with respect to their order of elution from an HPLC column (Fig. 2B, a, b, and c). These observed masses correlate with the masses of N-retinylamides possessing C18, C16, and C14 acyl groups within their structure. To collect more evidence, the MS pattern of synthetic N-retinylpalmitamide was compared with the most abundant biosynthetic product (Fig. 2A, a, peak 2). The molecular ion peak and MS fragmentation patterns of both compounds are identical. Additionally comparison of elution time from the HPLC column and UV absorbance spectra revealed no differences between synthetic and biosynthetic products (Fig. 2A, b and c). Thus, we conclude that RPE microsomes converted Ret-NH2 into three main amides: RPN, N-retinylstearamide, and N-retinylmyristamide produced in a ratio of 15:6:2, respectively. N-Retinylamides Can Be Detected in Tissues of Mice Gavaged with Ret-NH2—The potential application of Ret-NH2 as an inhibitor of the retinoid cycle in vivo led us to investigate whether N-retinylamides can be detected in mouse tissue. Mice were gavaged with 1 mg of Ret-NH2 18 h prior to retinoid analysis. The presence of N-retinylamides in the liver and eye extracts could be easily detected by normal phase HPLC chromatography (Fig. 3). N-Retinylamides were recognized based on comparison of their UV absorbance spectrum and elution time. Interestingly, the amount of Ret-NH2 found in the examined tissues was smaller than the amount of N-retinylamides, 4 and 15 nmol, respectively, in the livers and 102 and 140 pmol found in the eyes (Fig. 3, insets). These results suggest that Ret-NH2 is efficiently converted into N-retinylamides in vivo. Ret-NH2 Is Amidated Due to LRAT Activity—To identify the enzyme that is responsible for amidation, we tested whether LRAT can utilize Ret-NH2 as a substrate. First we carried out qualitative analysis of retinyl esters and N-retinylamides formed in an excess of 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC). DHPC, present in millimolar concentration in the reaction mixture containing RPE microsomes and all-trans-retinol, serves as a donor of the C7 acyl group that is efficiently transferred onto all-trans-retinol. Consequently retinyl heptanoate was produced and was identified based on its mass spectrum and elution profile from normal phase HPLC in comparison with a synthetic standard (Fig. 4A). The same experiment performed in the presence of Ret-NH2 led to the formation of an amide containing a short acyl chain whose mass and elution time from the normal phase HPLC column perfectly matched the properties of N-retinylheptanamide (Fig. 4B). Considering transfer of the heptanoyl group from DHPC onto both all-trans-retinol and Ret-NH2, we conclude that LRAT could be responsible for both enzymatic activities. In addition, the production of N-retinylamides in LRAT-expressing HEK cells was investigated. Prior to the experiments, LRAT-expressing HEK cells were examined for expression and activity of the enzyme by immunoblotting and standard assays (Fig. 5B, a and b). Cells were harvested and homogenized, and the lysate was incubated in the presence of Ret-NH2. The products of the reaction were analyzed by normal phase HPLC. This analysis revealed striking differences between the retinoid composition extracted from untransfected and LRAT-expressing cells. In the presence of LRAT, products corresponding to N-retinylamides were observed (Fig. 5A, top panel) that correlate with the decrease of Ret-NH2 to below detection limits (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). In the control cells, the unreacted substrate was observed, and no amides were formed (Fig. 5A). Quantification of the retinoids found in the examined samples is shown in Fig. 5B, c. Additionally incubation of the cell lysate with Ret-NH2 led to an elevation of all-trans-retinol that was observed directly by HPLC in untransfected cells. In the case of LRAT-expressing cells, the amount of retinyl esters increased. Thus, as an alternative to amidation, Ret-NH2 can be also deaminated to all-trans-retinol. To further investigate the role of LRAT in Ret-NH2 acylation in vivo, we designed assays using Lrat-/- mice. Following gavage of Lrat-/- mice with synthetic Ret-NH2, we observed a complete lack of N-retinylamide formation in the examined livers (Fig. 6, top) concomitant with the detection of intact Ret-NH2 (Fig. 6, bottom). Together these observations demonstrate that LRAT utilizes Ret-NH2 as an acceptor of acyl groups. Additionally analysis of the chromatograms obtained from in vivo studies indicated that Ret-NH2 was transformed into vitamin A. This transformation was confirmed by the increased level of all-trans-retinol found in Lrat-/- mice gavaged with Ret-NH2 as well as the elevation of retinyl esters despite the absence of LRAT (Fig. 6, top). Without LRAT, retinol esterification most likely occurs due to the action of acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes (32O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J.M. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J.

N-Retinylamides Can Be Hydrolyzed Back to Ret-NH2 in Vivo—In contrast to Ret-NH2, N-retinylamides do not inhibit the formation of 11-cis-retinol in vitro (13Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We showed that Ret-NH2 has a long lasting affect on visual recovery (more than 48 h), which is surprising considering the efficient conversion of Ret-NH2 into N-retinylamides observed in vivo. It may be that once synthesized, N-retinylamides do not remain intact but are slowly hydrolyzed back to Ret-NH2. To address this hypothesis, WT mice were gavaged with 1 mg of RAN 18 h prior to HPLC analysis of retinoids extracted from liver. Based on the retention time from a normal phase HPLC column, RAN and C18, C16, and C14 N-retinylamides were identified (Fig. 7A). The presence"

We have determined the crystal structure of the enzyme from Oxalobacter formigenes from a hemihedrally twinned crystal to 1.73 Å resolution and characterized the steady-state kinetic behavior of the decarboxylase. The monomer of the tetrameric enzyme consists of three α/β-type domains, commonly seen in this class of enzymes, and the thiamin diphosphate-binding site is located at the expected subunit-subunit interface between two of the domains with the cofactor bound in the conserved V-conformation. Although oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase is structurally homologous to acetohydroxyacid synthase, a molecule of ADP is bound in a region that is cognate to the FAD-binding site observed in acetohydroxyacid synthase and presumably fulfils a similar role in stabilizing the protein structure. This difference between the two enzymes may have physiological importance since oxalyl-CoA decarboxylation is an essential step in ATP generation in O. formigenes, and the decarboxylase activity is stimulated by exogenous ADP. Despite the significant degree of structural conservation between the two homologous enzymes and the similarity in catalytic mechanism to other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes, the active site residues of oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase are unique.

A suggestion for the reaction mechanism of the enzyme is presented. Oxalic acid is one of nature's most highly oxidized organic compounds, and its dianion is a strong chelator of metal cations, especially Ca2+, causing oxalate to be highly toxic to many organisms (1Williams H.E. Smith L.H. Am. J. Med. 1968; 45 (Jr.): 715-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In humans, elevated levels of oxalate are associated with several diseases, including the formation of calcium oxalate stones in the kidney (urolithiasis), renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac conductance disorders (1Williams H.E. Smith L.H. Am. J. Med. 1968; 45 (Jr.): 715-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2James L.F. Clin.

Relatively large amounts of oxalate are introduced into the body through the diet, although this diacid may also arise as a byproduct of normal cellular metabolism (4Hodgkinson A. Oxalic Acid in Biology and Medicine. 1977; (Academic Press, Inc., London, UK)Google Scholar). Because humans, in common with other mammals, are not able to degrade oxalate, this compound must be eliminated by excretion in the urine or via the intestine (5Hatch M. Freel R.W. Vaziri N.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The recent observation that a symbiotic, gut-dwelling bacterium, Oxalobacter formigenes, may regulate oxalate homeostasis in humans, therefore, has important implications for efforts to develop new strategies for treating oxalate-related diseases (6Allison M.J. Cook H.M. Milne D.B. Gallagher S. Clayman R.V. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). O. formigenes is an obligate anaerobe bacterium found in the gastrointestinal tracts of vertebrates, including humans, and is unusual in that it employs oxalate as the sole energy source for its survival (7Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Stewart C.S. Duncan S.H. Cave D.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 230: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As a result, this bacterium not only degrades free oxalate entering the intestine lumen but also creates a transepithelial gradient favoring oxalate secretion and preventing absorption of oxalic acid in the lower tract of the intestine (9Hatch M. Freel R.W. Urol. Res. 2005; 33: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A direct correlation between the number of recurrent kidney stone episodes and a lack of O. formigenes in the intestinal flora has recently been demonstrated (10Sidhu H. Hoppe B. Hesse A. Tenbrock K.

Unfortunately, efforts to re-colonize the gastrointestinal tract with O. formigenes in individuals who lack the organism have proven ineffective to date, a finding stimulating interest in the development of oxalate-degrading enzyme-based therapies (11Sidhu H.

Oxalate is anaerobically decarboxylated in O. formigenes to give CO2 and formate via a two-step pathway that is mediated by the coupled action of two enzymes, formyl-CoA transferase (12Baetz A.L.

It has been proposed that this oxalate degradation pathway, when coupled with oxalate/formate transport by an oxalate/formate transmembrane anti-porter (17Ruan Z.S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T.

The first step in oxalate catabolism involves formyl-CoA transferase-catalyzed transfer of CoA from formyl-CoA to oxalate, which activates the oxalyl moiety for thiamin-dependent decarboxylation in the subsequent reaction mediated by OXC (15Baetz A.L.

The enzyme requires the cofactor thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) (15Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the biologically active form of vitamin B1, which is common in proteins catalyzing the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds adjacent to a carbonyl group. In this paper we report the 1.73 Å resolution crystal structure and kinetic characterization of recombinant OXC from O. formigenes. This crystallographic study reveals a novel set of residues in the active site from which we propose a mechanism for the decarboxylation, together with an ADP-binding site. The ADP site appears to have evolved from an FAD-binding site, which is present in the related enzymes pyruvate oxidase (POX) (21Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) (22Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Guddat L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies stimulated by this structural observation support the hypothesis that ADP is a high affinity activator of the enzyme, a finding that may be of physiological relevance in O. formigenes. Expression and Purification—A BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli expression strain transformed with pET-9a carrying the wild type oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (oxc) gene from O. formigenes (20Lung H.Y.

Cells were grown in LB broth to an A600 of 0.3-0.6, and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopy-ranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 3 h at 37 °C (A600 1.8-2.0). Cell pellets from 1 liter of culture were suspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2) and sonicated. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and supernatant was loaded onto a 20-ml Blue-Sepharose fast flow affinity column equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The column was washed with Buffer A, and OXC was then eluted with Buffer B (25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 2 m NaCl). Fractions containing OXC were combined, and buffer was exchanged using a Sephadex G25 HiPrep 26/10 desalting column equilibrated with Buffer C (25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. OXC was eluted with Buffer C, and fractions containing the enzyme were loaded on a Q-Sepharose high performance anion exchange column equilibrated with Buffer C at a flow rate 5 ml/min. Purified OXC was eluted using a 10-40% gradient of Buffer D (25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 0.5 m NaCl), and fractions were pooled. Purified OXC was concentrated in an Amicon Stirred Cell and stored at -80 °C as previously described (23Berthold C.L. Sidhu H. Ricagno S. Richards N.G. Lindqvist Y. Biochim. Biophys.

The solution was concentrated to a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml before crystallization by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique. Full details about crystallization screening and optimization have been published elsewhere (23Berthold C.L. Sidhu H. Ricagno S. Richards N.G. Lindqvist Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Useful diffraction-quality crystals were obtained after ∼4 days, with a precipitating solution containing 27% polyethylene glycol 550 monomethyl ether, 100 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.5, and 50 mm CaCl2. Data Collection and Processing—Data were collected to 1.73 Å in a nitrogen stream at 110 K at beamline ID23-1, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, as described (23Berthold C.L. Sidhu H. Ricagno S. Richards N.G. Lindqvist Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; (August 16)10.1016/j.bbapap.2005.08.016PubMed Google Scholar). No additional cryoprotectant was needed, and the crystals were directly flash-frozen in the nitrogen stream. All images were processed using MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26 (Vol., Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK)Google Scholar), and the unit-cell parameters were determined using the autoindexing option. The data set was scaled using the program SCALA (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Briefly, the data showed 622 symmetry, but hemihedral twinning was detected using the intensity statistics and distributions obtained from the CCP4 programs TRUNCATE (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr.

The Yeates and Fam Merohedral Crystal Twinning Server was used as an additional indicator and for calculations of the twin fraction (α) (28Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). An incomplete low resolution model of OXC has previously been determined from crystals in space group P42212 diffracting to 4.1 Å resolution (23Berthold C.L. Sidhu H. Ricagno S. Richards N.G. Lindqvist Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; (August 16)10.1016/j.bbapap.2005.08.016PubMed Google Scholar). This model, covering 468 of 568 residues, was obtained by molecular replacement using a polyalanine model of AHAS (22Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Guddat L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), omitting loops and the C-terminal domain. The low resolution model of OXC was subsequently used for molecular replacement in the high resolution data with the program MOLREP (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar, 29Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

The molecular replacement search was initially performed in twinned data without any success and was, therefore, continued in detwinned data generated by DETWIN. The true space group P3121 was deduced based on packing considerations and statistical comparisons. The structure of OXC in the P3121 crystal form was refined to 1.73 Å with a fixed twin fraction of α = 0.43 using the protocol for twinned data in the CNS software (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). A test set of 4.6% of the reflections was excluded to monitor the Rfree value. Care was taken to keep the twin-related reflections together in either the test or work set in order not to bias the refinement. Refinement with simulated-annealing, individual B-factor, and energy minimization procedures was interspersed with rounds of manual model building in σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc electron density maps with the graphics program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) (TABLE TWO). Initially, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied but were later abandoned. All ligand library files were created with the Dundee PRODRG2 server (32Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4189) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added automatically in CNS at Fo - Fc difference density peaks >3σ followed by manual inspection and additional assignment in the molecular graphics program Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar). After convergence of the refinement in CNS, refinement of both the coordinates and the twin fraction was performed in SHELXL (34Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). The test set was kept intact during all refinement steps. The refined twin faction α = 0.440 was used in the final refinement steps in CNS when double conformations for some side chains were added.TABLE TWOStructure refinement and final model statisticsResolution (Å)29.2-1.73Twinned Rwork (%)15.1Twinned Rfree (%)17.5Number of amino acids2 × 546Number of atoms8999Protein8231Ligands108Water658Ion2B-factors (Å2)Wilson plot21.1Protein24.6Main chain23.4Side chain25.9Ligands23.5Water32.9Ion17.8Root mean square deviation from ideal geometryBond length (Å)0.007Bond angles (°)1.29Ramachandran plot (%)Residues in most favored regions89.6Residues in additional allowed10.0Residues in generously allowed0.2Residues in disallowed0.2 Open table in a new tab Structural Analysis—The final model was validated with the PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A.

Size Exclusion Chromatography Measurements—Size exclusion chromatography was carried out following the procedure described in Jonsson et al. (14Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using Buffer E (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl) at a flow rate 1 ml/min. Molecular weight standards used were lysozyme (14.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), peroxidase (44 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Void volume (vo) was determined with blue dextran (2000 kDa). Enzymatic Assay—Recombinant OXC (0.775 μg/ml) was assayed in 60 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.7, 60 μm ThDP, 6 mm MgCl2, with a final reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of oxalyl-CoA at appropriate concentrations to reaction mixture preincubated at 30 °C for 2.5 min. Oxalyl-CoA was synthesized and purified following literature protocols (14Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1963; 87: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and diluted in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.5. The reaction was quenched by adding 11.1 μl of 20% acetic acid to assay mixture, and the initial rate of formyl-CoA formation was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a modification of a previously published procedure (14Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 75-μl aliquots of quenched reaction mixture were injected onto a C18 analytical column (Dynamax Microsorb 60-8 C18, 250 × 4.6 mm) equilibrated with 98% Buffer F (25 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) and 2% Buffer G (20% Buffer F; 80% CH3CN) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After injection, the proportion of Buffer G was raised to 6% over a 12-min period followed by a step to 95% Buffer G that was continued for 2 min before returning to 2% Buffer G. Under these conditions ThDP eluted after 3.7 min, oxalyl-CoA eluted after 6.1 min, free CoA eluted after 9.9 min, and formyl-CoA eluted after 11.3 min. The concentration of CoA derivatives in the aliquots was determined as described previously (14Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Activation and Inhibition Studies—Recombinant OXC was assayed as described above in the presence of varying concentrations of ADP, ATP, and FAD suspended in 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.7, and free CoA diluted in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.5. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of Recombinant OXC—The recombinant, wild type enzyme was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells and purified using a two-step purification procedure that was significantly different from that published previously (15Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, after an initial dye-affinity chromatography step, wild type OXC could be purified to near homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography in yields of typically 5-10 mg/liter of culture (Supplemental Table S1). Gel filtration experiments were performed to determine the oligomeric state of the recombinant OXC using a size exclusion chromatography column calibrated with a variety of molecular mass standards. OXC eluted in a single peak with a retention time corresponding to 243 kDa (Fig. 2A). Because the OXC monomer has a molecular mass of 60,691 Da (20Lung H.Y. Baetz A.L. Peck A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2468-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this finding suggests that the purified enzyme is a tetramer in solution rather than the homodimer suggested in earlier studies of recombinant OXC (20Lung H.Y. Baetz A.L. Peck A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2468-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the recombinant, wild type OXC was measured using an HPLC-based assay rather than the coupled assay used to characterize the native enzyme (15Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) so as to measure formyl-CoA production directly. All reactions were performed at pH 6.7 to minimize the rate of uncatalyzed thioester hydrolysis. Under these conditions, product formation was linear over a period of 3 min (Fig. 2B), permitting the derivation of Michaelis-Menten steady-state kinetic parameters by fitting to standard equations (Fig. 2C) (39Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. 1993; (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, the apparent Km of oxalyl-CoA was 23 ± 3.5 μm, which is 10-fold lower than reported for native OXC (15Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the turnover number (kcat) was 88 s-1. This difference in the apparent Km values likely reflects technical difficulties in the coupled assay used in the earlier study (15Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because formate dehydrogenase activity appears to be affected by the presence of CoA thioesters. Sequence alignments (Supplemental Fig. S1) are consistent with the hypothesis that OXC is evolutionarily related to AHAS (22Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Guddat L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40Benner S.A. Chamberlin S.G. Liberles D.A. Govindarajan S. Knecht L. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the ThDP-dependent enzyme that plays an important role in the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids (41Singh B.K. Shaner D.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and which is the target for sulfonylurea-based herbicides (42LaRossa R.A. Schloss J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8753-8757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation was intriguing in that AHAS contains a “vestigial” FAD-binding site even though the redox co-factor plays no role in the catalytic mechanism and presumably is present merely to stabilize the three-dimensional fold of the protein (43Chang Y.Y. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170 (Jr.): 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 44Chang Y.Y. Wang A.Y. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (Jr.): 3911-3919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because electronic spectroscopy provided no evidence for the presence of bound flavin in OXC, 3P. Moussatche, unpublished results. we hypothesized that the FAD-binding site in AHAS had been “co-opted” as a binding site for the CoA portion of the substrate and examined the ability of free CoA and FAD to inhibit OXC activity. These experiments showed that although FAD does not inhibit OXC (data not shown), free CoA is a mixed inhibitor of OXC with respect to oxalyl-CoA, exhibiting Ki and Ki′ values of 400 and 270 μm, respectively (Fig. 2D). Significant functional insights have been provided by the availability of crystal structures of many different ThDP-dependent enzymes, of which some of the most extensively studied are transketolase (45Lindqvist Y.

The AAA domain contains highly conserved motifs, the Walker A, Walker B, and the second region of homology (SRH). Although Walker A and B motifs mediate ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively, the function of the SRH in VCP is not clear. We examined the significance of the SRH in VCP, especially the conserved Arg359 and Arg362 in the first AAA domain, D1 and Arg635 and Arg638 in the second AAA domain, D2. We show that Arg359 and Arg362 in D1 are critical for maintaining the hexameric structure and the ability to bind the polyubiquitin chains. Although the rest of the tested SRH mutants retain the hexameric structure, all of them exhibit severely reduced ATPase activity. Tryptophan fluorescence analysis showed that all of the tested mutants can bind to ATP or ADP. Thus, the reduced ATPase activity likely results from the hampered communications among protomers during hydrolysis. Moreover, when the ATPase-defective mutant R635A or R638A is mixed with the Walker A mutant of D2, the ATPase activity is partially restored, suggesting that Arg635 and Arg638 can stimulate the ATPase activity of the neighboring protomer. Interestingly, mutation of Arg359 and Arg362 uncouples the inhibitory effect of p47, a VCP co-factor, on the ATPase activity of VCP. Therefore, the Arg residues allow D1 to take on a specific conformation that is required for substrate binding and co-factor communications. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the conserved Arg residues in the SRH of both D1 and D2 play critical roles in communicating the conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis, and SRH in D1 also contributes to substrate binding and co-factor communications.

The AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of activities) family members act as molecular chaperones in many cellular activities in which they use the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis to remodel the structure of the “client” proteins. These AAA+proteins frequently form an oligomeric complex, with a ring-shaped structure, that provides the mechanical basis for the enzymatic and biological activities. The family proteins are characterized by having either one or two ATPase domains also called the AAA domains. The ∼250-amino acid ATPase domain contains highly conserved sequence motifs, such as Walker A and Walker B motifs that are responsible for ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, respectively.

The 97-kDa VCP (named p97 or VCP in animal or Cdc48 in yeast) is an ancient member of the AAA family and is present ubiquitously in all cells at a high level. Like other AAA proteins, VCP plays a critical role in many seemingly unrelated cellular activities, such as membrane fusion, cell cycle regulation, stress response, programmed cell death, B and T cell activation, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, and protein degradation (reviewed in Refs. 3Ogura T.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of these activities have been shown to be regulated, directly or indirectly, by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. It suggests that VCP may play a fundamental role in the degradation pathway that underlies all of these seemingly unrelated functions (4Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The VCP molecule comprises an N-terminal domain, two AAA domains (D1 and D2), and a C-terminal domain. We previously showed that the entire VCP molecule is required for the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin E in vitro (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal domain binds to the polyubiquitin chain and is responsible for substrate recognition (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In agreement with the diverse functions of VCP, it has been shown that in addition to the polyubiquitin chains the N-terminal domain can bind to a number of co-factors and membrane proteins, including p47 (12Uchiyama K.

In most of the proteins containing two AAA domains, only one of the domains is highly conserved, referred to as the bona fide AAA domain. Interestingly, unlike most of these family members, VCP possesses two bona fide AAA domains. Despite sharing a high sequence similarity, the two domains are not functionally equal. Although D2 is responsible for the major enzymatic activity at physiological temperature, D1 mediates a heat-enhanced ATPase activity (16Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our recent study further showed that D1 (residues 208–459) plus the linker region (residues 460–481) between D1 and D2 is responsible for the nucleotide-independent hexamerization. During the ATPase cycle, D1 stays as a relatively compact and protease-resistant hexameric ring, but D2 only does so when it binds to nucleotides (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32784-32793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After ADP is released at the end of the ATP hydrolysis, the D2 ring is destabilized and adopts a relatively flexible and open structure (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32784-32793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The consensus SRH sequence in the AAA family proteins, X(T/S)(N/S) XXXXXDXAXXRXXRX(D/E), contains two perfectly conserved Arg residues (18Ogura T. Whiteheart S.W. Wilkinson A.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A few available studies revealed that the conserved Arg residues play different roles in various AAA proteins. In FtsH, a protease containing a single AAA module in prokaryotes, Arg312 and Arg315 in the SRH are crucial for ATP hydrolysis but not for nucleotide binding (19Karata K. Inagawa T. Wilkinson A.J. Tatsuta T. Ogura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26225-26232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A different function is observed in NSF, a chaperone containing two AAA modules involved in membrane fusion events. In its bona fide ATPase domain D1, the conserved Arg385 and Arg388 in the SRH are not required for ATPase activity but rather serve as nucleotide state sensors (20Matveeva E.A. May A.P. He P. Whiteheart S.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This again demonstrates the confusing contrast between the extreme sequence conservation within the domain and the diversity of function of the AAA proteins. Because VCP has two conserved AAA domains, it would be interesting to study the function of the SRH in each domain. Available structural studies of AAA proteins suggest that SRH resides at the interface between the neighboring protomers and the two conserved Arg residues in SRH are of crucial importance. The ND1 crystal structure of VCP showed that Arg359 is available for interacting with the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide in the neighboring protomer and that Arg362 forms a salt bridge with Glu305 from a neighboring protomer (21Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, Arg359 and Arg362 are considered the trans-elements of the ATP-binding pocket of the D1 domain. The orientations of these two arginines are significantly different in the crystal structures obtained from ND1 and full-length constructs (21Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 22DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Because the two structures are crystallized at different nucleotide states, whether these two Arg residues are functionally interchangeable during the ATPase cycle is not clear. Recently, DeLaBarre and Brunger (23DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that Arg359 can interact with the β-phosphate group of ADP bound to the neighboring protomer. Moreover, the corresponding Arg residues in the D2 domain, Arg635 and Arg638, are not well ordered in the full-length crystal structure (22DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the GTPase-activating proteins identified an “arginine finger” that can stimulate the GTPase activity of GTP-binding protein (24Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Similarly, the conserved Arg residues in VCP may act as arginine fingers with respect to the ATPase activity of VCP. Therefore, the functional roles of these conserved elements in mediating the activities of VCP need to be investigated. The published mutagenesis studies of VCP have focused on the alterations in Walker A and B motifs, which are required for ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. However, the completion of the ATPase cycle is far more complicated than the steps of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. To better understand how the communication between adjacent protomers influences the enzymatic and biological activities of the hexameric VCP complex, it is necessary to examine the function of the SRH in VCP. In this report, we mutated the conserved Arg residues in the SRH of D1 (Arg359 and Arg362) and D2 (Arg635 and Arg638) and assessed the impact of these mutations on the functions of VCP such as hexameric structure, ATPase activity, nucleotide binding, substrate binding, and co-factor communication. We found that the Arg residues are critical for maintaining the hexameric structure and ATP hydrolysis but not for ATP binding, and they likely play a role in communicating between protomers. Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—Site-specific mutants were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using wild type pVCP-His (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) or p[1–481]-His (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32784-32793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as the templates. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of the VCP variants were cloned into His6 fusion expression vector pQE60 and expressed as His6 fusion proteins (through the C terminus of VCP) in Escherichia coli strain M15 (pREP4) (QIAexpress system; Qiagen). The His6-tagged wild type and mutant VCP proteins were purified as previously described (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32784-32793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To generate the hybrid hexamer constituting K524A and SRH mutants, we first generated K524A-Tag100 construct. Wild type VCP was cloned into pQE-100 vector (Qiagen) and a Lys to Ala mutation was introduced to obtain the pHis-K524A-100 construct. Then the N-terminal His tag was removed using the mutagenesis kit with the following primer: 5′-CATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGGCCTCTGGAGCCGATTC (the coding sequence of VCP is underlined, and the complementary strand is not shown). The resulting pK524A-Tag100 was co-transformed with either pR635A-His or pR638A-His into M15, and the expressed VCP protein (presumably heterohexamer) was purified with Ni-NTA-agarose. The identification of the heterohexamer was confirmed by Western blot with anti-Tag100 antibody (Qiagen). Oligomeric Status Analysis—The oligomeric status of VCP variants was analyzed by both native gel electrophoresis using 10% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) and gel filtration chromatography using Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32784-32793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The fractions collected from the gel filtration column were resolved on SDS gels. VCP proteins on the native gel or the SDS gel were electrophoretically transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected by Western blot analysis as described previously (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32784-32793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ATPase Activity Assay—The ATPase activity of the wild type and VCP mutants were carried out as previously described (16Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To test the allosteric effect of the Arg in SRH on ATPase activity, VCP heterohexamers containing the His-tagged SRH mutants and the Tag100-fused K524A were used in the ATPase assay. To test the effect of p47 on the activity of VCP, p47 (2.5 μg) and VCP variants (2.5 μg each) were incubated in the reaction buffer for 15 min at room temperature prior to the standard ATPase assay. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra of tryptophan were measured with a Jasco FP6500 spectrometer equipped with a microcell (Jasco Inc. Japan). The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the tryptophan emission was monitored between 305 and 450 nm with bandwidths of 3 and 5 nm, respectively. The concentration of the test proteins was approximately 100 μg/ml (1 μm). The experiments were carried out at room temperature in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm nucleotide (if desired). p47 Binding Assays—The GST-p47 expressed from plasmid of pGEX-2T-p47 (a gift from Dr. Mitsuo Tagaya, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Tokyo, Japan) on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was incubated with individual VCP-His variants at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotating in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% gelatin, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mm ATP) (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The beads were sedimented in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with the same buffer. The complex pulled down with the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer, and immunoblotting with a VCP antiserum recognizing the C terminus of VCP (25Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin Chain Binding—The polyubiquitin chain (Affiniti Research Products Ltd., UW8860) binding assay was carried out as described previously (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). All of the reactions contained 4 mm ATP, and the reaction components were separated onto 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously with a 1:1,000 dilution of the antibodies specific to VCP C terminus (25Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), ubiquitin (DAKO), His (Qiagen), and Tag100 (Qiagen). Generation and Purification of SRH Mutants of VCP—Sequence alignment shows that several amino acids in the SRH, including Asn, Asp, and two Arg residues, are almost 100% conserved among the AAA family proteins (Fig. 1A). Crystallographic studies showed that the two Arg residues in SRH are trans-elements for the ATP-binding pockets of VCP. We therefore generated a variety of VCP mutants (summarized in Fig. 1B), including the full-length VCP variants and the truncated [1–481] variants, all of which harbor single or double mutations at the conserved Arg residues in the D1 (Arg359 and Arg362) or D2 (Arg635 and Arg638) domain. Specifically, the positively charged Arg residue was systematically mutated to a similarly charged Lys residue (Arg to Lys), or a neutral Ala (Arg to Ala) or a negatively charged Glu (Arg to Glu). For comparison, two additional conserved residues in SRH, Asn348 and Asp354, which are cis-elements of the ATP-binding pocket of D1 domain, were also mutated for the study. All of the site-specific mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of the variants were expressed as fusion proteins with a His6 tag fused at the C terminus of VCP. The expressed proteins were subjected to consecutive affinity chromatography and purified to apparent homogeneity (partially shown in Fig. 1C). Arg to Glu Mutations in the SRH of D1, but Not D2, Disrupt the Hexameric Structure of VCP—To examine the functional roles of the SRH in VCP, we first studied the oligomeric status of the double mutants, in which both Arg are changed to Glu. In gel filtration analysis, although almost all of the D2 double mutant (R635E/R638E) was detected in a hexameric form, D1 mutant (R359E/R362E) was predominantly in a monomeric form or in an oligomeric form smaller than hexamers (Fig. 2A and summarized in Fig. 1B). In accordance, the native gel electrophoresis showed that the D1 mutant was detected in three types of complexes corresponding to hexamers, trimers, and monomers (Fig. 2B, lane 3), whereas the D2 mutant was present predominantly as hexamers (lane 2). We then asked whether changing Arg to an uncharged Ala or a similarly charged Lys impacts the hexamer stability. As shown in Fig. 2C, mutating Arg to Ala in all four conserved positions, in the context of either single or double mutations, did not affect the hexamerization. Similar results were obtained with Lys substitution (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that 1) the Arg residues in the SRH of D1, but not D2, are critical for hexamerization, 2) substitution of Arg with Ala or Lys at any of the four positions does not impact the overall hexameric structure, and 3) only changing Arg to Glu at both positions 359 and 362 in D1 disrupts the hexamer. Arg362 Is More Important than Arg359 in Maintaining the Hexameric Structure—To determine whether Arg359 and Arg362 are of equal importance in maintaining the structure, we further examined the oligomeric status of the single mutants, R359E and R362E. As shown in Fig. 3A, the hexamer was partially disrupted in R362E but intact in R359E mutant (also summarized in Fig. 1B). This result suggests that although both Arg359 and Arg362 are trans-elements in the ATP-binding pocket, Arg362 is more important in holding the hexamer together. We previously reported that the first 481 amino acids of VCP ([1–481]), comprising the ND1 domain and the subsequent 20-amino acid linker, are sufficient to form hexamers in the absence of nucleotides (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32784-32793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further substantiate the significance of Arg359 and Arg362 in hexamerization, the Arg to Ala substitutions were introduced into [1–481], designated [1–481]R359A and [1–481]R362A. Because VCP can form hexamers in the absence of nucleotides, a similar mutation at the ATP-binding site Lys251 was also generated ([1–481]K251A) for comparison. As revealed by the native gel electrophoresis, [1–481] and the majority of [1–481]K251A migrated as hexamers, but [1–481]R359A and [1–481]R362A failed to form a hexamer (Fig. 3B). Again, the oligomeric structure was disrupted more severely in [1–481]R362A than in [1–481]R359A mutant. In summary, the conserved Arg359 and Arg362 in D1 domain are crucial for maintaining the hexameric structure in VCP, and Arg362 plays a more important role than Arg359. Impact of Arg Mutations on Polyubiquitin Chain Binding—Our previous study showed that a hexameric structure is critical for binding to the polyubiquitinated proteins (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Because D1 SRH is essential for the hexameric structure, it is expected to play an important role in substrate binding. To test this, an in vitro ubiquitin chain binding assay was carried out. VCP variants containing Arg mutations in D1 or D2 domain were attached to Ni-NTA beads and used in polyubiquitin chain pull-down assays. As evidenced in Fig. 4, D2 mutants, including R635A, R635K, R638A, and R638K, were all capable of binding the ubiquitin chains. But the D1 mutants are dissimilar: whereas R359K and R362K retain the binding ability, R359A and R362A do not. This indicated that the specific conformations of R359K and R362K are different from those of R359A and R362A, although they are all capable of forming hexamer (Fig. 2C) and binding to nucleotides (Fig. 5C and D). Based on these results, we conclude that the extended positively charged side chains at positions 359 and 362 in D1 SRH allow the N-terminal domain to adopt a specific conformation for substrate binding.FIGURE 5Nucleotide binding is not affected in Arg mutants of both domains. The Trp fluorescence spectra of wild type (WT), K524T, and Arg mutants are shown. The steady-state fluorescence spectra of the wild type (A), K524T (B), R359A (C), R362A (D), R635A (E), and R638A (F) in the presence of ATP or ADP were compared with the nucleotide-free state.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All Arg Mutations in SRH Severely Reduce the ATPase Activity of VCP—In addition to binding to the substrates, an intact hexameric structure is also a prerequisite to the efficient ATPase activity of VCP (26Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Lustig A. Muller S. Engel A. Volker S. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 557-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the R359E/R362E mutant barely exhibits ATPase activity (TABLE ONE and summarized in Fig. 1B). Although most other Arg mutants retain the hexameric structure, all have severely compromised ATPase activities. Even with the conservative change from Arg to Lys, the ATPase activity was abolished in R635K and R638K mutants and decreased ∼80% in R359K and R362K mutants (TABLE ONE). It was also noted that mutations in the D1 domain resulted in a smaller decrease in ATPase activity than the analogous mutations in the D2 domain. This is consistent with our previous report that D2 is the major ATPase domain in VCP (16Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); thus the corresponding mutation in D2 inflicts more drastic impacts. The activity of another D1 SRH mutant, N348Q, was also reduced to ∼25%, comparable with that observed in the Arg mutants of D1 domain (TABLE ONE). This result is consistent with the crystallographic data that Arg359, Arg362, and Asn348 residues are all involved in protomer interactions (21Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, mutating Asp354, which is not directly involved in protomer interactions, only reduced the activity by ∼50%. Therefore, an efficient ATPase activity requires the conserved SRH residues, especially those directly involved in protomer contacts. Previously, we reported that although D2 is the major ATPase domain, D1 domain mediates the heat-induced activity of VCP (16Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We compared the ATPase activity measured at 50 °C versus 37 °C and found that although the wild type, N348Q, and D354E exhibited nearly 2-fold increases, the D1 Arg mutants have a much smaller increase (TABLE ONE). It suggests that these two trans-elements are also important for mediating the heat-stimulated activity.TABLE ONEATPase activity and its stimulation by heatATPase activity at 37 °CStimulation by heat%foldWild type1001.9R359E13.71.2R359A11.71.3R359K22.11.4R362E17.01.2R362A21.51.3R362K22.21.3R359E/R362E5.11.2R359A/R362A8.91.2R635ANDaND, not detectable at the protein concentration used in the experiments hereNDR635KNDNDR638ANDNDR368KNDNDN348Q25.02.0D354E54.41.7a ND, not detectable at the protein concentration used in the experiments here Open table in a new tab Arg to Ala Substitution in D1 or D2 SRH Does Not Affect the Nucleotide Binding to D2—The decrease of enzyme activity in hexameric SRH mutants may result from an incapability of nucleotide binding and/or an inefficient hydrolysis. To differentiate the two possibilities, intrinsic Trp fluorescence spectra were analyzed. We previously showed that binding of ATP or ADP to VCP induces a characteristic Trp fluorescence change (Fig. 5A) specifically resulting from residue Trp476 (17Wang Q. Song C. Yang X. Li C.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2080083940,"The Arabidopsis genome contains two genes predicted to code for bifunctional aspartate kinase-homoserine dehydrogenase enzymes (isoforms I and II). These two activities catalyze the first and the third steps toward the synthesis of the essential amino acids threonine, isoleucine, and methionine. We first characterized the kinetic and regulatory properties of the recombinant enzymes, showing that they mainly differ with respect to the inhibition of the homoserine dehydrogenase activity by threonine. A systematic search for other allosteric effectors allowed us to identify an additional inhibitor (leucine) and 5 activators (alanine, cysteine, isoleucine, serine, and valine) equally efficient on aspartate kinase I activity (4-fold activation). The six effectors of aspartate kinase I were all activators of aspartate kinase II activity (13-fold activation) and displayed a similar specificity for the enzyme. No synergy between different effectors could be observed. The activation, which resulted from a decrease in the Km values for the substrates, was detected using low substrates concentrations. Amino acid quantification revealed that alanine and threonine were much more abundant than the other effectors in Arabidopsis leaf chloroplasts. In vitro kinetics in the presence of physiological concentrations of the seven allosteric effectors confirmed that aspartate kinase I and II activities were highly sensitive to changes in alanine and threonine concentrations. Thus, physiological context rather than enzyme structure sets the specificity of the allosteric control. Stimulation by alanine may play the role of a feed forward activation of the aspartate-derived amino acid pathway in plant.

The first and the third steps in the synthesis of the essential amino acids threonine (Thr) and methionine (Met) from aspartate (Asp) are catalyzed in bacteria and in plants by the bifunctional enzyme aspartate kinase-homoserine dehydrogenase (AK-HSDH) 2The abbreviations used are: AKaspartate kinaseASADHaspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenaseHSDHhomoserine dehydrogenase. (E.C. 2.7.2.4-E.C. 1.1.1.3) (see Scheme 1). In Escherichia coli, two isoforms of AK-HSDH enzymes are found (thrA and metL gene products) (1Umbarger H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 533-606Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). ThrA protein is inhibited by Thr on both activities. No allosteric effector could be identified for the AK and the HSDH activities of the second isoform (MetL protein) (1Umbarger H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 533-606Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In plants, only one AK-HSDH isoform was identified after fractionation of crude extracts of soluble proteins (2Aarnes H. Rognes S.E. Phytochemistry. 1974; 13: 2717-2724Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Turner W.L. Lea P.J. Phytochemistry. 1997; 46: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome revealed the existence of two genes (At1g31230 and At4g19710) for AK-HSDH enzymes. The cDNA from one of these genes (At1g31230) was previously cloned (4Ghislain M. Frankard V. Vandenbossche D. Matthews B.F. Jacobs M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) but the protein (AK-HSDH I) was not characterized. In a study from our group (5Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the cDNA corresponding to the second AK-HSDH gene (At4g19710) was cloned and the protein (named AK-HSDH II) was overexpressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. aspartate kinase aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase homoserine dehydrogenase. To complete the analysis of Arabidopsis AK-HSDH enzymes the Arabidopsis thaliana AK-HSDH I isoform was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli and its kinetic and regulatory properties were determined. In the course of this work, a systematic survey of the effect of other amino acids led us to identify unexpected allosteric effectors of Arabidopsis Thr-sensitive AKs. The key point of this discovery was the measurement of AK activities in the presence of low (i.e. physiological) concentrations of the substrates ATP and Asp. The plasmid coding for AK-HSDH I devoid of its predicted transit peptide was constructed by PCR using the same strategy as for AK-HSDH II (5Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The initiating Met in recombinant AK-HSDH I was aligned with the position of the initiating Met in the recombinant AK-HSDH II (5Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As part of the insertion of a NcoI restriction site, Gly62 and Ser63 were replaced by Met62 and Ala63 in the recombinant protein. Sequencing of the cDNA was carried out and was in agreement with the predicted cDNA sequence of At1g31230. Transformed E. coli BL21pLys(S) cells were grown at 37 °C in 800 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm when bacterial growth was equivalent to an A600 of 0.8. Cells were further grown for 15 h at 28 °C and collected by centrifugation. The preparation of the crude extract and the first two purification steps (anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration) of AK-HSDH I were as for AK-HSDH II (5Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). AK-HSDH I eluted from the DEAE column at a higher KCl concentration (300 mm) than AK-HSDH II (250 mm). After elution from the gel filtration column, the protein was concentrated on a Centricon device (50 K) and loaded on a Green Sepharose column equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm Thr. AK-HSDH I protein was excluded. Pure protein was quickly frozen in N2 and stored at -80 °C for several months without any loss of activity. Recombinant AK-HSDH II protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as previously reported (5Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in the spectrophotometer in a quartz cuvette thermostated at 30 °C. AK Assay—AK activity was measured with a coupled assay using aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH) previously purified to homogeneity in the laboratory (6Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amount of ASADH was adjusted so that the flux through the enzymatic chain was independent on the ASADH concentration (typically 50 nm AK and 0.8 μm ASADH). Activity was measured in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μm NADPH in the presence of fixed or variable amounts of ATP and Asp (see figure legends). Reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme. In this coupled assay 2 mol of NADPH are consumed per mol of Asp phosphorylated (1 mol consumed by ASADH and 1 mol by HSDH). NADPH oxidation rate at steady-state was divided by two to obtain actual AK rates. HSDH Assay—HSDH substrate, aspartate semialdehyde, was prepared as previously described (7Paris S. Viemon C. Curien G. Dumas R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5361-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activity measurements were carried out in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 100 μm aspartate semialdehyde, and 200 μm NADPH. Reaction was initiated with the enzyme (final concentration 20 nm). A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown for 3 weeks on soil in a growth chamber (22 °C, 60% air humidity, light intensity of 150 μE m-2 s-1, 16 h light/8 h dark) before rosette leaves were harvested. Chloroplasts were purified on Percoll gradients as described in Ref. 8Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Free amino acids were prepared from intact chloroplasts by three consecutive extractions in aqueous ethanol solutions buffered with Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, as described in Ref. 9Kreft O. Hoefgen R. Hesse H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1843-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar. Between the extraction steps, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g and the supernatants collected. The combined ethanol/water extracts were used for amino acid derivatization using o-phthaldialdehyde. The derivatized amino acids were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Hypersil C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 3 μm) at 37 °C and 0.8 ml/min using a 65-min gradient of methanol in a sodium acetate buffer. Derivatized amino acids were detected using a SFM25 fluorimeter (Kontron) by excitation at 340 nm and emission at 455 nm. Free amino acid contents were normalized to chlorophyll concentration (10Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9424) Google Scholar). Three extractions were performed for two independent purifications of chloroplasts to ensure reproducibility. The cDNA corresponding to the At1g31230 gene from A. thaliana and predicted to code for a Thr-sensitive AK-HSDH was the first to be cloned (4Ghislain M. Frankard V. Vandenbossche D. Matthews B.F. Jacobs M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the recombinant protein (named AK-HSDH I) was not characterized. Following the publication of the Arabidopsis genome, a second gene (At4g19710) predicted to code for a Thr-sensitive AK-HSDH was identified. In a previous study (5Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) from our group the corresponding recombinant protein (named AK-HSDH II) was overexpressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. In the present work, to determine the kinetic and regulatory properties of AK-HSDH I, the cDNA sequence corresponding to the predicted mature form of the enzyme (devoid of its predicted chloroplastic transit peptide) was amplified by PCR and cloned into a pET23d(+) expression vector. The AK-HSDH I recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli as a soluble form but at a lower level than observed for AK-HSDH II (5Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Pure protein could be obtained after three purification steps (see “Materials and Methods”). Comparison of AK-HSDH Isoform Kinetic Properties—AK I and AK II catalytic constants were similar (v/[E]0 = 5 ± 0.5 s-1 for AK I and v/[E]0 = 6.2 ± 0.5 s-1 for AK II). Compared with AK II, AK I displayed a higher Km for aspartate and a lower Km for ATP, see TABLE ONE.TABLE ONEKm of AK I and AK II for ATP and Asp in the absence and presence of a saturating concentration of AlaEnzymeVariable substrateFixed substrateKm minus Ala (mm)Km plus Ala (mm)AK IATPAsp (50 mm)6.5 (±1)0.48 (±0.02)aSaturation curve by ATP was sigmoidal.

The value is a S0.5 rather than a Km Open table in a new tab HSDH activities were measured in the physiological direction (production of homoserine from aspartate semialdehyde). The Km for aspartate semialdehyde proved to be very similar for both isoforms (290 ± 17 and 311 ± 6 μm for HSDH I and HSDH II, respectively). Catalytic constants were also similar (245 ± 19 and 196 ± 21 s-1 for HSDH I and HSDH II, respectively). Inhibition of AK Activities by Thr at Low Substrate Concentrations— The inhibition of AK II by Thr was previously measured in the presence of 50 mm Asp and 20 mm ATP (7Paris S. Viemon C. Curien G. Dumas R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5361-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present work, to describe and compare the inhibition by Thr under more physiological conditions, we used low substrate concentrations, representative of the chloroplastic environment, i.e. 1 mm Asp and 2 mm ATP (11Krause G.H. Heber U. The Intact Chloroplast. 1976; : 174-175Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that AK I, which was predicted to be a Thr-sensitive AK, was indeed inhibited by Thr. The inhibition curve was sigmoidal. The K0.5 value for Thr was about twice as high as that of AK II (91 ± 3 and 49 ± 3 μm for AK I and AK II, respectively). Also the cooperativity of the inhibition was much higher for AK I (Hill number, nH = 3.7 ± 0.5) than for AK II (nH = 1.7 ± 0.15). It is worth noting that the K0.5 value of AK II for Thr was 10-fold lower than previously reported for this enzyme when activity was measured in the presence of saturating concentrations of substrates (7Paris S. Viemon C. Curien G. Dumas R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5361-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A lower K0.5 value for Thr in the presence of low substrate concentrations was expected as the inhibition of the AK activity by Thr is competitive with respect to the substrates (7Paris S. Viemon C. Curien G. Dumas R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5361-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HSDH Activities by Thr—Thr inhibited HSDH I activity in a hyperbolic manner (Fig. 1B). Inhibition was partial at saturation. In the presence of 100 μm aspartate semialdehyde, a K0.5 value for Thr of 407 ± 56 μm was calculated for HSDH I. In the same experimental conditions, HSDH II displayed a K0.5 value for Thr about 1 order of magnitude higher than HSDH I (K0.5 = 8500 ± 1800 μm). At saturation of Thr HSDH I retained 14% of activity, whereas HSDH II retained 25% of activity. Identification of New Allosteric Effectors of AK I—As the present work was the first characterization of AK I we checked the effect of various other amino acids on its activity, in the absence of Thr and in the presence of physiological concentrations of substrates (1 mm Asp, 2 mm ATP). We initially tested amino acids produced in the Asp-derived amino acid pathway (Lys, Met, Leu, Val, Ile), or connected to this pathway (Cys, the precursor of Met). Interestingly, Cys, Ile, and Val stimulated the enzyme activity about 3-fold at 2.5 mm. On the other hand, Leu inhibited AK I. These results engaged us to test other amino acids external to the pathway but of similar size (Gly, Ser, and Ala). Surprisingly, Ser and Ala (2.5 mm) also stimulated AK I activity about 3-fold. Response curves are displayed in Fig. 2A. The activation was hyperbolic or slightly sigmoidal (for Cys). Cys was the strongest activator. Activation by cysteine did not reflect a general sulfhydryl effect, because dithiothreitol did not activate AK at 1 mm. Parameters of the activation by Ala, Cys, Ile, Ser, Val, and of the inhibition by Leu are displayed in TABLE TWO. To test for synergistic effects between different activators the different couples were tested at concentrations representing one-fourth the K0.5 value calculated from the response curves in Fig. 2A. For each couple tested, activation was additive, indicating the absence of synergy between two different activators. In the same manner no synergy could be detected between the inhibitors Leu and Thr (not shown).TABLE TWOParameters of the allosteric activation and inhibition of AK I and AK IIK0.5 (μm)nHActivation factorAK IAK IIAK IAK IIAK IAK IIAla1075 (±321)362 (±26)–aSaturation curve was hyperbolic1.7 (±0.22)4.213.2Cys340 (±76)79 (±5)–aSaturation curve was hyperbolic1.6 (±0.15)3.812.4Ile4000 (±1400)488 (±26)–aSaturation curve was hyperbolic1.6 (±0.1)4.512.4Leu1100 (±50)636 (±110)1.5 (±0.1)–aSaturation curve was hyperbolicInhibition4.3Ser1250 (±340)325 (±68)–aSaturation curve was hyperbolic1.2 (±0.3)3.712.3Thr91 (±3)49 (±3)3.7 (±0.5)1.7 (±0.5)InhibitionInhibitionVal1800 (±520)337 (±24)–aSaturation curve was hyperbolic1.5 (±0.15)3.912.4a Saturation curve was hyperbolic Open table in a new tab Among the 6 novel effectors of AK I, tested at 2.5 mm, only Cys had an effect on HSDH I activity. Cys inhibition was hyperbolic and partial at saturation (not shown). Fourteen percent activity was retained at saturation with Cys and a K0.5 value for Cys of 290 ± 45 μm was calculated. Thus, Cys was a more potent inhibitor of HSDH I activity than Thr (K0.5 = 405 μm, Fig. 1B). The cysteine effect on HSDH activity did not reflect a general sulfhydryl effect as dithiothreitol was not inhibitory at 1 mm. No synergy between Cys and Thr could be detected. Re-examination of AK-HSDH II Regulatory Properties—We checked the effect of the allosteric effectors identified for AK I on the AK II activity, in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP and Asp. Interestingly, the effect on the AK II activity was even more pronounced than for AK I and qualitatively different. A 13-fold stimulation of AK II activity was observed with Ala, Cys, Ile, Ser, and Val each at 2.5 mm. Leu, an inhibitor of AK I, was stimulatory with AK II although to a lower extent than observed for the other activators (4-fold activation at 2.5 mm). The response curves for the strongest activators of AK II displayed sigmoidal shapes (Fig. 2B). The saturation curve by Cys (Fig. 2B) had the lowest K0.5 value (80 ± 5 μm). K0.5 values for Val, Ile, Ala, and Ser were similar and about 4-fold higher (350 μm) than for Cys (see TABLE TWO). The saturation curve for Leu (Fig. 2B) displayed a higher K0.5 value (635 ± 100 μm) and was hyperbolic. As observed for AK I no synergy could be detected between different activators of AK II (not shown). At 2.5 mm, the 6 activators of AK II were without any detectable effect on HSDH II activity in the presence or the absence of Thr, with the exception of Cys (not shown). Inhibition of HSDH II by Cys was hyperbolic and partial at saturation. The enzyme retained 15% of activity at saturation with Cys and a K0.5 value of 715 ± 171 μm was calculated. Thus, as observed for HSDH I, Cys was a more potent inhibitor of HSDH II than Thr. HSDH II K0.5 value for Cys was higher than that of HSDH I. No synergy between Thr and Cys for the inhibition of HSDH II could be observed (not shown). Activation Results from a Decrease in the Km for the Substrates—AK I and AK II kinetic parameters in the absence and presence of a saturating concentration of Ala (10 mm) were compared. No catalytic effect could be detected (not shown). However, as indicated in TABLE ONE, in the presence of 10 mm Ala, AK I and AK II displayed much lower K0.5 values for ATP than in the absence of Ala (13- and 5-fold decrease, respectively). In the presence of Ala, AK II Km for Asp was reduced 4-fold, whereas AK I displayed a Km for Asp virtually unchanged. The minor effect of Ala on AK I apparent affinity for Asp explains why AK I is less efficiently activated than AK II at physiological concentrations of Asp and ATP (see Fig. 2). Both isoforms displayed similar kinetic parameters with respect to ATP and Asp in the presence of 10 mm Ala. The activation thus results from an increase in the apparent affinity for the substrates, and thus can only be detected at low substrate concentrations. Enzyme Response in the Presence of Physiological Concentrations of Effectors—From a physiological point of view, the existence of several allosteric activators for a single enzyme, with some amino acids produced downstream in the pathway (Leu, Val, and Ile) and others external to the pathway (Cys, Ser, and Ala) was perplexing. To examine this further in a quantitative manner, the abundance of the different amino acids was measured in the stroma of chloroplasts isolated from A. thaliana leaves. Results presented in TABLE THREE indicated that Ala and Thr were from 5- to 20-fold more abundant than the other amino acids. Cys, the strongest activator of AK I and AK II and the best inhibitor of HSDH I and II was the lowest abundant of the 7 effectors. In the absence of observed synergy between different amino acids, these results suggested that the broad specificity for the control of AK activity observed when amino acids were tested one by one (Fig. 2) might be restricted to the two highly abundant amino acids Ala and Thr. We thus designed experiments in which AK I and AK II activities were measured in the presence of the 7 allosteric effectors at their chloroplastic concentrations. From a physiological point of view it was more pertinent to consider relative changes of concentration rather than absolute changes. Thus, the concentration of each of the allosteric effectors of the AK activities was varied in turn, from zero to several times their chloroplastic concentration, in the presence of the other effectors at their chloroplastic concentration. Fig. 3, A and B, show that, when the modification of amino acid abundance was expressed in terms of fold-changes, AK I and AK II activities were efficiently inhibited by Thr and activated by Ala only. Manyfold changes in Cys, Ile, Leu, Ser, or Val concentrations had only minor quantitative effects on AK I and AK II activities (Fig. 3). Results in Fig. 3, A and B, also show that Ala and Thr are able to displace each other. Moreover, the inhibition by Thr and the activation by Ala were observed for rather similar ranges of concentrations of effectors for AK I and AK II. Indeed, half-inhibition by Thr was observed at a concentration of Thr of 104 μm and 114 μm for AK I and AK II, respectively. Also, half-maximum activation was observed for 2250 and 3400 μm Ala for AK I and AK II, respectively.TABLE THREEConcentrations of the effectors of AK-HSDH in the stroma The amino acids Ala, Ile, Leu, Ser, Thr, and Val were quantified in chloroplasts isolated from 21-day-old Arabidopsis leaves.Amino acidChlorophyllConcentration in the stromaa66 μl of stroma/mg of chlorophyll (17)nmol/mgμmAla26.96 (±1.9)408Cys15bCys was assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the cell and we used the same value as in Ref. 18Ile3.19 (±0.79)48Leu3.57 (±0.53)54Thr20.90 (±2.23)317Ser4.05 (±0.72)61Val6.36 (±1.09)96a 66 μl of stroma/mg of chlorophyll (17Winter H.

Dumas R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4615-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar Open table in a new tab Similar experiments were carried out to examine the sensitivity of HSDH activities to Cys and Thr. As expected from the low abundance of Cys, HSDH activities are only feebly affected by manyfold changes of Cys concentrations around its physiological value. HSDH I was much more sensitive to Thr than HSDH II (compare Fig. 3, C and D), which virtually escaped control by Thr at physiological concentration. In the present work, the previously uncharacterized AK-HSDH isoform I from A. thaliana was expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli, purified, and its kinetic and regulatory properties were determined. We first showed that the AK and HSDH activities of this isoform were inhibited by Thr. HSDH I activity was inhibited by physiological concentrations of Thr, in marked difference with HSDH II, which was virtually unaffected in these conditions. A systematic examination of the effect of other amino acids leads us to the discovery of new allosteric activators and inhibitors of Arabidopsis Thr-sensitive AK activities. When tested in isolation and in the absence of Thr, amino acids Ala, Cys, Ile, Ser, and Val had very similar stimulating effects on a given AK activity. The extent of stimulation and the apparent affinity were higher for AK II than for AK I. As the activation resulted from a decrease in the apparent Km for the substrates ATP and Asp it could only be detected when activity measurements were carried out in the presence of low concentrations of substrates. In the first paper describing a Thr-sensitive AK from plant, Aarnes and Rognes (2Aarnes H. Rognes S.E. Phytochemistry. 1974; 13: 2717-2724Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), working on a partially purified enzyme fraction from pea leaf observed a 2-fold stimulation of the AK activity by 8 mm Ala, Val, or Ile (2Aarnes H. Rognes S.E. Phytochemistry. 1974; 13: 2717-2724Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Little attention was given to this result in later reviews about the regulation of the Asp-derived amino acid synthesis, probably because the activation factor was low and observed at a high concentration of activators. We are now able to explain why the activation factor was so low. Indeed, in their assay the authors used high concentrations of Asp (12 mm) and ATP (8 mm). Under these conditions the activating effect was partly masked. Together, the observation of Aarnes and Rognes (2Aarnes H. Rognes S.E. Phytochemistry. 1974; 13: 2717-2724Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) on the pea enzyme and our results on the recombinant A. thaliana enzymes suggest that the activation of Thr-sensitive AK may be a general feature in plants. In this respect plant AK-HSDH enzymes clearly differ from their bacterial equivalent. Indeed, Ser was shown to be an inhibitor of the E. coli Thr-sensitive AK activity (K0.5 = 25 mm (12Costrejean J.M. Truffa-Bachi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5332-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), rather than an activator, as observed here for the A. thaliana enzymes. The identification of novel ligands for Arabidopsis AK-HSDH enzymes raised the question of their binding mode on the enzyme. AK-HSDH enzymes are predicted to be formed of three domains, the AK and HSDH domains, separated by a regulatory domain (7Paris S. Viemon C. Curien G. Dumas R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5361-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the AK-HSDH II regulatory domain contains two non-equivalent threonine binding sites. Amino acid sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction allowed us to identify an amino acid in each subdomain (Gln443 and Gln524) potentially involved in the binding of Thr, the only known effector at this time. Steady-state kinetic analyses of Q443A and Q524A mutants showed that the AK activity of the Q443A mutant was not any more inhibited by Thr, whereas the AK activity of the Q524A mutant was inhibited as observed for the wild type (7Paris S. Viemon C. Curien G. Dumas R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5361-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Preliminary kinetic measurements (not shown) indicated that the allosteric stimulation by Ala was strongly reduced for both mutants of the AK-HSDH II regulatory domain. Thus both regulatory subdomains are involved in the allosteric activation. The two regulatory subdomains of AK-HSDH are repeated conserved motifs that belong to the ACT domain family (16Chipman D.M. Shaanan B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These domains are found associated with many allosteric enzymes involved in the amino acid metabolism. In this respect, the present results illustrate the remarkable plasticity of the ACT domains in their binding properties and their ability to control enzyme activities by activation and inhibition. The broad specificity observed for the control of the Arabidopsis AK-HSDH activities was surprising. We first checked whether some interactions could be synergistic (as observed for the Lys-sensitive plant AK that is synergistically inhibited by Lys and S-adenosylmethionine, (13Rognes S.E. Lea P.J. Miflin B.J. Nature. 1980; 287: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). As we could not detect any synergy between different effectors, one predicted that the relative abundance of the effectors determines their contributions to the control of the enzyme activity. We thus quantified the concentrations of the different allosteric effectors in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. The inhibitor Thr and the activator Ala proved to be much more abundant than the other allosteric effectors suggesting that Thr and Ala were the physiological effectors of the enzymes. In vitro kinetics in the simultaneous presence of the seven allosteric effectors confirmed this prediction. These experiments also showed that AK I and AK II were modulated by similar ranges of Thr or Ala concentrations. This was a priori non-obvious at the examination of the results in Fig. 2. Indeed, one may conclude from these results that AK I and AK II strongly differ with respect to their sensitivity to Ala. Indeed, AK I displayed much higher K0.5 values for the activators Ala than AK II. Also, the activation factor was lower than for AK II. However, results in Fig. 3 show that these quantitative differences observed when amino acids were tested in isolation were strongly attenuated when activities were measured in the simultaneous presence of the inhibitor Thr and the activator Ala. As AK I displayed a lower apparent affinity than AK II for both the activator and the inhibitor, the ratio of concentration rather than the absolute concentrations of Ala and Thr determined the output. It is interesting to observe from results in Fig. 3 that the other activators do contribute altogether to the activation of the enzyme. For example, in the presence of a physiological concentration of Thr (300 μm), the six allosteric activators together stimulate 25-fold the AK II activity. Sixty percent of this activation are because of the abundant amino acid Ala. Nevertheless, the other activators contribute to the remaining 40%. Whether this non-negligible contribution constitutes a noise in the regulatory processes that cannot be avoided or whether it has important physiological function remains to be determined. An interesting conclusion from this work is that the cellular context rather than the enzyme structure determines the specificity of the allosteric controls of Arabidopsis AK-HSDH enzyme activities. It is worth noting that the present conclusions are valid for Arabidopsis leaf chloroplasts. The conclusions might be different in a different tissue, under different environmental or developmental conditions leading to changes in the relative abundance of the seven allosteric effectors. AK I, AK II, and HSDH I activities are inhibited by physiological concentrations of Thr. However, one can conclude from our results that HSDH activities are not stringent control points by Thr. Indeed, in a reaction media that mimics the metabolic composition of the leaf chloroplast, half-inhibition of HSDH I occurs for a concentration of Thr 6-fold higher than that required for half-inhibition of AK I or AK II (600 versus 100 μm, compare Fig. 3, A and C). Also, molecular analyses using a GUS reporter-gene strategy suggested that the promoters of AK-HSDH I and AK-HSDH II were simultaneously active in different tissues of the plant (15Rognes S.E. Dewaele E. Aas S.F. Jacobs M. Frankard V. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and especially in the leaf. If AK-HSDH I and AK-HSDH II enzymes are indeed simultaneously expressed in the same compartment, and HSDH II is fully active at a physiological concentration of Thr, then HSDH activities are definitely not stringent control points by Thr. Note also that, although the inhibition of HSDH activities by Cys is more efficient than by Thr in vitro, the low abundance of this metabolite in vivo excludes a sensitive control of HSDH activities by Cys. Functional redundancy is frequently invoked to justify the existence of isoforms. The present analysis shows that the two enzymes are not exactly similar. First, one observed that AK I was about 4-fold less active than AK II when activity was measured in the presence of the seven allosteric effectors at their physiological concentration (see Fig. 3, A and B). Also, as shown in these figures, the response curve for Ala is shifted to slightly higher concentrations of Ala for AK I compared with AK II. Finally, the two isoforms strongly differ with respect to the control of the HSDH activity by Thr. Whether these differences have important physiological implications remains to be determined. Other levels of controls, which would affect the two isoforms differentially are not excluded. From a functional point of view, the existence of activators and inhibitors of an enzyme activity presents two advantages. First, it increases the sensitivity to small changes in the activator or the inhibitor concentrations. Second, as Ala not only displaces Thr but also activates the enzyme by itself, the existence of an activator and an inhibitor increases the range of enzyme activity for which control can be exercised. Additional function, if any, of the activation of plant AKs by Ala, remains obscure. In plants, after incorporation into glutamate, nitrogen is quickly distributed to other amino acids, much of it going directly to Ala and Asp via transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively (14Ireland R. Plant Metabolism. 1997; : 483Google Scholar). Ala is thus directly linked to the carbon and the nitrogen metabolisms of the cell. In this respect, Ala may be a feed-forward activator of the aspartate-derived amino acid pathway. Activation of AKs by Ala might couple the supply of carbon and nitrogen to the demand for Asp-derived amino acids synthesis. This is new information that might prove useful for understanding of the aspartate-derived amino acid metabolism in vivo and the improvement of crop quality.

https://openalex.org/W2088902184,"Bacteriophage T7 promoters contain a consensus sequence from -17 to +6 relative to the transcription start site, +1. In addition, the strong class III promoters are characterized by an extended AT-rich region upstream of -17, which is often interrupted by one or more GC base pairs in the weaker class II promoters. Herein we studied the role of the AT-rich region upstream of -17 in transcription regulation of T7 RNA polymerase. Equilibrium DNA binding studies with promoter fragments of consensus sequence truncated at various positions between -17 and -27 showed that the polymerase-promoter complex is significantly stabilized as the upstream AT-rich sequence is extended to and beyond -22. Similarly, promoters in which the AT-rich region from -17 to -22 is interrupted by several GC base pairs showed weak binding. Kinetic studies indicated that the presence of extended AT-rich sequence slows the dissociation rate constant of the polymerase-promoter complex and slightly stimulates the association rate constant, thereby increasing the stability of the complex. Measurement of the transcription activity revealed that the extended AT-rich region does not affect the kinetics of abortive synthesis up to the formation of 8-nucleotide RNA but causes accumulation of longer abortive products between 9 and 13 nucleotides. The observed effects of the upstream DNA region were AT sequence-specific, and the results suggested a larger role for the extended AT-rich sequence that has been unappreciated previously. We propose that the AT-rich DNA sequence upstream of -17 plays a role in modulating the efficiency of transcription initiation by affecting both the affinity of T7 RNA polymerase for the promoter and the efficiency of promoter clearance. Bacteriophage T7 promoters contain a consensus sequence from -17 to +6 relative to the transcription start site, +1. In addition, the strong class III promoters are characterized by an extended AT-rich region upstream of -17, which is often interrupted by one or more GC base pairs in the weaker class II promoters. Herein we studied the role of the AT-rich region upstream of -17 in transcription regulation of T7 RNA polymerase. Equilibrium DNA binding studies with promoter fragments of consensus sequence truncated at various positions between -17 and -27 showed that the polymerase-promoter complex is significantly stabilized as the upstream AT-rich sequence is extended to and beyond -22. Similarly, promoters in which the AT-rich region from -17 to -22 is interrupted by several GC base pairs showed weak binding. Kinetic studies indicated that the presence of extended AT-rich sequence slows the dissociation rate constant of the polymerase-promoter complex and slightly stimulates the association rate constant, thereby increasing the stability of the complex.

Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymerase2-AP2-aminopurinentnucleotideTAMRAtetramethylrhodamine. and T7 promoters constitute a model system for studying the protein-DNA interactions that occur during transcription as well as to understand the basic catalytic mechanism of DNA transcription. The 99-kDa single subunit enzyme of phage T7 shares many functional characteristics of transcription catalysis with multisubunit RNAPs despite lacking proteins structural similarities. T7 RNAP, without the assistance of accessory proteins, is capable of catalyzing all the fundamental transcription activities. The various crystal structures of T7 RNAP-promoter DNA complex provide deeper insights into the interactions that occur with the promoter as well as conformational changes in T7 RNAP that occur during promoter clearance (1Cheetham G.M.

The structure of T7 RNAP bound to a minimal promoter fragment shows that the specific recognition of T7 promoter involves both base-specific and nonspecific contacts with the 13 conserved promoter base pairs from -17 to -5. These include upstream contacts in the major groove of the specificity region of the promoter (-11 to -5) and in the minor groove of the AT-rich region of the promoter (-17 to -13) (1Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The base pairs from -4 to ∼+2 that include the initiation site (+1) are melted, and the single-stranded template DNA is plunged into the activity cleft of the T7 RNAP (1Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A.

The well defined class II and class III promoters of phage T7 share a consensus sequence from -17 to +6. Numerous studies have explored the role of promoter regions or specific base pairs within the highly conserved region (-17 to +1) of the T7 RNAP promoter (5Chapman K. Gunderson S.I. Anello M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of the DNA region upstream of base pair -17 is less understood, although some experimental evidences suggest the existence of polymerase-DNA contacts in the near region upstream of -17 (10Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Gunderson S.I. Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Enzymatic and chemical footprinting assays indicate that the upstream boundary of protection by T7 RNAP may extend up to -22 on the template strand and -17 on the non-template strand (10Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Gunderson S.I. Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This protection of the upstream AT-rich region around -20 by T7 RNAP is maintained in the initiation complex and at least up to the synthesis of 7-9-mer RNA (12Place C. Oddos J. Buc H. McAllister W.T. Buckle M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3474-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The conserved upstream DNA region from -17 to -20 is AT-affluent, and the region from -21 to -27 is homologous in the strong class III promoters (14Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequence of this region is variable among the weaker class II promoters, with one or more GC bp interrupting the AT run (14Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). By observing the salt-regulated transcriptional activity of T7 RNAP in vitro and the usage of promoters in vivo, McAllister and colleagues (15Jolliffe L.K. Carter A.D. McAllister W.T. Nature. 1982; 299: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16McAllister W.T. Carter A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4821-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) found that shortening this AT-rich region from 9 to 4 bp but keeping the integrity within the -13 to -17 region was sufficient to make a class III promoter act more like a weaker class II promoter. Promoter ϕ3.8 is the only class II promoter with uninterrupted AT runs from -13 to -22, and it behaves more like a class III promoter (14Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 15Jolliffe L.K. Carter A.D. McAllister W.T. Nature. 1982; 299: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the AT-rich region upstream of -17 may play a role in the control of promoter selection during T7 transcription in vivo. To investigate whether the AT-rich region upstream of -17 has an influence on the interactions of the promoter with T7 RNAP, we constructed a series of promoter fragments based on the class III promoter ϕ9 sequence with its upstream end truncated at different positions from -27 to -17 while leaving the consensus sequence downstream of -17 identical. The binding affinity of T7 RNAP for the promoter DNA fragments was measured by three different methods. Equilibrium binding was monitored using fluorescence anisotropy and 2-AP fluorescence, and stopped-flow association and dissociation kinetics were used to obtain the on and off rates for Kd determination. At the same time, the transcription activity of these promoter fragments was investigated by pre-steady-state assays. The results indicated an essential role for the upstream AT-rich region that was further investigated for physiological significance and for sequence-specific effects by studying of a natural class II promoter ϕ1.1B and a randomly chosen AT/GC-mixed sequence from the -18 to -22 position. T7 RNA Polymerase and Buffer—T7 RNAP was purified as described previously (17Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was calculated from its absorbance at 280 nm in 8 m urea using the molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105 m-1 cm-1 (19King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer 50 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol was used throughout the study. Oligodeoxynucleotides and Dye Coupling—Oligodeoxynucleotide strands were custom-synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). 2-AP was directly incorporated into the template strand during oligodeoxynucleotide synthesis. To make dye-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides, a terminal aminohexyl phosphate linker was incorporated at the 5′-end. The oligodeoxynucleotide was labeled with a succinimidyl ester of tetramethylrhodamine carboxylic acid (TAMRA) (Molecular Probes, Portland, OR). The dye-labeling reaction was performed in 100 mm fresh sodium carbonate buffer (pH 8.0) in the dark for ∼12 h at room temperature by mixing the oligodeoxynucleotide strand with a 10× excess of the dye that was freshly resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide. The large excess of the unreacted dye was removed by gelfiltration (Biogel P-6, Bio-Rad). The labeled strands were then purified using ∼14-16% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide = 19:1)/5 m urea gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 1× TBE buffer (18 cm wide × 32 cm long, constant voltage (400 V) for ∼7-8 h). Fluorophore-labeled strand migrated slower as a visibly discrete band from the unlabeled strand that moves faster and has to be visualized by UV shadowing. >95% pure oligodeoxynucleotide was recovered by electroelution followed by ethanol precipitation and storage in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) plus 1 mm EDTA in -20 °C. The labeling ratio was determined by comparing the absorbance at 260 and 560 nm for DNA and TAMRA, respectively. Contributions from the dye to the observed absorbance at 260 nm were corrected using the equation: Areal = Aobs - (Aλmax × CF). Aλmax represents the peak absorbance of TAMRA at 560 nm, and CF is the correction factor (0.38 for TAMRA). The coefficient used to calculate the concentrations of the dye is 91,000 m-1 cm-1. For each oligodeoxynucleotide strand, the coupling ratio of dye to DNA was determined to be very close to 1:1. Unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide strands were purified similarly. Double-stranded DNA was made by mixing two complementary strands in equimolar ratio for unlabeled double-stranded DNA or with a 5% excess of the non-fluorescent strand (the non-template strand in this study) for a singly labeled double-stranded DNA, heating to 70-80 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature over 2 h. Fluorescence Titrations with 2-AP DNA—Experiments were carried out at 25 °C as reported previously (20Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 2-AP was excited at 314 nm, and the emission fluorescence was collected at 376 nm. The blank-corrected fluorescence F was plotted as a function of total DNA concentration, [Dt]. The linear increase in the observed fluorescence at high [Dt] corresponding to free DNA fluorescence was then subtracted from F at each [Dt], and the data were replotted and fit to Equations 1 and 2 to obtain the Kd values, Fcorr=C+([Dt]-[ED])fD+[ED]fED(Eq. 1) where C is a constant and fD and fED are the fluorescence coefficients of 2-AP DNA (D) and T7 RNAP-DNA complex (ED), respectively. The concentration of ED, [ED], is defined by the quadratic Equation 2, ED=Kd+Et+Dt−Kd+Et+Dt2−4EtDt2(Eq. 2) where [Et] is the total concentration of the polymerase. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Equilibrium titrations using fluorescence anisotropy were performed at 25 °C on a PTI QM-3 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International) mounted with Glen-Thomson calcite prism polarizers in an L-format scheme. The titration was conducted by adding small aliquots of concentrated T7 RNAP to the solution of dye-labeled promoter DNA (20-50 nm). Fluorescence anisotropy of TAMRA (excitation = 555 nm, emission = 585 nm) was calculated from the vertical (Fvv) and horizontal (Fvh) polarized fluorescence intensities with a vertical excitation polarizer according to robs = (Fvv - GFvh)/(Fvv + 2GFvh). The grating correction factor G is measured from the ratio of the vertical (Fhv) and horizontal (Fhh) intensities from a horizontally polarized excitation. The mixed solution of DNA and enzyme was incubated in a 3-ml cuvette for ∼4 min before taking 10 measurements of fluorescence anisotropy to obtain an averaged value of fluorescence anisotropy robs. The observed anisotropy robs is contributed both by free DNA (with anisotropy rf) and from protein-bound DNA (with anisotropy rb), robs=rbfb+rf(1-fb)(Eq. 3) where fb is the fraction of DNA in the form of T7 RNAP complex, fb = [ED]/[Dt]. The increase in fluorescence anisotropy as a function of increasing T7 RNAP concentration was fit by the least-squares method to the quadratic Equation 2 to obtain the dissociation constant, Kd. The starting anisotropy of attached TAMRA prior to binding was slightly below 0.18 and constant for all promoter fragments. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Measurements—The apparent rates of association were measured from the time-dependent increase in 2-AP fluorescence after rapidly mixing the 2-AP promoter fragments (final concentration of 100 nm) with excess T7 RNAP (final concentration of 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 nm) at 25 °C using a KinTek 2000 stopped-flow setup as described previously (17Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The observed rates were plotted as a function of T7 RNAP concentration, and the association rate constant (kon) was determined from the slopes. In the displacement assay, 2 μm (final concentration) non-fluorescent bubble DNA was mixed with 100 nm 1:1 preformed complex of 2-AP DNA and T7 RNAP at 25 °C using the same KinTek 2000 stopped-flow setup. The dissociation of the complex was monitored by following the time-dependent decrease of 2-AP fluorescence. The 2-AP signals in both measurements were collected using a 360-nm cut-off filter with excitation at 315 nm. The averaged time courses were fit to a single or double exponential Equation 4, Fobs=Constant+∑i=1n=1or2αiexp(-kit)(Eq. 4) where αi is the amplitude and ki is the rate constant (s-1) of each component. Pre-steady-state Transcription Assay—The pre-steady-state kinetics of RNA synthesis were measured at 25 °C using a rapid chemical quench-flow instrument fitted with a temperature-controlled water bath (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). T7 RNAP (15 μm final) and promoter fragment (10 μm final) preincubated in high salt buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol) from one syringe was mixed with all four riboNTPs (500 μm each) spiked with [γ-32P]GTP in low salt buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol) from the second syringe at equal volumes (25 μl). The reactions were quenched at selected time intervals from 50 ms to 25 s by rapidly mixing with 200 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) from a third syringe. As a control for zero time, EDTA was added to the T7 RNAP-DNA solution before adding riboNTPs (+[γ-32P]GTP). The samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in sequencing gel loading buffer containing formamide. The RNA products were resolved on 23% polyacrylamide/4 m urea sequencing gels and electrophoresed in 1.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 95 W (50 °C). The gel was exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon 9410 instrument (Amersham Biosciences), and the RNA products were quantitated using the ImageQuant program. Promoter DNA Fragments—The class III promoters contain an extended AT-rich sequence that spans from -13 to -20 or up to -22. In the ϕ9 promoter sequence, the AT-rich region extends to -21. The longest promoter fragment we used in this study was derived from the promoter ϕ9 truncated upstream at -27 (P-27). Several successive upstream truncated fragments at various positions were similarly used in the study. These promoter fragments are named according to their most upstream base pair: P-27, P-24, P-22, P-21, and P-17. TABLE ONE shows the 5′- → 3′-sequence of non-template strand of these DNA fragments.TABLE ONEPromoter DNA sequencesNameDNA sequence of synthetic non-template strand (5′ → 3′)–27+1P-27GCCGGGAATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTCATCTTTGAAP-24GGGAATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTCATCTTTGAAP-22GAATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTCATCTTTGAAP-21AATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTCATCTTTGAAP-17TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTCATCTTTGAAmP-22CAGTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTCATCTTTGAAmP1.1B-22CCGGTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTCATCTTTGAA Open table in a new tab Affinity of T7 RNAP for the Promoter Fragments—Two fluorescence-based approaches have been used in the literature to measure the affinity of T7 RNAP for the promoter fragments (17Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Mol.

Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One method is based on the measurement of the fluorescence intensity changes of 2-AP incorporated at the -4 or -2 position in the template strand upon binding to T7 RNAP. The free 2-AP base in aqueous solution is highly fluorescent, but its fluorescence is quenched in double-stranded DNA, and the fluorescence signal is also highly dependent on the extent of base stacking with the neighboring bases in the DNA. When 2-AP is incorporated at position -4 in the template strand of a T7 promoter DNA fragment, maximal signals of fluorescence changes are obtained upon formation of the T7 RNAP-promoter DNA open complex (23Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) due to base unstacking of the -4 adenine from the neighboring guanine at position -5 (24Kelley S.O. Barton J.K. Science. 1999; 283: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The second method is based on the measurement of fluorescence anisotropy changes of TAMRA tethered to -22. The formation of T7 RNAP-promoter complex can be followed with a high sensitivity by monitoring the fluorescence anisotropy changes of DNA-attached TAMRA resulting from the slower global tumbling motion of the protein-DNA complexes relative to unliganded DNA (22Ujvari A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we used both methods to measure the affinity of T7 RNAP for the various promoter fragments. Equilibrium DNA binding titrations can be carried out in two ways. One can titrate a fixed amount of promoter DNA with increasing concentrations of T7 RNAP (forward titration) or titrate a fixed concentration of T7 RNAP with increasing concentrations of the promoter DNA (reverse titration). Titrations with 2-AP-modified promoters have been carried out in both ways (17Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Ujvari A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In practice, however, when using 2-AP DNA, the forward titration provides a low signal change. This is primarily due to the high fluorescence background from free T7 RNAP, which masks the increase in 2-AP fluorescence as a result of complex formation. In contrast, the reverse titration provides a sensitive measurement of 2-AP DNA binding because the fluorescence of 2-AP in the unbound DNA is much weaker than the 2-AP fluorescence increase that results upon complex formation. Therefore, equilibrium titrations with the 2-AP promoter fragments were carried out by titrating T7 RNAP (100 nm) with increasing concentrations of 2-AP DNA fragments (20Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1a. Equilibrium DNA binding assays by the anisotropy method were carried out using forward titrations. The probe TAMRA was attached on the 5′-end of the template strand via a C6 amino linker at position +19, which is believed to be far away from specifically bound RNAP on the promoter upstream. To minimize quenching effect due to a neighboring guanine base, the downstream terminal GC bp in all the fragments was modified to TA. We observed similar binding of P-22 irrespective of whether TAMRA was present at the 5′-end of the template strand or the 5′-end of the non-template strand, that is, at the downstream or the upstream end of the duplex DNA. 3G.-Q. Tang and S. S. Patel, unpublished results. Similarly, the same binding affinity was reported previously when TAMRA was incorporated at the 3′-end of the template strand at position -22 via a C3 amino linker (22Ujvari A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The extrinsic label at the -22 position therefore does not appear to affect the binding affinity of the complex. Each DNA duplex contained only a single attached dye as determined by UV-visible absorbance measurements. In all titrations, the mixture of T7 RNAP and DNA was incubated for at least 4-6 min prior to data acquisition. After correction of blank, experimental data were least-squares fitted to the quadratic equation to determine the values of Kd. A typical plot of TAMRA anisotropy measurement is shown in Fig. 1b. TABLE TWO summarizes the Kd values of the promoter fragments obtained from the two types of titrations. The results show that the extended promoter fragments with a longer AT-rich sequence bind to T7 RNAP with a greater affinity relative to the minimal P-17 promoter fragment. This trend of stabilization becomes more obvious when the Kd values are plotted versus the length of upstream extension (Fig. 2). T7 RNAP binds the P-17 promoter, which has a half-truncated AT-rich region, with a Kd of ∼60 nm, which is generally in agreement with previous estimates of a weak binding affinity for promoter DNA fragments truncated at -17 based on DNase I footprinting protection and gel-shift assays (20-55 nm) (5Chapman K. Gunderson S.I. Anello M. Wells R. Burgess R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4511-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5413-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15715-15725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but is significantly larger than ∼4 nm obtained from the forward titration of 2-AP DNA (21Ujvari A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recovery of the full AT-rich region helps to stabilize the complex of T7 RNAP such as with P-21. Although the 2-AP fluorescence assay showed a decreased Kd of ∼39 nm for P-21, the stabilization was more substantial when measured by the anisotropy assay, resulting in a Kd of ∼16 nm for P-21. Both binding assays showed that the T7 RNAP-DNA complex is more stable when the promoter region is extended to -22 (∼17 nm from the 2-AP assay and ∼4 nm from the TAMRA anisotropy assay). Similar stabilization was observed whether the -22 bp was GC or AT, suggesting no sequence-specific interaction with T7 RNAP at this position. Further extension from -22 to -27 had little effect on the Kd values as evaluated from the TAMRA anisotropy assays. These studies indicated that P-22 is the minimal promoter fragment that shows optimal binding interactions with T7 RNAP. To investigate whether the observed stabilization due to extension beyond -17 was AT sequence-specific, we replaced the -18 to -22 with a randomly chosen sequence (60% GC content, modified P-22 or mP-22). The mP-22 DNA bound to T7 RNAP with a significantly decreased affinity relative to P-22, and in fact, its affinity was close to that of P-17. Therefore, the stabilization effect of the extended promoters observed above appeared to be due to the AT-rich sequence. To investigate the physiological significance of this result, we chose the upstream sequence of a natural class II promoter ϕ1.1B that contains a relatively GC-rich upstream sequence. The synthesized promoter was identical to the consensus class III promoters from -17 to +2 for comparison but contained the 1.1B-specific sequence in the -22 to +2 region (TABLE ONE, mP1.1B-22). The binding affinity of mP1.1B-22 DNA was measured by anisotropy titrations, and these experiments showed that mP1.1B-22 binding is significantly weakened to the level of mP-22 and P-17 DNAs. These results strongly supported a role for the upstream AT-rich region in modulating T7 promoter strength.TABLE TWOEffect of the upstream AT-region on T7 RNAP-promoter interactions Errors from two or more independent measurements are included in both Kd columns.

https://openalex.org/W2139403670,"Jerdostatin represents a novel RTS-containing short disintegrin cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from the venom gland mRNA of the Chinese Jerdons pit viper Trimeresurus jerdonii. The jerdostatins precursor cDNA contained a 333-bp open reading frame encoding a signal peptide, a pre-peptide, and a 43-amino acid disintegrin domain, whose amino acid sequence displayed 80% identity with that of the KTS-disintegrins obtustatin and viperistatin. The jerdostatin cDNA structure represents the first complete open reading frame of a short disintegrin and points to the emergence of jerdostatin from a short-coding gene. The different residues between jerdostatin and obtustatin/viperistatin are segregated within the integrin-recognition loop and the C-terminal tail. Native jerdostatin (r-jerdostatin-R21) and a R21K mutant (r-jerdostatin-K21) were produced in Escherichia coli. In each case, two conformers were isolated. One-dimensional 1H NMR showed that conformers 1 and 2 of r-jerdostatin-R21 represent, respectively, well folded and unfolded proteins. The two conformers of the wild-type and the R21K mutant inhibited the adhesion of α1-K562 cells to collagen IV with IC50 values of 180 and 703 nm, respectively. The IC50 values of conformers 2 of r-jerdostatin-R21 and r-jerdostatin-K21 were, respectively, 5.95 and 12.5 μm. Neither r-jerdostatin-R21 nor r-jerdostatin-K21 showed inhibitory activity toward other integrins, including αIIbβ3, αvβ3, α2β1, α5β1, α4β1, α6β1, and α9β1 up to a concentration of 24 μm. Although the RTS motif appears to be more potent than KTS inhibiting the α1β1 integrin, r-jerdostatin-R21 is less active than the KTS-disintegrins, strongly suggesting that substitutions outside the integrin-binding motif and/or C-terminal proteolytic processing are responsible for the decreased inhibitory activity.

The integrin family of cell adhesion proteins promotes the attachment and migration of cells on the surrounding extracellular matrix (1Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H.

Through signals transduced upon integrin ligation by extracellular matrix proteins, several integrins play key roles in promoting angiogenesis and tumor metastasis (3Danen E.H. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, although antagonists of several integrins (e.g. α5β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5, the primary targets of endostatin, an endogenous negative regulator of angiogenesis (4Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E.

Thus, the integrins α1β1 and α2β1 are highly up-regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor in cultured endothelial cells, resulting in an enhanced α1β1- and α2β1-dependent cell spreading on collagen and it has been reported that these integrins provide critical support for vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, endothelial cell migration, and tumor angiogenesis (9Senger D.R.

The α1β1 and α2β1 integrins are highly expressed on the microvascular endothelial cells, and blocking of their adhesive properties by monoclonal antibodies (9Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Streit M.

Moreover, null-mice lacking integrin α1β1 develop normally, but exhibit reduced vascularity of the skin (9Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Streit M. Koteliansky V.E. De Fougerolles A.R. Detmar M. Am. J.

Ongoing studies with α2 knock-out mice also suggest a critical role in angiogenesis for the α2β1 integrins (13Mercurio A.M. Am. J.

Thus, inhibitors of the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins alone or in combination with antagonists of other integrins involved in angiogenesis may prove beneficial in the control of tumor neovascularization. α1β1 and α2β1 belong to the I-domain bearing subfamily of integrins, and specifically interact with collagen (15White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, despite sharing large structural homology, these two integrins have distinct collagen binding preferences: α1β1 integrin is a very selective receptor of basement membrane type IV collagen, whereas α2β1 is highly specific for fibrillar collagen types I-III (16Dickeson S.K.

Substitution of the cytoplasmic domains of the α1 and α2 subunits in transfected human mammary epithelial cells revealed that the two integrins participate in different signal transduction pathways (18Klekotka P.A.

Noteworthy, the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins are the targets of snake venom toxins belonging to different protein families. C-type lectin-like proteins include selective and potent (i.e. EMS16 from Echis multisquamatus;IC50 = 6nm) inhibitors of α2β1 (19Wang R. Kini R.M. Chung M.C.M.

The crystal structure of EMS16 in complex with the integrin α2 I-domain has provided insight into the structural basis of the integrin inhibitory specificity of this C-type lectin protein (23Horii K. Okuda D. Morita T. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the primary α1β1 binding motif of obtustatin and viperistatin is a KTS tripeptide located in a lateral position of the mobile disintegrins active loop (24Moreno-Murciano M.P.

Now, we report the molecular cloning, primary structure, recombinant expression, and integrin inhibitory characteristics of two conformers of jerdostatin, an RTS-containing disintegrin from the Chinese Jerdon pit viper Trimeresurus jerdonii, and of a R21K mutant.

Highly purified human fibrinogen was a gift from Dr. A. Budzynski (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). Recombinant human VCAM-1/Ig was a generous gift of Dr. Roy R. Lobb (Biogen). Human fibronectin and laminin were purchased from Sigma. ExTaq® DNA polymerase, dNTP, and DNA marker were from TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian).

K562 and Jurkat cell lines, which express α5β1 and α4β1 integrins, respectively, were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). PCR Amplification of Jerdostatin cDNA—The T. jerdonii venom glands were collected from Yiliang, Yunnan, China. Isolation of mRNA and reverse transcription was conducted using the PolyATtract System 1000 kit and Reverse Transcription System kit, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols. DNA was amplified by PCR using total reverse transcriptase-PCR products as template. The forward primer, 5′-CCAAATCCAG(C/T)CTCCAAAATG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-TTCCA(G/T)CTCCATTGTTG(G/T)TTA-3′, were designed according to the highly conserved 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of the cDNAs encoding for elegantin-2a from Trimeresurus elegans (GenBank® accession number AB059572), elegantin-1a from T. elegans (GenBank accession number AB059571), and HR2a from Trimeresurus flavoviridis (27Yamada D. Shin Y. Morita T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The PCR amplification protocol included 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The recovered PCR products were cloned into PMD18-T vector (TaKaRa), and then transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109. The white transformants were screened by PCR and the positive clones were subjected to sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencing system. Generation of r-Jerdostatin R21K Mutant—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed essentially as described in the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). To this end, plasmid pET-32a containing the wild-type jerdostatin sequence flanked by NcoI and XhoI restriction sites was used as the template in the PCR (denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 12 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (60 s at 55 °C), and extension (12 min at 68 °C), and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C) using the forward primer 5′-GGAACAACATGCTGGAAAACCAGTGTATCAAGTCATTACTGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACTTGATACACTGGTTTTCCAGCATGTTGTTCCTGCCGGC-3′ in which the Arg codon AGA has been substituted AAA (Lys) (in boldface). The mutant DNA was sequenced to confirm the absence of undesired mutations. Synthetic Peptides—Individual peptides and a library of peptides representing the entire integrin-recognition loop of obtustatin but differing in the residue at a single position (19CX1KTSLTSHYC29; CWX2TSLTSHYC; etc., where Xn is an equimolar mixture of all amino acids except cysteine) were prepared by manual simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis using standard N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry as described (28Pastor M.T.

The mixtures at positions “X” were incorporated by coupling a mixture of 19 L-amino acids (cysteine was omitted), with the relative ratio suitability adjusted to yield close to equimolar incorporation. The quality of the synthesized peptide mixtures was validated by mass spectrometry. Individual peptides were purified by preparative reverse phase-HPLC. Peptide identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The following molar absorption coefficients (ϵ) at 280 nm were used for quantification of peptide mixtures (29Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar): ϵ for the control peptide CWKTSLTSHYC = 5600 (Trp) + 1500 (Tyr) = 7100 m-1 cm-1; ϵ for the peptide library CX2KTSLTSHYC = 1500 + (1/19 × 5600) + (1/19 × 1500) = 1873.7 m-1 cm-1; for peptide libraries with X at positions 2-8, ϵ = 5600 + 1500 + (1/19 × 5600) + (1/19 × 1500) = 7473.7 m-1 cm-1; and ϵ for the peptide library CWKTSLTSHX9C = 5600 + (1/19 × 5600) + (1/19 × 1500) = 5973.7 m-1 cm-1. Purification of KTS-disintegrins—Obtustatin and viperistatin were purified from the venoms of V. lebetina obtusa and V. palestinae, respectively, using the previously described two-step reversed-phase HPLC (11Marcinkiewicz C.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The purity of the disintegrins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The monoisotopic masses of the purified disintegrins were determined either by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole-ion trap hybrid instrument (QTrap from Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nanospray source (Protana, Denmark) or by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) using an Applied Biosystems DE-Pro spectrometer, operated in delayed extraction and reflector modes, and α-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile as the matrix. A tryptic peptide mixture of Cratylia floribunda seed lectin (SwissProt accession code P81517) prepared and previously characterized in our laboratory was used as a mass calibration standard (mass range 450-3300 Da). For determination of isotope-averaged molecular masses, the instrument was operated in the linear mode using 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) saturated in 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the matrix. The mass calibration standard consisted of a mixture of the following proteins, whose isotope-averaged molecular mass in daltons are given in parentheses: bovine insulin (5,734.6), E. coli thioredoxin (11,674.5), and horse apomyoglobin (16,952.6). Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein quantification kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard, or by amino acid analysis (after hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C in air-evacuated and sealed ampoules) using a Biochrom (Amersham Biosciences) amino acid analyzer. Cloning and Production of Recombinant r-Jerdostatin-Thioredoxin-His6 Fusion Proteins—The jerdostatin cDNA coding for wild-type and R21K fragments were amplified by PCR using primers synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Haverhill, UK). The forward primer was 5′-CGTGCCATGGATTGTACAACTGGACCATG-3′, which contained a NcoI restriction site (underlined) and the sequence coding for the first six residues of the protein. The reverse primer was 5′-GCCTCGAGTATTAGCCATTCCCGGGATAAC-3′, which includes a restriction site for XhoI (underlined), a stop codon (in italics and bold), and the last six C-terminal residues of jerdostatin. The PCR protocol included denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (10 s at 94 °C), annealing (15 s at 55 °C), and extension (20 s at 72 °C), and a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. The amplified fragments were purified using the Perfect Pre Gel Clean Up kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and cloned in a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). E. coli DH5α cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) were transformed by electroporation using an Eppendorf 2510 electroporator following the manufacturer's instructions. Positive clones, selected by growing the transformed cells in Luria broth (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicilin, were confirmed by PCR amplification using the above primers, and the PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced (using an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencer) to check the correctness of the sequences of the wild-type and the R21K jerdostatins open reading frame. To construct an expression vector of jerdostatin-thioredoxin-His6 wild-type and mutated fusion proteins the pGEM-T-jerdostatin plasmid and a pET32a vector (Novagen) were digested with NcoI and XhoI for 12 h at 37 °C and the 132-bp jerdostatin fragments and the pET32a vector were purified after agarose gel electrophoresis with the Eppendorf Perfect Pre Gel Clean Up kit. The jerdostatin fragments and the open pET32a vector were ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) overnight at 13 °C. These constructs were used to transform electrocompetent E. coli DH5α cells. The plasmidic DNAs from positive clones were used to transform (by electroporation) E. coli Origami® B cells (Novagen). Another pool of cells were transformed with mock pET32a plasmid and used as negative control for the recombinant expression of jerdostatin-thioredoxin fusion protein. Recombinant Expression of Jerdostatin-Thioredoxin-His6 Fusion Proteins—Positive E. coli Origami B clones, shown by PCR to contain the jerdostatin-thioredoxin fusion constructs, wild-type or R21K mutant, were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, 33 μg/ml of kanamycin, and 12 μg/ml of tetracyclin, followed by a 1:10 (v/v) dilution in the same medium. For the induction of the expression of the recombinant fusion proteins, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cell suspensions were incubation for another 7 h at 37°C. Thereafter, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in the same volume of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, washed three times with the same buffer, and resuspended in 100 ml/liter of initial cell culture of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The cells were lyzed by sonication (15 cycles of 15 s sonication followed by 1 min resting) in an ice bath. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the soluble and the insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purification of Recombinant Jerdostatin Molecules—The jerdostatin-thioredoxin-His6 fusion proteins, wild-type and R21K mutant, were purified from the soluble fraction of positive E. coli Origami clone, the lysate was purified by affinity chromatography using an ÄKTA Basic chromatograph equipped with a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, buffer. After absorbance at 280 nm of the flow-through fraction reached baseline, the bound material was eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min with a linear gradient of 10-500 mm imidazole for 60 min. The purified protein fractions (checked by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and digested with 0.25 units of enterokinase (Invitrogen) per mg of recombinant protein. The reaction mixture was freed from enterokinase by chromatography on a 0.5-ml column of agarose-trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Jerdostatin was separated from thioredoxin-His6 by chromatography of the agarose-trypsin-inhibitor non-bound fraction on a HisTrap column (as above), and the nonbound and retarded fractions, both containing jerdostatin, were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC followed by size-exclusion chromatography using an ÄKTA Basic chromatograph equipped with a Superdex Peptide column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with phosphate-buffered saline buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The purity of the isolated proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE, reverse-phase HPLC, N-terminal sequence analysis (using an Applied Biosystems Procise instrument), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described above for the KTS-disintegrins, and nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a QTrap instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Proxeon, Denmark). Protein concentration of purified recombinant jerdostatin was determined spectrophotometrically using an ϵ at 280 nm of 10,677 m-1 cm-1 calculated by amino acid analysis as above. In-gel Tryptic Digestion and Mass Fingerprinting—The recombinant expression of the jerdostatin-thioredoxin-His6 fusion proteins and the purification of r-jerdostatin molecules were monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass fingerprinting. To this end, SDS-PAGE separated polypeptides were subjected to automated digestion with sequencing grade bovine pancreatic trypsin (Roche) at a final concentration of 20 ng/μlof 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, using a ProGest digestor (Genomic Solutions) following the manufacturer's instructions. Digestions were done with prior reduction with dithiothreitol (10 mm for 15 min at 65 °C) and carbamidomethylation with iodoacetamide (50 mm for 60 min at room temperature). The tryptic peptide mixtures were freed from reagents using a C18 Zip-Tip pipette tip (Millipore) activated with 70% acetonitrile and equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Following protein adsorption and washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the proteins were eluted with 3 μl of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For mass fingerprinting analysis, 0.85 μl of the digests were spotted onto a MALDI-TOF sample holder, mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried, and analyzed with an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE Pro MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, operated in delayed extraction and reflector modes, as above. The peptide mass fingerprint obtained from each electrophoretic band was compared with the expected proteolytic digest of the fusion protein using the program PAWS. 5Proteometrics, available at prowl.rockefeller.edu. Collision-induced Dissociation by Tandem Mass Spectrometry—For peptide sequencing, the protein digest mixture was subjected to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis using a QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Protana, Denmark). Doubly charged ions selected after Enhanced Resolution MS analysis were fragmented using the Enhanced Product Ion with the Q0 trapping option at 250 atomic mass units/s across the entire mass range. For MS/MS experiments, Q1 was operated at unit resolution, the Q1 to Q2 collision energy was set to 35 eV, the Q3 entry barrier was 8 V, the linear ion trap Q3 fill time was 250 ms, and the scan rate in Q3 was 1000 atomic mass units/s. Collision-induced dissociation spectra were interpreted manually or using the on-line form of the MASCOT program. 6www.matrixscience.com. Quantitation of Free Cysteine Residues and Disulfide Bonds—For quantitation of free cysteine residues and disulfide bonds (30Juárez P. Sanz L. Calvete J.J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the purified proteins dissolved in 10 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 9.0, 5 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 1 mm EDTA) were heat denatured at 85 °C for 15 min, allowed to cool at room temperature, and incubated with either 10 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature, or with 10 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol (Sigma) for 15 min at 80 °C, followed by addition of iodoacetamide at 25 mm final concentration and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Carbamidomethylated proteins were freed from reagents using a C18 Zip-Tip pipette tip (Millipore) after activation with 70% acetonitrile and equilibration in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Following protein adsorption and washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the PE-proteins were eluted onto the MALDI-TOF plate with 1 μl of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis as above. The number of free cysteine residues (NSH) was determined using Equation 1, NSH=(M1A-MNAT)/57.05(Eq. 1) where MIA is the mass of the denatured but nonreduced protein incubated in the presence of iodoacetamide; MNAT is the mass of the native, HPLC-isolated protein; and 57.05 is the mass increment because of the carbamidomethylation of one thiol group. The number of total cysteine residues (NCys) can be calculated from Equation 2, NCys=(MCM-MNAT)/57.05(Eq. 2) where MCM is the mass (in Da) of the reduced and carbamidomethylated protein. Finally, the number of disulfide bonds NS-S can be calculated from Equation 3. NS-S=(Ncys-NSH)/2(Eq. 3) Cell Adhesion Studies—Adhesion studies of cultured cells labeled with 5-chloromethyl fluorescein diacetate were performed essentially as described (31Marcinkiewicz C.

The cellular functions of the class II enzymes are incompletely understood, though they have been implicated in receptor activation pathways initiated by epidermal growth factor, insulin, and chemokines. PI3K-C2α was recently found to be localized to clathrin-coated membranes in the trans-Golgi network and at endocytic sites on the plasma membrane. Further, a specific binding site was identified for clathrin on the N terminus of PI3K-C2α, whose occupancy resulted in lipid kinase activation. Expression of PI3K-C2α in cells dramatically affected clathrin distribution and function in cells, leading to accumulation of intracellular clathrin-coated structures, which are visualized here at the ultrastructural level, and inhibition of clathrin-mediated transport from both the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network. In this study we have demonstrated that the isolated clathrin binding domain of PI3K-C2α can drive clathrin lattice assembly and that both it and the lipid kinase activity of the protein can independently modulate clathrin distribution and function when expressed in cells. Together, these results suggest that PI3K-C2α employs both protein-protein interaction and localized production of 3-phosphoinositides to affect clathrin dynamics at sites of membrane budding and targeting.

Together, these results suggest that PI3K-C2α employs both protein-protein interaction and localized production of 3-phosphoinositides to affect clathrin dynamics at sites of membrane budding and targeting. It is well established that both cargo and informational movement across the plasma membrane, as well as certain aspects of intercellular signaling, involve vesicular transport initiated by endocytosis from clathrin-coated pits. The machinery of endocytosis has been extensively studied, and its complexity would seem to reflect the challenge of providing a highly efficient yet controllable interface between the environment and the cell (1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). In addition to the structural protein clathrin, numerous other receptor binding adaptors are present, as are proteins involved in membrane curvature, detachment, coat dissociation, and recycling; these include AP-2 and other adaptors, epsin, dynamin, synaptojanin, and others (reviewed in Refs. 2Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 3Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

How the functions of these factors are controlled in space and time during the lifetime of the coated pit and the initial phase of the endocytic process remains a major challenge to our understanding. It has recently become apparent that membrane lipids, and specifically phosphoinositides, play major roles in the coordination of these processes. There is considerable evidence for an important regulatory role of phosphoinositide lipids in membrane traffic between multiple intracellular compartments. In the endocytic pathway, phosphoinositides were initially demonstrated to bind with high affinity to the plasma membrane adaptor AP-2 and to modulate its properties (6Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4437-4441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have confirmed these observations and demonstrated the interaction of phosphoinositides with other proteins involved in clathrin-mediated trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 8Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton has also been strongly implicated in the function of the endocytic machinery (9Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 287-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 10Guilherme A. Soriano N.A. Bose S. Holik J. Bose A. Pomerleau D.P. Furcinitti P. Leszyk J. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Thus there is considerable in vitro evidence for roles of both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and 3-phosphorylated inositides in membrane trafficking, and the identity of many of the targets to which they bind has now been established. To dissect the spatiotemporal aspects of these interactions in the modulation of endocytic and cytoskeletal function, it is critical to identify and study the enzymes responsible for inositide metabolism at specific sites of action. We have recently shown that a specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2α (PI3K-C2α) 3The abbreviations used are: PI3K-C2αphosphoinositide 3-kinase C2αTGNtrans-Golgi networkCBDclathrin binding domainWTwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: PI3K-C2αphosphoinositide 3-kinase C2αTGNtrans-Golgi networkCBDclathrin binding domainWTwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a component of the clathrin-mediated transport machinery at the plasma membrane and in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (14Domin J.

PI3K-C2α is a member of the class II PI 3-kinases and is distinguished from other PI 3-kinases by its additional C-terminal C2 domain (15Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13304-13307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Three distinct mammalian members of the class II PI 3-kinase family have been characterized (17Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), PI3K-C2α, PI3K-C2β, and PI3K-C2γ. Although all share the distinguishing C-terminal C2 domain as well as the characteristic 3-kinase motifs, the enzymes differ predominantly in their N-terminal regions. The cellular functions of class II enzymes are not well understood, though there is evidence that PI3K-C2β, and to a lesser extent PI3K-C2α, can be stimulated by activation of several receptor systems including epidermal growth factor (18Arcaro A.

Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and integrins (21Paulhe F. Perret B. Chap H. Iberg N. Morand O. Racaud-Sultan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); the former is also implicated in cell adhesion and movement (22Maffucci T. Cooke F.T. Foster F.M. Traer C.J. Fry M.J. Falasca M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By analogy with the Class I PI 3-kinase family, it has been suggested that activation of class II enzymes by signaling receptors may mediate specific aspects of downstream receptor activity. In vivo evidence for this possibility has recently been reported in studies of the single Class II PI 3-kinase in Drosophila melanogaster, PI3K-68D, which demonstrated its involvement in patterning processes involving the epidermal growth factor and Notch receptor pathways (23MacDougall L.K. Gagou M.E. Leevers S.J. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 796-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal region of PI3K-68D more closely resembles that of mammalian PI3K-C2β, consistent with the receptor-mediated signaling role for this family member implied by the studies in mammalian cells noted above. phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2α trans-Golgi network clathrin binding domain wild type glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2α trans-Golgi network clathrin binding domain wild type glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. In addition to localizing PI3K-C2α to endocytic and TGN clathrin-coated membranes (14Domin J. Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Keen J.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11943-11950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we found that PI3K-C2α is enzymatically activated by clathrin through binding to a discrete clathrin binding domain (CBD) present in the unique N-terminal region of the protein (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Exogenous expression of PI3K-C2α in cells dramatically affected both clathrin distribution and function. Although plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits could still be observed, PI3K-C2α expression induced a striking accumulation of intracellular clathrin staining consistent with the presence of numerous cytoplasmic clathrin-coated structures. Such structures, distinct from those in the TGN, are virtually undetectable in control cells (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 25Santini F. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inhibition of clathrin-mediated transport from both the plasma membrane and TGN was also observed under these conditions. It should be noted that the proliferation of uniform, punctate intracellular clathrin signal under these conditions was quite distinct from the aggregates of clathrin in granules that have been observed upon expression of dominant-negative forms of other clathrin-binding proteins such as auxilin or AP180 (26Zhao X. Greener T. Al-Hasani H. Cushman S.W. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 353-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the ubiquitous roles played by many different phosphoinositides in membrane trafficking, clathrin binding and activation of PI3K-C2α suggests a possible mechanism for the localized and timed formation of 3-phosphoinositides at sites of membrane budding during endocytosis or Golgi transport. This notion is supported by the observation that both PI3K-C2α overexpression (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and the putatively reciprocal knockout of synaptojanin phosphatase activity (27Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) result in the accumulation of unusual intracellular clathrin-coated structures, together suggesting defects in the coat recycling pathway. Elucidation of PI3K-C2α function under these conditions can be expected to provide insight into the mechanisms by which phosphoinositides regulate these aspects of membrane trafficking. To provide a basis for understanding PI3K-C2α function in cells, we report here an analysis of the roles of the CBD and of the lipid kinase activity in modulating PI3K-C2α effects on clathrin behavior in cells. Interestingly, we found that both the enzymatic and the clathrin binding activities of PI3K-C2α play distinct and apparently independent roles in regulating clathrin distribution and function. Constructs—Glu-tagged full-length and (Δ1-142) human PI3K-C2α in pMT-SM have been described (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The regions of PI3K-C2α cDNA corresponding to constructs noted in Fig. 1A were cloned into SmaI-EcoRI sites of pMT-SM (Sigma) with a Glu tag at the 5′-end (14Domin J. Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Keen J.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11943-11950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, pMT-SM-KD PI3K-C2α and pMT-SM-KD-(143-1686) (ΔCBD/KD) were generated in which Lys-1138, Asp-1157, and Asp-1250 were mutated to Ala. For generation of stable cell lines, cDNAs encoding WT- and KD-PI3K-C2α were cloned into SacII-EcoRI sites of pTRE (Clontech). Assay of PI 3-Kinase Activity—COS1 cells transfected with WT- or KD-PI3K-C2α were analyzed as described previously (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA. Clarified lysates (75,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C, TLA 100 rotor) were then immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the Glu epitope (Research Diagnostics, Inc.), and equivalent amounts (assayed by anti-Glu immunoblotting) of immunoprecipitate were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity. Sonicated phosphatidylinositol (200 μm) was preincubated with immunoprecipitated protein sample for 10 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA. The kinase reaction was initiated upon addition of 4 mm MgCl2 and 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, lipids were extracted with acidified chloroform/methanol, analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using silica-gel-60 plates and chloroform/methanol/4 m ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2, v/v/v), and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Electron Microscopy—MEF Tet-Off cells (Clontech), stably co-transfected with pTK-Hyg and pTRE-PI3K-C2α or pTRE-KD, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml G418, 150 μg/ml hygromycin, and 1 μg/ml doxycycline. One week after removing doxycycline, PI3K-C2α and KD expressing MEF Tet-Off cells (confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence) and parental cells were rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) and then fixed in this solution supplemented with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were processed for conventional thin-section electron microscopy as described previously (28Smith R.M. Cobb M.H. Rosen O.M. Jarett L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 123: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Quantification of coated membrane profiles was obtained by evaluating 8-11 fields comprising 2.25 square microns (roughly 1.5 × 1.5 μm) at high magnification (×50,000) for each cell line. GST-TD (Clathrin Terminal Domain) Binding Assay—pGEX-2T and pGEX-2T-TD-(1-579) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described previously (29Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). COS1 cells expressing Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α residues 2-873 were lysed 48 h after transfection in 25 mm Na-HEPES, (pH 7.3), 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, supplemented with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 15 min in a TLA100 rotor. Ten μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-TD-bound glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with clarified lysate, and binding was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Glu antibody. Miscellaneous Procedures—For immunofluorescence studies and transferrin uptake experiments, COS1 cells transiently transfected with vector, full-length wild type, or mutant PI3K-C2α constructs were processed as described previously (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Alexa-594 transferrin uptake (20 μg/ml for 10 min) and of clathrin-coated structure number was performed by analyzing pairs of PI3K-C2α-expressing and non-expressing cells in the same field, following background correction. Ten separate fields from multiple experiments were evaluated for each construct. For transferrin uptake, average pixel intensity in the perinuclear recycling compartment was quantitated, while the number of anti-clathrin antibody (R5 antibody, Ref. 25Santini F. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)-labeled spots within a 30.25-μm2 (50 × 50 pixel) box toward the periphery of the cell were counted for determination of clathrin coat structures. Image processing was performed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Inc.). For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in 100 mm MES-Na (pH 6.8), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02 NaN3, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Clarified lysates (12,000 rpm, 10 min) were centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 15 min in a TLA100 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and challenged with anti-Glu antibody. The immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Glu or anti-clathrin antibody TD1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Clathrin coat assembly was performed as described (30Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of clathrin alone or mixed with equimolar amounts of either AP-2 or purified PI3K-C2α-(2-134) was dialyzed overnight against 0.1 m MES-Na, pH 6.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3. Assembled clathrin structures were sedimented by ultracentrifugation (80,000 rpm, 10 min, TLA100 rotor), and equal proportions of pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Assembled clathrin structures induced by PI3K-C2α-(2-134) were further visualized by negative staining electron microscopy as described previously (30Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PI3K-C2α is a multidomain protein (Fig. 1) containing two protein modules directly related to the catalytic activity of the enzyme (HR1 and HR2), PX and C2 domains at its C terminus, and a distinct clathrin binding domain (CBD) in the N-terminal part of the protein (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Expression of PI3K-C2α in cells leads to gross changes in clathrin distribution and function, manifested as proliferation of intracellular clathrin-coated structures and inhibition of clathrin function in endocytosis (Fig. 2A) and TGN sorting (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the kinase activity in these processes, we generated a lipid kinase-defective mutant. In this mutant, residue Asp-1250 in the catalytic loop region (corresponding to Asp-166 in the protein kinase A catalytic subunit), conserved between all classes of PI 3-kinases as well as other lipid and protein kinases, was changed to alanine. In addition, two residues (Lys-1138 and Asp-1157) involved in ATP binding, and corresponding to protein kinase A catalytic subunit residues Lys-72 and Asp-89, were replaced with alanine. The resulting epitope-tagged kinase-dead mutant (KD-PI3K-C2α) and wild type (WT) proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of expressing cells and tested for kinase activity. At similar levels of overall expression, no catalytic activity toward phosphatidylinositol was detected in immunoprecipitates containing the KD protein in contrast to the wild type protein (Fig. 1B), confirming that kinase activity had indeed been ablated by the mutations. When epitope-tagged KD-PI3K-C2α protein was transiently expressed in COS1 cells and subjected to immunofluorescence, it exhibited a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm with some concentration in the perinuclear region characteristic of the TGN, a pattern indistinguishable from that of the WT protein (Fig. 2A and Ref. 24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As with the wild type protein, localization in the nucleus (31Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was only very occasionally observed. These results suggest that, as expected, the protein was correctly folded. Further, the results indicate that the kinase activity of the protein is not required for its correct targeting. Next we wished to evaluate the effect of transiently expressing KD-PI3K-C2α on the proliferation of novel intracellular clathrin-coated structures and inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis that characterize expression of the wild type protein. Surprisingly, expression of the mutant protein also resulted in proliferation of intracellular clathrin-coated structures, virtually indistinguishable from the effect of wild type enzyme (Fig. 2A). Similarly, cells expressing KD-PI3K-C2α were also defective in endocytosis of transferrin (Fig. 2B). Quantitation of multiple fields confirmed these effects (Fig. 3). The effects on clathrin distribution and on transferrin internalization were observed at similar levels of wild type and mutant enzyme overexpression. These data indicate that determinants other than the lipid kinase activity of PI3K-C2α are sufficient to elicit the effects on clathrin distribution and function. Stable Cell Lines Reveal Ultrastructural Changes upon PI3K-C2α Expression—To more fully characterize the effects of WT- and KD-PI3K-C2α expression upon clathrin morphology, we established stable inducible cell lines expressing each of these proteins in Tet-regulatable MEF cells. As with the transiently expressing cells (Fig. 2A), light microscopy revealed that both the WT and the KD-PI3K-C2α proteins are localized to punctate spots throughout the cytoplasm and are concentrated in the perinuclear region; further they show an increase in intracellular clathrin and a modest inhibition of transferrin uptake (data not shown). Ultrastructural analysis of the stable cell lines revealed important changes in coated membrane profiles. In parental MEF cells, characteristic bristle-coated pits were observed on the plasma membrane and occasionally as discrete profiles nearby (Fig. 4, upper left). In the WT-PI3K-C2α-expressing cells, no significant change was observed in the frequency of plasma membrane-coated pits (data not shown). However, a striking increase in the number of intracellular coated profiles was observed (Fig. 4, right panels). Most frequently these had the appearance of coated buds on the ends of tubules. Quantitation of the number of these coated buds suggests that their appearance is ∼10-fold more frequent in the WT-PI3K-C2α-expressing cells (2.4 coated structures/μm2; 9 fields analyzed) than in the parental line (0.23 coated structures/μm2; 8 fields analyzed). Evaluation of the KD-PI3K-C2α cell line (Fig. 4, lower left panel) also revealed a pronounced increase in intracellular coated membrane profiles (1.8 coated structures/μm2; 11 fields analyzed). These results confirm the immunofluorescence observations of a dramatic proliferation of intracellular clathrin-coated structures reported here (Fig. 2) and previously (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Further, they indicate that the lipid kinase activity of the exogenous PI3K-C2α molecule is not required to elicit the effect. In most cases the ultrastructural images suggest the presence of coats on small, circular membrane profiles of ∼70-90-nm diameter. Whether these structures are in fact discrete coated vesicles, coated buds on the end of tubular segments, or other coated membrane structures will require more elaborate ultrastructural studies such as serial section analysis. Observation of fluorescently tagged protein molecules in live cells may provide an alternative perspective, and preliminary results in our laboratory are consistent with the presence of clathrin-coated buds exhibiting highly dynamic but restricted local mobility. 4Y. Zhao, I. Gaidarov, and J. Keen, manuscript in preparation. Functional Domains in PI3K-C2α—The finding that the lipid kinase activity of PI3K-C2α was not required to elicit either the marked changes in clathrin distribution or inhibition of transferrin uptake prompted us to further analyze which domain(s) of the protein contributed to these phenomena. Accordingly, several constructs comprising different domains of PI3K-C2α were prepared and transiently expressed in cells. First, we expressed the N-terminal half of PI3K-C2α (amino acids 2-873), truncated before the catalytic regions (Fig. 1A, NT). This N-terminal fragment expressed well and exhibited the punctate pattern of cytoplasmic fluorescence with perinuclear concentration (Fig. 5A) characteristic of both the endogenous and WT protein (14Domin J. Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Keen J.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11943-11950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was able to potently induce formation of intracellular clathrin-coated structures and, like the WT protein, it colocalized with these structures (Fig. 5A, insets). Finally, again like the full-length WT protein, it was able to inhibit endocytosis of transferrin at expression levels comparable with those of full-length WT or KD proteins (Fig. 5D). These results (quantitated in Fig. 3) extend the finding that neither functional kinase activity nor the structural presence of the C-terminal half of the protein is required to elicit the proliferation of intracellular clathrin structures and concomitant inhibition of endocytosis. As the N-terminal half of PI3K-C2α contains the clathrin binding domain that we have identified previously at the extreme N terminus of the protein (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we then focused our attention on this region. First, expression of the N-terminal half of the protein lacking the CBD (residues 143-873) neither colocalized with clathrin nor had any demonstrable effect on its distribution (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the activity of this half of the protein can indeed be ascribed to the CBD. In confirmation, we found that expression of this fragment alone (residues 2-143) was indeed able to induce the formation of intracellular clathrin-coated structures, though only at higher levels of expression (Fig. 5C). This may reflect less effective folding or stability of this short fragment upon expression or that there are additional functional determinants located toward the C terminus of the protein. In any case, the results demonstrate that the ability of the catalytically inactive PI3K-C2α to elicit changes in clathrin distribution is attributable at least in part to the CBD of the enzyme. The PI-3KC2α CBD Possesses Clathrin Assembly Activity—Given the ability of PI3K-C2α fragments that contain the CBD to induce the proliferation of intracellular clathrin-coated structures, we hypothesized that the CBD might itself possess clathrin assembly activity that could account for the formation of these structures through clathrin polymerization. Our previous work demonstrated that this region of the protein could indeed bind to intact clathrin triskelia in precleared cell lysates (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The clathrin binding motif we noted in PI3K-C2α has been shown to interact specifically with the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain (29Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 32Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As expected from these characteristics, we found that clathrin terminal domain (heavy chain amino acids 1-579) fused to GST was able to efficiently pull out the PI3K-C2α fragment of amino acids 2-873 from expressing COS1 cells (Fig. 6A). Next we incubated purified clathrin triskelia with bacterially expressed polyhistidine-tagged PI3K-C2α-(2-134) under conditions in which clathrin assembly requires a separate factor to polymerize into coat structures (30Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Clathrin assembly was analyzed by ultracentrifugation followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The N-terminal PI3K-C2α fragment supported efficient polymerization of clathrin into a sedimentable state, comparable in extent to AP-2-mediated assembly used as a control (Fig. 6B). The macromolecular products of the assembly reaction were visualized by negative staining electron microscopy, revealing the formation of complete clathrin lattices in the presence of the PI3K-C2α N-terminal fragment (Fig. 6C). These data demonstrate that PI3K-C2α binds clathrin terminal domain and can induce clathrin assembly. It seems likely that this activity is responsible for the formation of assembled clathrin structures observed upon expression of PI3K-C2α constructs. PI3K-C2α Kinase Activity and the CBD Operate Independently—Our results to this point indicate that the CBD is sufficient to induce the proliferation of intracellular clathrin structures and that the lipid kinase activity of PI3K-C2α is not required. To test whether the catalytic activity of PI3K-C2α can independently play a role in the modulation of clathrin distribution in cells it was necessary to remove the clathrin binding domain from PI3K-C2α. Accordingly epitope-tagged deletion mutants of PI3K-C2α lacking N-terminal residues 1-142 in catalytically active (ΔCBD) or inactive (ΔCBD/KD) proteins (Fig. 1A) were constructed and expressed in COS1 cells. Cells transiently expressing the indicated constructs were lysed, the epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from resuspended high speed pellets, and the presence of associated clathrin was then determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 7A). As expected, the presence of the CBD conferred the ability to bind clathrin, as the latter was present in immunoprecipitates of both full-length WT- and KD-PI3K-C2α. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of the CBD itself also revealed the presence of clathrin, providing evidence of a stable association. These data support our immunofluorescence (Figs. 3 and 5) and ultrastructural (Fig. 4) results showing that enzymatically inactive PI3K-C2α as well as the CBD alone are each able to mediate the formation of intracellular clathrin-coated vesicular structures and support the hypothesis that this activity is a direct consequence of the presence of the clathrin binding and assembly activity of the CBD (Fig. 6). To evaluate the contribution of the kinase activity to the effect of PI3K-C2α on clathrin, cells expressing truncated PI3K-C2α constructs lacking the CBD (ΔCBD) were then examined. Interestingly, clathrin was efficiently recovered in immunoprecipitates of cells expressing the ΔCBD at levels comparable with the full-length protein (when corrected for expression level). However, it was greatly diminished or absent in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the kinase-dead version of the protein (Fig. 7A), demonstrating that the CBD and catalytic activity of PI3K-C2α can independently contribute to stable clathrin binding. We then tested ΔCBD catalytically active and inactive mutants for the ability to modulate clathrin distribution in intact cells (Fig. 7B). Analysis showed that expression of the catalytically active ΔCBD mutant leads to the proliferation of intracellular clathrin-coated vesicular structures. In contrast, the enzymatically inactive ΔCBD/KD mutant was completely incapable of affecting clathrin distribution upon expression. These data directly confirm independent roles for the catalytic and clathrin binding activities of PI3K-C2α in modulation of clathrin function in cells. Further, they suggest that the effect on clathrin-mediated processes observed upon expression of PI3K-C2α in cells is likely the summary result of both of these activities. The observations reported here indicate that the lipid kinase and clathrin binding activities of PI3K-C2α each contribute, and can even operate independently, to affect clathrin distribution and function. This bimodal mechanism of action, though revealed by utilizing non-physiological expression levels, is nonetheless useful in probing aspects of the involvement of PI3K-C2α in normal membrane trafficking processes. For example, the results provide a plausible mechanism for recruitment of PI3K-C2α to nascent sites of clathrin coat formation. This likely occurs as a consequence of both PI3K-C2α affinity for clathrin and of membrane binding by its PX and C2 domains (33Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This dual mode of interaction, involving both protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, is similar to targeting mechanisms that have been suggested to operate in other systems (13Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8262-8269Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 34Honing S. Ricotta D. Krauss M. Spate K. Spolaore B. Motley A. Robinson M. Robinson C.

Cell. 2005; 8: 801-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the assembly activity of the CBD of PI3K-C2α that we report here may also contribute directly to clathrin lattice assembly upon PI3K-C2α recruitment. An important implication of the formation of stable clathrin-PI3K-C2α complexes at sites of endocytosis is the localized activation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3K-C2α (24Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This may have several consequences. Local production of charged 3-(poly)phosphoinositides may affect the membrane directly or, because many of the key proteins involved in endocytosis (e.g. AP-2, AP180/CALM, epsin, and dynamin) show relatively low inositide specificity and a preference for more highly phosphorylated derivatives (8Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 36Lemmon M.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), may serve to help recruit and stabilize these proteins. Clearly it will be important to temporally resolve the appearance of these proteins in the coated pit, and further work with live cell systems should help to address these issues. Finally, another important potential outcome of the activation of PI3K-C2α in the coated pit may be the production of local PtdIns-3-P pools in membrane regions destined to enter the endocytic pathway. Lipids in these pools may be the downstream binding targets of the many 3-phosphoinositide-binding FYVE and PX domain proteins that have been identified and may be a key source of the 3-phosphoinositides that characterize the early endosomal compartment. Further work on the in situ regulation of the individual PI3K-C2α activities identified here will be essential to further refine our understanding of these possibilities.

https://openalex.org/W2156590829,"Pericyte loss and capillary regression are characteristic for incipient diabetic retinopathy. Pericyte recruitment is involved in vessel maturation, and ligand-receptor systems contributing to pericyte recruitment are survival factors for endothelial cells in pericyte-free in vitro systems. We studied pericyte recruitment in relation to the susceptibility toward hyperoxia-induced vascular remodeling using the pericyte reporter X-LacZ mouse and the mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Pericytes were found in close proximity to vessels, both during formation of the superficial and the deep capillary layers. When exposure of mice to the ROP was delayed by 24 h, i.e., after the deep retinal layer had formed [at postnatal (p) day 8], preretinal neovascularizations were substantially diminished at p18. Mice with a delayed ROP exposure had 50% reduced avascular zones. Formation of the deep capillary layers at p8 was associated with a combined up-regulation of angiopoietin-1 and PDGF-B, while VEGF was almost unchanged during the transition from a susceptible to a resistant capillary network. Inhibition of Tie-2 function either by soluble Tie-2 or by a sulindac analog, an inhibitor of Tie-2 phosphorylation, resensitized retinal vessels to neovascularizations due to a reduction of the deep capillary network. Inhibition of Tie-2 function had no effect on pericyte recruitment. Our data indicate that the final maturation of the retinal vasculature and its resistance to regressive signals such as hyperoxia depend on the completion of the multilayer structure, in particular the deep capillary layers, and are independent of the coverage by pericytes."
https://openalex.org/W2067891803,"Four versions of a β-sheet protein (CD2.d1) have been made, each with a single artificial disulfide bond inserted into hairpin structures. Folding kinetics of reduced and oxidized forms shows bridge position strongly influences its effect on the folding reaction. Bridging residues 58 and 62 does not affect the rapidly formed intermediate (I) or rate-limiting transition (t) state, whereas bridging 33 and 38, or 31 and 41, lowers the t-state energy, with the latter having the stronger influence. Bridging residues 79 and 90 stabilizes both I- and t-states. To assess additivity in the energetic effects of these bridges, four double-bridge variants have also been made. All show precise additivity of overall stability, with two showing additivity when ground states and the rate-limiting t-state are assessed, i.e. no measurable change in the folding mechanism occurs. However, combining 31-41 and 79-90 bridges produces a molecule that folds through a different pathway, with a much more stable intermediate than expected and a much higher t-state barrier. This is explained by the artificial introduction of stabilizing, non-native contacts in the I-state. More surprisingly, for another double-bridge version (58-62 and 79-90) both I- and t-states are less stable than expected, showing that conformational constraints introduced by the two bridges prevent formation of non-native contacts that would otherwise stabilize the I- and t-states, thereby lowering the energy of the folding landscape in the wild-type (unbridged) molecule. We conclude that the lowest energy path for folding has I- and t-state structures that are stabilized by non-native interactions.

We conclude that the lowest energy path for folding has I- and t-state structures that are stabilized by non-native interactions. The first domain of the cell surface molecule CD2 is a member of the immunoglobulin family of β-sandwich proteins. It has proved to be a productive experimental model for the study of folding in proteins that comprise only β-sheets, because of the reversibility and high yield of the folding reaction and the large signal change that accompanies the folding process. In addition, the absence of disulfide bonds in the folded structure means that the native state is maintained only by non-covalent interactions and the folding reaction is described by a single exponential process showing that there are no subpopulations that fold by a different route and that there is only one rate-limiting transition state. Despite the uncomplicated nature of the folding and unfolding kinetics, analysis of the denaturant dependence of the folding rate constant shows that the protein folds through a rapidly formed intermediate state, such that the overall folding process can be accurately described by a three-state mechanism as shown in Equation 1, UK(I/U)⇌_Ikf⇌kuF(Eq. 1) where U is the unfolded state, I is a partially folded intermediate state, and F is the fully folded state. The initial rapid collapse, described by the equilibrium constant K(I/U), occurs on the sub-millisecond time scale and leads to the formation of an I-state in which some aspects of overall topology of the molecule are established. Evidence for this is drawn from hydrogen-exchange experiments in which the most extensive I-state protection is detected in a nucleus of four β-strands (see Fig. 1, B, C, E, and F). Interestingly, the hydrogen-bonded strand pairings in this nucleus are distant in sequence (B with E and C with F) and form the most topologically complicated substructure within the folded molecule (1Hosszu L.L. Craven C.J. Parker M.J. Lorch M. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Parker M.J. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5786-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The simpler and more sequence-local substructures, namely the β-hairpins (a β-strand, followed by a turn of any description and a second β-strand that is hydrogen-bonded to the first), are also protected to some extent, particularly the long hairpin created by the hydrogen bonding of the F and G strands. The rate-limiting transition state for folding of CD2 has also been examined by mutational analysis (3Lorch M. Mason J.M. Sessions R.B. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3480-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies also emphasize the importance of the B,C,E,F nucleus (see Figs. 1 and 3b) in the transition state, because the only residues with transition state ϕ-values greater than 0.2 are in this region. It is also interesting to note that there are no statistically relevant ϕ-values greater than 0.5 in the whole protein, implying a rather poorly ordered transition state with respect to the intimacy of side-chain interactions. In two other proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, namely TI 127 and TNfn3 (belonging to the Ig I-set and the fn3 set of folds, respectively), it is also the formation of the B,C,E,F nucleus that is the key to folding (4Clarke J. Cota E. Fowler S.B. Hamill S.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Fowler S.B. Clarke J. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These findings reinforce the argument that topology and the transition state in the folding pathway are strongly related. The kinetic influence of disulfide bridges has been used as a tool in dissecting the folding pathway of numerous proteins (6Clarke J. Fersht A.R.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The topological properties of the intermediate and transition states of CD2 have also been probed by examining the effects of preformed disulfide bridges on folding dynamics (10Mason J.M. Gibbs N. Sessions R.B. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12093-12099Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was found that, in the majority of cases, well designed cross-links (11Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M. Proteins. 1995; 22: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Hutchinson E.G. Sessions R.B. Thornton J.M. Woolfson D.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) stabilized the folded state by an amount that was predictable from a calculation of the entropic penalty in the unfolded state (13Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, cross-links that connect β-strands that are distant in sequence were found predominantly to stabilize the rapidly formed intermediate state, suggesting that these strand-strand interactions occur in the initial stages of folding. Crosslinks that stabilize local hairpins have their major influence on the second, rate-determining step leading to significant enhancements in the folding rate. The result implies that the slow, rate-limiting step must involve the consolidation of localized, hairpin structures, a process that occurs after the complex elements of overall topology are established. Thus long-range contacts, and therefore molecular order, can be established in early, non-rate-limiting processes. To extend the above study of disulfide engineering, in this report we have looked at the additivity of effects, i.e. the extent to which the energetic properties of a molecule in which two disulfide bonds have been engineered can be predicted by simply summing the effects of the two single bridges. We undertook this work to address three questions. First, could we combine bridges to produce hyper-stable versions of the protein? This would clearly have implications for engineering extreme robustness, at least into β-sheet-containing proteins. Second, could we combine bridges that individually produced fast-folding proteins to create an ultra-fast folder? Third, and more speculatively, if we found non-additivity in combining the bridges, what information might this reveal about the nature of the folding process? Mutagenesis—All mutations were made on the rat gene cloned into the pGEX-2T glutathione S-transferase fusion vector (14Driscoll P.C. Cyster J.G. Campbell I.D. Williams A.F. Nature. 1991; 353: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (2Parker M.J. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5786-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Disulfides—To form the disulfide bridges, 10 μm protein was oxidized in an oxygen-purged buffer containing 20 μm zinc chloride, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride at pH 7.5. To break the bridges, 10 μm protein in a helium-purged buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride at pH 7.5 was reduced by the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol. In addition, all other buffers were filtered and purged with the relevant gases. The proteins were then checked for oxidation and reduction using mass spectrometry and Elman's reagent (15Creighton T. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 101-133Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis—The data have been fitted to Equation 2, kobs=kF-I+kI-F/(1+1/KI/U)(Eq. 2) where kF-I and kI-F are rate constants describing the forward and reverse reactions, respectively, between the folded and intermediate states (I). KI/U is the equilibrium constant ([I]/[U]) for the rapid inter-conversion of the intermediate and unfolded states (16Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the fitting routine, the following relationships were used as shown in Equations 3, 4, 5, kF-I=kF-I(w)exp(-mtD)(Eq. 3) kI-F=kI-F(w)exp[(mI-(mt)D](Eq. 4) KI/U=KI/U(W)exp[(mu-mI)D](Eq. 5) where the subscript w describes the rate and equilibrium constants in water, and the m parameters describe the shifts in the stabilities of each state (designated by the subscript) as a function of the guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) denaturant activity (D), where D = [C0.5 [GuHCl]/(C0.5 +[GuHCl])] - 2.6[Na2SO4], where C0.5 is a denaturation constant with a value of 7.5 m.

Na2SO4 is a kosmotropic agent and works in a manner analogous but opposite to GuHCl, increasing the free energy of solvation of hydrocarbon and consequently driving folding reaction in favor of more compact and desolvated states. The molar ability of Na2SO4 to decrease the extent of hydrocarbon burial has been scaled to the molar ability of GuHCl to increase it, allowing us to calculate the denaturant activity of Na2SO4 (16Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This results in negative values of denaturant activity. Folding measurements were initiated by mixing a 10 μm solution of unfolded Domain 1 of Cluster Determinant 2 (CD2.d1) 2The abbreviations used are: CD2.d1Domain 1 of Cluster Determinant 2GuHClguanidine hydrochloride. containing 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride and 3.27 m GuHCl against 10 volumes of a given concentration of GuHCl at 298 K in an SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). An excitation wavelength of 295 nm was selected by a single monochromator (band-pass 5 nm) from a mercury-xenon light source. The fluorescence intensity above 340 nm was recorded using an emission cut-off filter. For the unfolding reactions, a 10-mm solution of folded CD2.d1 in 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, was mixed with 10 volumes of an appropriate concentration of GuHCl at 298 K and the reaction recorded as above. The resulting data points are the result of at least three averages. The data are independent of protein concentration, with temperature control and mixing efficiency remarkably reliable in this apparatus. All reaction solutions were maintained at the appropriate temperature using a thermostated circulating water bath and were monitored continuously with a sensitive thermocouple. From this, the fluctuation in temperature was determined to be no more than ± 0.1 °C. Rate constants determined in the same conditions but in different experimental data sets vary by only 6-7%.

When fitting kinetic data to Equation 2, proportional weighting was used so that the fitted values took account of rate constants equally across the whole range.

Gibbs N. Sessions R.B. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12093-12099Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The effects of the bridges, with respect to free energy changes, are summarized in TABLE TWO, which splits the reaction into three stages. The first stage (U-to-I) is the rapid transition from the unfolded state to the intermediate. The second is the passage from this intermediate state to the rate-limiting transition state (I-to-t). The third is the descent from this high energy state to the folded ground state (t-to-F). For each stage in the reaction, the difference between the free energy change for the unbridged (reduced) molecule and the bridged (oxidized) molecule is given. The ΔΔG values reported in TABLE TWO for each stage in the reaction are, therefore, calculated by Equation 6. ΔΔG(bridge)=ΔG(ox)-ΔG(red)(Eq. 6) TABLE TWOChanges in free energy (ΔΔG) of defined steps in the folding reaction of CD2.d1 All values are derived from the parameters in TABLE ONE and are given in kcal/mol.

Additionally, by using the reduced state as the reference, rather than the wild-type, small local perturbations caused by replacing the wild-type residue with a cysteine are discounted, and we reveal only the effect of oxidizing the cysteines. For the double-bridge versions the values in brackets represent the expected ΔΔG(bridge) when the appropriate single-bridge values are summed together. Effects of Single Bridges—The data presented in the upper half of TABLE TWO show the wide spectrum of effects in the single-bridge versions of CD2. For instance, a bridge between residues 58 and 62 has no effect on the rapidly formed intermediate and only slightly increases the energy barrier that defines the rate-limiting transition state for folding. The major effect of the bridge is to destabilize the folded state, presumably by introducing some degree of strain. The insertion of a bridge between residues 33 and 38 leads to a moderate reduction in the size of the transition state barrier (ΔΔG(bridge) = -0.7 kcal/mol) and produces a protein with a 3-fold faster folding rate. The bridge between residues 31 and 41 is in the same hairpin and lowers the energy of the transition state to a greater degree (ΔΔG(bridge) =-1.8 kcal/mol). In this case, we see a 20-fold enhancement in the folding rate. The most striking effect is produced by a bridge between residues 79 and 90, which markedly stabilizes both the intermediate state (ΔΔG(bridge) = -2.2 kcal/mol) and reduces the height of the transition state barrier by 1.5 kcal/mol. Combination of Bridges; Additivity in Overall Free Energy of Folding— What is more relevant to the study conducted here is the additivity of effects. All the four double-bridge variants show precise additivity with respect to overall stability (ΔΔG(bridge) U-to-F). That is, the sum of the effects of the single bridges (see values in parentheses) is equal to the effect of the double bridge. This result demonstrates that, at least in principle, engineering high stability by insertion of multiple disulfide bonds into β-sheet regions of proteins is feasible. Additivity of Energies along the Folding Pathway—The data in TABLE TWO show that the property of additivity of free energy is maintained through every step in the folding mechanism for two of the four double-bridge proteins (31-41 + 58-62 and 33-38 + 58-62). Within error, the measured effect of introducing two bridges into a single molecule is the same as summing the measured effects in the two individual single-bridge versions (see values in brackets in TABLE TWO), showing that the bridges induce no measurable change in the folding mechanism. However, this property is not shown by the remaining two combinations. Combining the 31-41 and 79-90 bridges produces a molecule that folds through a different pathway, with an intermediate that is much more stable than expected from the additivity principle and a transition state barrier that is much higher in energy (see schematic profile in Fig. 3a). More explicitly, the ΔΔG(bridge) for the U-to-I transition in the double-bridge version is greater than -3.7 kcal/mol (in the sense of being more stable). The fact that we see no evidence for a measurable population of intermediate in the reduced form means that we do not know the upper limit for this effect. However, from summing the values for the individual bridges we would expect a ΔΔG(bridge) of -1.5 kcal/mol, i.e. the measured effect of the double bridge is >2.2 kcal/mol greater than the predicted effect. This can be defined as a synergistic combination of bridges when considering the energy of formation of the folding intermediate, i.e. the sum is greater than expected from its parts. When examining the height of the transition state barrier, it is interesting to note that the reduced and oxidized versions of 31-41 + 79-90 mutant fold at almost the same rate, whereas we would expect a 260-fold enhancement of the rate with its bridges intact. This means that the barrier is 3.2 kcal/mol higher than expected because of the introduction of stabilizing, non-native contacts in the I-state that have to be broken before the molecule can achieve the productive transition state. The hope in combining the CC′ and FG bridges was that we would not alter the folding pathway and so combine the reductions in the height of the folding barrier occasioned by the single bridges. This would have created a variant of CD2 with a folding rate of >10,000 s-1 if there were a 260-fold enhancement of the rate constant for the reduced system. However, the distortion in the pathway defeated this aim. Perhaps more surprisingly, the remaining double-bridge version (58-62 + 79-90) has an intermediate state and a transition state that are less stable than expected. The measured ΔΔG(bridge) for the U-to-I transition in the double-bridge version (see TABLE TWO) is close to zero. However, from summing the values for the individual bridges we would expect a ΔΔG(bridge) of -2.2 kcal/mol, i.e. the measured effect of the double bridge is >2.2 kcal/mol smaller than the predicted effect (see Fig. 3a). This can be defined as an anti-synergistic combination of bridges when considering the energy of formation of the folding intermediate, i.e. the sum is less than expected from its parts. However, as the term anti-synergistic contains an intrinsic contradiction, this effect will be called a destructive combination. When examining the height of the transition state barrier, it is interesting to note that this destructive effect persists into the next stage of folding, i.e. the transition state barrier. This is 0.6 kcal/mol higher in the double mutant than would be expected from summation of the singles (Fig. 3b). This means that the constraints on conformation introduced by the two bridges in the 58-62 + 79-90 mutant are acting in the opposite way to those described for the 31-41 + 79-90 mutant. That is, they must prevent rather than cause the formation of non-native contacts that would otherwise stabilize the I-state and the t-state in the folding pathway of the single-bridge versions. Implications of Synergistic Combinations—The principle behind additivity of free energy in a pathway is that when two bridges combine synergistically, i.e. their effect on the energy change for a given step is greater than predicted from the sum of the individuals, then the pathway has changed by creating a new conformation of lower free energy than is achieved in either of the single-bridge proteins. This is exemplified by the 31-41 + 79-90 version of CD2, which has an intermediate state that is >2.2 kcal/mol more stable than predicted. This means that there are stabilizing, non-native interactions between the CC′ and FG hairpins in the double-bridge version that are absent in the singles (Fig. 3b). However, the fact that additivity is maintained across the whole pathway, from unfolded to fully folded state, means that this advantage must be lost at a later stage. In fact, the transition state barrier is 3.2 kcal/mol higher than predicted in the doubly bridged molecule. The fact that there is a negative slope in the rate plot for the double mutant at low denaturant concentrations (see Fig. 2) shows that the intermediate is more compact than the transition state. In turn, this demonstrates that the stabilizing non-native contacts formed in the intermediate state have to be broken before the transition state can be attained. This result can be rationalized in structural terms by the following argument. As shown in the schematic in Fig. 3, the CC′ and FG hairpins are not in contact in the folded state, and analysis of the single-bridge 31-41 version of CD2 shows that the CC′ hairpin is not normally formed in the I-state. If the presence of this disulfide bridge forces hairpin formation then there is the possibility of a strong non-native interaction between the two hydrophobic faces of the hairpins. This interaction would then have to be broken to achieve the native topology. Implications of Destructive Combinations—According with the above paradigm, two bridges can be considered to combine in a destructive manner when their effect is less than predicted from the sum of the individual effects, i.e. the pathway is changed in the double mutant by preventing stabilization of non-native interactions that normally occur in the single-bridge proteins. The 58-62 + 79-90 version of CD2 exemplifies this phenomenon, suggesting that such non-native contacts between the DE and FG hairpins occur in the normal folding pathway (see Figs. 1 and 3a). The predicted free energy stabilization (ΔΔG(bridge)) in the double mutant for the formation of the I-state is -2.2 kcal/mol, whereas the observed is only -0.2 kcal/mol. In the case of the 79-90 single-bridge version, we see a marked stabilization of the I-state (>3.7 kcal/mol). This result shows that the FG hairpin must be at least partially formed in this conformation when the wild-type molecule folds. However, the single 58-62 bridge has, if anything, a destabilizing effect on the I-state showing that in the wild-type folding pathway the DE hairpin is not formed in the I-state. The destructive nature of the DE-FG combination in the double-bridge molecule can therefore be explained if the FG hairpin in normal folding pathway is stabilized by non-native interactions with the DE segment of the protein that has not, at this stage, formed a hairpin. It is interesting to note that the expected reduction in the transition state barrier from the summation of the single-bridge effects is 1.0 kcal/mol, whereas the observed stabilization is only 0.4 kcal/mol. This result implies that the non-native contacts that normally stabilize the intermediate state are maintained to a lesser degree in the transition state. Concluding Remarks—Although one of the objectives of these experiments was to make a fast-folding version of CD2 by combining an artificial bridge across the FG hairpin with one across the CC′ hairpin, we would argue that our failure to do so was instructive. Rather than making a fast folder, we succeeded only in forming a misfolded over-stable intermediate, i.e. we distorted the folding pathway by stabilizing a substructure (CC′) that is normally unfolded in the I-state, thereby creating non-native interactions between the two hairpins. The lesson here is to engineer more intelligently and, when combining bridges to engineer high folding rates, choose to stabilize hairpins that are in contact in the native state. Hence, non-native interactions that increase the height of the major energy barrier would probably be avoided by pursuing this strategy. To add to this, we found evidence for the beneficial role of non-native interactions in a folding pathway. When the DE bridge was combined with the FG, we were surprised to find that the double-bridge molecule folded through a less stable intermediate and through a higher energy transition state than would have been predicted from the effects of the two single bridges. This shows that the double bridge has abolished non-native contacts that normally stabilize intermediate and transition states in the folding pathway. The result implies that, perhaps counter-intuitively, contacts between regions of the polypeptide chain that are not in contact in the folded native state can assist, rather that inhibit, the kinetics of the folding process."

Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli cells expressing C-terminal fusions of HPNhaA to green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants exhibited wild-type levels of antiporter activity in their everted membrane vesicles. Vesicles containing both HPNhaA-CFP and HPNhaA-YFP or HPNhaA-Venus exhibited FRET from CFP (donor) to YFP or Venus (acceptor), suggesting that HPNhaA forms an oligomer. Co-precipitation of HPNhaA tagged by Venus and FLAG sequences confirmed oligomerization. FRET decreased extensively after treatment of the vesicles with proteinase K, which released GFP variants from the fusion proteins. FRET was not observed by merely mixing vesicles expressing the donor or acceptor fusion alone. Fluorescence of Venus is less sensitive to anions and stronger than that of anion-sensitive YFP. Using HPNhaA-Venus as the acceptor, Li+ was found to cause a significant decrease in FRET regardless of the presence or absence of ΔpH across the membranes, whereas Na+ caused a much weaker effect. This Li+ effect was minimal in vesicles prepared from cells expressing HPNhaA containing an Asp141 to Asn mutation, which results in defective Li+/H+ antiporter activity, possibly Li+ binding. These results demonstrate that monomer interactions within the HPNhaA oligomer are weakened possibly by Li+ binding. Dynamic interactions between HPNhaA monomers were detectable in membranes by FRET analysis, thus providing a new approach to study dynamic conformational changes in NhaA during antiport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2103092691,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system transports folded proteins across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane and bacterial plasma membrane. In vitro import assays have pointed to a key role for the thylakoid ΔpH in the initial assembly of the full translocon from two subcomplexes; more generally, the ΔpH is believed to provide the overall driving force for translocation. Here, we have studied the role of the ΔpH in vivo by analyzing the translocation of Tat substrates in transfected tobacco protoplasts. We show that the complete maturation of the precursor of the 23-kDa lumenal protein (pre-23K) and of a fusion of the 23K presequence linked to green fluorescent protein (pre-GFP) are unaffected by dissipation of the ΔpH. High level expression of Tat substrates in protoplasts has recently been shown to result in “translocation reversal” in that a large proportion of a given substrate is partially translocated across the thylakoid membrane, processed to the mature size, and returned to the stroma. However, the efficiency of translocation of pre-23K is undiminished in the absence of the ΔpH and/or ΔΨ, and the rate and extent of maturation of both pre-23K and pre-GFP by the lumen-facing processing peptidase is similarly unaffected. These data demonstrate that the proton motive force is not required for the functional assembly of the Tat translocon and the initial stages of translocation in higher plant chloroplasts in vivo.

These targeting signals are recognized by a membrane-bound translocase that is encoded by three key genes in plants and Gram-negative bacteria: the tatABC genes in bacteria and the homologous tha4, hcf106, and cptatC genes in higher plants (11Walker M.B.

The mechanism of the Tat system is poorly understood but protein purification and cross-linking studies have recently provided insights into the organization and operation of the system. Two primary Tat complexes have been characterized in membranes isolated from Escherichia coli cells, namely a TatABC core complex of ∼370 kDa as estimated by blue native gels (14Bolhuis A.

Bolhuis Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The situation appears to be similar, though possibily not identical in chloroplasts; a complex containing Hcf106 and cpTatC was identified using blue native gels of solubilized thylakoids, with all of the Tha4 present in separate complexes (17Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies have shown that substrates initially bind to a core complex (TatC-Hcf106 in chloroplasts or TatABC in E. coli (17Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Müller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)). The subsequent events are poorly understood, but Tha4 was only found to cross-link to the core complex subunits in the presence of the thylakoid ΔpH and substrate (19Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), giving rise to a model in which the Tha4 complex (or TatA in bacteria) is recruited under these conditions to form the full translocation complex. A range of earlier in vitro import studies (20Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12189-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also showed that the full translocation of Tat substrates across the thylakoid membrane is completely ΔpH-dependent in both intact chloroplasts or isolated thylakoids. More recently, the role of the ΔpH has been evaluated in vivo for the first time. Pulse labeling studies in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (22Finazzi G. Chasen C. Wollman F-A. de Vitry C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that several Tat substrates were converted to the mature size in the complete absence of a ΔpH, strongly suggesting that Tat-dependent translocation is not dependent on the thylakoid proton motive force. Another recent study using transfected tobacco protoplasts demonstrated another unexpected characteristic that has not been observed using in vitro assays; Tat substrates were found to be partially translocated across the thylakoid membrane but then returned to the stroma in a high percentage of instances (23Di Cola A. Robinson C.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given the emerging indications of major differences between the in vivo and in vitro characteristics of the Tat system, we have set out to study the role of the ΔpH in the translocation of substrates by the Tat pathway in tobacco protoplasts. We show that the ΔpH is not required for the partial translocation of a GFP construct across the thylakoid membrane by the Tat pathway or for the full translocation of an authentic lumenal Tat substrate. Constructs—A chimera comprising the presequence of the pea 23-kDa lumenal photosystem II protein (23K) linked to a version of GFP termed sGFP (24Foresti O. Frigerio L. Holkeri H. de Virgilio M. Vavassori S. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2464-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was expressed as described by Di Cola and Robinson (23Di Cola A. Robinson C.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The structure of a non-processable form is described in the same report; in brief, the terminal Ala of the signal peptide was deleted, removing the consensus Ala-Xaa-Ala motif recognized by the thylakoid processing peptidase. Full-length pea pre-23K was also expressed using the same vector system, but the protein was modified by the addition of two methionines at the extreme C terminus to facilitate radiolabeling. Transient Transformation of Leaf Protoplasts—Protoplasts were prepared from axenic leaves (4-7 cm long) of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana SR1 (24Foresti O. Frigerio L. Holkeri H. de Virgilio M. Vavassori S. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2464-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, leaves were cut and incubated overnight in the presence of an enzymatic mix containing 0.2% macerozyme and 0.4% cellulase prepared in K3 medium (Gamborg's B5 basal medium with minimal organics (Sigma), supplemented with 750 mg/liter CaCl2, 250 mg/liter NH4NO3, 136.2 g/liter sucrose, 250 mg/liter xylose, 1 mg/liter 6-benzylaminopurine, and 1 mg/liter naphthaleneacetic acid, pH 5.5). Protoplasts were subjected to polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection as described (25Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. de Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and were incubated overnight at 25 °C in the dark before pulse labeling. In Vivo Labeling of Protoplasts, Analysis of Expressed Polypeptides, and Import Assays—Pulse-chase labeling of protoplasts using Pro-Mix (a mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys; Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) was performed exactly as described in Ref. 26Frigerio L. Vitale A. Lord J.M. Ceriotti A. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14194-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. In some experiments (see “Results”) protoplasts were treated with 2 μm nigericin (Sigma), 2 μm valinomycin, or a combination of the two at the beginning of the pulse labeling period. KCl was added to 10 mm in each case. At the desired time points, 3 volumes of W5 medium (26Frigerio L. Vitale A. Lord J.M. Ceriotti A. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14194-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were added, and protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min. Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Homogenization of protoplasts and incubation media was performed by adding to the frozen samples 2 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (150 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, and 1.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation of expressed polypeptides was performed as described (26Frigerio L. Vitale A. Lord J.M. Ceriotti A. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14194-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against pea 23K or GFP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunoselected proteins were analyzed by 15% (w/v) reducing SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Chloroplast Isolation and Fractionation—Protoplast pellets (from 3,000,000 cells) obtained at the desired time points during pulse-chase were resuspended in 150 ml HS buffer (50 μm Hepes-KOH, 330 mm sorbitol, pH 8) and homogenized by repeated passage through a 23-gauge syringe needle. The obtained lysate was diluted to 4 ml with HS buffer and loaded on top of a 35% (v/v) Percoll pad in 5× HS and centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 9 min at 4 °C. Pellets (chloroplasts) were washed once in HS buffer, pelleted at 3,300 × g for 2 min, and resuspended in 120 μl of HS. An aliquot (30 μl) was saved and used for immunoprecipitation (chloroplast (C)), and the rest was incubated for 1 h on ice with thermolysin (Sigma 2 μg/μl) at the final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl. EDTA was added at the 10 μm final concentration to inhibit thermolysin, and 30 μl were kept for immunoprecipitation (protease-treated chloroplast (C+)). Chloroplasts were lysed in HM buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl) supplemented with 10 μm EDTA, for 10 min on ice, after which the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Supernatants (stroma (S)) were saved and used for immunoprecipitation (S), while pellets (thylakoids) were first washed in HM buffer and then resuspended in 60 μl of HM buffer containing 3 μm CaCl2. 30 μl were used for immunoprecipitation (thylakoid membrane (T)) and the rest incubated for 20 min on ice with thermolysin 0.2 μg/ml. EDTA was added (10 μm), and the last aliquot (30 μl) was kept for immunoprecipitation (thermolysin-treated thylakoid (T+)). For in vitro import assays, pre-GFP was generated by transcription-translation in the presence of [35S]methionine followed by import into intact pea chloroplasts in the absence or presence of nigericin as described (20Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12189-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorophyll Fluorescence Quenching Analysis—Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Hansatech FMS-2 fluorometer (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, UK). Tobacco protoplasts were suspended at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.2 mg ml-1 and maintained at 20 °C. Following dark adaptation for several hours protoplasts were given a saturating pulse of white light (all saturating pulses at 3,000 μmol m-2 s-1) to record the maximum fluorescence yield, Fm. An actinic light at 400 μmol m-2 s-1 was then provided for a 30-min duration to induce non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll a fluorescence. A second saturating pulse was then applied with the actinic light on to record Fm′. The actinic light was then switched off, and Fm′ values were recorded with regular saturating pulses in the dark. Dark relaxation kinetics of NPQ were then resolved into fast relaxing (NPQf) and slowly relaxing components (NPQs) according to Walters and Horton (27Walters R.G. Horton P. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 27: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), using the equation Fm/Fm′-1 as a measure of NPQ. When used nigericin was added at a concentration of 2 μm. Maturation of Pre-GFP Is ΔpH-dependent in Chloroplast Import Assays—One of the constructs used in this study (pre-GFP) comprises the presequence of the lumenal 23-kDa photosystem II protein (from pea) linked to green fluorescent protein. GFP constructs have been successfully used as Tat-dependent passenger proteins in bacteria (28Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (29Marques J.P. Schattat M.H. Hause G. Dudeck I. Klosgen R.B. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that this construct behaves as a typical Tat substrate in standard chloroplast import assays. However, expression in transfected protoplasts gave an unexpected result: the protein was imported into chloroplasts, extensively translocated across the thylakoid membrane by the Tat pathway, and processed to the mature size, but then the majority was returned to the stroma. A similar observation was made using a natural Tat substrate (the 23-kDa protein), with about 50% of this protein also appearing as the processed, mature size form in the stroma (23Di Cola A. Robinson C.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was found that mutation of the terminal thylakoid-processing peptidase (TPP) cleavage site caused the intermediate form to associate strongly with the thylakoid membrane, possibly due to prolonged interaction with the Tat translocon. This non-processable mutant, which lacks the terminal Ala in the Tat signal peptide, is termed pre-GFPΔTPP in the studies described below. The protoplast transfection system offers the opportunity to carry out pulse-chase assays on the time scales usually used for in vitro translocation assays, and in this study we have tested the importance of the thylakoid ΔpH for the targeting of pre-GFP. First, we tested whether this substrate exhibits the typical ΔpH dependence observed for Tat substrates in in vitro import assays, as shown in Fig. 1. The control panel shows the import and localization of the protein using the standard pea chloroplast import protocol, and the data show that pre-GFP is imported and converted to smaller products (lane C) that are protected from proteolysis of the organelles (lane C+). Fractionation of the chloroplasts shows the presence of mature size GFP in the thylakoid fraction (lane T), and this is resistant to thermolysin treatment of the membranes (lane T+) confirming a lumenal location. A small amount of intermediate size protein (iGFP) is apparent in the chloroplast (lane C) and protease-treated chloroplast (lane C+) samples, and this almost certainly corresponds to stromal intermediate en route to the thylakoids. This is not detected in the stroma, probably because the protein has been fully translocated by the time the fractions are generated. The second panel shows an import assays carried out in the presence of 2 μm nigericin. The nigericin totally inhibits transport across the thylakoid membrane and the stromal iGFP form accumulates, confirming that this substrate, like other Tat substrates, is completely dependent on the thylakoid ΔpH for transport into the lumen. The non-processable pre-GFPΔTPP form is likewise dependent on the thylakoid ΔpH, with the intermediate accumulating in the stroma in the presence of nigericin (data not shown). Partial Translocation and Maturation of Pre-GFP Is ΔpH-independent in Transfected Tobacco Protoplasts—We studied the same substrate in vivo using transfected tobacco protoplasts under conditions that have been used previously to study the intracellular targeting of proteins by other pathways (24Foresti O. Frigerio L. Holkeri H. de Virgilio M. Vavassori S. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2464-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. de Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Frigerio L. Vitale A. Lord J.M. Ceriotti A. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14194-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this assay, leaf protoplasts are transfected with plasmid DNA encoding pre-GFP, with expression driven by the strong cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. After 24-h incubation, the targeting of pre-GFP was studied by pulse-chase analysis as detailed below. Assays were carried out in the absence or presence of 2 μm nigericin. It is not possible to directly measure the ΔpH in vivo but chlorophyll fluorescence can be used as a non-invasive assay to confirm that the thylakoid ΔpH is indeed fully dissipated under these conditions. A strong light-dependent quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence, known as NPQ, is a feature of higher plant chloroplasts (30Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). NPQ can be resolved into at least two key components on the basis of the kinetics of relaxation in the dark (27Walters R.G. Horton P. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 27: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A rapidly relaxing component, referred to here as NPQf, reflects the safe dissipation of excess absorbed quanta as heat. This process, which serves to regulate the efficiency of light harvesting, is dependent upon a thylakoid ΔpH for its formation. As such it can be eliminated in the presence of uncouplers such as nigericin. To test the efficacy of the nigericin treatment of tobacco protoplasts in this study, chlorophyll a fluorescence quenching analysis was used as a non invasive, indirect assessment of the thylakoid ΔpH. Fig. 2 shows dark relaxation kinetics of NPQ in the tobacco protoplasts used in this study. In the untreated protoplasts (Fig. 2A) NPQ can be divided by linear regression into two distinct components, NPQf and NPQs. The rapidly relaxing component, NPQf, reflects the removal of the ΔpH in the dark and is complete within 5-10 min of dark treatment. In the presence of nigericin (Fig. 2B), the NPQf component is absent leaving only a single slowly relaxing component, NPQs. Since the rapidly relaxing component is completely dependent upon the ΔpH for its formation, these data demonstrate that the nigericin treatment of tobacco protoplasts in this study was successful in eliminating the ΔpH. This is to be expected, since this concentration of nigericin blocks the ΔpH-dependent targeting of Tat substrates in chloroplast import assays, where the chlorophyll concentration is higher than that used in protoplast assays. A related approach to dissipate the ΔpH was used in the study on Chlamydomonas (22Finazzi G. Chasen C. Wollman F-A. de Vitry C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase assays were used to study the requirement for the ΔpH during the targeting of pre-GFP and pre-GFPΔTPP in protoplasts, and the first data are shown in Fig. 3. The upper panel shows immunoprecipitates of labeled GFP polypeptides after a pulse of 1 h and a 3-h chase. In this experiment the protoplasts were fractionated to generate samples of intact chloroplasts (lane C), stroma (lane S), thylakoids (lane T), and thermolysin-treated thylakoids (lane T+). The data obtained for pre-GFP show the presence of intermediate and mature size GFP (iGFP, GFP) in the stroma, with only a minority of protein present in the thylakoids. In this experiment the thylakoid-associated mature GFP was calculated to be 18% of total imported protein, but it should be noted that a lower efficiency of thylakoid targeting is often observed (data not shown). In contrast, the pre-GFPΔTPP is imported and converted to the intermediate form (iGFP), most of which (70%) associates with the thylakoids. A significant proportion of this thylakoid-associated protein is resistant to digestion by thermolysin, implying a buried location within the membrane, while other molecules are converted to a smaller degradation product (DP). These data closely resemble those obtained in a recent study (23Di Cola A. Robinson C.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in which a variety of controls were used to confirm that the stromal mature size GFP arose from partial translocation across the thylakoid by the Tat system, maturation by TPP, and return to the stroma. Fig. 3B shows that 2 μm nigericin does not block the maturation of pre-GFP during a 2.5- or 5-h chase period. The ratio of intermediate: mature size protein is similar in each case and maturation is also observed in the presence of 5 μm nigericin, although this concentration is somewhat toxic and some smearing of the protein bands is apparent. Fig. 3C shows that the iGFP and most of the mature size GFP is located in the stroma in both the absence and presence of nigericin, as expected given the stromal location of these forms in the absence of nigericin as shown in the upper panel. These data show that the thylakoid ΔpH is not required for the initiation of translocation by the Tat translocon and partial translocation across the membrane. The ΔpH Is Not Required for the Complete Translocation of 23K or the Stable Insertion of Pre-GFPΔTPP—To further probe the importance of the ΔpH for Tat-dependent targeting, we studied two substrates that are transported either partially or entirely across the membrane. The first is pre-GFPΔTPP, which is transported into a thermolysin-resistant location within the thylakoid membrane as shown in Fig. 3 and other studies (23Di Cola A. Robinson C.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows chloroplast fractionation tests after 1 h pulse labeling + 3-h chase in the absence or presence of nigericin, and Fig. 4 shows that essentially identical results are obtained in each case. Approximately half of the imported intermediate form of pre-GFPΔTPP is localized in the thylakoid membrane (T) where it is largely resistant to digestion by thermolysin. Some proteolytic clipping of the stromal intermediate is observed (degradation product denoted DP). The data demonstrate that the ΔpH is not required for this partial translocation process. A further test is shown in Fig. 4B, where we studied the authentic Tat substrate pre-23K. Note that the protein was modified by the addition of two methionine residues at the extreme C terminus; this was carried out to facilitate radiolabeling of the protein, since mature pea 23K does not contain methionine. Like pre-GFP, this protein is subject to translocation reversal under these expression conditions but to a much lesser extent; we usually find that about 30-40% of the protein is correctly targeted into the thylakoid lumen. Some of the thylakoid-associated, mature size 23K is protected from proteolysis, suggestive of a lumenal location (23Di Cola A. Robinson C.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows fractionation tests to determine the locations of the imported bands after pulse-chase assays ± nigericin, and as with the previous experiments, the data show that nigericin has no significant effect on the overall targeting process. In both the presence and absence of nigericin, imported pre-23K is found as both the intermediate and mature size forms in the stroma, and mature size protein is also present in the thylakoid fraction. In higher plant leaves, the thylakoid proton motive force is almost entirely in the form of ΔpH under steady state conditions; the electrical potential, ΔΨ is negligible due to ion movements across the membrane (31Vredenberg W.J. Bulychev A.A. Plant Sci. Lett. 1976; 7: 101-107Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that the ΔΨ may actually contribute to the proton motive force under some circumstances (32Theg S.M. Cline K. Finazzi G. Wollman F.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 153-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and this may explain, at least in part, the ability of the Tat system to function in the absence of a ΔpH in Chlamydomonas. To completely exclude the role of either component in Tat-dependent targeting of these substrates, we carried out a comparative test on the effects of selectively dissipating the ΔpH or ΔΨ alone with nigericin or valinomycin, respectively, or of eliminating both components using a combination of the two compounds. Valinomycin was used at a concentration of 2 μm, which is a 2-fold excess compared with the concentrations used in previous studies (20Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12189-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to ensure that the ΔΨ was fully dissipated. Fig. 5A shows pulse-chase assays in which protoplasts expressing pre-GFP were labeled for 1 h in the presence of nigericin, valinomycin, or both as indicated and then analyzed immediately (0 h) or after a 5-h chase as indicated. Cells expressing pre-GFPΔTPP were analyzed in parallel to provide a size marker for the iGFP polypeptide. The data show that, as before, the pre-GFP is converted to a mixture of iGFP and mature size GFP. The efficiency of maturation is very similar in the control (Con) and + valinomycin samples, confirming that the ΔΨ is not required for maturation. A reduction in maturation efficiency is observed in the presence of nigericin alone or nigericin + valinomycin, but the inhibition is only partial, and a substantial level of maturation is observed even at the zero time point in the chase period. This shows that the initial translocation of this protein can occur in the complete absence of the proton motive force. We considered it possible that the combined presence of nigericin + valinomycin may have toxic side effects in vivo, possibly as a result of inhibiting ATP synthesis in the cells. To address this possibility we tested whether protein synthesis is affected by analyzing the total radio-labeled protein complement from the same samples. The data (Fig. 5B) show that protein synthesis is indeed inhibited to some extent in the nigericin-treated cells, since the proteins are more weakly labeled. This may represent a preliminary indication that the cells may indeed suffer side effects under these conditions. Summary—One current model for the operation of the thylakoid Tat system involves the binding of substrate to the Hcf106-cpTatC complex and the subsequent recruitment of the Tha4 complex to form the fully active translocon. The presence of both substrate and a ΔpH was proposed to be essential for the coalescence of the two complexes, on the basis that inter-complex cross-links were only observed under these conditions (19Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The ΔpH has also been proposed to provide the driving force for translocation and the proton: substrate translocation stoichiometry has been calculated in thylakoid import assays (33Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, all of these assays have been performed using in vitro reconstitution assays, and recent studies have strongly suggested that additional factors may influence the Tat system in vivo. In one study, the targeting of Tat substrates was found to be ΔpH-independent in the unicellular alga C. reinhardtii (22Finazzi G. Chasen C. Wollman F-A. de Vitry C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In another, we recently found that expression of Tat substrates in transfected tobacco protoplasts resulted in “translocation reversal” within the Tat translocon to a remarkable extent. This may stem from the high level expression of substrates in this system, but this alone does not explain why translocation is aborted so frequently, since this phenomenon was not observed in several previous studies when saturation of the Tat pathway was achieved in vitro (e.g. Ref. 34Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the stress associated with protoplast generation may lead to the production of factors that indirectly induce translocation reversal. It should, however, be emphasized that the protoplasts expressing the Tat substrates in this study are intact, the chloroplasts are equally intact, and photosynthetic efficiency is high, indicating that the cells as a whole are highly functional. Moreover, the same experimental system has been successfully used to study intracellular protein targeting by other pathways. In vitro assays to study Tat function have invariably used higher plant chloroplasts and in this report we have sought to use the tobacco protoplast system to analyze the role of the ΔpH in Tat function in a higher plant. Barley leaves were also analyzed in the Chlamydomonas study described above (22Finazzi G. Chasen C. Wollman F-A. de Vitry C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a radiolabeled 23-kDa protein was observed in the supernatant from chaotrope-treated thylakoids even in the presence of nigericin, suggesting that it had been transported across the membrane in a ΔpH-independent manner. However, the barley 23-kDa protein was not formally identified as 23K, the levels of 23K in the stroma were not analyzed, and the kinetics of maturation were not addressed. These experiments are, technically, very difficult using intact leaves. The protoplast system, on the other hand, can be used to address these issues because radiolabeling and organelle isolation is relatively straightforward. Athough the underlying causes of the observed translocation reversal observed recently are not understood, it is clear that the partial translocation of pre-GFP and the translocation of pre-23K to a protease-protected location is mediated in each case by the Tat pathway, and their maturation is carried out by TPP on the trans side of the thylakoid membrane (23Di Cola A. Robinson C.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used sensitive assays to study the role of the ΔpH in this process, and the results again point to major differences between the in vitro and in vivo assays. While the transport of pre-GFP across the thylakoid membrane is entirely ΔpH-dependent in isolated chloroplasts, as expected from numerous previous studies on Tat substrates (e.g. (20Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12189-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), dissipation of the ΔpH has no significant inhibitory effect on the maturation of either pre-GFP or pre-23K in transfected protoplasts. The data therefore demonstrate that the ΔpH is not required for the initial assembly of the Tat translocon in vivo or for partial translocation to the point where the signal peptide cleavage point is exposed on the trans side of the membrane. At this point, the GFP would be fully contained within the confines of the membrane bilayer, assuming that translocation occurs in a folded state. The data also raise the possibility that the ΔpH is not required for full translocation into the lumen; while the efficiency of pre-GFP translocation is very low because of the extensive translocation reversal, the pre-23K does appear to be transported into the lumen with higher efficiency, and its transport is not significantly affected by ΔpH removal. However, we are aware that 23K is transported with relatively low efficiency under these conditions and we cannot rule out the possibility that the ΔpH may stimulate translocation under conditions where translocation reversal is less prevalent. We conclude that key factors play a role in the energetics of Tat-dependent protein transport in vivo, and given the remarkable differences between the in vitro and in vivo targeting characterstics, a detailed understanding of these unknown factors is clearly essential for a full understanding of this system."
https://openalex.org/W2045608437,"The human fatty-acid synthase (HFAS) is a potential target for anti-tumor drug discovery. As a prelude to the design of compounds that target the enoyl reductase (ER) component of HFAS, the recognition of NADPH and exogenous substrates by the ER active site has been investigated. Previous studies demonstrate that modification of Lys-1699 by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate results in a specific decrease in ER activity. For the overall HFAS reaction, the K1699A and K1699Q mutations reduced kcat and kcat/KNADPH by 8- and 600-fold, respectively (where KNADPH indicates the Km value for NADPH). Thus, Lys-1699 contributes 4 kcal/mol to stabilization of the rate-limiting transition state following NADPH binding, while also stabilizing the most stable ground state after NADPH binding by 3 kcal/mol. A similar effect of the mutations on the ER partial reaction was observed, in agreement with the proposal that Lys-1699 is located in the ER NADPH-binding site. Most unexpectedly, however, both kcat and kcat/KNADPH for the β-ketoacyl reductase (BKR) reaction were also impacted by the Lys-1699 mutations, raising the possibility that the ER and BKR activities share a single active site. However, based on previous data indicating that the two reductase activities utilize distinct cofactor binding sites, mutagenesis of Lys-1699 is hypothesized to modulate BKR activity via allosteric effects between the ER and BKR NADPH sites.

In addition, there is an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain, which carries fatty acyl intermediates in the form of fatty acyl thioesters (5Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Palmitate, a C16-saturated fatty acid, is the major product produced (5Wakil S.J.

Fatty acid synthesis, although important evolutionarily for survival during famines (1Kuhajda F.P.

This is because of the dietary intake of lipids, which causes HFAS to be down-regulated in normal cells (6Li J.N. Gorospe M. Chrest F.J. Kumaravel T.S. Evans M.K. Han W.F. Pizer E.S.

However, HFAS overexpression in many cancers, such as in breast, prostate, and colon tumors, and also in many pre-malignant growths, has led to the hypothesis that HFAS is an important target for the study of tumor biology (7Takahiro T.

Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the development of antibacterial compounds that target prokaryotic fatty acid synthesis. Thus, an initial interest in HFAS was as a control system for validating the specificity of our bacterial FAS inhibitors. However, as described above, HFAS is now thought to be a bona fide target in its own right as a putative anti-tumor target. There have also been suggestions that HFAS inhibitors might provide some therapeutic benefit in the control of obesity (15Cha S.H. Hu Z. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Thupari J.N. Kim E.K. Moran T.H. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Am. J.

A. 2002; 99: 9498-9502Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Initial reports on the anti-tumor activity of HFAS inhibitors focused on compounds that target the β-ketoacyl synthase activity, such as cerulenin and C75 (14Kuhajda F.P. Pizer E.S. Li J.N. Mani N.S. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3450-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). More recently, Anderson and co-workers (18Liu B. Wang Y. Fillgrove K.L. Anderson V.E. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 49: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have reported that triclosan, an antibacterial additive in many personal care products, inhibited the enoyl reductase activity of HFAS with an IC50 value of 50 μm and also prevented the growth of a breast cancer cell line at a similar concentration. In order to provide information relevant to the design of compounds that target the ER component of HFAS, we have performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the overall and partial reactions catalyzed by HFAS. These studies have been extended to include mutants of Lys-1699, a residue that is modified by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP). Lys-1699 is part of a characteristic SXXK motif found in PLP-dependent enzymes (19Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although mammalian FAS does not require PLP, the site-specific incorporation of PLP was used to show that Lys-1699 is located close to the ER active site in the goose and chicken FAS enzymes (2Katiyar S.S. Porter J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Chang S.I. Hammes G.G.

A. 1995; 92: 8695-8699Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In order to explore the role of Lys-1699 in more detail, we used site-directed mutagenesis to alter Lys-1699, and we carried out detailed kinetic experiments to determine the effect of these mutations on the overall and partial reactions catalyzed by HFAS. For the overall HFAS reaction, these studies reveal that Lys-1699 stabilizes the rate-limiting transition state following NADPH binding by 4 kcal/mol and also stabilizes the ground state to which NADPH binds by 3 kcal/mol. Lys-1699 also makes similar contributions to ground and transition state stabilization in the ER reaction, as expected from the PLP labeling studies. However, unexpectedly the BKR reaction is also affected by mutation of Lys-1699. By analogy to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, a likely mechanism by which Lys-1699 acts is via direct interactions with NADPH in the ER cofactor binding site. A similar role can be envisaged for Lys-1699 in the BKR reaction, if both BKR and ER activities are catalyzed by a single active site. Alternatively, if the BKR and ER enzymes utilize separate cofactor binding sites, then modulation of the BKR reaction through interaction of NADPH with Lys-1699 must occur through allosteric effects between the two binding sites. In the course of kinetic experiments to determine kcat and Km values for the overall HFAS reaction as well as each individual component, we noted that kcat for the reduction of crotonyl-CoA was lower than the value obtained for the overall reaction. In order to explore the role of the intrinsic ACP moiety in the interaction of exogenously added substrates with HFAS, we mutated Ser-2151, the point of pantetheine attachment, to HFAS (22Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and we investigated the chain length specificity of the enzyme toward exogenously added enoyl reductase substrates. Materials—A pFastBac1 clone containing the cDNA coding for the entire HFAS protein with a C-terminal His tag was a generous gift from GlaxoSmithKline. Oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Pfu polymerase, the BAC-to-BAC baculovirus expression system, Escherichia coli maximum efficiency DH10 Bac competent cells, and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells were obtained from Invitrogen. pBluescript and E. coli XL-1 Blue competent cells were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the AatII, MluI, HindIII, EcoRI, and BamHI restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing was carried out on an MJ Research PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller from Global Medical Instrumentation, Inc. (Ramsey, MN). The DNA Sequencing Facility at Stony Brook University provided the ABI BigDye reaction mix. The NADPH, CoA lithium salt, ethyl chloroformate, triethylamine, 2-octenoic acid (predominantly trans), and crotonyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma, and the His-Bind resin was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Amersham Biosciences provided the Sephadex G-25 (fine) resin and the chromatography columns, and the 10% Tris-glycine gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. Dialysis membrane, all buffer reagents, and solvents were purchased from Fisher. 2-trans-Dodecenoic acid was purchased from TCI Chemicals. Construction of the K1699A, K1699Q, and S2151A Mutants—Mutagenesis on the original HFAS insert and vector was problematic because of the large size of this construct (13 kb). Consequently, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a portion of the HFAS cDNA containing the target site for mutagenesis that had been subcloned into pBluescript (3 kb). For the K1699A and K1699Q mutants, EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites were initially used to remove a portion of the HFAS cDNA from pFastBac1 and to insert this segment into pBlue-script KS. Following site-directed mutagenesis, the MluI and AatII restriction sites were used to remove a segment of the HFAS cDNA encompassing the site of mutation from pBluescript KS. The pFastBacI vector containing the mutant HFAS cDNA was then generated by three-way ligation. This involved ligating the MluI/AatII DNA fragment to pFastBac1 that had been digested with MluI and HindIII, together with a second DNA fragment generated from HFAS-pFastBacI using the AatII and HindIII sites. The S2151A mutant was generated using a similar protocol using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites to transfer the relevant HFAS cDNA between pFastBacI and pBluescript.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant HFAS Proteins—The pFastBac1 constructs were utilized to produce recombinant baculoviral stocks by the transposition procedure of the BAC-to-BAC baculovirus expression system. Sf9 cells were transfected with recombinant bacmid DNA, and virus was harvested from cell culture medium at 72 h post-transfection. Each viral stock was subjected to two rounds of amplification after which the viral titer was determined. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus, and a cell pellet was collected 72 h post-infection. The pellet was resuspended in 15–30 ml of His-bind buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and lysed by French press (5 times at 1000 p.s.i.). The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 33,000 rpm for 90 min, and the supernatant was filtered with a 0.45-μm Millipore filter and applied to a His-bind resin column (5-ml bed volume). The His-bind column was washed with His-bind buffer and then with wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Protein elution was performed using a gradient of 5 mm to 1 m imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing wild-type or mutant HFAS proteins were then immediately chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 column, equilibrated with 0.8 m KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The protein was dialyzed into 0.8 m KH2PO4, pH 7.4, buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol using molecular porous membrane tubing. Subsequently, 100–200-μl aliquots of protein were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen with 20% glycerol for storage at –80 °C. Protein expression and purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-glycine gels. Protein concentration was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (ϵ280) of 279650 m–1 cm–1 calculated at Expasy (www.expasy.ch) by assuming one active site per monomer. Protein yield was assessed using the calculated molecular mass of 273 kDa (www.expasy.ch). Synthesis of 2-Octenoyl-CoA and 2-Dodecenoyl-CoA—2-Octenoyl-CoA (C8-CoA) and 2-dodecenoyl-CoA (C12-CoA) were synthesized from the respective acids using the mixed anhydride method (24Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilcheze C. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 25Parikh S. Moynihan D.P. Xiao G. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13623-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 300 mg (1.5 mmol) of trans-2-dodecenoic acid was dissolved slowly in 2 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then placed in a flask that had been purged with nitrogen gas. 210 mg (2.1 mmol) of anhydrous triethylamine in 1 ml of THF was added slowly to the flask followed by 386 mg (3.6 mmol) of ethylchloroformate in 1 ml of THF, which resulted in the formation of a white precipitate. An additional 2 ml of THF was added, and then the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. 750 μl of the mixed anhydride was filtered with glass wool in a Pasteur pipette, and 500 μl of the filtrate was added dropwise with stirring to 30 mg of CoA dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm Na2CO3 at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by evaluating the amount of free thiol in solution using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (26Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21357) Google Scholar). When no more free thiol was present, the reaction mixture was immediately purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Shimadzu), using a Phenomenex C18-preparative column. Purification was performed with 20 mm ammonium acetate, 1.75% acetonitrile (Buffer A) with a 0–100% gradient of 95% acetonitrile, 5% H2O (Buffer B) for 90 min and a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Chromatography was monitored at 260 and 280 nm with a Shimadzu SPD-10A UV-visible detector, and the retention time for C12-CoA was 35–40 min. Fractions containing C12-CoA were combined, lyophilized, re-dissolved in 500 μl of H2O, and re-lyophilized to remove all ammonium acetate. The C12-CoA was then dissolved in 500 μl of H2O and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in 50-μl aliquots for storage at –80 °C. The mass spectrometry (atmospheric pressure ionization-electrospray) calculated for C33H56N7O17P3S was 947.27, and found was 948.20 [M + H]+. 2-Octenoyl-CoA was synthesized using a similar method. The product eluted from the C18 column at 25 min. The mass spectrometry (atmospheric pressure ionization-electrospray) calculated for C29H48N7O17P3S was 891.20 and found was 892.51 [M + H]+. Kinetic Analysis of the Overall HFAS Reaction and HFAS Partial Activities—Specific activities for the overall HFAS reaction were determined at 25 °C in 500 μl of assay buffer (0.1 m KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) using 100 μm NADPH, 20 nm wild-type HFAS or 80–160 nm mutant HFAS, 25 μm acetyl-CoA, and 100 μm malonyl-CoA. The rate of the reaction was determined by monitoring the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm, and initial velocities were calculated using an extinction coefficient (ϵ340) of 6,300 m–1 cm–1. Partial activities were determined using a similar protocol in the same assay buffer. ER activity was determined using 100 μm NADPH, 80 nm HFAS or 160 nm mutant HFAS, and 100 μm crotonyl-CoA, whereas BKR activity was determined using 100 μm NADPH, 20 nm wild-type HFAS or 160 nm mutant HFAS, and 100 μm acetoacetyl-CoA. DH activity was determined by monitoring the hydration of crotonyl-CoA at 280 nm using 80 nm HFAS and μm substrate. An extinction coefficient (ϵ280) of 3600 m–1 cm–1 was used for the conversion of crotonyl-CoA into 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The above assay conditions were also used for the determination of kcat and Km values. For the overall HFAS reaction, KNADPH was determined by using 100 μm malonyl-CoA and 25 μm acetyl-CoA and by varying the NADPH concentration from 5 to 100 μm for wild-type and from 80 to 800 μm for the mutant enzymes. Determination of KNADPH for the mutant enzymes was performed by monitoring NADPH oxidation at 370 nm due to the high concentration of NADPH and by using an extinction coefficient of 2400 of m–1 cm–1 (27Sivaraman S. Zwahlen J. Bell A.F. Hedstrom L. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similarly, KMAL (where KMAL is the Km value for malonyl-CoA) was determined by varying the concentration of malonyl-CoA (5–100 μm for WT; 0.5–20 μm for K1699Q; 0.5–100 μm for K1699A) at fixed concentrations of NADPH (100 μm) and acetyl-CoA (25 μm). Finally, KACET (where KACET is the Km value for acetyl-CoA) was determined by varying the concentration of acetyl-CoA (0.5–50 μm for WT; 5–80 μm for K1699A; 0.06–25 μm for K1699Q) at fixed concentrations of NADPH (100 μm) and malonyl-CoA (100 μm). For the BKR reaction, the KNADPH was determined by using 100 μm AcAc-CoA, 20 nm WT, or 160 nm of mutant enzyme and by varying the NADPH concentration from 5 to 80 μm for WT, 10 to 800 μm for K1699Q, and 20 to 400 μm for K1699A. The KACAC (where KACAC is the Km value for acetoacetyl-CoA) with BKR was determined by using 100 μm NADPH, 20 nm WT or 800 μm NADPH, 160 nm of mutant enzyme and by varying the AcAc-CoA concentration from 0.5 to 100 μm for WT and K1699A and 0.5 to 20 μm for K1699Q. For ER, KNADPH was determined by using 100 μm crotonyl-CoA, 80 nm WT, or 160 nm of mutant enzyme and by varying the NADPH concentration from 0.5 to 200 μm for WT and 100 to 800 μm for the mutants. The KCRT (where KCRT is the Km value for crotonyl-CoA) for ER was evaluated by using 100 μm NADPH, 80 nm WT or 800 μm NADPH, 160 nm mutant enzyme and by varying the concentration of crotonyl-CoA from 1 to 100 μm for WT, 1 to 400 μm for K1699A, and 1 to 100 μm for K1699Q. The KCRT for DH was measured by using 80 nm WT or 160 nm mutant enzymes and by varying the concentration of crotonyl-CoA from 5 to 40 μm for WT, 5 to 200 μm for K1699A, and 5 to 400 μm for K1699Q. For the DH reaction the decrease in absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. In each case kcat and Km values were calculated by fitting the observed initial velocities to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Grafit 4.0 (Erithacus Software Ltd.). Steady State Kinetic Analysis of C8-CoA and C12-CoA with Enoyl Reductase—Kinetic parameters for the C8 and C12 substrates were determined as described above for crotonyl-CoA. The Km value for C12-CoA with ER was determined by using 100 μm NADPH and 20 nm WT HFAS and by varying the concentration of C12-CoA from 6.25 to 200 μm. The KNADPH was determined by using 25 μm C12-CoA, 20 or 160 nm WT HFAS and by varying the concentration of NADPH from 100 to 800 μm where the oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 370 nm. kcat and Km values were calculated by fitting the observed initial velocities to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Grafit 4.0. Interaction of NADPH with HFAS Monitored by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—NADPH binding to HFAS was analyzed at 25 °C using a Spex Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter. NADPH fluorescence was excited at 340 nm (5 nm slit width) and monitored between 400 and 500 nm (1 nm slit width). 1-μl aliquots of 0.3 mm NADPH were added to a cuvette containing 0.5 μm wild-type or mutant HFAS enzymes in 0.1 m KH2P04, 1mm EDTA, pH 7 buffer. The NADPH concentration ranged from 0 to 20 μm. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant HFAS Enzymes—500 ml of Sf9 insect cell culture yielded 5 mg of soluble wild-type HFAS that was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Similar quantities of the K1699Q, K1699A, and S2151A mutant proteins were also obtained. Specific activities of the overall and partial reactions catalyzed by HFAS are given for the wild-type and mutant enzymes in TABLE TWO. Wild-type HFAS had a specific activity of 440 nmol/min/mg for the overall reaction. This value, together with those for the other partial activities catalyzed by the enzyme, were in good agreement with previously published data apart from the BKR activity that was ∼7–10-fold lower (3Jayakumar A. Huang W.Y. Raetz B. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14509-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Replacement of Lys-1699 with Ala or Gln resulted in about a 10-fold decrease in specific activity for the overall reaction (TABLE TWO). In contrast, the S2151A mutant was completely inactive in all assays. To shed more light on the impact of the mutagenesis on the reactions catalyzed by HFAS, we determined kcat and Km values for the overall reaction as well as each partial reaction.TABLE TWOSpecific activities of wild-type and K1699A, K1699Q, and S2151A HFASReactionaData are given for the specific activity using NADPH, malonyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA as substrates (overall), NADPH and crotonyl-CoA (ER), NADPH and acetoacetyl-CoA (BKR), and crotonyl-CoA (DH).

Open table in a new tab Kinetic Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant HFAS Enzymes—kcat and Km values for the overall reaction catalyzed by wild-type and mutant HFAS enzymes, as well as for each partial reaction, are given in TABLE THREE. The kcat value for the overall HFAS reaction was 160 min–1, whereas the Km values for NADPH (KNADPH), malonyl-CoA (KMAL), and acetyl-CoA (KACET) were all in the low micromolar range, resulting in kcat/Km values of 20–30 μm–1 min–1. Replacement of Lys-1699 with either an Ala or Gln residue resulted in a modest (8-fold) decrease in kcat and a large 600-fold decrease in kcat/KNADPH. In contrast, kcat/KMAL and kcat/KACET were unaffected by the K1699Q mutation and decreased only slightly in the K1699A enzyme. One explanation for these data is that the interactions with Lys-1699 stabilize the most stable ground state following association of NADPH with the enzyme by around 3 kcal/mol and contribute an additional ∼1 kcal/mol to stabilization of the rate-limiting transition state for a total transition state stabilization of ∼4 kcal/mol.TABLE THREEKinetic evaluation of wild-type, K1699A, and K1699Q HFASEnzymeOverall reactionkcatKNADPHKMALKACETkcat/KNADPHaNumbers in parentheses are values relative to wild type (%).kcat/KMALaNumbers in parentheses are values relative to wild type (%).kcat/KACETaNumbers in parentheses are values relative to wild type (%).min-1μmμmμmμm-1 min-1μm-1 min-1μm-1 min-1WT160 ± 155 ± 16 ± 27 ± 332 ± 927 ± 1123 ± 12K1699A19 ± 4370 ± 903.0 ± 0.87 ± 20.05 ± 0.02 (0.2%)6 ± 3 (22%)3 ± 2 (13%)K1699Q18 ± 2400 ± 801.0 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.20.05 ± 0.02 (0.2%)18 ± 7 (67%)36 ± 18 (150%)Enzymeβ-Ketoacyl reductasekcatKNADPHKACACkcat/KNADPHaNumbers in parentheses are values relative to wild type (%).kcat/KACACaNumbers in parentheses are values relative to wild type (%). μm-1 min-1min-1μmμmμm-1 min-1WT240 ± 124 ± 210 ± 260 ± 3324 ± 6K1699A20 ± 152 ± 92.0 ± 0.30.39 ± 0.09 (0.7%)10 ± 2 (42%)K1699Q26 ± 1123 ± 141.2 ± 0.30.21 ± 0.03 (0.4%"
