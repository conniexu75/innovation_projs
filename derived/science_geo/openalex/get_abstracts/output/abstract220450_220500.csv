We have previously reported that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is mediated by the release of proinflammatory factors from activated microglia. Here, we report the pivotal role of NADPH oxidase in inflammation-mediated neurotoxicity, where the LPS-induced loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons in vivo was significantly less pronounced in NADPH oxidase-deficient (PHOX-/-) mice when compared with control (PHOX+/+) mice. Dopaminergic neurons in primary mensencephalic neuron-glia cultures from PHOX+/+ mice were significantly more sensitive to LPS-induced neurotoxicity in vitro when compared with PHOX-/- mice. Further, PHOX+/+ neuron-glia cultures chemically depleted of microglia failed to show dopaminergic neurotoxicity with the addition of LPS. Neuron-enriched cultures from both PHOX+/+ mice and PHOX-/- mice also failed to show any direct LPS-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. However, the addition of PHOX+/+ microglia to neuron-enriched cultures from either strain resulted in reinstatement of LPS-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, supporting the role of microglia as the primary source of NADPH oxidase-generated insult and neurotoxicity. Immunostaining for F4/80 in mensencephalic neuron-glia cultures revealed that PHOX-/- microglia failed to show activated morphology at 10 h, suggesting an important role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from NADPH oxidase in the early activation of microglia. LPS also failed to elicit extracellular superoxide and produced low levels of intracellular ROS in microglia-enriched cultures from PHOX-/- mice. Gene expression and release of tumor necrosis factor α was much lower in PHOX-/- mice than in control PHOX+/+ mice. Together, these results demonstrate the dual neurotoxic functions of microglial NADPH oxidase: 1) the production of extracellular ROS that is toxic to dopamine neurons and 2) the amplification of proinflammatory gene expression and associated neurotoxicity.

The pathogenesis of several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and the AIDS dementia complex, has been closely associated with localized inflammatory responses in the brain (1.Dickson D.W.

Ignarro L.J. Med. Hypotheses. 1992; 39: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Glial cell activation and oxidative stress have been frequently observed during the course of these disease processes (5.Cicchetti F. Brownell A.L. Williams K. Chen Y.I. Livni E. Isacson O. Eur. J.

Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, are extremely responsive to environmental stress or immunological challenges and have been implicated as the predominant cell type governing inflammation-mediated neuronal damage (3.Liu B.

In particular, activated microglia exert cytotoxic effects by releasing inflammatory mediators, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; DA, dopamine; IR, immunoreactive; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; SN, substantia nigra; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcriptase. tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin-1, nitric oxide, arachidonic acid metabolites, and quinolinic acid (12.Boje K.M.

Although these immunotoxic factors are necessary for normal function, the microglia response must be tightly regulated to avoid overactivation and disastrous neurotoxic consequences (3.Liu B. Hong J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). ROS generated by phagocytic cells, such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, lipid hydroperoxides, and their by-products (e.g. hydrogen peroxide), are reported to have dual functions in the inflammatory response. First, microglia respond to toxic agents, such as the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 coat protein gp120, and β-amyloid peptides, and release ROS, which in turn induce neuronal degeneration (6.Liu B.

Liu B. Wilson B. Hong J.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Specifically, both in vitro and in vivo studies support the possibility that microglia-mediated neurotoxicity is influenced by the release of superoxide and other ROS (3.Liu B. Hong J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 9.Gao H.M. Jiang J. Wilson B. Zhang W. Hong J.S. Liu B. J.

Alternatively, there is increasing evidence that ROS can also function as second messengers to regulate several downstream signaling molecules, including protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NF-κB (19.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 20.Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M.

In phagocytic cells such as macrophages, activation of the NADPH oxidase pathway initiates an intracellular ROS signaling pathway that can amplify the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα (22.Forman H.J. Torres M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 166: S4-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, NADPH oxidase is an important source of ROS generation for both oxidative burst (23.Glass G.A. DeLisle D.M. DeTogni P. Gabig T.G. Magee B.H. Markert M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13247-13251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cell signaling pathways (24.Goldman R. Ferber E. Zort U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that intracellular ROS mediate β-amyloid peptide-induced microglial activation, whereas inhibition of intracellular ROS results in the reduction of β-amyloid-induced NF-κB activation and lowered interleukin-1β expression (25.Kang J. Park E.J. Jou I. Kim J.H. Joe E.H. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). LPS is one of the most common inflammogens used to investigate the impact of inflammation on neuron death. The intracellular signaling mechanisms related to the effects of LPS have been well studied in several types of cells including macrophage, microglia, and astrocytes (26.Boulet I. Ralph S. Stanley E. Lock P. Dunn A.R. Green S.P. Phillips W.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19424-19430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS is known to activate protein kinase C, protein-tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and NF-κB, which have been implicated in the release of immune-related cytotoxic factors, such as NO and proinflammatory cytokines (26.Boulet I. Ralph S. Stanley E. Lock P. Dunn A.R. Green S.P. Phillips W.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J.

Given the reported influence of intracellular ROS signaling on several kinase-mediated pathways (31.Ueda S. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Tanaka T. Ueno M. Yodoi J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), this common LPS signaling pathway in microglia presents a likely target for downstream ROS signaling. The production of intracellular ROS results from the process of normal cellular function and metabolism and may originate from multiple cellular sources, such as xanthine oxidase, mitochondrial electron transport, NADPH oxidase, peroxisomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum (32.Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The identification of ROS as a primary factor in LPS-mediated neurodegeneration, the localization of the source of ROS causing the neurotoxic effects, and the elucidation of the signaling pathway driving microglial overactivation is of paramount importance to understanding the molecular mechanisms of the neurodegenerative disease state. In effort to answer these questions, the following group of experiments sought to discern the role of NADPH oxidase in microglia-mediated neurotoxicity as both a source of neurotoxic ROS and as a critical cellular mediator responsible for the amplification of the microglia proinflammatory response. In this paper, we have performed both an in vivo study by nigral injection of LPS and an in vitro study using mesencephalic neuron-glia or enriched microglial cultures from both PHOX-deficient mice and PHOX+/+ control mice in effort to delineate the role of NADPH oxidase-generated ROS in LPS-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and to discern the underlying mechanism. Animals—Eight-week-old male (25-30 g) and female (25-30 g) B6.129S6-Cybbtm1Din (PHOX-/-) and C57BL/6J 000664 (PHOX+/+) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). B6.129S6-Cybbtm1Din PHOX-/- mice are lacking a functional gp91 protein, the catalytic subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. The PHOX-/- mutation is maintained in the C57BL/6J 000664 background; therefore, C57BL/6J 000664 (PHOX+/+) mice were used as control animals. Breeding of the mice was performed to achieve accurate timed pregnancy within ± 0.5 days. Reagents—Lipopolysaccharide (strain O111:B4) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Cell culture ingredients were obtained from Invitrogen. [3H]Dopamine (DA; 28 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal antibody against neuron-specific nuclear protein (Neu-N) was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and antibody diluent came from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). The polyclonal antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was a kind gift from Dr. John Reinhard of Glaxo Wellcome (Research Triangle Park, NC). Rat monoclonal antibody raised against F4/80 antigen was purchased from Serotec (Washington, D. C.). Biotinylated horse anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents came from Sigma. LPS Injection in Vivo—Male PHOX-/- and PHOX+/+ mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg) and positioned in a small animal stereotaxic apparatus. Injection of LPS into substantia nigra (SN) was made using the flowing stereotaxic coordinates, measured from bregma (33.Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar): 3.0 mm posterior, 1.3 mm lateral, and 4.7 mm ventral. LPS (5 μg in 2 μl of saline) was injected into the right side of the SN over a period of 2 min, and the injection needle was kept in place for 2 min after the injection. A control injection of saline alone was made into the left side of SN under the conditions described above. Eight animals were used for each strain. Mesencephalic Neuron-Glia Cultures—Mouse ventral mesencephalic neuron-glia were prepared following a previously described protocol (34.Liu B. Du L. Kong L.Y. Hudson P.M. Wilson B.C. Chang R.C. Abel H.H. Hong J.S. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, ventral mesencephalic tissues dissected from embryonic day 13/14. PHOX+/+or PHOX-/- tissues were dissociated by mild mechanical trituration in minimum essential medium. The cells were plated (5 × 105/well) in 24-well culture plates precoated with poly-d-lysine (20 μg/ml) and cultured using the previously reported procedure (34.Liu B. Du L. Kong L.Y. Hudson P.M. Wilson B.C. Chang R.C. Abel H.H. Hong J.S. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The composition of the mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures was determined by immunocytochemistry. The mouse mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures contained 10-11% F4/80-IR microglia, 40% Neu-N-IR neurons, and 1% TH-IR dopaminergic neurons. The remaining cells were presumed to be astroglia. Mesencephalic Microglia-depleted Cultures—Mesencephalic neuron-glia were seeded at 5 × 105/well in 24-well plates. Microglia were depleted by 0.5 mm l-leucine methyl ester for 72 h. The cultures stained with F4/80 antibody showed less than 0.1% microglia. Mesencephalic Neuron-enriched Cultures—Mesencephalic neuron-glia seeded at 5 × 105/well in 24-well plates were treated with 5 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside at 48 h. Two days later, the cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside was removed. The cultures stained with F4/80 and GFAP antibodies showed a purity of >98%. Microglia-enriched Cultures—Primary microglia were prepared from whole brains of 2-day-old control (PHOX+/+) or PHOX-/- pups following a previously described protocol (34.Liu B. Du L. Kong L.Y. Hudson P.M. Wilson B.C. Chang R.C. Abel H.H. Hong J.S. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at 5× 104/well in 96-well plates for TNFα or superoxide assays. The purity of microglia was >98%. Analysis of Neurotoxicity—The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was assessed by measuring the ability of cultures to take up [3H]DA and counting the number of TH-IR neurons following immunostaining in mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures. For in vivo study, 24 consecutive brain slices (35-μm thickness), which encompassed the entire substantia nigra, compact, were collected. A normal distribution of the number of TH-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons in the substantia nigra, compact was constructed based on the counts of 24 slices from PHOX-/- mutant mice and PHOX+/+ mice. The distribution curves from these two noninjected groups superimpose and show no difference in number and shape of the curves. Eight evenly spaced brain slices from saline or LPS-injected animals were immunostained with an antibody against TH and counted. The distribution of the cell numbers from each animal was matched with the normal distribution curve to correct for errors resulting from the cutting. With stereology equipment, three individuals and the Computer-Assisted Stereology Toolbox (Olympus Danmark A/S, Albertslund, Denmark) system performed counting in a double-blind manner. Conclusions were drawn only when the difference was within 5%. Uptake Assay—The cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 1 μm [3H]DA in Krebs-Ringer buffer (16 mm NaH2PO4, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 119 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Nonspecific uptake was measured in the presence of 10 μm mazindol. After the cells were washed (three times) with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer (1 ml/well) and lysed with 1 n NaOH (0.5 ml/well), the lysate was mixed with 15 ml of scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. The specific [3H]DA was calculated by subtracting the amount of radioactivity obtained in the presence of mazindol from that obtained in the absence of mazindol. Immunostaining—Neurons were stained with the antibody against Neu-N, for neuronal cell bodies but not for neurites. Microglia were stained with rat monoclonal antibody raised against F4/80 antigen, and astrocytes were stained with the antibody against GFAP, an intermediate filament protein whose synthesis is restricted to astrocytes. Dopamine neurons were detected with the polyclonal antibody against TH. Briefly, the cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing (two times) with PBS, the cultures were treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The cultures were again washed (three times) with PBS and then incubated for 40 min with blocking solution (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 4% appropriate serum: normal horse serum for Neu-N, or F4/80 and normal goat serum for TH or GFAP staining). The cultures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in DAKO antibody diluent, and then the cells were washed (three times) for 10 min each time in PBS. The cultures were next incubated for 1 h with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Neu-N, horse anti-mouse antibody, 1:227; TH or GFAP, goat anti-rabbit antibody, 1:227; F4/80, mouse anti-rat antibody, 1:500). After washing (three times) with PBS, the cultures were incubated for 1 h with the Vectastain ABC reagents diluted in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After washing (two times) with PBS, the bound complex was visualized by incubating cultures with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and urea-hydrogen peroxide tablets from Sigma dissolved in water. Color development was terminated by removing the reagents and washing the cultures (two times) with PBS. For cell counting, nine representative areas/well in the 24-well plate were counted under the microscope at 100× magnification. Superoxide Assay—The amount of extracellular superoxide (O2˙-) produced was determined by measuring the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of tetrazolium salt, WST-1 (35.Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 293: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 36.Liu B. Hong J.S. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 79: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Tan A.S. Berridge M.V. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 238: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Primary microglia were plated at 5 × 104/well in 200 μl of culture medium in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). To each well, 100 μl of HBSS with or without superoxide dismutase (600 units/ml), 50 μl of vehicle or LPS, and 50 μl of WST-1 (1 mm) in HBSS were added. The cultures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and 95% air. The absorbance at 450 nm was read with a Spectra Max Plus microtiter plate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable superoxide was calculated and expressed as a percentage of vehicle-treated control cultures. Intracellular oxidative stress was measured by DCFH Oxidation. DCFH-DA enters cells passively and is deacetylated by esterase to nonfluorescent DCFH. DCFH reacts with ROS to form DCF, the fluorescent product. DCFH-DA was dissolved in methanol at 10 mm and was diluted 500-fold in HBSS to give DCFH-DA at 20 μm. The cells were exposed to DCFH-DA for 1 h and then treated with HBSS containing the corresponding concentrations of LPS for 2 h. The fluorescence was read immediately at wavelengths of 485 nm for excitation and 530 nm for emission on a fluorescence plate reader. The value subtracted by control group was viewed as the increase of intracellular ROS. Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—The level of TNFα gene expression was quantified using real time RT-PCR analysis as described by Walker (38.Walker N.J. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2001; 15: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures from PHOX-/- and PHOX+/+ mice using Trizol reagent, followed by purification with RNeasy column (Qiagen). Total RNA was reverse transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. The following forward and reverse primers for TNFα were designed using Primer Express software (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA): TNFα forward, 5′-GAC CCT CAC ACT CAG ATC ATC TTC T-3′; TNFα reverse, 5′-CCT CCA CTT GGT GGT TTG CT-3′. The SYBR green DNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for real time PCR analysis. The relative differences in expression between groups were expressed using cycle time values normalized with β-actin, and the relative differences between control and treatment groups were calculated and expressed as relative increases setting control as 100%. TNFα Assay—Release of TNFα was measured with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), as described previously (6.Liu B. Gao H.M. Wang J.Y. Jeohn G.H. Cooper C.L. Hong J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 962: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E., and statistical significance was assessed with an analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's t test using the StatView program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PHOX -/- Mice Show Reduced LPS-induced DA Neurotoxicity in the Substantia Nigra in Vivo—To investigate the role of NADPH oxidase-generated ROS in LPS-induced neurotoxicity, LPS (5 μg in 2 μl of saline) was stereotaxically injected into the SN of PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- mice. Fourteen days later, the brains were removed, and coronal sections through the nigral complex were taken. The sections were immunostained with an antibody against TH to detect dopaminergic neurons. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that LPS injections caused a greater loss of TH-IR neurons in the SN of PHOX+/+ mice than that of PHOX-/- mice, compared with the corresponding saline-injected sides (Fig. 1A). Cell count analysis revealed a 44% loss of DA neurons in PHOX+/+ controls and 18% loss in PHOX-/- mutants, compared with the corresponding saline-injected control sides (Fig. 1B). These results showed that TH-IR neurons in the substantia nigra of PHOX-/- mutants were less affected by LPS-induced inflammatory insult, compared with PHOX+/+ controls. These findings suggest that NADPH oxidase-generated ROS play an important role in LPS-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Neuron-Glia Cultures from PHOX-/- Mice Show Reduced LPS-induced DA Neurotoxicity than Those from PHOX+/+ Mice—To further understand the mechanisms underlying the difference in LPS-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity between PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- mice observed in vivo, mixed mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures from PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- mice were treated with either vehicle or LPS (1-100 ng/ml). Neurotoxicity was assessed by DA uptake, morphological analysis and TH-IR neuron number. The cultures from PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- mice showed a concentration-dependent decrease in both [3H]DA uptake and the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons. However, in neuron-glia cultures from PHOX-/- mice, the decrease in DA uptake and the number of TH-IR neurons was significantly less than that in neuron-glia cultures from PHOX+/+ mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Morphological analysis showed that TH-IR neurons in the LPS-treated cultures from PHOX+/+ mice displayed shorter and less elaborate TH-IR dendrites compared with those from PHOX-/- mice (Fig. 2C). This difference in the LPS-induced neurotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons between the cultures from PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- mice suggests an important role for ROS in LPS-induced neuron death. NADPH oxidase mediates LPS-induced morphological changes associated with the activation of microglia. Earlier work from our laboratory demonstrates that LPS is not directly toxic to dopaminergic neurons and that microglia, rather than astroglia, are pivotal to LPS-induced neurotoxicity (39.Kim W.G. Mohney R.P. Wilson B. Jeohn G.H. Liu B. Hong J.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6309-6316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether microglia were the source of NADPH oxidase and consequent neurotoxicity for LPS-treated cells, the PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- mesencephalic neuron-glia, neuron-astrocyte, and neuron-enriched cultures were treated with vehicle or 100 ng/ml LPS for 7 days, respectively. In neuron-glia cultures, LPS caused a significant decrease in DA uptake (Fig. 3A). In neuron-astrocyte cultures, the PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- mesencephalic neuron-glia were treated with l-leucine methyl ester to chemically deplete the microglia. l-Leucine methyl ester-treated PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- cultures devoid of microglia did not show significant neurotoxicity (Fig. 3B). The result was further confirmed by the PHOX+/+ and PHOX-/- neuron-enriched cultures treated with LPS (Fig. 3C), wh"

The BRCA1 COOH-terminal (BRCT) domains are protein modules found in many proteins that regulate DNA damage responses (Koonin, E. V., Altschul, S. F., and Bork, P. (1996) Nat. Genet. 13, 266-268). Whether BRCT domains can mediate phosphorylation-dependent interactions has not been systematically investigated. We report here that the BRCT domains also recognize phosphopeptides. Oriented peptide library analysis indicated that the BRCT domains from BRCA1, MDC1, BARD1, and DNA Ligase IV preferred distinct phosphoserine-containing peptides. In addition, the interaction between BRCA1 and the BRCT binding motif of BACH1 was required for BACH1 checkpoint activity. Furthermore, BRCT domains of the yeast DNA repair protein Rad9 could bind phosphopeptides, suggesting that the BRCT domains represent a class of ancient phosphopeptide-binding modules.

In the human genome more than 30 BRCT-containing proteins have been documented. Interestingly, most of the BRCT domains associate with proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint response (5Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 6Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The exact function of BRCT domains is not yet clear; they have been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions (7Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V.

In addition, BRCT domains of 53BP1 can interact with P53, while BRCT domains of BRCA1 bind DEAH family helicase BACH1 and CtBP interacting protein CTIP (11Chai Y.L. Cui J. Shao N. Shyam E. Reddy P.

Interestingly, it was shown that the BRCT domains might also bind double stranded DNA breaks (14Yamane K. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

BRCA1 COOH-terminal glutathione S-transferase forkhead-associated fluorescein isothiocyanate small interfering RNA. In addition to heterodimerization of BRCT domains, emerging evidence suggests that BRCT domains may mediate phosphorylation dependent interactions. For example, association of the sixth BRCT domain of TOPBP1 and E2F1 was shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (15Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interactions between BRCA1 and BACH1 depend on BACH1 phosphorylation as well (16Yu X. Chini C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). However, whether other BRCT domains can directly binding to phosphopeptide and what the specificities of BRCT domains are remain to be determined. We were particularly intrigued by the possibility of BRCT domains mediating phosphorylation-dependent interactions, because protein phosphorylation by protein kinases is known to trigger the assembly of phosphorylation-dependent signal complexes critical for cell growth and survival (1Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 17Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Many protein domains or modules have evolved to mediate such activities. The best examples are the Src homology domain 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains that recognize phosphorylated sites by protein-tyrosine kinases in a sequence-specific manner (17Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 18Songyang Z. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, several protein domains that bind phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues have been identified, including the 14-3-3, FHA, KIX, PIN1, WD-40, and polo box (1Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Elia A.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Notably, each of these domains recognizes a subset of substrates phosphorylated by different protein kinases. For instance, 14-3-3 recognizes sites that are phosphorylated by Arg-directed kinase such as Akt/PKB, while FHA domains bind sites that are substrates of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family (1Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Given the large number of protein kinases in the human genome, it has been postulated that novel families of phosphopeptide-binding domains that transmit signals from different protein kinases may exist. If BRCT domains can indeed bind phosphopeptides directly, it will provide new insight about how signaling complexes are regulated by DNA damage. To answer such questions, we carried out experiments to study the specificities of BRCT domains using oriented peptide libraries. BRCT Domain Constructs and Fusion Proteins—A DNA fragment encoding the human BRCA1 BRCT domain (residues 1599-1863) was cloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector. Constructs of GST BRCT fusions containing human BARD1 (residues 554-777), human MDC1 (residues 2727-3089), human DNA Ligase IV (residues 618-911), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD9 (residues 962-1309) were cloned similarly into pGEX-4T1. GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Oriented Peptide Library Analysis—Two phosphoserine-containing peptide libraries (X3: ISRSTpSXXXNK and X6: KAXXXpSXXXAK) were synthesized as described previously (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar), where X is any amino acids except Cys. For library analysis, 1 mg of the peptide library was incubated with 100-300 μg of GST BRCT-agarose beads. Then the beads were washed five times with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The bound peptides were eluted with 30% acetic acids, lyophilized, and sequenced on an ABI 477 peptide sequencer. Relative selectivities of amino acids at each degenerate position were calculated as described previously (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). SPOT Peptide Array Synthesis and Screen—The BACH1 peptide array was synthesized on cellulose membrane using the ASP222 SPOT robot (20Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The parental peptide SRSTpSPTFNK was scanned with 19 of the 20 amino acids (except Cys), phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine. The array membrane was first blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature. GST-BRCT of BRCA1 (3 μg) was labeled with anti-GST-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) (0.75 μg) for 30 min at room temperature. The fusion proteins were then added to the array membrane at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min. The array membrane was subsequently washed with TBST for 10 min three times. GST-BRCT bound peptide spots were visualized by ECL. Affinity Measurements Using Fluorescence Polarization—A FITC-labeled phosphopeptide with the sequence VDDpSYVFNK was first synthesized. For controls, an aliquot of this peptide was dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. The phosphopeptide or dephosphorylated peptide was incubated with different concentration of BRCA1 GST-BRCT fusion proteins in a 96-well plate. Fluorescence polarization was measured on TECAN Polarion. BACH1 siRNA and siRNA-resistant BACH1—BACH1 siRNA (AGCUUACCCGUCACAGCUUdTdT) was transfected into cells by Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). SiRNA-resistant (silent) mutants of wild-type BACH1 and BACH1 BRCT-binding mutants (T989A, S990A, or F993A) were created by substituting four nucleotides in the BACH1 siRNA targeting region (G69T, T70A, C71G, A72C). All BACH1 constructs were cloned into the pCDNA 3.1 His/Myc vector (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (16Yu X. Chini C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). G2/M Checkpoint Assay—For assaying BACH1 activity, cells were transfected with BACH1 mutant constructs immediately after siRNA transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, cells were exposed to 10-Gy γ-irradiation, allowed to recover for 3 h, and then treated with nocodazole (1 μg/ml) for 15 h. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Mutant BACH1 was stained with anti-myc antibody (9E10), followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. The BACH1 mutants were expressed in ∼90% of the cells based on immunofluroscence microscopy. The phospho-histone H3-positive staining cells were examined by immunofluroscence microscopy. The BRCA1 BRCT Domains Recognize Phosphopeptides with the Phosphoserine-Aromatic-Hydrophobic-Phe Motif—One of the known in vivo targets of BRCA1 is BACH1, a member of the DEAH helicase family (13Cantor S.B. Bell D.W. Ganesan S. Kass E.M. Drapkin R. Grossman S. Wahrer D.C. Sgroi D.C. Lane W.S. Haber D.A. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 149-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In the course of mapping BRCA1 and BACH1 interactions, we found that tandem but not individual BRCA1 BRCT domains directly bound BACH1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (16Yu X. Chini C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Further analysis of BRCA1 and BACH1 interaction demonstrated that BRCA1 BRCT domains specifically recognize phosphorylated Ser990 (ISRSTS990PTFNK) of BACH1. These data suggested that the BRCT domain may be a phosphopeptide-binding module. To understand the sequence binding preference of BRCT domains, we first examined the specificity of BRCA1 BRCT domain using an oriented peptide library (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). The phosphoserine containing peptide library X3 (ISRSTpSXXXNK) was synthesized, based on the sequence surrounding residue Ser990 of human BACH1. Using this phospho-library, we found that BRCA1 BRCT domains preferred aromatic amino acids at the P+1 position and aromatic/hydrophobic residues at the P+2 position (Fig. 1). Notably, at the P+3 position COOH-terminal to the phosphoserine, Phe is strongly selected, indicating that Phe at this position is critical for recognition by the BRCA1 BRCT domains. Thus, BRCA1 BRCT domains prefer a phosphoserine-aromatic-hydrophobic-Phe motif. To further examine the specificity of BRCA1 BRCT domain at residues NH2-terminal to the phosphoserine, the phospho-library X6 with the sequence KAXXXpSXXXAK was used. As shown in Table I, the BRCA1 BRCT domains preferred a [YE]E-[TV]-pS-[YFH]-[VTYF]-[FY] motif with weak selection at the NH2 terminus, suggesting that residues COOH-terminal to phosphoserine are important for binding to BRCA1 BRCT domains. A BRCA1 BRCT binding peptide (VDDpSYVFNK) was then synthesized, and its affinity to BRCA1 BRCT domains was measured. Indeed, this peptide bound with an affinity of 162 nm to the BRCA1 BRCT domains. In addition, such interaction was dependent on phosphorylation, as the unphosphorylated control peptide failed to bind (Fig. 2A).Table IThe specificities of BRCT domainsBRCT domainsSelectivity positions−3−2−10+1+2+3BRCA1X3 LibpSF (5.7)V (2.9)F (10.1)Y (3.0)F (2.3)Y (3.2)H (1.6)I (2.0)Y (1.7)H (1.7)BRCA1 X6 LibY (1.4)E (1.4)T (1.3)pSY (2.6)V (2.2)F (5.1)E (1.3)V (1.3)F (2.3)T (1.5)Y (1.5)H (1.3)Y (1.5)F (1.4)MDC1 X3 LibpSI (2.4)E (4.0)Y (5.6)P (1.7)V (2.9)F (2.0)V (1.6)D (2.1)E (1.9)F (1.6)I (1.3)I (1.3)Y (1.3)BARD1 X3 LibpSD (1.7)D (2.0)E (2.2)E (1.4)E (1.3)LIG IV X3 LibPSY (2.6)Y (1.9)I (1.6)A (1.4)A (1.5)Y (1.4)D (1.4)D (1.3)D (1.4)L (1.3)RAD9 X3 LibPSY (2.2)I (1.8)I (2.4)L (1.6)Y (1.5)L (1.4)I (1.5)L (1.5)K (1.4)K (1.3) Open table in a new tab To further probe the binding motif for BRCA1 BRCT domains, we generated an array of phosphopeptides based on the BACH1 peptide using the SPOT peptide synthesizer. Consistent with our finding that Phe at P+3 is crucial for binding, substitution with amino acids other than Phe at P+3 abolished BRCA1 BRCT interaction (Fig. 2B). Similarly, only β-branched amino acids (Thr, Val, and Ile) were tolerated at the P+2 position. This result recapitulated our oriented peptide library data and again highlighted the importance of the P+3 position for recognition by the BRCA1 BRCT domain. The oriented peptide library and SPOT array data collectively demonstrate that the BRCT domains from BRCA1 recognize specific phosphorylated sequences with the consensus motif phosphoserine-aromatic-hydrophobic-Phe motif. The BRCT-binding Motif of BACH1 Is Important for BRCA1-dependent G2/M Checkpoint Control—BRCA1/BACH1 interaction is important for DNA damage-induced checkpoint control during G2 to M cell cycle transition (16Yu X. Chini C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). To test whether the BRCA1-binding motif of BACH1 identified by in vitro studies is involved in this process, we used a γ-ray-induced G2/M checkpoint assay. First, we constructed Thr989-to-Ala (T989A), Ser990-to-Ala (S990A), or Phe993-to-Ala mutants of BACH1. BACH1 siRNA-resistant forms of wild-type and mutant BACH1 were then generated by introducing silent mutations in the siRNA target region. All these BACH1 proteins were expressed in HeLa cells. However, only wild-type BACH1 and the T989A mutant, but not the S990A or F993A mutant, were associated with BRCA1 (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that the BRCA1 binding-motif of BACH1, especially P+3 Phe, is necessary for BRCA1/BACH1 interaction in vivo. To explore the in vivo functional link between the BRCT-binding motif of BACH1 and BRCA1 BRCT domains, HeLa cells were treated with BACH1 siRNA and then transfected with siRNA-resistant BACH1 or BACH1 mutants. BACH1 siRNA repressed the expression of endogenous BACH1 but not exogenous siRNA-resistant BACH1 (Fig. 3B). Cells treated with BACH1 siRNA showed G2/M checkpoint defect after DNA damage (Fig. 3C). While expression of wild-type BACH1 and the T989A mutant rescued the checkpoint defect, the S990A and F993A mutants had no effect (Fig. 3, D and E). These data further confirm P+3 Phe as a key residue for BRCA1 BRCT and BACH1 interaction and indicate that the BRCA1 binding-motif of BACH1 is important for the function of BRCA1 BRCT domain in vivo. The Specificities of BRCT Domains of MDC1, BARD1, and Ligase IV—To investigate whether other BRCT domains can also bind phosphopeptides, we studied the specificities of several BRCT domains. Interestingly, tandem BRCT domains from MDC1, BARD1, and Ligase IV specifically bound phosphopeptides in the X3 library (Table I). MDC1 is a recently identified mediator of DNA damage responses (21Ozaki T. Nagase T. Ichimiya S. Seki N. Ohiri M. Nomura N. Takada N. Sakiyama S. Weber B.L. Nakagawara A.

Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). MDC1 contains two BRCT repeats at its carboxyl terminus. Using the X3 library, we found that MDC1 BRCT domains selected a distinct set of phosphopeptides compared with BRCA1. Instead of Phe, Tyr is the most selected amino acid by MDC1 at the P+3 position (Table I). At the P+2 position, acidic residues Glu and Asp were selected in addition to Val and Ile. At the P+1 position hydrophobic residues are preferred. Thus, the MDC1 BRCT domains bind phosphopeptides with the motif pS-hydrophobic-[EVDI]-[YF]. BARD1 is a cancer susceptible protein that is mutated in families of breast cancer patients (27Thai T.H. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y. Ashfaq R. Mathis J.M. Miller D.S. Trask B.J. Baer R. Bowcock A.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). BARD1 has an NH2-terminal ring finger domain which heterodimerizes with BRCA1 and two COOH-terminal BRCT domains with unknown function (4Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L.

Oriented peptide library analyses indicated that the tandem BRCT domains of BARD1 specifically recognize Asp/Glu residues at the P+1, +2, and +3 positions (Table I). The selection for Asp at the P+2 and Glu at the P+3 seemed most critical for BARD1 BRCT domain binding. Thus, the binding motif for BARD1 BRCT domains is pS-[DE]-[DE]-E. DNA Ligase IV functions to join single-strand breaks in double-stranded DNA (28Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It plays a major role in V(D)J recombination and non-homologous end joining. At the COOH terminus of Ligase IV are two BRCT domains. Different from MDC1 and BARD1, Ligase IV BRCT repeats preferred to bind phosphopeptides with Tyr and Ile, respectively, at the P+1 and P+3 positions (Table I). These results demonstrated that the BRCT domains are protein modules that recognize specific phosphopeptides. S. cerevisiae RAD9 BRCT Domains Bind Phosphopeptides—The BRCT domain is an ancient structural fold that can be traced back to bacteria. In bacteria and fungi, BRCT domains are also frequently found in proteins that regulate DNA damage responses. We therefore were interested in determining if BRCT domains from single cell eukaryotes could bind phosphopeptides as well. One of the proteins we studied is budding yeast RAD9, which is essential for cell cycle checkpoint control (30Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the tandem BRCT domains of RAD9 preferred Tyr at the P+1 position, and Ile at the P+2 and P+3 positions. Thus, the RAD9 BRCT repeats recognize phosphopeptides with the motif pS-Y-I-I. This result suggests that BRCT domains have evolved as a phosphopeptide-binding module early in evolution. Prediction of Potential in Vivo Targets of BRCT Domains—To identify potential targets of BRCT domains, we performed pattern searches in Swiss-Prot using the consensus motifs from our library and SPOT array analyses (Table II). Some of the interesting predicted targets for BRCA1 include BRCA1 itself, kinesin-like protein KIF1B, mismatch repair protein Msh3, Rb-binding protein CTIP, co-repressor NCoA-2 and NCoA-3/SRC-3. For MDC1, histone deacetylases HDAC8, and HDAC10, GATA family transcription factors could be potential targets. Interestingly, RNA polymerase II contains repeats of the MDC1-binding motif. A search of potential targets of RAD9 in budding yeast also found a short list of proteins that regulate DNA repair and cell cycle. Notably these include MEC1, RAD1, and RFC p140, which have been shown to interact with RAD9 genetically and biochemically.Table IIPotential targets of BRCA1 and MDC1 BRCT repeats in Swiss-ProtBRCT domainsSearched motifPredicted targetsSequenceBRCA1pS-[FYIVPAKHST]-[VT]-F-[GSTNYRKH]BACH1SRSTSPTFNKBRCA1IKESSAVFSKKinesin-like KIF1BDRTPSPTFSTProtein Kinase NIKSQEFSPTFSECTIPTRVSSPVFGAMsh3LHSESSVFGQNuclear poreSAGSSFVFGTNup153repressor CTCFLCRYCSAVFHEhTid-1RVQKSPVFRRNCoA-2PRRNSHTFNCNCoA-3/SRC-3QRQKSHTFNCRNA-bindingASFGSPTFSSprotein 12MDC1pS-[IVFP]-[EDVI]-YHDAC8DHPDSIEYGLHDAC10GLVHSPEYVSCENP-CKSEESPVYSNMDM2STSSSIIYSSRNA Polymerease IIYSPSSPEYTPWRN helicaseEFTGSIVYSYERCC-6MDGASPDYVLFanconi anemiaHPALSPVYLGFACFGATA-4GAASSPVYLPKIAA0076HMLSSPDYQIRAD9pS-[YILQP]-I-IRAD1EMMPSYIIMFRFC5LKSSSPIIKPMEC1HQLYSQIISNPDS5LFRASPIIYNRAD50KVLASIIIRLHelicase MER3EKKQSQIIDRHelicase DNA2TYSFSIIICNCDC68DWTYSPIIQSCDC45NIFGSQIIQCRNA helicase DHR1TKYSSIIIDESMC2ANPSSQIIAR Open table in a new tab Tandem Versus Single BRCT Domains—Our results have shown that tandem BRCT repeats can specifically recognize phosphoserine containing peptides, suggesting that the BRCT domain represents a new class of modules that mediate phosphorylation dependent protein-protein interactions. Most BRCT domain-containing proteins are known to mediate DNA damage responses (5Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 6Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). These proteins are often recruited to the sites of DNA damage, coinciding with the activation of protein kinases such as ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 (31Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 32Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 33Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The identification of BRCT domains as phosphopeptide-interacting motifs suggest that BRCT domains may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes that sense the activation of damage and checkpoint kinases. In fact, numerous residues in the BRCA1 BRCT repeats are mutated in breast cancer cells (34Arver B. Du Q. Chen J. Luo L. Lindblom A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Rosen E.M. Fan S. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 19-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Some of these mutations may disrupt the ability of BRCT domains to bind phosphorylated cellular target and therefore contribute to disease phenotypes. There is one notable difference between BRCT and other phosphopeptide-binding domains such as Src homology domain 2 and FHA domains. Among the BRCT domains we examined so far, only tandem but not single BRCT domains bound a sufficient amount of phosphopeptides from the peptide library. It is possible that inter-BRCT interactions is required for phosphopeptide binding, or tandem BRCTs function as a unit to bind phosphopeptides. In fact, structural studies have revealed that tandem BRCTs may have evolved from a common ancestor, because the linker structures between the two BRCT domains are also conserved (36Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In further support of this idea, single point mutations in either of the two repeats in BRCA1 can abolish its interaction with BACH1 (13Cantor S.B. Bell D.W. Ganesan S. Kass E.M. Drapkin R.

Our data, however, do not rule out that single BRCT domains can also bind phosphopeptides. Interestingly, single BRCT domains (e.g. XRCC1 and Ligase III) have been shown to form heterodimers. One intriguing possibility may exist that such heterodimers may function as a phosphopeptide-binding unit. Structural Insight into BRCT Phosphopeptide Recognition—The structures of several BRCT domains have been determined (8Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Hainbucher K. Nash R.A.

These studies indicate that the BRCT domain consists of four-stranded parallel β sheets bundled by three α helices. The two BRCT repeats of BRCA1 connected by the linker region are arranged in tandem (36Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is possible that similar to 14-3-3 and FHA, the phosphoserine-binding pocket of BRCT repeats may be formed by conserved Arg or Lys residues (39Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F.

Secondary structure comparisons of BRCA1 BRCT repeats from several different species suggested that Lys1667, Arg1670, Lys1671, Lys1724, Arg1726, Lys1727, Arg1737, Lys1750, Arg1751, Arg1753, and Lys1759 on human BRCA1 are highly conserved. In addition, positive charged residues are found at similar positions on BRCT domains of MDC1, BARD1, and DNA Ligase IV. It is interesting to note that these Arg/Lys residues are mainly located at two regions of BRCA1 BRCT domains. One region is on the surface of BRCT domain structure formed by Lys1667, Arg1670, and Lys1671 located on the helix α1A, and Arg1726 and Lys1727 located on the loop between α3A and α4A. The second region is near the connecting linker of the tandem BRCTs. These regions may form the phosphoserine-binding pocket of BRCA1 BRCT repeats. In support of this model, mutation of several residues in the second region of the BRCA1 BRCT repeats significantly decreased BACH1 binding in vitro, suggesting that the phosphopeptide-binding pocket may reside in this region as well (36Joo W.S.

Since vesicles from pathogenic bacteria contain virulence factors and have been shown to interact with eukaryotic cells, it has been proposed that vesicles behave as delivery vehicles. We wanted to determine whether heterologously expressed proteins would be incorporated into the membrane and lumen of vesicles and whether these altered vesicles would associate with host cells. Ail, an outer membrane adhesin/invasin from Yersinia enterocolitica, was detected in purified outer membrane and in vesicles from Escherichia coli strains DH5α, HB101, and MC4100 transformed with plasmid-encoded Ail. In vesicle-host cell co-incubation assays we found that vesicles containing Ail were internalized by eukaryotic cells, unlike vesicles without Ail. To determine whether lumenal vesicle contents could be modified and delivered to host cells, we used periplasmically expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP fused with the Tat signal sequence was secreted into the periplasm via the twin arginine transporter (Tat) in both the laboratory E. coli strain DH5α and the pathogenic enterotoxigenic E. coli ATCC strain 43886. Pronase-resistant fluorescence was detectable in vesicles from Tat-GFP-transformed strains, demonstrating that GFP was inside intact vesicles.

For example, LT associated with lipopolysaccharide on the surface of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) vesicles triggers internalization via caveolae and delivers not only catalytically active LT, which intoxicates the eukaryotic cell, but also other bacterial vesicle components. 2N.

Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, vesicle components have not been altered by genetic manipulation. Previous studies demonstrated that vesicles could be generated containing periplasmic gentamicin by treatment of cells with gentamicin, but they differed from native vesicles in their composition and size (15.Kadurugamuwa J.L. Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16.Kadurugamuwa J.L. Beveridge T.J. Antimicrob.

Because vesicles are composed of outer membrane and periplasmic components, we hypothesized that expressed heterologous outer membrane and periplasmic proteins should be packaged in vesicles. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether vesicle properties could be altered by the expression of proteins into the periplasm and outer membrane of bacteria. For instance, green fluorescent protein (GFP) transported to the periplasm and packaged in vesicles could be used as a lumenal vesicle marker, whereas vesicle incorporation of an outer membrane adhesin/invasin, Ail from Yersinia enterocolitica, could alter the adhesion and internalization properties of the vesicles. In this study, we demonstrate that Ail and periplasmic GFP are packaged in vesicles and that these altered vesicles can be used to track vesicle interactions with mammalian cells. Reagents and Cell Culture—E. coli strains DH5α (Stratagene), MC4100, and ETEC (ATCC strain 43886) were grown in LB or CFA broth (1% casamino acids, 0.15% yeast extract, 0.005% MgSO4, and 0.005% MnCl2), respectively. HB101/pVM102 (Ail) was kindly provided by Dr. Virginia Miller (18.Miller V.L. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were grown in the presence of kanamycin (10 μg/ml) and/or ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as required. Human colorectal HT29 cells (ATCC HTB-38) were grown in McCoy's 5a media supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. CHO-K1 cells (ATCC CCL-61) were grown in Ham's F12K media supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. All cell lines were grown in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Sigma) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Plasmid Construction—For pNKTG2 (Tat-GFP), the Tat signal sequence and mutGFP3 sequence were cut out of pJDT1 (19.Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and inserted into pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoRI and HindIII. The mutGFP3 sequence was replaced with mutGFP2 (20.Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar) using MscI and HindIII. pNKTAT (TatABCE) was constructed by partial digestion of pTatABCE (21.Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) using EcoRI and HindIII and insertion into the multiple cloning site of pK187 (22.Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5315-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To induce Tat-GFP or TatABCE, overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 and grown at 37 °C for 6 h, unless otherwise mentioned, in the presence of 0.1 mm IPTG. Plasmids were transformed by electroporation into bacteria using a modified CaCl2 protocol (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). Vesicle Purification and Labeling—Vesicles were purified as described previously (2.Horstman A.L. Kuehn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12489-12496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Bacteria were pelleted (10 min, 10,000 × g), and vesicles were then pelleted from the supernatant (1 h, 40,000 × g), filter-sterilized (0.45 μm; Millipore), and applied to the bottom of a discontinuous Optiprep (Greiner) gradient (2 ml each of 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, and 25% Optiprep in 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, supplemented with 0.85% NaCl). Vesicle-containing fractions were combined, and protein concentration was determined using Coomassie Plus (Pierce). Vesicles were fluorescently labeled by diluting 1:1 with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (1 mg/ml in 50 mm Na2CO3 and 100 mm NaCl, pH 9.2) and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Vesicles were pelleted (52,000 × g, 30 min) and washed three times with sterile 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8. FITC-labeled vesicles were resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 0.2 m NaCl and checked for sterility and protein concentration. Ail Confirmation—To confirm that the 17-kDa band detected in DH5α/Ail vesicles by Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE was Ail, purified DH5α/Ail vesicles (15 μg) were loaded on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and the N-terminal sequence of the 17-kDa band was determined to be Ala-Ser-Glu-Asn-Ser-Ile-Ser-Ile (Tufts Core Facility). Cargo Quantitation—To determine the percent of GFP or Ail packaged in vesicles, bacteria were pelleted from a culture grown either overnight (Ail) or induced for 6 h (Tat-GFP/TatABCE). Vesicles were pelleted as described above and filter-sterilized. Bacteria and vesicles were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration; 4 °C, 30 min), and the proteins were pelleted (10 min, 16,000 × g) and washed with acetone. Samples were then resuspended in 1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline. Vesicle samples and dilutions of the bacterial preparation (1:300 for Ail; 1:1000 for GFP) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Ail) or immunoblotting (GFP). Densitometry results were quantified using NIH Image. Periplasm and Outer Membrane Preparations—To obtain periplasm from DH5α, the culture was pelleted, resuspended in 20% sucrose in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (4 ml/g cells), and 0.1 m EDTA (0.2 ml/g cells), and lysozyme (600 μg/g cells) were added. Following 40 min incubation on ice, 0.5 m MgCl2 (0.16 ml/g cells) was added, and the spheroplasts were pelleted (20 min, 9500 g). Periplasm was collected from 43886 strains using the polymyxin B method as described previously (2.Horstman A.L. Kuehn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12489-12496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Outer membranes were purified using the Sarkosyl method as described previously (24.Nikaido H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To purify outer membrane from DH5α strains with and without Ail, spheroplasts collected from the periplasm preparation were resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris (pH 8) and sonicated, and the cells were pelleted (5 min, 8,000 × g). Whole membranes were pelleted from the supernatants (60 min; 40,000 × g) and washed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, before being resuspended in distilled water and freezethawed. The membranes were then incubated in 0.5% Sarkosyl (sodium N-lauroylsarcinosinate; 25 °C, 20 min), and the outer membrane was pelleted (90 min, 40,000 × g). Equal volumes of sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for GFP or MutL. Pronase Protection Assay—Bacterial membrane integrity was determined using a RNase detection assay as described previously (25.Bernadac A. Gavioli M. Lazzaroni J.C. Raina S. Lloubes R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4872-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect lumenal GFP, 3 μg of 43886/Tat-GFP/TatABCE vesicles were incubated (37 °C, 30 min) with 0.1 mg/ml Pronase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by Complete protease inhibitor (Roche; 37 °C, 5 min). As a control, vesicles were solubilized with 1% SDS prior to incubation with Pronase. Immunoblot Analysis—Samples of vesicles or outer membranes were separated using 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Tween 20 and 3% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were immunoblotted for GFP (rabbit anti-GFP; 1:1000), MutL (rabbit anti-MutL; 1:1000), maltose binding protein (rabbit anti-MBP; 1:6000; New England Biolabs), or E. coli outer membrane antigens (rabbit anti-OM; 1:1000) and detected using horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000), ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and autoradiography. Negative Staining Electron Microscopy—To visualize vesicles, samples were applied to carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Quantitative Fluorescence Assay—To quantitate the amount of vesicles bound by cells, a 96-well fluorescent assay was used. CHO cells were plated at a concentration of 8 × 104 cells/well and incubated overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2) to allow cell adherence. Cells were washed with Hanks' buffer (2×) and incubated with FITC-labeled vesicles (1 μg) in serum- and antibiotic-free media (100 μl). Following incubation, wells were washed with Hanks' (2×) to remove unbound vesicles, and 100 μl of Hanks' containing 1% Triton X-100 was added. Fluorescence was quantitated using a 96-well plate FLUOstar Galaxy fluorometer (BMG Lab Technologies) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm. Relative fluorescence units were converted to micrograms of vesicle protein using separate standard curves that established the relative fluorescence units per microgram values of FITC-DH5α vesicles and FITC-DH5α Ail vesicles (r = 0.99), which were present on each microtiter plate tested. Fluorescence and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—CHO or HT29 (1.6 × 105 cells/well) cells were plated on Permanox microwell chamber slides (Nunc Inc.) and incubated (37 °C) with vesicles (1–5 μg/well) for various times in serum- and antibiotic-free media. Unbound vesicles were then removed, and the cells were washed. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For immunofluorescence, cells were then permeabilized and blocked for 30 min with 0.1% Triton-X, 5% goat serum, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (2.5 μg/ml) and visualized with rhodamine red-X-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (2.5 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Slides were mounted with a coverslip and Pro-Long Antifade kit (Molecular Probes), and the cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Ail Is Present in E. coli Vesicles—To determine whether exogenous outer membrane proteins are secreted via vesicles, purified vesicles were prepared from several laboratory strains of E. coli transformed with a plasmid encoding the Y. enterocolitica outer membrane protein Ail under the control of its native promoter (18.Miller V.L. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ail was detected in purified outer membrane preparations and in vesicles produced by DH5α/Ail (Fig. 1, A and B), MC4100/Ail, and HB101/Ail (data not shown), and its presence in vesicles was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Co-fractionation in Optiprep density gradients of Ail with OmpA and OmpF/C, outer membrane components of native vesicles (Fig. 2, A and B), showed that Ail was shed into the culture supernatant in association with other outer membrane vesicle components. Electron microscopy examination of vesicles in low density Optiprep fractions revealed that >90% were closed vesicles (Fig. 2, C and D), not membrane whirls or fragments of lysed vesicles. These data demonstrated that the heterologous outer membrane proteins expressed in E. coli are present in native-like vesicles.Fig. 2Ail copurifies with vesicle markers and does not increase vesicle density. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of fractions of increasing density (left to right) of DH5α (A) and DH5α/Ail (B) vesicles from a discontinuous Optiprep gradient (25–50%). Positions of OmpF/C (39 kDa), OmpA (35 kDa), and Ail (17 kDa) are indicated. Negative staining electron microscopy of purified DH5α (C) and DH5α/Ail (D) vesicles. Size bar applies to panels C and D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effect of a heterologous protein on yield, we compared vesicle production as a function of protein concentration per colony forming unit. After overnight growth, DH5α/Ail produced 2.3-fold more vesicles per colony forming unit than DH5α. A difference in vesicle density was not detected, because vesicles with Ail migrated to the same density fraction as DH5α vesicles (see peak vesicle fractions 4 and 5, Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, no distinguishable difference was detected in the vesicles by negative staining electron microscopy: DH5α vesicles ranged from 22–90 nm (Fig. 2C), and DH5α/Ail vesicles ranged from 22–77 nm (Fig. 2D) in diameter. Therefore, outer membrane vesicle density and size were unaltered due to the incorporation of a heterologous protein into the membrane, but vesicle yield increased. To determine whether Ail was incorporated differently into vesicles than endogenous outer membrane cargo, we compared the amounts of Ail, OmpF/C, and OmpA packaged into vesicles (Fig. 3). Of the total amount in the bacteria, 0.32% of the Ail, 0.23% of OmpF/C, and 0.14% of the OmpA were packaged into vesicles, which falls in the previously reported range of protein packaged in E. coli vesicles (26.Mug-Opstelten D. Witholt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 508: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27.Hoekstra D. van der Laan J.W. de Leij L. Witholt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, the Omp to Ail ratio appeared constant in each fraction (0.5 + 0.03 S.E., fractions 2–7; Fig. 2B). Therefore, heterologous Ail is neither selectively enriched nor selectively excluded from vesicles, and Ail appears to be included in every vesicle. Ail Induces Vesicle Internalization by Eukaryotic Cells— Our previous work has demonstrated that LT, which is externally bound to vesicles because of its association with lipopolysaccharide, induces the association and internalization of vesicles by eukaryotic cells (2.Horstman A.L. Kuehn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12489-12496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 28.Horstman A.L. Kuehn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32538-32545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).2 Because Ail is a known adhesin/invasin that can confer an invasive phenotype to HB101 (18.Miller V.L. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether Ail is able to catalyze the internalization of DH5α vesicles. We used fluorescently labeled vesicles to study cell association. Wild type DH5α vesicles displayed minimal eukaryotic cell association (Fig. 4A); however, the presence of Ail in vesicles increased cell association dramatically (Fig. 4B). Quantitation of cell-associated fluorescence revealed that the presence of Ail increased DH5α vesicle-cell association 10-fold (Fig. 4C) and that Ail-dependent vesicle-cell association was vesicle concentration-dependent (data not shown). Interestingly, the unbound DH5α/Ail vesicles removed from the eukaryotic cells contained Ail as shown by Coomassie staining (data not shown). This further supported the finding that Ail was present in every vesicle, because Ail would be expected to be depleted from this fraction if the vesicles contained heterogeneous cargo populations. These data demonstrate that an exogenous outer membrane protein packaged in vesicles can alter the adherence properties of the vesicles. GFP Transport to the Periplasm Is Limited by Endogenous Levels of TatABCE—Next we wanted to determine whether an exogenous periplasmic protein, which could be utilized in future studies as a lumenal vesicle marker, would also be packaged in vesicles. Due to the reducing environment of the periplasm, GFP transported via the Sec pathway is unable to fold in the periplasm (29.Feilmeier B.J. Iseminger G. Schroeder D. Webber H. Phillips G.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4068-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar); however, GFP folded in the cytoplasm can be transported to the periplasm by the twin arginine transporter system (Tat) using the Tat signal sequence (19.Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 31.Santini C.L. Bernadac A. Zhang M. Chanal A. Ize B. Blanco C. Wu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8159-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). DH5α and 43886, a pathogenic E. coli strain, were transformed with a plasmid encoding IPTG-inducible GFP (20.Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar) fused to the Tat signal sequence (Tat-GFP). As shown previously for Tat-GFP expressed in MC4100 (19.Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 31.Santini C.L. Bernadac A. Zhang M. Chanal A. Ize B. Blanco C. Wu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8159-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we found that induction of Tat-GFP expression increased the concentration of periplasmic GFP (data not shown). Although GFP-associated fluorescence was detectable, the amount of periplasmic GFP was saturable and could not be increased with longer induction (data not shown). The Tat machinery (TatABCE) has previously been shown to limit the transport of Tat substrate SufI into the periplasm (21.Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32.Sargent F. Gohlke U. De Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was the limiting factor in Tat-GFP transport, bacteria expressing Tat-GFP were transformed with a plasmid encoding IPTG-inducible TatABCE. Both periplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 5A) and immunoblot analysis for GFP (data not shown) revealed a significant increase of periplasmic GFP when exogenous TatABCE expression was induced. Periplasmic GFP was detectable in DH5α and 43886 after induction of Tat-GFP and TatABCE (Fig. 5, B and C). In the periplasm, the Tat signal sequence is cleaved from Tat-GFP to yield the mature 27-kDa form of GFP. Bands with slightly higher molecular weights were seen in the spheroplasts, which may represent immature forms of GFP (Fig. 5B). After induction for 6 h, 91 and 86% of the GFP was periplasmic in DH5α/Tat-GFP/TatABCE and 43886/Tat-GFP/TatABCE, respectively. Immunoblot analysis for MutL, a cytoplasmic protein, confirmed that the spheroplasts were intact and did not leak cytoplasmic components into the periplasmic preparation (Fig. 5, B and C). These results demonstrated a periplasmic localization of fluorescent GFP in laboratory and pathogenic strains of E. coli that is limited by the expression level of the Tat transporter. GFP in the Periplasm Is Packaged into Vesicles—Because Tat-GFP was transported and properly folded in the periplasm, we wanted to determine whether it was packaged into vesicles. Vesicles were purified from cultures of strains expressing Tat-GFP with and without TatABCE after 6 and 12 h of induction. GFP was detectable in both DH5α- and 43886-derived vesicles when TatABCE was expressed (Fig. 6, A and B). Low levels of GFP were detected in the vesicles of 43886 cells expressing only endogenous levels of TatABCE (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, GFP cofractionated with vesicles on an Optiprep gradient during vesicle purification, as observed by the presence of OmpF/C, OmpA, and GFP in the same fractions (Fig. 7A, fractions 4–6). In contrast, soluble GFP and maltose-binding protein (MBP) (Fig. 7B, fractions 8 and 9) or GFP and MBP from lysed vesicles (data not shown) remained in the heavy fractions in an Optiprep gradient. These data showed that heterologously expressed periplasmic GFP copurified during vesicle purification is associated with intact E. coli vesicles.Fig. 7GFP cofractionates with vesicle Omps, and GFP-containing vesicles are slightly denser than native vesicles. Fractions of increasing density (left to right) of vesicles (A) from 43886/Tat-GFP/TatABCE and 43886 or soluble periplasm (B) from 43886/Tat-GFP/TatABCE using a discontinuous Optiprep gradient (25–50%) were applied to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GFP (upper panel; A and B), Coomassie stained (lower panels; A), or immunoblotted with anti-MBP (lower panel; B). Positions of OmpF/C, OmpA, GFP, and MBP are indicated. Negativ"
https://openalex.org/W2077336339,"A successful defense against potential pathogens requires that a host organism is able to discriminate between self and nonself structures. Soybean (Glycine max L.) exploits a specific molecular pattern, a 1,6-β-linked and 1,3-β-branched heptaglucoside (HG), present in cell walls of the oomycetal pathogen Phytophthora sojae, as a signal compound eliciting the onset of defense reactions. The specific and high affinity HG-binding site is contained in the β-glucan-binding protein (GBP), which in turn is part of a proposed receptor complex. The ability to perceive and respond to Phytophthora cell wall-derived β-glucan elicitors is exclusive to plants that belong to the Fabaceae. However, we propose that the presence of the GBP is essential, but not sufficient for β-glucan elicitor-dependent disease resistance because genes encoding GBP-related proteins can be retrieved from many plant species. Furthermore, we show that the GBP is composed of two different carbohydrateactive protein domains, one containing the β-glucan-binding site, and the other related to glucan endoglucosidases of fungal origin. The glucan hydrolase displays most likely an endo-specific mode of action, cleaving only 1,3-β-d-glucosidic linkages of oligoglucosides consisting of at least four moieties. Thus, the intrinsic endo-1,3-β-glucanase activity of the GBP is perfectly suited during initial contact with Phytophthora to release oligoglucoside fragments enriched in motifs that constitute ligands for the high affinity binding site present in the same protein. The concept of innate immunity in plants receives substantial support by this highly sophisticated system using ancient enzyme modules as an active part of the recognition mechanism.

The concept of innate immunity in plants receives substantial support by this highly sophisticated system using ancient enzyme modules as an active part of the recognition mechanism. Plants are exposed to a wide range of potential pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and damaging insects. Only a few of these organisms actually succeed in efficiently attacking plant species, which implies that most plants are not susceptible to most putative pathogens. Effective plant-pathogen interactions display either broad host, species, or even race-specific resistance phenomena based on respective perception systems. The evolution of host-pathogen interactions thus is primarily related to the evolution of recognition systems of both partners. The products of plant disease resistance (R) and corresponding avirulence (Avr) genes of the pathogens are the critical components of species or race specificity (1.Staskawicz B.J. Ausubel F.M. Baker B.J. Ellis J.G. Jones J.D. Science. 1995; 268: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 2.Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar). They appear to evolve more rapidly than other regions of the plant genomes, a phenomenon that may be based on gene duplications, intragenic and intergenic recombinations, gene conversions, and/or adaptive selection (3.Richter T.E. Ronald P.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, broad host resistance cannot be described with a single matching R gene/Avr gene pair, and thus is genetically much less defined.The concept of broad host resistance is better described from a biochemical point of view, for example, during colonization of plants by pathogens that requires the mutual identification of extracellular structures and/or compounds. Substantial progress was made in characterizing structures, called elicitors, which are perceived by plants during the infection process (4.Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 5.Hahn M.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1996; 34: 387-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6.Ebel J. Scheel D. The Mycota V Part A.

Elicitors are believed to interact with host plant receptors with both high specificity and sensitivity. The elicitor receptors, in turn, transduce the elicitor signal into cellular reactions that result in the activation of plant defense reactions (8.Yang Y. Shah J. Klessig D.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1621-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 9.Ebel J. Mithöfer A. Planta. 1998; 206: 335-348Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10.Nürnberger T. Scheel D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 372-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).According to a more general concept, the long-known general elicitors may be collectively termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; ANTS, 8-aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid; Avr, avirulence; DP, degree of polymerization; GBP, glucan-binding protein; βGRP, β-glucan recognition protein; HG, hepta-β-glucoside; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; OS, oligosaccharide; PACE, polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; R, resistance; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; ANTS, 8-aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid; Avr, avirulence; DP, degree of polymerization; GBP, glucan-binding protein; βGRP, β-glucan recognition protein; HG, hepta-β-glucoside; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; OS, oligosaccharide; PACE, polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; R, resistance; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. PAMPs were defined as invariant structures shared by large groups of microorganisms that are essential for survival of the microbes, are absent from the host, and thus are determinants of nonself recognition as a prerequisite for innate immunity in humans and animals (11.Janeway Jr, C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr, C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Recently, the concept of innate immunity has been broadened to insects and plants because of related putative receptors and similar signaling functions (2.Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar, 13.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6201-6208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).However, the receptors responsible for the detection of PAMPs in broad host resistance of plants are mostly unknown. The receptor for flagellin, a subunit of bacterial flagella, was identified as a leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor kinase in Arabidopsis thaliana (14.Gómez-Gómez L. Boller T.

Cell. 2000; 5: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the β-glucan-binding proteins (GBPs) from Fabaceae, which are believed to be part of the β-glucan elicitor receptors, do not feature any of the functional domains found in other innate immunity receptors (19.Mithöfer A. Lottspeich F. Ebel J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20.Mithöfer A. Fliegmann J. Ebel J. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1997; 94: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A distinct oligo-β-glucosidic component of the cell walls of the Oomycete Phytophthora was described as the main determinant of broad host resistance in soybean (reviewed in Refs. 5.Hahn M.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1996; 34: 387-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and 23.Ebel J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phytophthora sojae, the causative agent of root and stem rot in soybean, interacts with its host both in a cultivar/race-specific manner, depending on corresponding R and Avr genes, as well as in a broad host resistance type. How these different mechanisms contribute to plant defense is not yet understood (24.Tyler B.M. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2002; 40: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The existence of GBP-related proteins and transcripts was proved in other species of the Fabaceae, such as Medicago sativa, Lupinus multilupa, and very likely Pisum sativum by Northern and Western blotting experiments (21.Mithöfer A. Fliegmann J. Neuhaus-Url G. Schwarz H. Ebel J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These plants have been previously shown to display high affinity binding sites for the β-glucan elicitor and to respond to these compounds by inducing the production of phytoalexins (25.Cosio E.G. Feger M. Miller C.J. Antelo L. Ebel J. Planta. 1996; 200: 92-99Crossref Google Scholar). The β-glucan elicitors used for these studies consisted either of purified structural isomers of 1,3-1,6-β-linked fragments of the cell walls of P. sojae with a degree of polymerization (DP) up to 25, or of the synthetic 1,6-β-linked and 1,3-β-branched heptaglucoside (HG) (25.Cosio E.G. Feger M. Miller C.J. Antelo L. Ebel J. Planta. 1996; 200: 92-99Crossref Google Scholar), the oligosaccharide with the highest biological activity in eliciting phytoalexin accumulation in soybean (26.Cheong J.J. Birberg W. Fugedi P. Pilotti A. Garegg P.J. Hong N. Ogawa T. Hahn M.G. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several experimental attempts failed to detect high affinity binding sites or any biological activity of the purified β-glucan fractions or of the synthetic HG in plants outside the Fabaceae (27.Coté F. Roberts K.A. Hahn M.G. Planta. 2000; 211: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28.Klarzynski O. Plesse B. Joubert J.M. Yvin J.C. Kopp M. Kloareg B. Frittig B.

Consequently, the ability to specifically perceive and respond to β-glucans derived from the cell walls from Phytophthora seems to be restricted to species belonging to the Fabaceae, although not every single species inside this group must necessarily possess this ability.In this study, we show that despite the absence of biological activity or binding sites for β-glucans, related genes for putative GBPs exist in presumably all plant species. Moreover, we show that these proteins are very likely descendants of carbohydrate-active enzymes and that they still retain glucohydrolytic activity. We postulate a model of pathogen perception using ancient enzyme modules by the host for the amplification and recognition of pathogen-derived PAMPs, constituting another prime example of innate immunity in plants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESData Retrieval and Multiple Sequence Alignment—Similarity searches were performed by using the coding regions of the cDNAs and the encoded protein sequences of the GBPs from Glycine max and Phaseolus vulgaris using BLAST and TBLASTN, respectively (30.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69163) Google Scholar), to different sequence data sets. 2www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp; mips.gsf.de; www.tigr.org. The nucleotide sequences encoding the GBPs from soybean and bean, respectively, can be accessed through the GenBank™ data base under accession numbers Y10275 and AF188088 (21.Mithöfer A. Fliegmann J. Neuhaus-Url G. Schwarz H. Ebel J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene and expressed sequence tag sequences were translated and aligned with the GBPs using MultAlin (31.Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4265) Google Scholar). Pairwise identities were calculated using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (32.Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). Sequence accessions from plants outside of the Fabaceae that were judged to encode GBP-related proteins (similarities of the overlapping regions were found to be ∼40%) were retrieved from A. thaliana, Brassica napus, Capsicum anuum, Citrus sinensis, Gossypium hirsutum, Hordeum vulgare, Lactuca sativa, Lycopersicon esculentum, Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, Pinus pinaster, Pinus taeda, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Zea mays, and Zinnia elegans. The data set containing a list of the retrieved accessions and the alignment can be retrieved from the authors. Fungal accessions encoding putative endo-1,3-β-glucanases were from Aspergillus fumigatus (AfENGL1p, accession number AF121133), Candida albicans (CaENG1p and CaENG2p, accession numbers AJ251464 and AJ251465), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScACF2 and ScENG1p, accession numbers Z73316 and Z71682, Ref. 33.Baladrón V. Ufano S. Duenas E. Martin-Cuadrado A.B. del Rey F. Vázquez de Aldana C.R. Eukarot. Cell. 2002; 1: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpENG1p and SpENG2p, accession numbers CAB57443 and CAA91245).Heterologous Expression—The cDNA encoding the GBP from soybean was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) (21.Mithöfer A. Fliegmann J. Neuhaus-Url G. Schwarz H. Ebel J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two different expression constructs were used, one using the endogenous translational initiator codon, and the second, which was engineered to additionally express a NH2-terminal fused signal peptide originating from the glycoprotein 67 (GP67) as present in the vector series pAcGP67 (BD Pharmingen, Dianova). GP67 constitutes a major membrane-bound structural component of the wild type baculovirus (34.O′Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the protocol of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the recombinant pFastBac plasmids as templates and matching oligonucleotides (forward: 5′-AAGGAATCAACAGAGCACAAGTCAGGCTGTGAGT-3′, reverse: 5′-ACTCACAGCCTGACTTGTGCTCTGTTGATTCCTT-3′) spanning the region 1514 to 1548 of the GmGbp cDNA (21.Mithöfer A. Fliegmann J. Neuhaus-Url G. Schwarz H. Ebel J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR introduced two sequence alterations resulting in the conversion of the two glutamic acid codons (positions 494 and 498 of the GBP) into glutamine codons.Sf9 cells were harvested 4 days post-infection in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.2, and lysed by use of a potter after swelling in 10 mm Tris/MES, pH 6.0, 5 mm MgCl2 for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were precipitated twice by centrifugation at 300 × g after adjustment of the extract to 50 mm NaCl. Subsequently, the crude extract was fractionated into a soluble and a microsomal fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min.Enzymatic Studies—β-Glucosidase assays were conducted using p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucoside at 2.5 mg/ml as substrate in 100 mm imidazole/citrate, pH 6.0, and monitoring the liberation of p-nitrophenol at 405 nm. Endo-1,3-β-glucanase activity was assayed as described (35.Fontaine T. Hartland R.P. Beauvais A. Diaquin M. Latge J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Laminarin (Paesel) and pustulan (Calbiochem) were reduced with 25 mg/ml NaCNBH3 in 1 n NH4OH overnight at room temperature. Standard tests were performed in 25 mm citric acid/NaOH or MES/KOH, pH 5.0-6.5, at 40 °C, using 1-20 μg of protein and 100 μg/ml reduced laminarin (1,3-β-glucan) in a total volume of 250 μl. Alternative substrates were tested at 250 μg/ml. Inhibitors tested were glucono-1,5-lacton (Sigma), d-nojirilactam, d-gluconhydroximo-1,5-lactam, and gluco-configured imidazole (provided by A. Vasella, ETH Zürich, Switzerland). Hydrolysis of the substrates was quantified by determining the amount of liberated reducing sugars according to Ref. 36.Waffenschmidt S. Jaenicke L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar. Additional glucan polymers used were 1,3-β-glucooligosaccharides (MoBiTec), cyclic 1,3-1,6-β-glucan from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (37.Bhagwat A.A. Mithöfer A. Pfeffer P.E. Kraus C. Spickers N. Hotchkiss A. Ebel J. Keister D.L. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and β-glucan preparations derived from P. sojae cell walls as described (38.Cosio E.G. Frey T. Verduyn R. van Boom J. Ebel J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, mycelial cell wall-derived β-glucans were size-fractionated by use of gel-permeation chromatography on a calibrated Bio-Gel P-4 column. The flow-through contained polymers of at least 50 glucose residues with a mean DP of 139 (DP139). The fraction DP15-25 refers to glucanoligomers in the range of 15 to 25 glucose residues according to the calibration. Enzyme tests for analytical gel electrophoresis were incubated in 25 mm pyridine/acetate, pH 5.5, at 40 °C, for the times indicated, using 1 mg/ml laminarin, 1 mg/ml DP139 β-glucan, or 0.1 mm DP15-25 β-glucan. To test the ability of cyclic 1,3-1,6-β-glucan as an inhibitor of the glucoside hydrolase, the protein extract was incubated with 0.5 mg/ml cyclic β-glucan for 30 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of laminarin (0.5 mg/ml). Protein concentrations were adjusted to 5 μg/ml (Fig. 5), 10 μg/ml (Figs. 6 and 7, A except lanes 15 and 16, and Fig. 7C), or 0.1 mg/ml (Fig. 7, A, lanes 15 and 16, and B). Quantazyme (Qbiogene), a recombinant 1,3-β-glucanase originating from Cellulomonas cellulosan (39.Shen S.-H. Chrétien P. Bastien L. Slilaty S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1058-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a control at 2400 units per ml. Typically, one-tenth of the reaction products (total volume of the enzyme assays 50 μl) were analyzed after derivatization (see below).Fig. 6Loss of enzymatic activity of a GBP mutant. The model substrate laminarin was incubated with soluble protein extracts derived from insect cells expressing the GmGBP (lane 1), the mutant GmGBP-Gln494-Gln498 (lane 2), or the wild type virus (lane 3), and, as a control, without the addition of protein (lane 4) for 20 min. Reaction products were derivatized with ANTS and analyzed by PACE on a 17.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Oligoglucoside standards (250 pmol each, lanes 5-9) are labeled on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7PACE of the hydrolytic action of the GBP on different β-glucan polymers. A, degradation of laminarin by the recombinant soybean GBP (lanes 7-9, 12, and 16) in comparison to Quantazyme (a recombinant, commercially available 1,3-β-glucanase, lanes 13 and 17). Controls for long-time incubations included protein extracts from wild type virus-infected Sf9 cells (lanes 11 and 15) and incubations without added protein (lanes 10 and 14). B, P. sojae-derived glucans with different degrees of polymerization (DP139, lanes 6-9; DP15-25, lanes 10-13) were incubated overnight with soluble soybean GBP, recovered after heterologous expression in Sf9 cells (lanes 8 and 12), or Quantazyme (lanes 9 and 13). Controls consisted of incubation with the soluble protein extract derived from wild type virus-infected Sf9 cells (lanes 7 and 11) and incubation without addition of protein extracts (lanes 6 and 10). Derivatized products corresponding to 7.5 μg of glucan each were applied on lanes 6-13. C, laminarin was incubated with soluble protein extracts from GBP-expressing insect cells (lanes 8 and 9), or wild type virus-infected cells (lane 7), or without added protein (lane 6) for 20 min. The enzyme assay analyzed in lane 9 has been preincubated with cyclic 1,3-1,6-β-glucan from B. japonicum prior to the addition of the model substrate, laminarin. Reaction products were treated with ANTS and separated on 17.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The products were visualized by UV light (366 nm) and video documentation. Glucose (Glc) and laminarioligosaccharides (L2, L3, L5, L7), derivatized with ANTS, were used as standards (250 pmol each).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Carbohydrate Gel Electrophoresis—Polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE) was performed as described (40.Goubet F. Jackson P. Deery M.J. Dupree P. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, dry glucans were treated with equal volumes of both, 0.2 m 8-aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS, Molecular Probes, MoBiTec), prepared in acetic acid/water (3/17, v/v), and 1 m NaCNBH3 (in Me2SO) at 37 °C overnight. After vacuum evaporation the derivatized glucans were dissolved in 6 m urea and appropriate aliquots were separated in 17.5 or 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5% (w/v) N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide using 0.1 m Tris borate, pH 8.2.Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall). Western blot analysis was carried out using the anti-GBP antiserum (21.Mithöfer A. Fliegmann J. Neuhaus-Url G. Schwarz H. Ebel J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) diluted 1:10,000 in TBS at 4 °C overnight after blocking in 1% (w/v) gelatin and 5% (w/v) milk powder at room temperature. Anti-rabbit anti-IgG secondary antibody, coupled with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), was used at a dilution of 1:20,000 in TBS including 1% (w/v) milk powder.Immunocytochemical Analyses—Tissue pieces of 2-day-old soybean root tips were fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaric dialdehyde in 75 mm sodium cacodylate, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, for 2 h at 0-4 °C. After two washing steps in fixative buffer and distilled water, the tissue pieces were dehydrated with a graded acetone series. Tissue samples were then infiltrated and embedded in Spurr's low-viscosity resin (42.Spurr A.R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1969; 26: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10147) Google Scholar). Sections with 50 to 70-nm thickness were mounted on collodion-coated nickel grids, incubated first with 50 mm glycine in PBS, blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then incubated with affinity purified anti-GBP antiserum at concentrations of 3-5 μg/ml (diluted in PBS) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 10 nm gold was added (diluted 1:20 in PBS buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin), and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. After washing with 50 mm glycine in PBS and distilled water, the sections were post-stained with aqueous lead citrate (100 mm, pH 13.0).RESULTSResponsiveness to β-Glucan Elicitors—Plant species belonging to the family Fabaceae were able to detect surface structures of Phytophthora using high affinity binding sites for branched 1,3-1,6-β-glucans, which are the main polysaccharide components of the oomycetal cell walls (25.Cosio E.G. Feger M. Miller C.J. Antelo L. Ebel J. Planta. 1996; 200: 92-99Crossref Google Scholar, 27.Coté F. Roberts K.A. Hahn M.G.

Table I summarizes the available data for both the glucan binding activity and the elicitor activity using a branched HG or a mixture of 1,3-1,6-β-glucans (oligosaccharide, OS) as ligand and elicitor, respectively, in different Fabaceous plants. Interestingly, plants outside of the Fabaceae showed no responsiveness to these compounds. The failure to trace binding sites for HG has been reported for A. thaliana, Brassica nigra, Nicotiana tabacum, Lycopersicon peruvianum, Z. mays, T. aestivum, H. vulgare, and O. sativa (21.Mithöfer A.

The column “Biological activity” refers to either the values for the concentrations of the above mentioned β-glucan fraction necessary to induce a half-maximal phytoalexin synthesis in these plants (EC50 OS) or the ability of both a β-glucan fraction with a DP20–25 and HG to induce medicarpin in Medicago truncatula (27.Coté F.

Although the protein components in this pathway have begun to be identified, little is known about their subcellular localization or the physiological significance of their localization. By immunofluorescence, we find that both endogenous and recombinant FRAP/mTOR proteins show localization predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Consistent with this finding, FRAP/mTOR is cofractionated with calnexin, an ER marker protein. Biochemical characterization suggests that FRAP/mTOR is a peripheral ER/Golgi protein with tight membrane association. Finally, we have identified domains of FRAP/mTOR which may mediate its association with the ER and the Golgi apparatus.

Both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus are internal membrane structures constituting more than one-half of the total membranes in a cell. The ER is known to have two essential functions. First, proteins destined for transport to other organelles and the cell surface or for secretion are synthesized in the ER. During translation, they are translocated into the ER lumen through a pore in the ER membrane and are folded and become glycosylated inside the ER lumen. Secondly, synthesis of lipids and cholesterol takes place on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. The ER is also an important participant in cell signaling, including the unfolded protein response, the ER overload response, and the ER-to-nuclear sterol signaling by SREBP (25.Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Several recent studies suggest that the ER is also involved in signal transduction pathways traditionally thought to occur solely through the plasma membrane. For example, the small GTPase Ras that is restricted to the ER and the Golgi apparatus can actively engage in signal transduction to mitogen-activated protein kinases (26.Chiu V. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson R. Cox A. Philips M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the ER and the Golgi apparatus can serve as anchors for diverse cell signaling events. A large body of evidence shows that proper localization plays a crucial role in the specificity and/or regulation of cell signaling events. Despite the importance of FRAP in cell growth and therapeutic intervention, little is known about its precise subcellular localization. We have examined common mammalian cell lines for FRAP localization. We find that FRAP is localized predominantly in the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Biochemical analyses suggest that FRAP is a peripheral ER membrane protein but tightly anchored to the ER/Golgi membranes. Finally, we found two discrete domains in the N terminus which are crucial for targeting to the ER and the Golgi apparatus, respectively. Like the sterol-SREBP pathway, FRAP may use the ER/Golgi as anchors for nutrient sensing and signaling. Plasmids, Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Chemicals—FLAG-FRAP plasmids have been described previously (12.Choi J.H. Bertram P.G. Drenan R. Carvalho J. Zhou H.H. Zheng X.F.S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mammalian cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Center (ATCC) and were maintained as recommended by ATCC. FRAP antibodies were produced (Harlan) by immunizing rabbits with polypeptides corresponding to the amino acids 1-120 of human FRAP. The rabbit FLAG polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, calnexin antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories, Golgin-97 antibodies and Mitotracker were purchased from Molecular Probes, phospho-Thr389 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling, FRAP H-266 FKBP12-rapamycin binding-specific antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Leptomycin B, sodium azide, and trypsin and chymotrypsin were purchased from Sigma. Affinity Purification of FRAP Antibodies—The N-terminal FRAP antigenic polypeptide was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instruction. The N-terminal FRAP antiserum (150 mg of IgG) was equilibrated in binding buffer (Bio-Rad) and was loaded twice onto the N-terminal FRAP-Sepharose affinity column. After washing with binding buffer, FRAP-specific IgG was eluted with elution buffer (Bio-Rad). Fractions were collected, analyzed, and subsequently dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol until further use. Purification and dialysis were performed at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation and Western blot were prepared using ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH). Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the cell lysates with 10 μl of FRAP antibody/mg of protein extract at 4 °C for 90 min. The immune complexes were bound to protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, which were washed three times with wash buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 m LiCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Protein A-bound materials were eluted by boiling in SDS protein sample buffer. For Western blot, protein samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane. After blocking with 5% dry milk in TBST, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h to overnight, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000) for 30 min and with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). FRAP Kinase Assay—After immunoprecipitation, FRAP or control immunocomplexes were incubated at 30 °C with the FRAP kinase reaction mix (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 μg of GST-p70/20 μl of kinase buffer). Aliquots of samples were withdrawn at different times, and the kinase reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylation of GST-p70S6K1 at Thr389 was analyzed by Western blot with a phospho-Thr389 antibody. Transfection and Immunofluorescence (IF) Microscopy—HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids using the calcium phosphate method. For indirect IF, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in H2O for 10 min at 37 °C, permeabilized with ice-cold Triton buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) for 5 min on ice, blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min on ice, and incubated with primary antibodies for 20 min (rabbit N-terminal FRAP antibody at 1:500, rabbit C-terminal FRAP antibody at 1:50, FRAP H-266 FKBP12-rapamycin binding-specific antibody at 1:50, mouse anti-calnexin at 1:50, mouse anti-Golgin-97 at 1:100, rabbit anti-FLAG at 1:1000) at 37 °C in a moisture chamber. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing 10 times with TBST. Secondary antibodies labeled with Texas Red-X or Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) were applied for 15 min at room temperature and washed as with the primary antibodies. Glass cover slips carrying treated cells were mounted with Cytoseal mounting medium onto glass slides and analyzed using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope and LSM 5 Pascal laser scanning confocal) or an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Qimaging Retiga EXi digital camera. No significant difference in IF staining was observed with the N-terminal FRAP antiserum or affinity-purified N-terminal FRAP antibody. Mitotracker Red was used to stain HeLa cells according to manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular Fractionation and Related Biochemistry—HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold HME buffer (10 mm HEPES, 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), resuspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold HME buffer containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Dounce homogenized with 10 gentle strokes. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted at 1,500 × g, followed by a spin at 10,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C). The pellets (P10) were resuspended in HME buffer. The S10 supernatant (after saving an aliquot) was overlaid on a 20% sucrose cushion and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g (60 min, 4 °C). The pellets (P100) were resuspended in HME. The S100 was also saved for Western blot analysis. To determine the nature of FRAP membrane association, the P100 pellets were resuspended in HME, 2 m KCl, 4 m urea in 10 mm MOPS, or 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and incubated for 40 min at 4 °C prior to centrifugation. Two consecutive washes (S1, S2) were performed for each condition. For protease protection assays, the P100 pellets were resuspended in HME plus 10 mm CaCl2 with or without 1% Triton X-100, and then incubated with different amounts of trypsin/chymotrypsin (0, 10, 20 μg) for 40 min at 4 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of aprotinin and boiling in SDS protein sample buffer. To characterize FRAP subcellular localization, we have generated a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal 120 amino acids of FRAP. This antibody specifically recognized a protein of ∼250 kDa in all cell types examined, including HeLa, HEK293T, C2C12, Rh30, and MRC5 (normal human lung fibroblasts) (Fig. 1A). A minor species of 140 kDa was occasionally seen, which appears to be a FRAP proteolytic product during cell lysis. This Western blot signal was completely blocked by the FRAP antigenic polypeptide (Fig. 1A), and this Western blot signal was completely absent when a preserum was used (Fig. 1B). In addition, the 250-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by the FRAP antibody, but not a preimmune serum (Fig. 1C). To establish further the specificity of the FRAP antibody, we assayed the ability of the anti-FRAP immunocomplex to phosphorylate p70S6K1 using a system recently developed by Thomas and co-workers (27.Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). In this assay, the anti-FRAP immunocomplex was incubated with recombinant GST-p70S6K1 (amino acids 333-412) and a high ATP concentration (2 mm). Phosphorylation of p70S6K1 at Thr389, a FRAP-dependent phosphorylation site, was assayed by Western blot with a phospho-Thr389-specific antibody. We found that Thr389 was rapidly phosphorylated by the FRAP immunocomplex, but not by an immunoprecipitate with the preimmune serum (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate the high specificity of the anti-FRAP antibody. We next used the FRAP antibody to study FRAP subcellular localization using indirect IF microscopy. We analyzed the staining pattern of HeLa cells with this antibody in the absence or presence of FRAP antigenic polypeptide. A strong and highly reproducible perinuclear staining pattern was observed with the FRAP antibody (Fig. 1E). A minor nuclear staining signal was also noticeable (Fig. 1E). This IF signal was completely removed by incubation with the FRAP antigenic polypeptide (Fig. 1E). In addition, no significant signal was observed with the preserum (Fig. 1E). Therefore, FRAP is distributed predominantly in the perinuclear region. In contrast, no FRAP staining was detected on the periphery of the cells, indicating that FRAP is not localized to the plasma membrane. In addition, only a small fraction of FRAP was found in the nucleus (Fig. 1E). We have compared the FRAP antiserum with an affinity-purified FRAP antibody but observed no difference in FRAP IF staining pattern, immunoprecipitation, or Western blot. The perinuclear staining pattern of FRAP shows strong similarity to that of the ER and the Golgi apparatus. To verify this, we performed double IF staining with the FRAP antibody and an antibody specific for the ER (calnexin) or the Golgi apparatus (Golgin-97) in HeLa cells. By laser scanning confocal microscopy, we found that the FRAP staining strongly overlapped with that of calnexin, a common ER marker protein and Golgin-97, a common Golgi marker protein (Fig. 2A). A recent report suggests that FRAP is localized to mitochondria (28.Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the relationship between FRAP and mitochondria in HeLa cells by costaining the cells with the FRAP antibody and Mitotracker Red, a mitochondrial membrane-specific dye. Although there appeared to be some colocalization between FRAP and mitochondria, their distribution patterns were largely distinctive, suggesting that only a small fraction of FRAP is localized in mitochondria in these cells (Fig. 2B). To corroborate this in situ staining pattern for endogenous FRAP, we transfected HeLa cells with a FLAG-tagged FRAP. IF staining with anti-FLAG antibodies showed the same perinuclear pattern that was observed with calnexin (Fig. 2C). Additionally, an anti-FRAP C-terminal antibody showed similar codistribution of FRAP with calnexin (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that FRAP is primarily localized to the ER and Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells. Next, we investigated FRAP distribution in other common mammalian cell lines with both N- and C-terminal FRAP antibodies. We found essentially identical FRAP distribution pattern in C2C12 murine myoblasts, MRC5 human diploid fibroblasts, rat embryonic fibroblasts, and Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cancer cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the ER/Golgi localization is not cell type-specific.Fig. 3FRAP localization is consistent in many cell lines.A, FRAP localization in common mammalian cell lines. FRAP localization was examined by IF with the N-terminal and C-terminal FRAP antibodies in C2C12 myoblasts, MRC5 human fibroblasts, rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs), and Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells. B, FRAP distribution in HeLa cells under different conditions. HeLa cells were treated with rapamycin (60 min), serum starvation (16 h), serum starvation (16 h) followed by serum refeeding for 1 h, sodium azide (20 min), or leptomycin B (2.5 h). FRAP distribution was analyzed by IF with the N-terminal FRAP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Modulation of cell signaling can occur by changing subcellular localization of key components of the corresponding pathways. We investigated whether FRAP distribution changed in response to cellular conditions that modulate FRAP signaling. We found that FRAP remained in the perinuclear pattern during serum starvation or rapamycin treatment, conditions that inhibit FRAP signal transduction (Fig. 3B). A similar pattern was observed in serum-stimulated cells that had been deprived from serum for an extended period (Fig. 3B). Mitochondria have recently been linked to FRAP functions because sodium azide, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory function, has been shown to block p70S6K1 phosphorylation (28.Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 29.McDaniel M.L. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Kwon G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2877-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, treatment of HeLa cells with sodium azide did not change the FRAP perinuclear staining pattern (Fig. 3B). A recent report indicates that FRAP shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus (30.Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, short term treatment (2.5 h) with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1-dependent nuclear export, failed to elicit substantial FRAP accumulation in the nucleus in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). This observation suggests that the proposed nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mechanism is unlikely a fast one. To characterize FRAP localization further, we performed biochemical fractionation of HeLa cell lysates. After mild homogenization and pelleting of nuclei and unbroken cells, heavy membranes including mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and some ER membranes were pelleted by low speed centrifugation (10,000 × g). FRAP was found in both the supernatant (S10) and pellet (P10) (Fig. 4A). The S10 supernatant was further fractionated by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g) to pellet light membranes, including the ER and Golgi apparatus membranes. As expected, the ER marker protein calnexin was found in the pellet (P100) but not in the supernatant (S100) (Fig. 4A). We also found that FRAP was in the P100 but not the S100 fraction (Fig. 4A). These results are in agreement with our IF data and suggest that FRAP is associated with the ER and the Golgi apparatus. FRAP may be associated with the outer or inner surface of the ER as a peripheral or integral membrane protein. Alternatively, it could be localized within the ER lumen. To study the nature of FRAP association with the ER, we treated the P100 fraction with conditions known to disrupt selectively the membrane association of different types of membrane-bound proteins. A high salt condition is commonly used to dissociate peripheral membrane proteins whose membrane interaction is largely electrostatic in nature. As expected, washing with 2 m KCl significantly disrupted the binding of the peripheral Golgi membrane protein Golgin-97 to membranes but had no effect on association of the integral membrane protein calnexin with ER/Golgi membranes (Fig. 4B). This condition only removed a minor fraction of FRAP from the P100 membranes (Fig. 4B). Washing with 4 m urea completely removed Golgin-97, but not calnexin, from the P100 membranes (Fig. 4B). This washing condition significantly, but not completely, removed FRAP from the P100 membranes (Fig. 4B). Finally, a high pH (sodium carbonate, pH 11) condition completely dissociated Golgin-97 and FRAP from the P100 membranes, although only partially removing calnexin (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that FRAP is an outer ER membrane protein that is tightly associated with the membrane. To determine further the topology of FRAP ER localization, we performed the protease protection assay. We reasoned that if FRAP were an outer membrane protein exposed to the cytoplasm, it should be sensitive to protease treatment. On the other hand, an inner ER protein should be protected from proteolysis unless the ER is first dissolved with detergent. We incubated the P100 fraction with a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein with the bulk of its sequence in the ER lumen. However, it has ∼100 amino acids exposed to the cytoplasm. When treated with protease in the absence of detergent, calnexin was processed to a smaller polypeptide with molecular weight corresponding to its inner ER fragment (Fig. 4C). In the presence of detergent, calnexin was further degraded (Fig. 4C). In contrast, we found that FRAP was completely digested regardless of whether Triton X-100 was present or not (Fig. 4C). Therefore, FRAP appears to be an outer ER protein. To determine the sequence(s) that specify FRAP localization, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of systematically generated FLAG-FRAP deletion mutants by IF (Fig. 5A). After transient transfection of the wild type and mutant FLAG-FRAP into HeLa cells, IF staining was performed using FLAG-specific antibodies. As shown earlier, the full-length FLAG-FRAP (P1) showed the typical ER/Golgi localization pattern (Fig. 1C). Deletion of the N terminus up to amino acid 1361 (P2, P3, and P4) did not affect the normal FRAP distribution pattern (Fig. 5B). Similarly, removing the C terminus starting from amino acid 1444 (P5) did not change FRAP localization (Fig. 5B). Strikingly, further deletion of 404 amino acids (from amino acid 1040) from the C terminus (P6), however, led to apparently exclusive Golgi localization of FRAP (Fig. 5, B and C). Also interestingly, FRAP lost either ER or Golgi localization with a further deletion of 109 amino acids from the C terminus (P7 and P8) (Fig. 5B). The two C-terminal deletion mutants (P7 and P8) became distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that amino acids 1362-1443 and amino acids 931-1039 are important for ER and Golgi localization, respectively. In this study, we show that both endogenous and recombinant FRAP proteins are predominantly localized to the ER and Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells, as judged by IF and cell fractionation experiments. A similar FRAP distribution pattern was observed with several other common mammalian cell lines, including C2C12 murine myoblasts, MRC5 human diploid fibroblasts, rat embryonic fibroblasts, and Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells, suggesting that ER/Golgi localization is a common theme of FRAP distribution. Huang and Houghton (3.Huang S. Houghton P. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 295-304PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported predominant nuclear localization of FRAP/mTOR in certain mammalian cells. Interestingly, in the same cell lines (C2C12 murine myoblasts and Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells), we still observed that the majority of FRAP showed ER/Golgi localization (Fig. 3A). The apparent discrepancy between the two studies could reflect the specificity of different antibodies used. For example, one antibody may only recognize a subpopulation of FRAP proteins because of the availability of the corresponding epitope. This latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that the C-terminal FRAP antibody does show slightly more nuclear staining in C2C12 murine myoblasts and Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells (Fig. 3A). Our results are also in agreement with the biochemical properties of FRAP/TOR signaling complexes reported recently. It has been found that FRAP and the yeast TOR proteins, and their associated cofactors such as Raptor/Kog1 and GβL/Lst8, are bound to light intracellular membranes (13.Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X.

Electron microscopy study indicates that the yeast Raptor/Kog1 protein is colocalized with TOR at an intracellular location that appears to be the ER in budding yeast (32.Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates III, J. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The interaction between FRAP/TOR and Raptor/Kog1 is highly sensitive to detergent (13.Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ER membrane is important in facilitating the assembly of the FRAP/TOR signaling complex. Taken together, these observations indicate that the ER localization of FRAP/TOR is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon and is likely to play an important role in FRAP/TOR signaling/functioning. Our results further indicate that FRAP is associated with the outer surface of the ER because treatment of the P100 fraction leads to complete proteolysis of FRAP by trypsin/chymotrypsin. Unlike the peripheral Golgi protein Golgin-97, FRAP is highly resistant to high salt washes and moderately resistant to 4 m urea or high pH, suggesting that FRAP is much more tightly associated with the ER membrane than a typical peripheral membrane protein. FRAP may be lipid-modified or an integral membrane protein with the bulk of its sequence exposed to the cytoplasm. We have taken a deletional approach to map the regions important for FRAP ER/Golgi targeting. Our results indicate that amino acids 1362-1443 are critical for ER targeting because FRAP mutants missing this region were unable to localize to the ER (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, amino acids 931-1039 are essential for localization to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, these two regions appear to be competing with each other: the P6 mutant missing the region necessary for ER targeting becomes exclusively localized to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5B). The fact that FRAP is predominantly localized at the ER or Golgi is intriguing in light of the fact that the sterol-SREBP signaling pathway is anchored at the ER and utilizes the Golgi apparatus as well (25.Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 33.Brown M. Goldstein J. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). Both the FRAP and SREBP pathways sense the level of nutrients, amino acids and sterol, respectively (for a model see Fig. 6). Analogous to the sterol signaling mechanism, FRAP may base on the ER/Golgi to sense amino acid levels and transduce amino acid signals. FRAP signaling is likely to be mediated by interaction with downstream effectors and could also relocate to other subcellular compartments such as the nucleus in response to signaling input. Like the SCAP/SREBP system that utilizes both the ER and the Golgi apparatus for regulation of sterol levels, FRAP may also exhibit a dynamic localization pattern between these organelles which is important for its signaling functions. Deletion of the sequences important for ER/Golgi localization results in cytoplasmic as well as nuclear localization (Fig. 5B). Therefore, similar to the SCAP/SREBP system, the ER and the Golgi apparatus may be used to regulate the availability of FRAP proteins to the cytoplasm and nucleus, which may be important for diverse FRAP/TOR-dependent events such as translation and ribosome biogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2087046756,"The bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum contains a simple photosynthetic system, in which the reaction center (RC) receives energy from the light-harvesting (LH1) complex. We have used high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to image two-dimensional crystals of the RC-LH1 complex of R. rubrum. The AFM topographs show that the RC-LH1 complex is ∼94 Å in height, the RC-H subunit protrudes from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane by 40 Å, and it sits 21 Å above the highest point of the surrounding LH1 ring. In contrast, the RC on the periplasmic side is at a lower level than LH1, which protrudes from the membrane by 12 Å. The RC-LH1 complex can adopt an irregular shape in regions of uneven packing forces in the crystal; this reflects a likely flexibility in the natural membrane, which might be functionally important by allowing the export of quinol formed as a result of RC photochemistry. Nanodissection of the RC by the AFM tip removes the RC-H subunit and reveals the underlying RC-L and -M subunits. LH1 complexes completely lacking the RC were also found, providing ideal conditions for imaging both rings of LH1 polypeptides for the first time by AFM. In addition, we demonstrate the ellipticity of the LH1 ring at the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the membrane, in both the presence and absence of the RC. These AFM measurements have been reconciled with previous electron microscopy and NMR data to produce a model of the RC-LH1 complex. The bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum contains a simple photosynthetic system, in which the reaction center (RC) receives energy from the light-harvesting (LH1) complex. We have used high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to image two-dimensional crystals of the RC-LH1 complex of R. rubrum. The AFM topographs show that the RC-LH1 complex is ∼94 Å in height, the RC-H subunit protrudes from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane by 40 Å, and it sits 21 Å above the highest point of the surrounding LH1 ring. In contrast, the RC on the periplasmic side is at a lower level than LH1, which protrudes from the membrane by 12 Å.

These AFM measurements have been reconciled with previous electron microscopy and NMR data to produce a model of the RC-LH1 complex. Photosynthetic organisms harvest light energy and convert it to a chemically useful form, using light-harvesting (LH) 1The abbreviations used are: LH, light-harvesting; RC, reaction center; EM, electron microscopy; RC-LH1, reaction center light-harvesting complex I; BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; AFM, atomic force microscopy/microscope. and reaction center (RC) complexes. This coupling between LH and RC complexes involves close physical proximity because of the distance term governing energy transfer between the complexes (1.Förster T. Sinanoglu O. Modern Quantum Chemistry. IIIB. Academic Press, New York1965: 93-137Google Scholar). In the purple photosynthetic bacteria, the reaction center receives energy from the LH1 complex (reviewed in Ref. 2.Sundström V. Pullerits T. van Grondelle R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 2327-2346Crossref Scopus (739) Google Scholar). This particular energy transfer step, which takes ∼35–45 ps (3.Visscher K.J. Bergström H. Sundström V. Hunter C.N. van Grondelle R. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), is important, because it is the rate-limiting step in the process of trapping light energy in photosynthetic bacteria (4.Beekman L.M. van Mourik F. Jones M.R. Visser H.M. Hunter C.N. van Grondelle R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3143-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In view of the value of the RC-LH1 complex as a model for coupled light-harvesting energy transfer and photochemistry, structural information on the association between LH1 and RC complexes is required. Rhodospirillum rubrum, which represents one of the simplest possible photosynthetic systems, is valuable in this respect. A recent cryo-electron microscopy (EM) study of the RC-LH1 complex of R. rubrum, which built upon earlier work on the LH1-only (no RC) complex (5.Karrasch S. Bullough P.A. Ghosh R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), shows that the RC complex is surrounded by a ring of 16α and 16β LH1 subunits, which would correspond to 32 bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This structure provides a rationale for the rate-limiting energy transfer step, because the ∼45 Å distance from LH1 BChls to the special pair BChls of the RC is considerable (5.Karrasch S. Bullough P.A. Ghosh R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This should be viewed in the context of known energy transfer steps and distances in these bacteria: for example, the internal transfer of energy in ∼0.5–1 ps between the B800 and B850 BChls within the peripheral LH2 complex (7.Monshouwer R. Ortiz de Zarate O. van Mourik F. van Grondelle R. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1995; 246: 341-346Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which have a center-to-center distance of ∼18 Å (8.Freer A. Prince S. Sauer K. Papiz M. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A. McDermott G. Cogdell R. Isaacs N.W. Structure. 1996; 4: 449-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another intriguing observation that emerged from the cryo-EM study of the RC-LH1 complex of R. rubrum was that the LH1 ring could adopt both circular and elliptical conformations (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), thus confirming a previously suspected flexibility in this complex (5.Karrasch S. Bullough P.A. Ghosh R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the LH1 ring was suggested to have a functional significance (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), because of the need for the RC complex to export reduced quinone, the product of its photochemistry. Breathing motions of the ring could facilitate this export and might be essential because the RC-LH1 complex of R. rubrum does not contain the PufX polypeptide, which is required for quinone transfer in Rb. sphaeroides and Rb. capsulatus (9.Barz W.P. Vermeglio A. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15248-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10.Barz W.P. Francia F. Venturoli G.

Acta. 1992; 1100: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The current state of structural knowledge of the RC-LH1 complex, seen only in projection at present, needs to be advanced by incorporating three-dimensional information to define the structure of this complex in more detail, to examine the ellipticity and flexibility of both the periplasmic and cytoplasmic surfaces, and to define the way in which this complex sits in the membrane bilayer. In the absence of three-dimensional x-ray crystallographic data, we have used atomic force microscopy (AFM) (12.Binnig G. Quate C.F. Gerber C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1986; 56: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (12639) Google Scholar) to obtain high-resolution surface topographs of both faces of the RC-LH1 complex from R. rubrum. The AFM is a remarkable instrument: it allows the topography of biological samples to be acquired at subnanometer lateral resolution and vertical resolution of ∼1 Å under near physiological conditions, i.e. in buffer solution, at room temperature, and under normal pressure. A further feature of the AFM is the high signal-to-noise ratio provided in the topographs, making the study of single membrane protein complexes at work possible (13.Engel A. Müller D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Recently, the value of this technique has been demonstrated for the light-harvesting LH2 complexes of Rubrivivax gelatinosus and Rb. sphaeroides (14.Scheuring S. Reiss-Husson F. Engel A. Rigaud J.L. Ranck J.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and on membranes of Rhodopseudomonas viridis containing RC-LH1 complexes (16.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The aim of this work is to advance our knowledge of the photosynthetic core complex by building on the work of Scheuring et al. (16.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) on the periplasmically exposed surface of the complex and by obtaining topographs of both the cytoplasmic (RC-H subunit) and periplasmic (c-type cytochrome) faces. This establishes the height of the RC-H subunit and the functionally crucial special pair bacteriochlorophylls in relation to the membrane bilayer. In addition, it is possible to measure directly the position of the membrane-water interface in relation to RC-LH1 aromatic residues to assess their proposed anchoring role (17.Schabert F.A. Henn C. Engel A. Science. 1995; 268: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18.de Planque M.R.R. Bonev B.B. Demmers J.A.A. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E. Separovic F. Watts A. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5341-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Finally, AFM can be used to determine the heights of the LH1 polypeptides above the membrane bilayer, and the ellipticity of the LH1 ring at the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the membrane, in the presence and absence of the RC. In the present study, we have used high-resolution AFM to image two-dimensional crystals of the RC-LH1 complex of R. rubrum. This represents the most detailed analysis of this complex to date, and it is sufficient to show two rings surrounding the RC, one from LH1α and the other from LH1β. The heights of the RC and LH1 protein subunits in the complex measured from AFM topographs have been reconciled with structural data from EM (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), AFM (this study), and NMR (19.Conroy M.J. Westerhuis W.H. Parkes-Loach P.S. Loach P.A. Hunter C.N. Williamson M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) experiments. New features of this complex are revealed, including the dimensions and conformations of both periplasmic and cytoplasmic aspects of the complex and the relationship of the RC-LH1 complex and its chromophores to the membrane bilayer. The flexibility of the RC-LH1 complex is emphasized by its adoption of an angular shape in regions of uneven packing in the crystal; this flexibility is expected to be important for the function of this complex by allowing the export of quinol formed as a result of reaction center photochemistry. Sample Preparation and Crystallization—The purification of the RC-LH1 complex from R. rubrum has been reported previously (20.Qian P. Addlesee H.A. Ruban A.V. Wang P. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23678-23685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, pure membranes obtained from sucrose gradient centrifugation were solubilized with diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine at a final concentration of 20 mm and a final OD of the protein sample of 60 at 880 nm. The mixture was stirred at 4 °C in the dark for 45 min. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) ion-exchange column equilibrated with elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine, pH 7.9). A gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in elution buffer was applied. The main peak, which contains pure RC-LH1, appeared when the concentration of NaCl reached ∼240 mm. The best fractions judged from the peak absorbance ratio of 880 to 280 nm were pooled (A880/A280 > 2.0). Concentrated sample was then applied to a gel filtration column and eluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.9 at 4 °C. Fractions with A880/A280 > 2.4 were collected for crystallization. Well ordered two-dimensional crystals were obtained as described (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) by reconstitution of purified protein with Escherichia coli lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL) at a lipid-to-protein ratio of 1.0 using the flow dialysis method (21.Jap B.K. Zulauf M. Scheybani T. Hefti A. Baumeister W. Aebi U. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 45-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy—A stock solution of two-dimensional RC-LH1 crystals (0.5 mg/ml protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9) was diluted 30-fold in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 7.8 (imaging buffer) and adsorbed for 20–30 min on freshly cleaved muscovite mica. After adsorption, the sample was gently washed with imaging buffer to remove membranes that were not attached firmly to the substrate. AFM experiments were performed using a Nanoscope Multimode microscope (Digital Instruments, Veeco Metrology Group, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with an infrared laser head, fluid cell, and oxide-sharpened silicon nitride cantilevers of 100 and 200 μm length and nominal spring constants of 0.08 and 0.06 N/m from Olympus Optical Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and Digital Instruments, respectively. Topographs were acquired in contact mode at minimal loading forces (≤100 pN). Trace and retrace signals were recorded simultaneously at line frequencies ranging between 4.1 and 5.1 Hz. Perspective views of raw data were prepared using the SXM program (University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom). Modeling—The procedure described here was carried out using the visualization program Dino. The Rb. sphaeroides LH1α and -β polypeptides (19.Conroy M.J. Westerhuis W.H. Parkes-Loach P.S. Loach P.A. Hunter C.N. Williamson M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were modeled as rigid bodies into a dimer using the following constraints: (i) the side chain nitrogen from the conserved αTrp+11 is located within hydrogen-bonding distance to the C2 acetyl-oxygen from BChla (22.Olsen J.D. Sockalingum G.D. Robert B. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); (ii) αHis0 serves as the ligand for the Mg-atom in BChla (23.Olsen J.D. Sturgis J.N. Westerhuis W.H. Fowler G.J.S. Hunter C.N. Robert B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12625-12632Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); (iii) the relative orientation of transmembrane helices fits the EM projection (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); and (iv) avoidance of clashes between both domains, even under 16-fold symmetrization. The resulting dimer (not shown) was fitted to the EM projection with the help of the symmetry visualization feature available in Dino, which allows interactive fitting with instant update of the corresponding symmetry elements based on elliptical symmetry, in this case, 16-fold with an axial ratio of 1.04. The Rb. sphaeroides RC (Protein Data Bank ID code 1M3X; PubMed ID 12167672) was subsequently inserted into the resulting LH1 ring, and the relative height was adjusted to fit the AFM data. Purified RC-LH1 complexes from the purple non-sulfur bacterium R. rubrum were crystallized into two dimensions in the presence of E. coli lipids. This yielded exclusively the orthorhombic crystal form, rather than the mixture of crystals with square and orthorhombic symmetry as obtained previously with the lipid dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A comparison of negatively stained and glucose embedded two-dimensional crystals reconstituted in E. coli or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine lipids by EM revealed no apparent differences. The crystal parameters of the orthorhombic form were almost identical in both lipids, within experimental uncertainty (data not shown). To visualize the supramolecular organization of the RC-LH1 complex, two-dimensional crystals of the latter were adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica and imaged by AFM in buffer solution. On the overview topograph shown in Fig. 1a, three different surface types are evident: RC-LH1 two-dimensional crystals with their orthorhombic lattice lines (a, 1), lipid (a, 2), and mica (a, 3). Compared with the flat and featureless surfaces of lipid and mica, protein two-dimensional crystals were highly corrugated (see section analysis in Fig. 1b). Heights of 111 ± 5 Å (n = 146) and 45 ± 3 Å (n = 50) were measured above the mica surface for the RC-LH1 crystal and the lipid bilayer, respectively. These heights together with the section analysis in Fig. 1b indicate that the first domain (Fig. 1a, 1) consists of a single layer of RC-LH1 complexes, and that the crystal lattice is surrounded by a border of lipid (Fig. 1a, 2), as seen previously in two-dimensional crystals of the cyanobacterial Photosystem I complex (24.Fotiadis D. Müller D.J. Tsiotis G. Hasler L. Tittmann P. Mini T. Jenö P. Gross H. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The height of this lipid border, 45 ± 3 Å, is in agreement with previous AFM measurements of the thickness of E. coli lipid bilayers (25.Fotiadis D. Hasler L. Müller D.J. Stahlberg H. Kistler J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fig. 2a shows a high resolution AFM topograph of an RC-LH1 two-dimensional crystal, which clearly indicates that it is composed of alternating rows of complexes exposing high and prominent protrusions (bright rows), and the lower, opposite face of the complex (dark rows). The high protrusions correspond to the RC-H subunit, which is surrounded by an elliptical LH1 ring. It is known that the RC-H subunit is located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane in vivo (26.Hall R.L. Doorley P.F. Niederman R.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 273-276Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar); the oppositely oriented complexes, therefore, expose the periplasmic face of the RC-LH1 complex. Within the array of molecules seen in Fig. 2a, it is apparent that, in some cases, the RC-H subunit is missing, revealing a shape arising from the underlying RC-L and -M subunits inside the LH1 ring (see complexes marked 1 and 2). When images were recorded with minimal force applied to the AFM tip, i.e. ≤100 pN, it was evident that this occurred only in a minority of the complexes. As originally demonstrated by Fotiadis et al. (24.Fotiadis D. Müller D.J. Tsiotis G. Hasler L. Tittmann P. Mini T. Jenö P. Gross H. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and more recently by others (16.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), extrinsic or weakly bound subunits of a complex can be displaced by increasing the force applied to the AFM tip. When such nanodissections were performed on RC-LH1 crystals, the RC-H subunit could be removed routinely (data not shown). This manipulation, however, is not desirable because it may disrupt the membranes and it also increases drastically the probability of contaminating the AFM tip, thus hindering the acquisition of clear images. One important aspect of LH1 that emerges from the complexes in Fig. 2a is the intrinsic ability of LH1 to adopt either a round (broken circle, 1) or a larger, elliptical shape (broken ellipse, 2), while conforming to both the shape of the RC and the close packing of neighboring complexes. The asterisks and the empty arrowhead indicate LH1 rings without RC, seen from the cytoplasmic and periplasmic side, respectively. Fig. 2b displays two typical RC-LH1 complexes. Careful inspection of these molecules reveals that the central, prominent elevation arising from the RC-H subunit is slightly skewed either to the left or to the right (see arrows), indicating two preferred orientations of the H subunit in the LH1 ring, which is consistent with Jamieson et al. (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Proximity of the RC-H subunit to either side of the LH1 ring, depending on the orientation of H, obscures measurement of LH1. This point is underlined by Fig. 2c, which shows in more detail a comparison of an intact RC-LH1 complex (particle at right) with one lacking the H-subunit (particle at left). Removal of the RC-H subunit did not only reveal the RC L and M subunits (arrowhead), but, most interestingly, the second, inner ring of the LH1 complex is visualized for the first time by AFM (arrow). LH1 complexes completely lacking the RC were found, although infrequently. Both sides of LH1 were imaged. Fig. 2a shows the cytoplasmic (asterisks) and periplasmic (empty arrowhead) faces of the LH1-only complex. As the comparison with the intact RC-LH1 complex on the left of Fig. 2d clearly shows, the absence of all of the RC subunits (particle at right) provides ideal conditions for imaging the LH1 complex, and two distinct rings, one for LH1α, and the other for LH1β, are seen. Another striking finding is the presence of elliptical LH1-only rings, whether or not the RC is present. The crystalline lattice contains defects (Fig. 2a, bottom right), which imposes uneven packing constraints on the LH1 complex. Thus, in addition to the round or elliptical shapes in the crystal lattice, the RC-LH1 complex can also assume irregular, angular shapes (Fig. 2a, bottom right and Fig. 2e). The adopted shape of the central RC-LH1 complex is dictated by the surrounding complexes (denoted 1–4 in Fig. 2e), which exert uneven packing forces. This result not only reflects the intrinsic flexibility of the LH1 ring in the presence of the RC but also explains why empty LH1 complexes also distort into ellipses when packed in a two-dimensional crystal with orthogonal symmetry. Carefully inspecting the RC-LH1 ring shapes in Fig. 2, we perceive that their contours in the crystal are not perfect ellipses; individual shapes strongly depend on the orientation of the RC in the surrounding complexes, again reflecting the intrinsic flexibility of the LH1 ring. Consequently, a large diversity of possible contours emerges. When imaging at minimal force, only a little information is gained from complexes exposing the periplasmic face (central particle in Fig. 2e). This is because this face of the complex forms grooves in the lattice, which are poorly accessible to the AFM tip. Increasing the force applied to the AFM tip to 200–300 pN improves the contrast on the periplasmic side of the complex significantly, unveiling a structure in the approximate shape of an “X” arising from the periplasmic face of the RC (Fig. 2f). This RC surface is at a lower level than the surrounding ring formed by the C-terminal regions of LH1. However, the higher force applied to the AFM stylus involves a loss in resolution on the cytoplasmic side of the RC-LH1 complex and the introduction of defects in the H-subunit (Fig. 2f, arrows). The solid circle in Fig. 2a indicates a lipid region where the AFM tip can descend to touch the surface of the lipid bilayer; this is invaluable because it provides a way to measure the heights of the LH1 and RC complexes above the membrane. Thus, on the cytoplasmic side, the height from the lipid bilayer to the highest point of the protruding RC is 40 ± 3 Å (n = 48), and from the highest point on the LH1 ring to the highest point of the RC is 22 ± 2 Å (n = 48). On the periplasmic side, the distance from the surface of the LH1 complex to the membrane bilayer is 12 ± 2 Å (n = 120). Therefore, given the measured thickness of the membrane bilayer of 45 ± 3 Å (n = 50), the overall height of the RC-LH1 complex is ∼94 Å. All of this height information is incorporated into the representation of the RC-LH1 complex in Fig. 3, which incorporates structural and modeling information for the homologous Rb. sphaeroides complex. This model of the complex shows the RC (structure of the Rb. sphaeroides homolog; Protein Data Bank ID code 1M3X), surrounded by the LH1 complex, which was modeled on the Rb. sphaeroides LH1αβ dimer from Conroy et al. (19.Conroy M.J. Westerhuis W.H. Parkes-Loach P.S. Loach P.A. Hunter C.N. Williamson M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and fitted to the EM projection map of the R. rubrum RC-LH1 complex in Jamieson et al. (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Shape of the RC-LH1 Complex—The elliptical shape of the LH1 complex observed in the present work is consistent with the overall shape of the RC (27.Allen J.P. Feher G. Yeates T.O. Komiya H. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6162-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28.Arnoux B. Ducruix A. Reiss-Husson F. Lutz M. Norris J. Schiffer M. Chang C.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29.Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). However, adoption of this shape by the encircling LH1 ring depends on external packing constraints. When these packing forces are evenly applied, as in the tetragonal crystals of Jamieson et al. (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), or absent, as in solution (30.Gerken U. Lupo D. Tietz C. Wrachtrup J. Ghosh R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10354-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), then they can be circular. In contrast, when packing forces are anisotropic, the complex can be squeezed so that it adopts an elliptical shape (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The extent of ellipticity is also variable. The present AFM data are important in measuring these ellipses directly at room temperature. They also dramatically illustrate the point about packing constraints; there is an area of the crystal (Fig. 2a, bottom right and at higher magnification in Fig. 2e) within which lattice imperfections are induced by faulty packing of the RC-LH1 complexes. One poorly packed complex in this region clearly exhibits an angular shape where it makes contact with neighboring complexes. The EM projection maps in Jamieson et al. (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) clearly established the capacity of the RC-LH1 complex to adopt both circular and elliptical conformations. This flexibility of the LH1 complex was suggested to be important for its function, by allowing the export of quinol formed as a result of reaction center photochemistry (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a similar ellipticity was observed in AFM topographs of the membrane-bound Rps. viridis RC-LH1 complex, only to alter to a circular shape upon removal of the RC (16.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our topographs of the R. rubrum complex differ, in that ellipses are observed whether or not the RC is present. Additionally, because we are able to image both sides of the complex, we have demonstrated that this ellipticity is conserved on periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides of the complex, regardless of the presence of the RC. However, this does not imply that there is a “correct” answer to the question of the shape of the LH1 complex, only that this shape depends on local forces exerted by neighboring complexes, which were clearly different in the orthorhombic and tetragonal two-dimensional crystals in Jamieson et al. (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and which are probably different again in Rps. viridis membranes (16.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In fact, the shape of the LH1 complex is subject to subtle distortions; this fact is revealed because AFM provides information on individual molecules, whereas EM, for example, averages out such differences. Furthermore, crystallographic techniques necessarily ignore any complexes that do not form regular lattices. Careful inspection of the complexes in Fig. 2 shows that the LH1 complex is not perfectly elliptical but instead is more “D” shaped. Thus, the flexibility of LH1 is sufficiently pronounced to allow it to conform very closely to the real shape of the RC, which is also not perfectly elliptical in projection. Another aspect of the pliability of the LH1 complex has emerged from a closer examination of the projection structure of the RC-LH1 complex (6.Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); variable α-β and αβ-αβ spacings are found within the LH1 ring (not shown). The model in Fig. 3 presents the LH1 complex as a perfect ellipse for convenience, although we have already noted that this is one of many shape variations for this complex. The panels in Fig. 3 a–c depict space-filling representations of the model of the RC-LH1 complex to show how it relates to the AFM topographs in Fig. 2. Thus, the complete complex in Fig. 3a (cf. Fig. 2b) is accompanied by the complex lacking the RC-H subunit (Fig. 3b; see Fig. 2c for the AFM topograph), and the LH1 ring with no RC enclosed (Fig. 3c; see also Fig. 2d). The Heights of Extrinsic Regions of the RC-LH1 Complex in Relation to the Membrane Bilayer—The relative heights of the RC and LH1 complexes and the positions in the membrane were obtained from the AFM data. These heights can only be obtained directly by AFM, and the precision of this measurement allows several structural and functional aspects of the RC-LH1 complex to be examined. The AFM data, obtained for the first time for both periplasmic and cytoplasmic faces of the RC-LH1 complex, show that the highest part of the AFM topograph can be unequivocally assigned to the RC-H subunit, which protrudes from the membrane by 40 ± 3 Å and which is apparently easily removed by the AFM tip during scanning. Once fixed, this parameter allows the positions of aromatic residues of the RC to be examined, because the vertical distance between these residues and the extremity of the RC-H subunit is known from the Rb. sphaeroides RC structure, which is highly homologous to the RC of R. rubrum (31.Yeates T.O. Komiya H. Chirino A. Rees D.C. Allen J.P. Feher G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7993-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The vertical positions of these residues are of interest because they have been proposed to lie at the interface between hydrophobic and head group regions of a membrane bilayer, acting as membrane “anchors”. Specifically, it has been proposed that in the bacterial RC, Trp residues will be found at the membrane interface (32.Schiffer M. Chang C.H. Stevens F.J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and our AFM data allow this proposition to be examined. The results of this analysis were inconclusive and demonstrated an interfacial location for only a few Trp and other aromatic residues. In contrast, this proposed anchoring role for aromatic residues is more clearly seen for LH1 (see below). The LH1 complex of R. rubrum completely encloses the RC, and on the cytoplasmic side, it protrudes from the membrane surface by 19 ± 2 Å (n = 72). There have been predictions of substantial hydrophilic N-terminal domains for both the α and β polypeptides of LH1, based upon sequence alignments (33.Brunisholz R.A. Wiemken V. Suter F. Bachofen R. Zuber H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1984; 365: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and AFM measurements of LH2 complexes have shown protrusions of up to 15 Å (14.Scheuring S. Reiss-Husson F. Engel A. Rigaud J.L. Ranck J.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The absence of the RC-H subunit from some complexes, and even of the whole RC complex from others, afforded the opportunity of comparing the heights of the LH1 complex under these different conditions, but no height differences were detected. The AFM topographs in Fig. 2 are of sufficient quality to allow two rings within LH1 to be distinguished in the absence of the RC-H subunit, particularly so in the absence of the whole RC complex. No differences in height, with respect to the membrane, were noted for the inner and outer rings of LH1. On the periplasmic side, LH1 protrudes ∼12 Å from the membrane surface, and it also protrudes slightly from the periplasmic surface of the RC. This cannot be quantified, because relatively high forces are applied to the AFM tip to obtain images such as that displayed in Fig. 2f, but qualitatively speaking, it means that the LH1 complex forms a slightly raised rim around the RC. Our measurements can be compared with those of Scheuring et al. (16.Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), who examined the periplasmic side of membranes from Rps. viridis, and found that the LH1 complex protruded from the membrane by ∼10 Å. The model displayed in Fig. 3d relates the heights of the LH1 and RC complexes in relation to the membrane normal, according to the AFM data. We note two belts of aromatic residues for the LH1 complex, which coincide with the position of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic head group membrane interface. These aromatic regions are more clearly seen for the LH1 complex than for the RC, possibly because the RC is not required to anchor itself in the membrane bilayer because it is surrounded by LH1. Perhaps the LH1 complex provides a stabilizing “life-belt” around the RC. One exception to this possibility might be in the earliest stages of assembly of the photosynthetic unit before the LH1 ring has fully formed around the RC (34.Pugh R.J. McGlynn P. Jones M.R. Hunter C.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The surface color coding of the LH1 ring (Fig. 3d) shows that polar, extrinsic regions of this complex, indicated by the positive belt on both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides, are found in the lipid head group region of the membrane bilayer. Specifically, the positively charged residues are in a position to interact with the lipid phosphate groups. The Heights of the Protein and Bacteriochlorophyll Components of the RC-LH1 Complex in Relation to the Membrane Bilayer—The features of the RC-LH1 complex revealed by this AFM study also provide information on the positions of BChl cofactors in relation to the membrane. The distance along a vertical plane from the cytoplasmic extremity of the RC-H subunit to the special pair BChls of the RC is known. Thus, it can be demonstrated directly that the special pair BChls are located in the hydrophobic core of the membrane (see Fig. 3e). In contrast, the Fe atom on the cytoplasmic side of the complex lies just outside the head group region of the membrane. Recently, the RC was crystallized by using the cubic lipidic-phase method (35.Katona G. Andreasson U. Landau E.M. Andreasson L.E. Neutze R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the positions of the membrane bilayer deduced in this work are in approximate agreement with our direct measurements using AFM. As a consequence of using AFM to measure the positions of the RC and LH1 complexes along the membrane normal, the ring of LH1 BChls falls into alignment with the special pair BChls of the RC (Fig. 3e), in such a way that excitation energy could transfer along a horizontal plane from LH1 to the RC special pair BChls, as originally suggested (36.Hunter C.N. van Grondelle R. Olsen J.D. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2061961549,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of epidemic respiratory tract illness in children in the United States and worldwide. RSV infection of airway epithelial cells induces formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whose production mediates the expression of cytokines and chemokines involved the immune/inflammatory responses of the lung. In this study, we have investigated the role of ROS in RSV-induced signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) activation and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) gene expression in human airway epithelial cells. Our results indicate that RSV replication induces IRF-1 and -7 gene transcription, a response abrogated by antioxidants. RSV infection induces binding of STAT to the IRF-1 γ-interferon-activated sequence (GAS) and IRF-7 interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE). STAT1 and STAT3 bind IRF-1 GAS, whereas STAT1, STAT2, IRF-1, and IRF-9 bind IRF-7 ISRE. Antioxidant treatment blocks RSV-induced STAT binding to both the IRF-1 GAS and IRF-7 ISRE by inhibition of inducible STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that RSV-induced ROS formation is required for STAT activation and IRF gene expression. Although protein tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for RSV-induced STAT activation, Janus kinase and Src kinase activation do not mediate this effect. Instead, RSV infection inhibits intracellular tyrosine phosphatase activity, which is restored by antioxidant treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases induces STAT activation. Together, these results suggest that modulation of phosphatases could be an important mechanism of virus-induced STAT activation.

McCarthy C.A. Mandel G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingston, New York1995: 1501-1518Google Scholar). Since its isolation, RSV has been identified as a leading cause of epidemic respiratory tract illness in children in the United States and worldwide. In fact, RSV is so ubiquitous that it will infect 100% of children before the age of 3. It is estimated that 40–50% of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and 25% of children with pneumonia are infected with RSV, resulting in 100,000 hospital admissions annually in the United States alone (1.Hall C.B. McCarthy C.A. Mandel G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingston, New York1995: 1501-1518Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of RSV-induced airway disease and the associated long term consequences are largely unknown, the local inflammatory response is thought to play a fundamental role. Airway epithelial cells are the target of RSV infection, and they respond to the infection producing a variety of mediators involved in lung immune/inflammatory responses, such as cytokines, chemokines, interferons, and up-regulating adhesion molecules and major histocompatibility complex antigens on the cell surface (for review, see Ref. 2.Garofalo R.P. Haeberle H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Regulation of cellular responses to extracellular stimuli is a central aspect of host defense, and it is coordinated by intracellular networks in which different subsets of transcription factors are involved in the expression of diverse set of target genes, depending on the nature of the extracellular stimulus. RSV induces gene expression through the coordinate induction of multiple transcription factors that assemble in nucleoprotein complexes, defined “enhanceosomes,” as we demonstrated for the chemokines interleukin-8 and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cells expressed and secreted) (3.Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4.Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Haeberle H. Elliott T.F. Lin A. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6428-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cellular signaling events leading to RSV-induced transcription factor activation are mostly unknown. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ubiquitous, highly diffusable and reactive molecules, produced as a result of reduction of molecular oxygen, including species such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical, and they have been implicated in damaging cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA. In the past few years, there has been increased recognition of their role as redox regulators of cellular signaling (for review, see Refs. 5.Allen R.G. Tresini M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar and 6.Prasad Gabbita S. Robinson K.A. Stewart C.A. Floyd R.A. Hensley K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 1-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that RSV infection of airway epithelial cells rapidly induces ROS production (7.Casola A. Burger N. Liu T. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19715-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of airway epithelial cells with the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), as well a panel of chemically unrelated antioxidants, blocked RSV-induced chemokine gene expression and protein secretion, through inhibition of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) activation. Antioxidant treatment inhibited de novo IRF-1 and -7 gene expression, protein synthesis, and IRF-3 nuclear translocation, indicating that a redox-sensitive pathway was involved in RSV-induced IRF activation (7.Casola A. Burger N. Liu T. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19715-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The IRF proteins belong to a family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of important immune/inflammatory genes, including RANTES and interleukin-15, as well as of genes necessary to mount an effective antiviral response, such as interferons (8.Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pithas P.M. Cytokine Growth Ed. Rev. 1997; 4: 293-312Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar). IRF-3 is constitutively expressed, but IRF-1 and -7 are virus-inducible (8.Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pithas P.M. Cytokine Growth Ed. Rev. 1997; 4: 293-312Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the unknown mechanism of antioxidant inhibition of virus-induced IRF-1 and -7 activation. Our results indicate that RSV infection of alveolar epithelial cells induces IRF-1 and -7 gene transcription, an effect abrogated by BHA treatment. RSV infection induces members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family to bind the IRF-1 γ-interferon-activated sequence (GAS) and the IRF-7 interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE) of transcription factors belonging to the STAT1 and STAT3 bind IRF-1 GAS, whereas STAT1, STAT2, IRF-1, and IRF-9 bind IRF-7 ISRE. Antioxidant treatment blocks RSV-induced binding to both IRF-1 GAS and IRF-7 ISRE and inhibits RSV-induced STAT1 and -3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. These data suggest that RSV-induced ROS formation is involved in STAT activation and IRF gene expression, following RSV infection. Although protein tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for RSV-induced STAT activation and induction of IRF promoter, Janus kinase (JAK) and Src kinase activation do not mediate this effect. Interestingly, RSV infection induces a significant decrease in intracellular tyrosine phosphatase activity, which is restored by antioxidant treatment, and pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases in airway epithelial cells induces STAT activation. Together, these results suggest that modulation of phosphatases could be an important mechanism of virus-induced STAT activation. Finally, treatment of alveolar epithelial cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) abolishes STAT activation, indicating that NAD(P)H oxydase system is an important enzyme for the generation of ROS and the subsequent activation of STAT, following RSV infection. This study provides novel insights into the role of ROS in virus-induced IRF and STAT protein activation. Reagents—Antibodies anti-STAT1 (sc-592X), anti-STAT2 (sc-476X), anti-STAT3 (sc-482X), anti-STAT5 (sc-1656X), anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (sc-8394), anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (sc-8059), anti-IRF-1 (sc-497X), and anti-IRF-9 (sc-496X) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The chemical inhibitors AG490, AG82, protein phosphatase (PP)1, PP2, and DPI were purchased from Calbiochem. RSV Preparation—The A2 strain of RSV was grown in Hep-2 cells and purified by centrifugation on discontinuous sucrose gradients as described elsewhere (9.Ueba O. Acta Med. Okayama. 1978; 32: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). The virus titer was determined by a methyl-cellulose plaque assay. No contaminating cytokines were found in these sucrose-purified viral preparations (10.Patel J.A. Kunimoto M. Sim T.C. Garofalo R. Eliott T. Baron S. Ruuskanen O. Chonmaitree T. Ogra P.L. Schmalstieg F. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Viral pools were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR analysis and were used if they had <0.125 EU/ml endotoxin (by Limulus assay). Virus pools were aliquoted, quick frozen on dry ice/alcohol, and stored at –70 °C until used. Cell Culture and Infection of Epithelial Cells with RSV—A549, human alveolar type II-like epithelial cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were maintained in F12K medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell monolayers were infected with RSV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 (unless otherwise stated), as described previously (11.Garofalo R.P. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An equivalent amount of a 20% sucrose solution was added to uninfected A549 cells, as a control. When BHA or other inhibitors were used, cells were pretreated with the compound for 1 h and then infected in the presence of that compound. Because BHA was diluted in ethanol and the other inhibitors in dimethyl sulfoxide, equal amounts of either ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide were added to untreated cells, as a control. The total number of cells and cell viability, following treatment, were measured by trypan blue exclusion. Northern Blot—Total RNA was extracted from control and infected A549 cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method. 20 μg of RNA was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to a radio-labeled IRF-1, IRF-7, and RSV N protein cDNAs as described previously (7.Casola A.

After washing, membranes were exposed for autoradiography with Kodak XAR film at –70 °C, using intensifying screens. After exposure, membranes were stripped and rehybridized with a β-actin probe. Cell Transfection—To investigate IRF-1 and -7 gene transcription, we transiently transfected A549 cells with the IRF-1 or -7 promoter, linked to the luciferase reporter gene (generous gifts from Dr. A. B. Deisserot, Yale University, New Haven, and Dr. P. M. Pitha, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, respectively) (13.Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell.

Logarithmically growing A549 cells were transfected in triplicate in 60-mm Petri dishes by DEAE-dextran, as described previously (3.Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in 2 ml of HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 20 μl of 60 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Amersham Biosciences) premixed with 6 μg of either IRF-1 or -7 plasmids and 1 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase internal control plasmid. After 3 h, the medium was removed, and 0.5 ml of 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline was added to the cells for 2 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured overnight in 10% fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The next morning, cells were infected with RSV, and cells were lysed at different times postinfection to measure independently luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter activity, as described previously (3.Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Luciferase was normalized to the internal control β-galactosidase activity. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts of uninfected and infected A549 cells were prepared using hypotonic/nonionic detergent lysis, as described previously (3.Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Proteins were normalized by protein assay (Protein Reagent, Bio-Rad) and used to bind to a duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to the IRF-1 GAS and IRF-7 ISRE, whose sequences are as follows: IRF-1 GAS, 5′-GATCCAGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACGGC-3′ and 3′-CGGACTAAAGGGGCTTTACTGCCGCTCTAG-5′; IRF-7 ISRE, 5′-TTTAGGTTTCGCTTTCCCGGG-3′ and 3′-TCCAAAGCGAAAGGGCCCTCG-5′. DNA binding reactions contained 10–15 μg of nuclear proteins, 5% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 40,000 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in a total volume of 20 μl. The nuclear proteins were incubated with the probe for 15 min at room temperature and then fractionated by 4% nondenaturing PAGE in 0.5× TBE buffer (22 mm Tris-HCl, 22 mm boric acid, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8) at 120 volts. After electrophoretic separation, gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography with Kodak XAR film at –70 °C using intensifying screens. In the gel mobility supershift, commercial antibodies against specific transcription factors were added to the binding reactions and incubated on ice for 1 h prior to fractionation on 4% PAGE. Western Immunoblot—Nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (3.Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% albumin in TBS-Tween and incubated overnight with antibody recognizing the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT1 and STAT3. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to STAT1 and STAT3. For secondary detection, we used a horseradish-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody, in the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). Intracellular Tyrosine Phosphatase Assay—Total intracellular tyrosine phosphatase activity was performed using the tyrosine assay kit from Promega, Madison, WI, according to manufacturer's protocol. This is a colorimetric assay that determines the amount of free phosphate generated in a reaction, which includes the source of phosphatase plus a tyrosine phosphopeptide, by measuring the absorbance of a molybdate-malachite green-phosphate complex. Briefly, total cell lysates from A549 cells, control and infected with RSV, in the absence or presence of 400 m BHA, were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, as described previously (7.Casola A. Burger N. Liu T. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19715-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Excess free phosphate was removed from cell lysates using the provided spin columns and 3 μg of samples were mixed with 100 μm tyrosine phosphopeptide substrate and incubated at 30 °C for 20–60 min. Reactions were stopped adding a molybdate dye solution, color was allowed to develop for 15–20 min, and absorbance was read at 600 nm with a plate reader. Phosphatase activity was expressed as generation of pmol of free phosphate/min/μg of protein. BHA Inhibits RSV-induced IRF Transcription—We have recently shown that RSV infection of A549 cells, type II-like alveolar epithelial cells, induced IRF-1 and -7 gene expression, and antioxidant treatment greatly diminished RSV-induced steady-state IRF mRNA levels (7.Casola A. Burger N. Liu T. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19715-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Treatment of A549 cells with 400 μm BHA almost completely abolished the expression of IRF-1 and IRF-7 genes following RSV infection, without significantly affecting viral replication, as determined by levels of RSV N protein expression (Fig. 1). Antioxidant treatment slightly reduced cell viability (a decrease of ∼10% in BHA-treated cells versus untreated, data not shown) without reducing the amount of virus released by infected cells, as shown previously (7.Casola A.

Previous studies, investigating interferon-β and -γ stimulation of IRF-1 and -7 gene induction, have demonstrated that IRF gene expression is controlled at the transcription level (14.Lu R. Au W.C.

To determine whether IRF-1 gene transcription was increased after RSV infection, A549 cells were transiently transfected with a construct containing 1.3 kb of the human IRF-1 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (13.Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The day after, cells were infected with RSV for various lengths of time and harvested to measure luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, RSV infection induced a time-dependent increase in IRF-1 promoter activation, which started between 3 and 6 h postinfection, peaked at 12 h, and started to decrease at 24 h. To determine whether the antioxidant effect of BHA influenced IRF gene transcription, A549 cells were transfected with the IRF-1 promoter, infected with RSV in the absence or presence of 400 μm BHA, and harvested 12 h later to measure luciferase activity. We have shown previously that a 400 μm concentration of BHA is able to block ∼ 90% of RSV-induced ROS production without interfering with cell viability (7.Casola A. Burger N. Liu T. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19715-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment with BHA completely abolished RSV-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that the antioxidant inhibits IRF-1 gene expression, at least partially, by interfering with gene transcription.Fig. 2IRF-1 promoter activation after RSV infection.

At different times postinfection, cells were harvested to measure luciferase activity. Uninfected plates served as controls. B, effect of BHA. A549 cells were transfected with the IRF-1 promoter plasmid, infected with RSV for 12 h, in the absence or presence of 400 μm BHA, and harvested to measure luciferase activity.

Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of normalized luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate IRF-7 gene transcription following RSV infection, we performed similar studies using A549 cells transiently transfected with a construct containing 1.7 kb of the human IRF-7 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (14.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As with IRF-1, RSV infection induced a time-dependent increase in luciferase activity, which started around 3 h postinfection, peaked at 6 h, and then declined after 12 h (Fig. 3A). Similarly, BHA treatment completely abolished RSV-induced luciferase activity, indicating that antioxidant treatment also inhibits IRF-7 gene transcription (Fig. 3B). It is important to notice that, although BHA treatment inhibited RSV-induced IRF-1 and -7 promoter activation, it did not affect the basal level of transcription of both genes, indicating that BHA affects only the inducible component of gene transcription. We have also shown previously that BHA does not affect expression of constitutively transcribed cellular genes, such as β-actin (7.Casola A. Burger N. Liu T. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19715-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RSV-induced STAT Activation Is Redox-sensitive—Several studies have investigated the promoter elements involved in the regulation of IRF-1 gene expression and have identified the GAS as a major site necessary for inducible transcription (15.Harada H. Takahashi E. Itoh S. Harada K. Hori T.A. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To determine whether RSV infection produced changes in the abundance of DNA-binding proteins recognizing the IRF-1 GAS, EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from A549 cells, control and infected with RSV for various lengths of time. As shown in Fig. 4A, a single nucleoprotein complex (C3) was formed from nuclear extracts of control cells on the IRF-1 GAS probe. RSV infection induced the appearance of two other complexes, C1 and C2 (better resolved on longer electrophoresis as in Fig. 4C), starting between 1 and 3 h postinfection, peaking around 3–6 h, and declining after 12 h of infection. The sequence specificity of the different complexes was examined by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides in EMSA (Fig. 4B). C1 and C2 were competed by the wild type but not by the mutated oligonucleotide, indicating GAS-specific binding. IRF-1 GAS has been shown to bind transcription factors of the STAT family (18.Stevens A.M. Wang Y.F. Sieger K.A. Lu H.F. Yu-Lee L.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 513-525PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the composition of the RSV-inducible complexes, we performed supershift assays using a panel of antibodies reacting with the different members of STAT family of transcription factors. The anti-STAT1 antibody induced the disappearance of C2 and the appearance of a supershifted band, whereas the anti-STAT3 antibody caused a reduction of C1 and the appearance of a supershifted band (supershifted complexes are indicated by the arrows), as shown in Fig. 4C. Antibodies recognizing STAT2, STAT5, and IRF-9 did not induce changes in binding or mobility shifts. These data indicate that STAT1 and -3 are the major components of the RSV-inducible IRF-1 GAS complexes. To determine whether BHA-induced inhibition of IRF-1 gene transcription was the result of changes in STAT binding to the IRF-1 GAS, we performed EMSAs using nuclear extracts prepared from A549 cells, control or infected with RSV for 3 h, in the absence or presence of BHA. As shown in Fig. 5, RSV infection induced a significant increase in STAT binding, which was completely abolished by treatment with BHA. IRF-7 gene transcription is controlled mainly through activation of the promoter ISRE site, which binds transcription factors of the STAT and IRF families (14.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of RSV-induced IRF-7 transcription by antioxidant treatment was also the result of changes in abundance of proteins binding to the IRF-7 ISRE, we performed EMSAs using nuclear extracts of A549 cells, control and infected with RSV for various lengths of time, in the presence or absence of BHA. As shown in Fig. 6A, a single nucleoprotein complex (C3) was formed from nuclear extracts of control cells on the IRF-7 ISRE probe. RSV infection induced the appearance of three other complexes, C1, C2, and C4, starting around 3 h postinfection, with a progressive increase in binding intensity at 6 h and a decline after 12 h of infection. Antioxidant treatment greatly reduced binding of the RSV-inducible complexes to the ISRE probe at all time points. The sequence specificity of the different complexes was examined by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides in EMSA (Fig. 6B). C1, C2, and C4 were competed by the wild type but not by the mutated oligonucleotide, indicating binding specificity. Supershift assays showed that anti-IRF-1 antibody induced a reduction of C4 and appearance of supershifted bands (indicated by the arrows), whereas the anti-STAT1, -2, and IRF-9 antibodies caused the disappearance or reduction of C1 and, in case of anti-STAT2, the appearance of a faint supershifted band (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that IRF-1 is the major component of the RSV-inducible C4, and STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-9, which together form the ISGF3 complex, are the major components of C1. We were not able to identify the composition of C2. STAT proteins are constitutively expressed and, in unstimulated cells, are located in the cytoplasm. Upon activation, they are phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues, a post-translational modification necessary for dimerization and nuclear translocation, both of which are requi"

These proteinases probably play a further role in formation of bone through activation of transforming growth factor β-like BMPs.

These proteinases mediate morphogenetic effects in part by biosynthetic processing of precursors into the mature functional forms of proteins necessary to formation of the extracellular matrix. For example, they provide the procollagen C-proteinase activity that excises the carboxyl-terminal propeptides of procollagens I–III, to yield the major fibril-forming components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (2.Kessler E.

These metalloproteinases may thus be central regulators in the formation of ECM.Type I collagen is the major organic component of mineralized ECM and serves as the template upon which mineral is deposited in tissues such as bone and dentin. Noncollagenous proteins of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein family, which includes dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) and dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1), are secreted into the ECM during assembly and mineralization of these tissues and are thought to initiate mineralization through their acidic calcium binding domains (19.Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20.Veis A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 493-497PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, genetic studies of human defects in biomineralization and analysis of transgenic mice have identified DMP1 and DSPP as important mediators of mineralization in bone and dentin (21.Zhang X.

Srinivasan R. Takagi Y. Veis A. George A. J. Dent. Res. 2000; 79: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms of action of these proteins in vivo remain to be clearly defined. The carboxyl-terminal domain of DSPP, designated the dentin phosphoprotein, and the carboxyl-terminal domain of DMP1, have both been shown to stimulate hydroxyapatite crystal formation in vitro (24.Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 25.He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that in vivo proteolytic processing of full-length DSPP and DMP1 occurs, to generate functional carboxyl-terminal cleavage fragments that can be found in the extracts of mineralized tissue (26.Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 904-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27.Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Whereas the proteinase(s) responsible for the specific cleavage of these proteins has not been identified, several predicted proteolytic sites have been mapped based on sequencing of DSPP and DMP1 fragments extracted from dentin and bone, respectively. The amino acid sequence at the amino terminus of dentin phosphoprotein from rat dentin was identified as Asp-Asp-Pro, suggesting that the major site of DSPP processing occurs between Gly447 and Asp448 (26.Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 904-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on analysis of DMP1-derived cleavage products extracted from rat bone, several processing sites were predicted. However, only one of these sites, between Ser196 and Asp197, occurs within sequences strictly conserved in DMP1 across species (27.Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although sequence identity between DSPP and DMP1 is low, the conservation of certain residues surrounding the two cleavage sites described above, within these two proteins, suggests that the same protease(s) may process DSPP and DMP1. Moreover, these sequences exhibit similarities to cleavage sites within a number of the physiological substrates of the BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases (11.Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N. Troedel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting DSPP and DMP1 as candidate substrates for BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases.In this study, we have generated recombinant DMP1 and tested it as a possible substrate for BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases. We demonstrate that BMP-1 cleaves mouse DMP1 to generate fragments similar to those previously isolated from mature rat bone. Among the BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases, BMP-1, mammalian Tolloid (mTLD), and mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (mTLL-1) all have similar activities in generating DMP1 fragments of the expected sizes, whereas mammalian Tolloid-like 2 (mTLL-2) has lesser activity in generating these fragments. Consistent with possible roles for the BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases in the physiological processing of DMP1, the NH2-terminal sequences of the cleavage products generated by BMP-1 matched those predicted from processing at the most well conserved site within DMP1. Moreover, using fibroblasts derived from Bmp1/Tll1 double null mouse embryos, we demonstrate that these proteinases are likely to contribute to DMP1 proteolysis in vivo. We provide evolutionary evidence that sequences adjacent to this particular processing site may be critical for maintenance of a functional DMP1 gene and discuss implications of the BMP1/Tolloid-like proteinases as functional mediators of biomineralization of bone and dentin ECM in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of DMP1 Expression Constructs—Mouse DMP1 coding sequences were amplified from mouse embryonic day 15 whole embryo Marathon Ready cDNA (Clontech) by PCR using forward primer 5′-AGTCACTAGTCTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTCTCCCAGTTGCCAGATACCACAAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCATGCGGCCGCTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTAGCCGTCCTGACAGTCATTGTC-3′, containing sequences 172–195 and 1609–1632, respectively, of the reported sequence (GenBank™ accession number U65020). The forward and reverse primers also contained SpeI and NotI restriction sites, respectively, to facilitate cloning and sequences encoding NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) and COOH-terminal FLAG epitopes, to facilitate detection of DMP1-derived proteolytic fragments. The PCR employed Advantage cDNA polymerase (Clontech) and denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min 30 s, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. After digestion with SpeI and NotI, the 1.6-kb PCR product, which contained sequences encoding full-length DMP1 minus the signal peptide, was inserted, together with an AflII-NheI fragment encoding the osteonectin/SPARC/BM40 signal peptide, between the AflII and NotI sites of the expression vector pcDNA4TO (Invitrogen). In the resulting expression vector, DMP1 sequences are downstream of and in frame with the osteonectin/SPARC/BM40 sequences, which were included to optimize secretion. Fidelity of the DMP1 expression vector was verified by DNA sequencing of the PCR insert and cloning junctions.Expression of Recombinant DMP1—293 T-REx cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, 10 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 5 μg/ml blasticidin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells at 80% confluence were transfected with 10 μg of the DMP1 expression vector per 100-mm tissue culture dish, using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For transient expression studies, cells were processed for protein production 24 h post-transfection as described below. For establishment of stable lines, cells were subcultured 1:4 at 48 h after transfection and selected in growth medium containing 200 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained under selection until colonies were visible (∼10 days); individual clones were isolated with cloning cylinders and amplified under selection in complete growth medium containing 200 μg/ml zeocin, and individual clones were processed for protein production as described below.Protein Production—Growth medium was removed from cell cultures, cell layers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cells were incubated for 15 min in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. Cell layers were washed with serum-free DMEM and replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline and 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) (Sigma). After 24 h, conditioned medium was harvested, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethlylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm EDTA (Sigma). Samples were stored at –80 °C until further use.Immunoprecipitation—To determine whether the expressed DMP1 was intact, 1 ml of conditioned medium from the DMP1 expression vector-transfected 293 T-REx cells was incubated with 20 μl of FLAG BioM2 matrix (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The matrix was pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and proteins were eluted with 50 μl of buffer A containing 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). SDS-PAGE 10× sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol was added to eluted proteins, and the samples were boiled prior to SDS-PAGE.Western Blot Analysis—Samples were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on 4–15% acrylamide gradient resolving gels and electrotransferred to either Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.) (for anti-FLAG, anti-HA, or anti-procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein 1 immunoblots) or Trans-Blot nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) (for anti-DMP1 immunoblot) membranes. Immunoblots were performed as previously described using antibodies specific for procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein 1 (28.Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For detection of DMP1, membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TPBS) and 5% nonfat dry milk for 4 h, followed by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody in TPBS containing 5% milk for 12 h. Blots were washed six times for 10 min in TPBS and probed with a 1:30,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) for 1 h in TPBS plus 5% milk. The blots were washed six times for 10 min each in TPBS, and immunoreactive proteins were revealed using Supersignal peroxidase substrate (Pierce).Purification of Recombinant DMP1—Conditioned media from transfected cells were applied to a column of 2 ml of settled DEAE-cellulose (DE52; Whatman), washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 40 μg/ml SBTI). Fractions were prepared for reducing SDS-PAGE, eluted samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized with Stains-All (Sigma). Fractions with the greatest enrichment of DMP1 protein were used both for in vitro cleavage assays and amino acid sequence analysis as described below.In Vitro Enzyme Assays—Approximately 750 ng of recombinant DMP1 was incubated alone or in combination with 1 pmol of recombinant BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, or mTLL-2 containing C-terminal FLAG epitopes (4.Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev.

Reactions were stopped by adding 10× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and boiling samples for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Stains-All as described above.Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Approximately 3 μg of purified recombinant DMP1 was incubated with 150 ng of BMP-1 at 37 °C for 20 h, and the reaction was quenched and prepared for SDS-PAGE as above. Products were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% resolving gel and electrotransferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Proteins were revealed with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems Division Procise494 HT Protein Sequencing System.Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts (MEFs)—MEFs were isolated from 13.5-day postconception embryos as described (6.Pappano W.N.

Cells were maintained in growth medium consisting of DMEM, 1 mm l-glutamine, 10 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum and were immortalized by routine serial passage. To detect endogenous DMP1 protein in MEFs, wild type or Bmp1/Tll1 doubly null cells at 80% confluence were treated with 10 nm dexamethasone, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid in growth medium containing DMEM, 1 mm l-glutamine, 10 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum for a period of 12 days. Cell layers were washed twice with PBS and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C. Media were replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 40 μg/ml SBTI, 10 nm dexamethasone, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Media were harvested at 48 h into protease inhibitors, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and media were concentrated by ethanol precipitation as previously described (6.Pappano W.N.

However, alignment of DMP1 amino acid sequences from a number of mammalian species demonstrates strict cross-species conservation of sequences (Fig. 1A; also see Fig. 5) around only one of the four predicted (27.Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) cleavage sites. In addition, although pairwise sequence comparison of mouse DMP1 and DSPP sequences yielded an overall identity of only ∼20% (data not shown), the highest level of conservation between the two proteins (42%) is found between 38 amino acid residues surrounding the conserved DMP1 cleavage site and a stretch of 38 residues surrounding the DSPP cleavage site, which has the highest cross-species conservation of sequences when DSPP molecules are compared (Fig. 1A). This conservation of sequences suggested that these sites in particular might be of functional importance and thus represent true sites of in vivo proteolytic processing rather than artifactual cleavage that might occur during extraction from tissues.Fig. 5Divergence of DMP1 amino acid sequences. From a previously reported alignment of DMP1 amino acid sequences from 10 species (33.Toyosawa S. Sato A. O'HUigin C. Tichy H. Klein J. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with additional alignment of the amino acid sequence of DMP1 from Noctilio leporinus (34.Van Den Bussche R.A. Reeder S.A. Hansen E.W. Hoofer S.R. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2003; 26: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a consensus DMP1 sequence was derived. The fraction of sequences differing from the derived consensus was plotted as a function of amino acid position within the mouse DMP1 protein and is presented graphically. The vertical arrows indicate the DMP1 processing sites predicted from Ref. 27.Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, and an asterisk indicates the position of the BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinase cleavage site identified in the current study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The amino acid sequences surrounding the conserved predicted cleavage sites of DMP1 and DSPP exhibit similarities to the amino acid sequences surrounding cleavage sites used by the BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases in their known substrates, including procollagens I–III, V, and VII; the proteoglycan probiglycan; prolysyl oxidase; laminin 5; and Chordin (Fig. 1B). In particular, the presence of aspartate residues at P1′ positions and of residues with aromatic side chains or methionines at P2–P4 positions are the most common features of cleavage sites in substrates of the BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases. These similarities suggested that BMP-1 or related proteinases might have the requisite specificity to process DSPP and DMP1 at the conserved predicted sites.Expression and Characterization of Recombinant Dentin Matrix Protein-1—Previous studies that have reported the isolation of DSPP and DMP1 from tissues have yielded only fragments of these proteins, complicating the study of their proteolytic processing and identification of the responsible proteinase(s). In order to examine the ability of BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases to generate physiological forms of DMP1 from the full-length protein, an expression plasmid was generated for the production of full-length DMP1, differing from native murine DMP1 only by replacement of the native signal peptide with the osteonectin/SPARC/BM40 signal peptide (for optimal secretion), and by the addition of NH2- and COOH-terminal HA and FLAG epitopes, respectively, to facilitate detection of the protein and proteolytic fragments. Transient transfection of 293 T-REx cells with the expression construct resulted in secretion of a ∼85–90-kDa protein species that reacted with both FLAG and HA-specific antibodies (Fig. 2A), whereas immunoblots failed to detect any reactive protein species in conditioned medium from cells transfected with the empty pcDNA4TO vector. The molecular weight predicted by the murine DMP1 amino acid sequence, minus signal peptide sequences, is 52,225. However, although recombinant DMP1 produced in Escherichia coli was reported to be ∼90 kDa (28.Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), DMP1 from mammalian tissues is both glycosylated and heavily phosphorylated, and biochemical estimates of the apparent molecular mass of post-translationally modified DMP1 from tissues have ranged from 150 to 200 kDa (29.Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30.Qin C. Brunn J.C. Jones J. George A. Ramachandran A. Gorski J.P. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To further characterize the recombinant DMP1 in the current study, DMP1 was immunoprecipitated from the conditioned media of transfected 293 T-REx cells using FLAG-specific antibody and then probed on immunoblots with HA-specific antibody. As can be seen (Fig. 2B), anti-FLAG antibody precipitated ∼85–90-kDa DMP1 that was recognized on immunoblots by HA-specific antibody. Thus, at least some of the ∼85–90-kDa DMP1 protein is full-length, retaining both NH2 and COOH termini, and it is highly unlikely that any of the ∼85–90-kDa forms represent a mix of DMP1 fragments of similar size, some of which retain NH2 termini and some of which retain COOH termini. As can be observed in Fig. 2B, the recombinant DMP1 sometimes migrated as a doublet, the nature of which is further characterized below.Fig. 2Characterization and purification of recombinant DMP1 produced by transfected 293 T-REx cells.

The first experiment shows that there is a fetuin-mineral complex in the blood of rats in which extensive calcification of the artery media has been induced by treatment with vitamin D for 96 h, and that there is no detectable fetuin-mineral complex in the blood of rats in which artery calcification has been inhibited by concurrent treatment with ibandronate or osteoprotegerin. The second experiment shows that the timing of vitamin D-induced artery calcification correlates with the timing of the maximal increase in serum fetuin-mineral complex levels. Whereas both results indicate that serum levels of the fetuin-mineral complex are indeed associated with vitamin D-induced artery calcification, the biochemical basis for this association is presently unclear. One possibility is that high levels of the fetuin-mineral complex cause defects in the ability of fetuin to prevent the growth of the mineral component, which then seeds artery calcification. Another possibility is that the fetuin-mineral complex is the downstream product of a pathway that begins with the true causative agent, and that the serum level of the fetuin-mineral complex is a marker for the activity of this agent in blood. An unexpected finding of the present studies is that vitamin D-induced artery calcification is also correlated with a 65 to 75% reduction in serum fetuin, a reduction that appears to be caused by the clearance of the fetuin-mineral complex from serum.

An unexpected finding of the present studies is that vitamin D-induced artery calcification is also correlated with a 65 to 75% reduction in serum fetuin, a reduction that appears to be caused by the clearance of the fetuin-mineral complex from serum. We recently proposed the hypothesis that artery calcification is linked to bone resorption to explain the association between increased bone resorption and increased artery calcification that has been seen in the vitamin D-treated rat (1.Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), in the osteoprotegerin-deficient mouse (2.Bucay N. Sarosi I. Dunstan C.R. Morony S. Tarpley J. Capparelli C. Scully S. Tan H.L. Xu W. Lacey D.L. Boyle W. Simonset W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar), and in patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis (see Ref. 3.Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar for references). One prediction of the hypothesis that artery calcification is linked to bone resorption is that inhibitors of bone resorption should inhibit artery calcification (3.Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In previous studies we tested this prediction using three different types of bone resorption inhibitors, each with an entirely different mode of action on the osteoclast: the amino bisphosphonates alendronate and ibandronate (3.Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the cytokine osteoprotegerin (4.Price P.A. June H.H. Buckley J.R. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1610-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and the V-H+-ATPase inhibitor SB 242784 (5.Price P.A. June H.H. Buckley J.R. Williamson M.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Each bone resorption inhibitor potently inhibited artery calcification. Our working hypothesis is that a causative agent for artery calcification arises in bone, travels in blood, and then induces calcification in the artery wall. A necessary condition for this blood-born theory of artery calcification is that bone resorption inhibitors affect blood chemistry in a way that is plausibly associated with their ability to prevent artery calcification. In previous studies we have shown that this putative change in blood chemistry cannot simply be changes in serum calcium and phosphate, because doses of osteoprotegerin and of bisphosphonates that inhibit artery calcification do not lower serum levels of calcium or phosphate in the warfarin-treated rat, and do not affect the extent of hypercalcemia seen in the vitamin D-treated rat (3.Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 4.Price P.A. June H.H. Buckley J.R. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb.

In the present investigations we have examined another potential change in blood chemistry that could be arguably correlated with artery calcification, the presence of a fetuin-mineral complex. Previous studies have shown that the fetuin-mineral complex consists of a calcium phosphate mineral phase and the proteins fetuin (called α2-HS glycoprotein in humans) and matrix Gla protein (MGP), 1The abbreviations used are: MGP, matrix Gla protein; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.1The abbreviations used are: MGP, matrix Gla protein; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and that the complex can be detected at extraordinarily high levels in blood following the acute inhibition of mineralization with etidronate (7.Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibition of bone resorption with calcitonin, alendronate, or osteoprotegerin completely prevents the appearance of the fetuin-mineral complex in blood following etidronate administration (8.Price P.A. Caputo J.M. Williamson M.K. J. Bone Mineral Res. 2002; 17: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recent studies found that the fetuin-mineral complex is formed from the serum fetuin pool, and that clearance of the complex from blood removes fetuin associated with the complex and thereby reduces total levels of serum fetuin (9.Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22153-22160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These studies also showed that the ratio of the dominant protein component of the complex, fetuin, to calcium phosphate mineral varies by as much as 1.9-fold depending on etidronate dose, and the term “fetuin-mineral complex” therefore refers to a range of complexes of fetuin, MGP, and mineral that differ somewhat in composition much like the low density lipoprotein of blood (9.Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22153-22160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the studies presented here our general strategy has been to directly compare blood levels of the fetuin-mineral complex in rats in which artery calcification had been induced by treatment with toxic doses of vitamin D to those found in rats treated with toxic doses of vitamin D together with doses of ibandronate or osteoprotegerin sufficient to completely prevent any evidence of vitamin D-induced artery calcification. The dominant protein component of the fetuin-mineral complex, fetuin, is a 59-kDa glycoprotein that consists of 2 N-terminal cystatin domains and a smaller C-terminal domain. Fetuin is synthesized in the liver and is found at high concentrations in mammalian serum (10.Pedersen K.O. Nature. 1944; 154: 575-580Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11.Brown W.M. Saunders N.R.

The serum fetuin concentration in adult mammals ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, whereas the serum fetuin concentration in the fetus and neonate is typically far higher (11.Brown W.M. Saunders N.R. Mollgard K. Dziegielewska K.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Tissue Int. 1984; 36: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) bone. Despite the abundance of fetuin in bone, however, it has not been possible to demonstrate the synthesis of fetuin in calcified tissues, and it is therefore presently thought that the fetuin found in bone arises from hepatic synthesis via serum (15.Mizuno M. Farach-Carson M.C. Pinero G.J. Fujisawa R. Brunn J.C. Seyer J.M. Bousfield G.R. Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Bone Miner. 1991; 13: 1-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17.Wendel M. Heinegard D. Franzen A. Matrix. 1993; 13: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This view is supported by the observation that fetuin binds strongly to apatite, the mineral phase of bone, and is concentrated from serum onto apatite to a far greater extent than is albumin (13.Ashton B.A. Hohling H.J. Triffitt J.T. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1976; 22: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The less abundant protein component of the complex, MGP, is a 10-kDa vitamin K-dependent protein that is secreted by a wide variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. Both protein components of the fetuin-mineral complex have been shown to function as calcification inhibitors. In vitro studies demonstrate that MGP potently inhibits calcification of aortic elastin in vitro (18.Alagao F.C. Patel R. Price P.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: S208Google Scholar), and genetic and biochemical studies have convincingly demonstrated that impaired MGP function causes extensive calcification of the elastic lamellae in the artery media of mice (19.Luo G.

In vitro studies have also demonstrated that fetuin is an important inhibitor of apatite formation in serum containing increased levels of calcium and phosphate (22.Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A.

More recent studies have shown that a fetuin-mineral complex is formed in the course of the fetuin-mediated arrest of apatite formation in serum containing increased calcium and phosphate (24.Price P.A.

Purified bovine fetuin has also been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase from supersaturated solutions of calcium phosphate (22.Schinke T.

Despite the evidence that fetuin is a potent serum inhibitor of calcium phosphate precipitation, the phenotype of the fetuin-deficient mouse on a normal diet is far less dramatic than that of the MGP-deficient mouse, with evidence of ectopic microcalcifications in soft tissues but no evidence for artery calcification (23.Jahnen-Dechent W.

Materials—Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) was purchased from Sigma and Ibandronate (Bondronat, Roche Diagnostics) was purchased from Idis World Medicines (Surrey, United Kingdom). Ibandronate was diluted with 0.15 m NaCl and stored at 4 °C. The osteoprotegerin used in this study was a generous gift of Amgen, Inc., and is a chimeric form of osteoprotegerin consisting of the ligand-binding domain of human osteoprotegerin (amino acids 22–194) fused at the N terminus to the C terminus of the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, and is covalently dimerized through the Fc domain (25.Simonet W.S. et al.Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4313) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of vitamin D were prepared fresh daily for each 3-day subcutaneous injection cycle at a concentration of 1.65 mg/ml in 7% Emulphor (alkamuls EL-620, Rodia, Inc.) (1.Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). NuPAGE bis-Tris 4–12% acrylamide gels were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA). Simonsen albino rats (Sprague-Dawley derived) were purchased from Simonsen Labs (Gilroy, CA). Methods—Calcium levels in serum and acid extracts were determined colorimetrically using cresolphthalein complexone (Sigma) and phosphate levels in serum and in acid extracts were determined colorimetrically as described (26.Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5827) Google Scholar). For measurement of mineral accumulation in thoracic aorta, aortas were removed within 30 min of death, cleaned of adhering non-vascular tissue, and patted dry with a kim-wipe. The aorta was placed into a 2-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube, 1 ml of 150 mm HCl was added to each tube, and the tubes were mixed end over end for 24 h at room temperature to dissolve mineral. Serum samples were analyzed to determine the level of cross-linked N-telopeptides (Osteomark NTx) by Ostex, Inc. (Seattle, WA) using a rat-specific 2The rat-specific NTx assay used in these tests is no longer offered by Osteomark. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (27.Gorski J.P. Apone S. Shaffer K.A.

For determination of rat MGP and rat fetuin, aliquots of acid extracts and serum samples were assayed in triplicate using radioimmunoassay procedures previously described (9.Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T.

Photogr. 1981; 16 (44): 22-26Google Scholar, 30.Rosa-Molinar E. Proskocil B.J. Ettel M. Fritzsch B. Brain Res. Protocols. 1999; 4: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For measurement of serum levels of the fetuin-mineral complex, blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 1 h, serum was collected by centrifuging at 1,400 × g for 10 min, and 200-μl aliquots were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at –70 °C. The serum fetuin-mineral complex was sedimented by centrifuging the 0.2-ml aliquots of serum for 2 h at 16,000 × g. Each tube was rinsed briefly with 200 μl of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl and the tubes were then incubated with 35 μl of 150 mm HCl for 24 h at room temperature. The acid extracts were analyzed for calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP. In a repeat centrifugation experiment (Fig. 3), pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of SDS gel loading buffer containing 60 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and reducing agent, and 20-μl aliquots were electrophoresed using 4–12% polyacrylamide gels. Treatment of Animals—Rats were fed ad libitum with rodent diet 5001 (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO), a diet that contains 0.67% phosphorus and 0.95% calcium by weight. Animals were killed by exsanguination while under isoflurane anesthetic. Artery calcification was induced by treatment with toxic doses of vitamin D, as described previously (1.Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In brief, 7-week-old male rats received subcutaneous injections of 500,000 IU of vitamin D3/kg body weight at t = 0, 24, and 48 h. Rats were killed 96 h after the first vitamin D injection, and the appropriate tissues were removed for analysis. In the osteoprotegerin experiment, rats also received daily subcutaneous injections of osteoprotegerin at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day beginning at the time of the first vitamin D injection. In the ibandronate experiment, rats also received subcutaneous injections of ibandronate at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day beginning 4 days prior to the first vitamin D injection. In the time course study, six 7-week-old male rats served as untreated controls (t = 0); 6 received 500,000 IU of vitamin D3/kg body weight at t = 0 and were killed at t = 24 h; 6 received 500,000 IU of vitamin D3/kg body weight at t = 0 and 24 h and were killed at t = 48 h; and 18 received 500,000 IU of vitamin D3/kg body weight at t = 0, 24, and 48 h, 6 of these were killed at t = 72, 6 at t = 84, and 6 at t = 96 h. The abdominal aorta and attached arteries were dissected as a unit from each animal. Each abdominal aorta unit was first stained with Alizarin red S and then extracted with 150 mm HCl to dissolve any calcification that might be present. The UCSD Animal Subjects Committee approved all animal experiments. Correlation between Artery Calcification and Serum Levels of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex in Rats Treated for 96 h with Vitamin D, Vitamin D + Ibandronate, and Vitamin D + Osteoprotegerin—Rats were treated for 3 days with 500,000 IU of vitamin D/kg, a procedure previously shown to induce extensive artery calcification (4.Price P.A.

Nutr. 2001; 131: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Subsets of these animals were also treated with doses of osteoprotegerin or ibandronate known to inhibit bone resorption in rats of this age and which, in prior studies, have been shown to inhibit vitamin D-induced artery calcification (4.Price P.A. June H.H. Buckley J.R. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1610-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6.Price P.A. Buckley J.R. Williamson M.K. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In agreement with these earlier studies, the abdominal arteries from all 6 rats treated with vitamin D alone had extensive Alizarin red staining for calcification, whereas the arteries of the 6 rats treated with vitamin D plus ibandronate and the 6 rats treated with vitamin D plus osteoprotegerin had no detectable Alizarin red staining for calcification. Fig. A (see Supplemental Materials) shows a typical example of the level of Alizarin red staining for calcification seen in the abdominal arteries of rats treated with vitamin D alone, and examples of the absence of Alizarin red staining seen in the arteries of rats treated with vitamin D plus osteoprotegerin and in rats treated with vitamin D plus ibandronate. Note that calcification in the vitamin D-treated animals is particularly pronounced in the smaller branch arteries, such as the mesenteric, celiac, and renal arteries. In previous studies, microscopic examination of von Kossa-stained sections showed that vitamin D-induced artery calcification begins within the elastic lamellae and is absent in artery sections from rats treated with vitamin D plus osteoprotegerin and with vitamin D plus ibandronate (4.Price P.A.

Nutr. 2001; 131: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The possible presence of the fetuin-mineral complex in the serum of vitamin D-treated rats was evaluated by biochemical analysis of the pellets formed by centrifuging serum for 2 h at 16,000 × g, a procedure that has been previously shown to pellet the fetuin-mineral complex found in the serum of etidronate-treated rats (7.Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A translucent, compact pellet was found in each of the 6 serum samples from animals treated with vitamin D alone, 3Previous efforts failed to detect the fetuin-mineral complex in serum from rats treated with vitamin D alone (7.Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The fact that the complex could be detected in the present experiments is because of the use of a longer centrifugation time (2 h versus 30 min) to form a more compact pellet, and to modifications in procedure that eliminated loss of the pellet during the 0.15 m NaCl wash step. but could not be detected in any of the serum from untreated control animals or from animals treated with vitamin D plus either ibandronate or osteoprotegerin. This pellet was visually identical to the translucent fetuin-mineral complex pellet formed by centrifuging serum from etidronate-treated rats. After removal of the supernatants, 0.15 m HCl was added to each tube to dissolve any fetuin-mineral complex that might be present, and the resulting acid extracts (termed “pellet fractions”) were analyzed to determine the levels of the known constituents of the serum fetuin-mineral complex, calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and matrix Gla protein (7.Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, treatment with vitamin D alone elevated the levels of calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP in the acid extracts by 25–75-fold compared with the levels in the acid extracts of control serum (p < 0.001 compared with control values). As an additional control for this experiment, serum samples from control and vitamin D-treated rats were placed in identical tubes but not centrifuged, and the serum was then removed, 0.15 m HCl was added to each tube, and the acid extracts were analyzed for calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP. The resulting values were not significantly different from the values shown in Fig. 1 for control serum after centrifugation (data not shown). These results show that there is not sufficient fetuin-mineral complex in the serum of control rats to be detected by these centrifugation procedures, whereas there is abundant centrifugation evidence for the presence of a fetuin-mineral complex in the serum of vitamin D-treated rats. Based on the pellet analyses, the weight ratio of mineral to fetuin in the fetuin-mineral complex found in the serum of vitamin D-treated rats is 1.32, which is comparable with the 1.15 ratio found for the complex in the serum of etidronate-treated rats when the same radioimmunoassay is used for fetuin measurement (9.Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22153-22160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 4The ratio of mineral to fetuin found for rats treated with the 32 mg of etidronate dose using the radioimmunoassay for rat fetuin, 1.15 (9.Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22153-22160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), is significantly higher than the 0.53 ratio reported in the initial study of the complex (7.Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The earlier study relied on a qualitative comparison of staining intensity in SDS gels between the rat fetuin-mineral complex and purified bovine fetuin (7.Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and was less accurate than the immunoassay procedures used in the subsequent study (9.Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22153-22160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 also shows that treatment with doses of ibandronate that prevent vitamin D-induced artery calcification eliminated the characteristic chemical elements of the fetuin-mineral complex from the pellet fraction. Treatment with vitamin D plus osteoprotegerin dramatically lowered the levels of these parameters compared with the values seen in the pellet fractions of animals treated with vitamin D alone, but in each case the values found in the rats treated with vitamin D plus osteopro-tegerin remained slightly above those seen in untreated control animals. The protein composition of the putative fetuin-mineral complex was also examined by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Each serum sample was again centrifuged for 2 h at 16,000 × g to sediment the fetuin-mineral complex. The supernatants were then removed and SDS gel loading buffer containing 60 mm EDTA was added to each tube to dissolve any fetuin-mineral complex that might be present.

In the present study we sought to determine the functional relevance of the p38α isoform in IFN signaling, using cells from mouse embryos with targeted disruption of the p38α gene. Our data demonstrate that p38α activation is essential for Type I IFN-dependent transcriptional regulation via ISRE or GAS elements. On the other hand, the function of p38α is not required for IFN-dependent Ser727 or Tyr701 phosphorylation of Stat1 and does not impact on the formation of ISGF3 or SIF nuclear binding complexes. In efforts to identify downstream effectors of p38 that may mediate IFN-dependent transcriptional responses, we found that IFNα activates the kinase Msk1, a known regulator of histone phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling. In other studies, we demonstrate that Type I IFN-dependent activation of the kinases MapKapK-2 and MapKapK-3 is defective in the absence of p38α, while Type I IFN-dependent antiviral properties are decreased in cells with targeted disruption of the MapKapK-2 gene.

There is accumulating evidence that among the different Map kinase subgroups, the p38 pathway may play an important role in interferon-signaling (7.Platanias L.C. Pharmacol.

Such activation of p38 appears to be initiated at the Type I IFN receptor level by the upstream activation of tyrosine kinases, likely Tyk-2 and/or Jak-1 (25.Mayer I.A. Verma A. Grumbach I.M.

Koromilas A.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5107-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The regulatory effects of p38 on Type I IFN-dependent transcriptional activation have been primarily suggested from studies employing pharmacological inhibitors (22.Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J.

The potential of p38 to regulate IFN-dependent gene transcription has suggested that this pathway either modulates the activation of IFN-regulated Stats, or that it functions independently via distinct downstream effectors that cooperate with the Stats to induce optimal transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Prior evidence using pharmacological p38 inhibitors has suggested the existence of a Stat-independent mechanism (22.Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the present study we used p38α knockout cells to define the role of p38α in the induction of IFN responses. Our data definitively establish that p38α is required for ISRE- and GAS-driven gene transcription in response to Type I interferons (IFNα, IFNβ), but it plays no role in Type II IFN (IFNγ)-dependent gene transcription. Type I IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3, Stat1 phosphorylation on serine 727, and formation of Stat DNA binding complexes are normally formed in the absence of p38α, establishing that this pathway does not modulate activation of Stats. Our data identify Map kinase-activated protein kinases 2 and 3 (MapKapK-2 and MapKapK-3) and mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (Msk1) as potential downstream mediators of the regulatory effects of p38α on IFN-inducible responses.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with 5 × 103 units/ml of IFNα or IFNβ as indicated. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed essentially as previously described (37.Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M.

ChIP DNA was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with human ISG15 gene ISRE forward (FP) (5′-cat gcc tcg gga aag gga aac-3′) and reverse (RP)(5′-gtg aca tct gcc tta cca tgg-3′) primers. Msk1 Kinase Assays—Cells were incubated with IFNα for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-Msk1 antibody or control non-immune RIgG. In vitro kinase assays were subsequently carried out on the immunoprecipitates, as previously described (40.Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Values were calculated by subtracting nonspecific activity, detected in RIgG immunoprecipitates, from kinase activity detected in anti-Msk1 immunoprecipitates. MapKap K-2 and MapKap K-3 Kinase Assays—These assays were performed essentially as previously described (22.Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N.

Briefly, p38 +/+ and p38 –/– MEFs were treated with the indicated mouse IFNs for the indicated times, in the presence or absence of SB203580 (final concentration 10 μm), added 30 min prior to IFN treatment. The cells were then lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer, lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against MapKapK-2 or MapKapK-3, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP), and the immune complex kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of Hsp-25 protein (Stress Gen Laboratories) as a substrate and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Subsequently, the reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated Hsp-25 was detected by autoradiography. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the p38 Map kinase pathway is activated in a Type I interferon-dependent manner in several lines of diverse cellular origin. To definitively establish the role of p38α in interferon signaling, and to define its contribution in Type I IFN-dependent transcriptional activation, we performed studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with targeted disruption of the p38α gene (35.Adams R.H. Porras A. Alonso G. Jones M. Vintersten K. Panelli S. Valladares A. Perez L. Klein R. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We first confirmed the lack of p38α expression in the knockout MEFs (Fig. 1). Luciferase promoter assays were subsequently performed to evaluate the induction of Type I IFN-dependent transcriptional responses in the presence or absence of p38α. p38α +/+ and p38α –/– cells were transfected with an ISRE luciferase construct or an 8× GAS luciferase construct. The cells were subsequently treated with mouse IFNα and luciferase activity was measured. IFNα-dependent gene transcription via both ISRE and GAS elements was significantly reduced in the absence of the p38α kinase (Fig. 2, A and B). Some residual transcriptional response was present in still p38α –/– cells (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that other p38 isoforms may partially compensate for the absence of p38α. Nevertheless, the reduction in IFNα-dependent gene transcription for ISRE elements in p38α –/– cells was comparable to that seen in Stat1 –/– MEFs (Fig. 2C), indicating that the function of both the p38 and Stat pathways are essential for optimal gene transcription by IFNα.Fig. 2p38α is required for IFNα-dependent gene transcription via ISRE and GAS elements. p38α +/+ and p38α –/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with an ISRE-luciferase construct (A) or an 8X-GAS-luciferase construct (B). 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 6 h in the presence or absence of mouse IFNα, and luciferase activity was measured. Data are expressed as fold increase in response to mouse IFNα-treatment over control untreated samples for each condition. Mean + S.E. values of three independent experiments for the ISRE panel (A) and two independent experiments for the GAS panel (B) are shown. C, Stat1 +/+ and Stat1 –/– MEFs were transfected with an ISRE luciferase construct. 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 6 h in the presence or absence of mouse IFNα, and luciferase activity was measured. Data are expressed as fold increase in response to mouse IFNα treatment over control untreated samples for each condition. Mean ± S.E. values of two independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When similar studies were performed using another Type I IFN, IFNβ, we also found that mouse IFNβ-dependent transcriptional regulation via ISRE elements is impaired in the absence of the p38α isoform (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the induction of luciferase activity via GAS elements was significantly reduced in cells lacking p38α (Fig. 3B), strongly suggesting that activation of this pathway is required for transcriptional regulation by all different Type I IFNs. On the other hand, lack of p38α expression had no effect on IFNγ-inducible gene transcription via GAS elements (Fig. 3C), indicating that this kinase does not mediate signals that facilitate Type II IFN-dependent transcription. Thus, p38α appears to play a specific role in interferon-signaling, selectively targeting Type I but not Type II interferon pathways that impact on transcriptional activity. In subsequent studies, we determined whether the defective Type I IFN-dependent gene transcription observed in p38α-knockout cells results from defective activation of components of the Stat pathway. It is well established that phosphorylation of Stat1 on tyrosine 701 is required for its association with Stat2 and the formation of the mature Stat1·Stat2·IRF9 ISGF3 complex that translocates to the nucleus and binds to ISRE elements to initiate gene transcription (2.Darnell Jr., J.E.

Because protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are implicated in platelet secretion, we investigated the role of individual PKC isoforms in platelet dense granule release. PKCδ was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner that coincided with dense granule release in response to protease-activated receptor-activating peptides SFLLRN and AYPGKF in human platelets. Only agonists that caused platelet dense granule secretion activated PKCδ. SFLLRN- or AYPGKF-induced dense granule release and PKCδ phosphorylation occurred at the same respective agonist concentration. Furthermore, AYPGKF and SFLLRN-induced dense granule release was blocked by rottlerin, a PKCδ selective inhibitor. In contrast, convulxin-induced dense granule secretion was potentiated by rottlerin but was abolished by Go6976, a classical PKC isoform inhibitor. However, SFLLRN-induced dense granule release was unaffected in the presence of Go6976. Finally, rottlerin did not affect SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation, even in the presence of dimethyl-BAPTA, indicating that PKCδ has no role in platelet fibrinogen receptor activation. We conclude that PKCδ and the classical PKC isoforms play a differential role in platelet dense granule release mediated by protease-activated receptors and glycoprotein VI. Furthermore, PKCδ plays a positive role in protease-activated receptor-mediated dense granule secretion, whereas it functions as a negative regulator downstream of glycoprotein VI signaling.

Platelets are an important part of the hemostatic mechanism that is activated following vascular injury (1.Packham M.A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Upon activation, platelets secrete their granule contents that help amplify platelet responses to many of the physiological agonists. Human platelets contain two types of morphologically distinguishable storage granules: α-granules and dense granules. Substances released from the α-granules supplement the coagulation cascade at the site of vascular injury and hence contribute to the procoagulant function of platelets. The dense granules contain, among other components, ADP that is essential for recruiting platelets to the site of vascular injury.

Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Similarly, collagen fails to cause dense granule secretion in PLCγ2-deficient mouse platelets (5.Wang D. Feng J. Wen R.

Activation of PLC leads to generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (3.Gabbeta J. Yang X. Kowalska M.A. Sun L. Dhanasekaran N. Rao A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PKC isoforms are subdivided into three groups based on their lipid and cofactor requirements (20.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell.

Like the other members of the AGC family of kinases, PKC has three distinct phosphorylation sites: the activation loop, the turn motif, and the hydrophobic residues in the carboxyl terminus (22.Keranen L.M.

In this study, we show that PKCδ plays an important role in regulating agonist-induced platelet dense granule release and that it plays a differential role downstream of protease-activated receptors (PARs) and glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Materials—Apyrase (type VII), fibrinogen (type 1), bovine serum albumin (fraction V), thrombin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and acetylsalicylic acid were obtained from Sigma. ADP, epinephrine, and CHRONO-LUME reagent were purchased from Chrono-log Corp. (Havertown, PA). The stable thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide analog 9,11-dideoxy-9,11-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2 (U46619), the acetoxymethylester ester dimethyl-BAPTA, rottlerin, Go6976 and Ro 31-8220 (bisindolylmaleimide IX) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Hexapeptides SFLLRN and AYPGKF were custom synthesized at Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Convulxin was purchased from CenterChem, Inc. (Norwalk, CT). Serotonin was obtained from Acros Organics. PKC isoform-selective antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and phospho-specific PKC antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling technologies (Beverly, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Isolation of Human Platelets—Whole blood was drawn from healthy, consenting human volunteers into tubes containing one-sixth volume of ACD (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and2gof glucose in 100 ml of deionized water). Blood was centrifuged (Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge, Hamburg, Germany) at 230 × g for 20 min at room temperature to obtain platelet-rich plasma. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. The platelet-rich plasma was then centrifuged for 10 min at 980 × g at room temperature to pellet the platelets. Platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) containing 0.01 unit/ml apyrase. Cells were counted using the Coulter Z1 particle counter, and the concentration of the cells was adjusted to 2 × 108 platelets/ml. All experiments using washed platelets were performed in the absence of extracellular calcium unless otherwise mentioned. Measurement of Platelet Secretion—Platelet secretion was determined by measuring the release of ATP using the CHRONO-LUME reagent. The activation of platelets was performed in a lumiaggregometer at 37 °C with stirring at 900 rpm, and the secretion was measured and expressed in as nmol of ATP released/108 platelets. The data were normalized to the maximum secretion as indicated in the figure legends. In experiments in which inhibitors were used, the platelet sample was incubated with the inhibitors for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of agonists. The secretion was subsequently measured as described above. Aggregometry—Aggregation of 0.5 ml of washed platelets was analyzed using a PICA lumiaggregometer (Chrono-log Corp.). Aggregation was measured using light transmission under stirring conditions (900 rpm) at 37 °C. Agonists were added simultaneously for platelet stimulation; however, each inhibitor was preincubated as follows: 10 μm dimethyl-BAPTA, for 10 min at 37 °C; 10 μm Ro 31-8220, for 3 min at 37 °C; 5 μm rottlerin and 100 nm Go6976, for 15 min at 37 °C. Each sample was allowed to aggregate for at least 3 min. The chart recorder (Kipp and Zonen, Bohemia, NY) was set for 0.2 mm/s. Western Blot Analysis—Platelets were stimulated with agonists for the appropriate time, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 × SDS-Laemmli buffer. Platelet lysate were boiled for 10 min, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline and Tween (TBST; 20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 0.5% (w/v) milk protein and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature, and membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (1:1,000 dilution in TBST with 2% bovine serum albumin) with gentle agitation. After three washes for 5 min each with TBST, the membranes were probed with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution in TBST with 2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. After additional washing steps, membranes were then incubated with CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) for 10 min at room temperature, and immunoreactivity was detected using a Fuji Film Luminescent Image Analyzer (LAS-1000 CH, Japan). Presence of Different PKC Isoforms in Human Platelets—We first investigated the presence of various PKC isoforms in human platelets. This was achieved by Western blot analysis of platelet protein lysate using commercially available antibodies directed against specific PKC isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1, human platelets express PKC isoforms α, β, δ, η, θ, ϵ, and ξ. Despite loading the wells with excess protein, we could not detect the isoforms γ, λ, and ι. Time-dependent Dense Granule Release and Activation of PKCδ in Human Platelets by PAR-activating Peptides SFLLRN and AYPGKF—PKCδ has been implicated in secretion in other cell systems (26.Li J.

We evaluated the activation of this isoform by analyzing the activation-dependent phosphorylation of the threonine 505 residue in the activation loop following agonist stimulation (23.Parekh D.B.

When aspirin-treated, washed human platelets were stimulated for various time periods with 50 μm PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN and 500 μm PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF, dense granule secretion started as early as 15 s (Fig. 2, A and C). PKCδ activation, as measured by phosphorylation at threonine 505, occurred in a time-dependent manner starting at 15 s and was sustained for 2 min (Fig. 2, B and D). We also checked the phosphorylation states for extended time period as late as 10 min. The phosphorylation was still present following agonist stimulation until 10 min (data not shown). Whereas SFLLRN-induced dense granule release was maximal at 15 s, AYPGKF-induced dense granule release reached maximum at 30 s. The difference in the time to maximum dense granule secretion between SFLLRN and AYPGKF could be the result of the differential kinetics of receptor activation of the two peptides (35.Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, the time required for PAR agonist-induced PKCδ phosphorylation correlated with dense granule secretion. Note that PKCδ phosphorylation is maximal at 2 min, whereas the dense granule release occurred maximally at 30 s (AYPGKF). The probable reason for this finding could be that the contents of the α granules might cause further activation of PKCδ. Previous studies have shown that dense granule secretion occurs much earlier than α granule secretion following stimulation with agonists such as thrombin (36.Akkerman J.W. Gorter G. Kloprogge E. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37.Donato J.L. Nogueira M.D. Marcondes S. Antunes E. Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. de Nucci G. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1994; 27: 2163-2167PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the initial secretion and PKCδ phosphorylation might be mediated downstream from the agonist receptor, and the subsequent phosphorylation might be potentiated by the secreted contents from the α granules. The secretion does not increase further because this process could have been saturated during those time periods even in the presence of increased PKCδ phosphorylation. By this mechanism, the PKCδ phosphorylation could be amplified over an extended time period even though the primary signaling event ends much earlier. Phosphorylation of PKCδ by Agonists That Cause Platelet Dense Granule Release—We evaluated the ability of both GPCR and glycoprotein signaling to activate PKCδ and correlated it with their ability to cause dense granule secretion. Aspirin-treated and washed human platelets were stimulated with 1.0 unit/ml thrombin, 50 μm SFLLRN, 500 μm AYPGKF, 10 μm U46619, 10 μm ADP, 10 μm serotonin, 10 μm epinephrine, and 100 ng/ml convulxin, and both dense granule release and PKCδ phosphorylation were measured. As shown in Fig. 3, thrombin, SFLLRN, AYPGKF, U46619, or convulxin caused dense granule release (A), and phosphorylation of PKCδ (B), whereas ADP, serotonin, and epinephrine did not cause either. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a known PKC activator, was used as a positive control for phosphorylation for PKCδ. These results suggest that signaling downstream of both GPCR and glycoprotein receptors is capable of activating PKCδ. In particular, agonists that cause dense granule secretion also activated PKCδ. We further investigated whether ADP transiently causes PKCδ activation by measuring phosphorylation at various time points. As shown in Fig. 3C, ADP failed to cause PKCδ phosphorylation until 2 min. These data show that agonists that cause granule secretion also cause activation of PKCδ, suggesting the involvement of this PKC isoform in the process of dense granule secretion. Correlation of PAR-mediated Dense Granule Secretion and PKCδ Phosphorylation—We investigated whether the concentration of agonist required for secretion of dense granules correlated with the concentration needed for activation of PKCδ. Human platelets were stimulated with increasing concentrations of the PAR1-activating peptide, SFLLRN, and the amount of secreted ATP was measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, SFLLRN began to cause dense granule secretion at a concentration of 5 μm, which corresponded to the same concentration at which phosphorylation and activation of PKCδ began to occur (Fig. 4B). We used the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF to correlate further PAR-mediated dense granule release and PKCδ activation. As shown in Fig. 5A, AYPGKF began to cause dense granule secretion at a concentration of 100 μm, which corresponded to the same concentration at which phosphorylation of PKCδ began to occur (Fig. 5B). These data suggest a correlation between dense granule release and activation of PKCδ phosphorylation in human platelets. Effect of PKCδ Isoform-selective Inhibitor on PAR-activating Peptides and Convulxin-induced Dense Granule Secretion— PKCδ is known to play an important regulatory role in exocytosis in other cell systems (26.Li J.

Platelets were stimulated with different concentrations of SFLLRN, AYPGKF, or convulxin after preincubation for 15 min with either rottlerin or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle) at 37 °C, and the secreted ATP was measured. Whereas rottlerin inhibited (about 50%) both SFLLRN- and AYPGKF-induced ATP secretion (Fig. 6, A and B), it potentiated convulxininduced dense granule secretion (Fig. 6C). These results confirm the role of PKCδ in regulating dense granule secretion in human platelets. Effect of Classical PKC Isoform Inhibitor on Convulxin-induced Dense Granule Release—Agonist-mediated platelet dense granule secretion is inhibited by the PKC inhibitors Ro 31-8220 and GF109203X (47.Paul B.Z.

Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Previous studies have implicated PKCα in secretion, but it was also shown in the same study that this enzyme alone is not sufficient to cause dense granule release (50.Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R.

Because rottlerin did not inhibit convulxin-induced dense granule release, we postulated that other PKC isoforms might be involved in convulxin-induced secretion. Hence we used a PKCα/β-specific inhibitor, Go6976 (100 nm final concentration) (51.Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate the role of classical PKC isoforms in convulxin-induced dense granule release. As shown in Fig. 7A, Go6976 abolished convulxin-induced platelet secretion, suggesting that classical PKC isoforms play an important role in convulxin-induced dense granule release. However, Go6976 had minimal inhibitory effect on SFLLRN-induced dense granule secretion (Fig. 7B). When both rottlerin and Go6976 were used together, SFLLRN-induced dense granule secretion was inhibited to the same extent as that with rottlerin alone (data not shown), indicating that PKCα/β isoforms do not play a major role in SFLLRN-mediated dense granule secretion. In contrast, classical PKC isoforms seem to play an important role in GPVI-mediated dense granule secretion. Ro 31-8220, an inhibitor of both classical and novel PKC isoforms, completely abolished the dense granule secretion by PAR agonists or convulxin (data not shown) (47.Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 48.Quinton T.M. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Dorsam R.T. Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Effect of Rottlerin on SFLLRN-, AYPGKF-, and Convulxin-induced PKCδ Phosphorylation—As seen from the previous experiments, rottlerin inhibits the amount of dense granule secretion caused by the PAR-activating peptides while potentiating secretion caused by convulxin. This could be either because of rottlerin affecting the kinase activity following PKCδ phosphorylation or that it could inhibit the phosphorylation event itself that is needed for kinase activity. We investigated the phosphorylation of PKCδ following platelet stimulation with the PAR-activating peptides or convulxin in the presence of rottlerin. As shown in Fig. 8, rottlerin decreased the phosphorylation of PKCδ in response to all the three agonists. This indicated that inhibition of PKCδ activity by rottlerin could be the result of its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of the activation domain that is essential for its activity. Effect of Rottlerin on SFLLRN-induced Platelet Aggregation—PKC has been shown to play an important role in platelet fibrinogen receptor activation (48.Quinton T.M. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Dorsam R.T.

Hence, we investigated the role of the PKCδ isoform, which plays a positive regulatory role SFLLRN-induced dense granule release, in SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. As shown in Fig. 9, rottlerin had no effect on SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation, whereas Ro 31-8220 caused inhibition of aggregation. We have shown recently that fibrinogen receptor can be activated independently by calcium-dependent and -independent (PKC-dependent) pathways in human platelets (48.Quinton T.M. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Dorsam R.T. Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent pathway can be blocked by chelating intracellular calcium with dimethyl-BAPTA without inhibiting the PKC-dependent pathway; under these conditions, the effect of rottlerin on PKC-mediated platelet aggregation was measured. As shown in Fig. 8, rottlerin failed to inhibit PKC-dependent platelet aggregation in the presence of dimethyl-BAPTA, whereas Ro 31-8220 completely blocked this aggregation. These results suggest that isoforms other than PKCδ play a role in SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. Platelet secretion is an important component of the amplification of platelet activation. Several platelet agonists stimulate GPCRs and cause activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq, leading to activation of PLCβ. PLC activation leads to generation of IP3 and DAG that causes increase in calcium and PKC activation, respectively (3.Gabbeta J. Yang X. Kowalska M.A. Sun L. Dhanasekaran N. Rao A.K. Proc. Natl.

Consistent with the previous studies, we have also determined that human platelets express seven PKC isoforms: α, β, δ, θ, ϵ, η, and ξ (Fig. 1). PKCδ has been shown to be important in the secretion process in other cell systems and that it mediates positive stimulatory signals for secretion (26.Li J. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1197-G1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27.Ozawa K. Yamada K. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol.

E880–E888Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated whether PKCδ plays an important role in regulating agonist-mediated dense granule secretion in human platelets. Based on the correlations of time- and concentration-dependent activation of PKCδ and dense granule release by PAR-activating peptides and the inhibitory effect of the PKCδ-selective inhibitor rottlerin on SFLLRN- and AYPGKF-induced dense granule secretion, we conclude that PKCδ plays a positive regulatory role in PAR-mediated platelet dense granule secretion. The persistence of PKCδ phosphorylation at time periods beyond the maximum dense granule secretion could be caused by the potentiating effects of substances that are released from the α granules. Our results show that in the presence of 5 μm rottlerin, PAR-activating peptides SFLLRN- and AYPGKF-induced platelet dense granule secretion was decreased but not completely abolished. This lack of complete inhibition suggests a possible role for other PKC isoforms that could also contribute to secretion. The phosphorylation state of PKCδ was also reduced in the presence of rottlerin, suggesting that rottlerin inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of PKCδ. Decreased phosphorylation and activation of PKCδ would then result in decreased dense granule secretion. However, SFLLRN-induced dense granule release was not inhibited by the classical PKC isoform selective inhibitor Go6976, indicating that these PKC isoforms do not play any significant role in PAR-mediated dense granule release. Consistent with our observations, Reed and co-workers (58.Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have shown that calcium-dependent PKC isoforms do not play a role in thrombin-induced platelet granule secretion. All the above suggests that PKCδ plays an important positive role in dense granule secretion downstream of PAR-mediated signaling. Previous studies have shown that PKCα is essential but not sufficient for granule secretion from human platelets and that a yet unidentified cytosolic factor is needed for this secretory process (50.Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our studies with convulxin are in agreement with this observation and indicate that classical PKC isoforms play an important role in GPVI-mediated platelet dense granule release. In contrast to the results with PAR-activating peptide, rottlerin potentiated convulxin-induced dense granule secretion, suggesting a negative role for PKCδ in this signaling pathway. Convulxin-mediated PKCδ phosphorylation was also inhibited in the presence of rottlerin and hence reduced the activity of PKCδ. Given that this isoform plays a negative role in dense granule secretion downstream of GPVI signaling (59.Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24533-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), inhibiting the phosphorylation and, thereby activity of this isoform, would thus potentiate GPVI-mediated dense granule secretion. Our results with convulxin are consistent with the interpretations of Crosby and Poole (59.Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24533-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whereas PLC-β2 activation downstream of PAR signaling leads to PKC activation, GPVI signaling results in activation of PLCγ2 through activation of tyrosine kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinases. The differences in these pathways might account for the differential role of PKCδ in dense granule release by PAR-activating peptides and convulxin. Previous studies have shown that the GPCR pathways and GPVI pathway could be regulated differently in platelets. For example, the nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibited collagen-induced increases in intracellular calcium but did not affect calcium mobilization by other agonists that activate G protein signaling pathways (60.Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similarly, elevation of cAMP levels results in the inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation induced by thrombin, a GPCR agonist, but not by collagen (61.Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The differential role of PKCδ downstream of GPCR and GPVI provides another evidence of this differential regulation in signaling pathways in platelets. It is known that Gq-coupled platelet agonists such as thrombin, the PAR-activating peptides SFLLRN and AYPGKF, and thromboxane A2 analog (U46619) cause dense granule secretion, whereas weaker agonists such as ADP fail to cause dense granule secretion when thromboxane generation is blocked (62.Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). ADP, through activation of the P2Y1 receptor, stimulates Gq and PLCβ2 and causes increases in intracellular calcium and PKC activation (2.Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 38.Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our investigation suggests why some agonists cause dense granule release and others do not, even though both agonists activate PLC. Our results show that selective activation of PKCδ by stronger Gq-coupled receptor agonists might be responsible for mediating dense granule release. As shown in Fig. 3, PKCδ is not activated by the weaker agonists, which may explain their inability to cause dense granule release. Thus, we suggest that the inability of ADP to cause dense granule release in aspirin-treated platelets is partly the result of its failure to activate PKCδ. We can also conclude that the PKC isoforms that are activated by ADP do not play a role in dense granule secretion. Previous studies using isoform nonselective inhibitors have been shown to block platelet secretion but not fibrinogen receptor activation (39.Pulcinelli F.M. Ashby B. Gazzaniga P.P. Daniel J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47.Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting that the PKC isoforms involved in secretion and fibrinogen receptor activation are different. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that calcium- and PKC-dependent signaling pathways can independently cause platelet aggregation (48.Quinton T.M. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Dorsam R.T. Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We investigated whether PKCδ also played an important role in this calcium-independent but PKC-dependent pathway leading to fibrinogen receptor activation and platelet aggregation. Our results demonstrate that PKCδ does not play a role in this aggregation (Fig. 9). In conclusion, we have shown that PKCδ plays an important role in PAR-mediated dense granule secretion in human platelets while negatively regulating secretion downstream of GPVI signaling. The failure of ADP to activate this isoform could account for its inability to cause dense granule secretion. In addition, PKCα/β isoforms play an important role in GPVI-mediated dense granule secretion but do not play any role in PAR-mediated dense granule secretion. Furthermore, the PKCδ isoform does not play any role in PAR-mediated platelet fibrinogen receptor activation. We thank Dr. Todd M. Quinton for critically reviewing this manuscript."

Block of these channels has been proposed as a treatment for atrial arrhythmias. Here we report a novel and potent inhibitor of Kv1.5 potassium channels, N-benzyl-N-pyridin-3-yl-methyl-2-(toluene-4-sulfonylamino)-benzamide hydrochloride (S0100176), which exhibits features consistent with preferential block of the open state. The IC50 of S0100176 for Kv1.5 expressed in Xenopus oocytes was 0.7 μm. Ala-scanning mutagenesis within the pore helix and the S6 segment, regions that form the walls of the central cavity, was combined with voltage clamp analysis to identify point mutations that altered drug affinity. This approach identified Thr-479, Thr-480, Val-505, Ile-508, and Val-512 as the most important residues for block by S0100176. Mutations of these key residues to Ala or other amino acids caused marked changes in the IC50 of S0100176 (p < 0.01). For example, the IC50 of S0100176 increased 362-fold for T480A, 26-fold for V505A, 150-fold for I508A, and 99-fold for V512A. We used modeling to dock S0100176 into the inner cavity of a Kv1.5 pore homology model that was generated based on the crystal structure of KcsA.

Site-directed Mutagenesis of Human Kv1.5—PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations into the human Kv1.5 (KCNA5) cDNA. Kv1.5 was cloned from human heart and differs from the GenBank™ data base entry NM_002234 by two residues, K418R and K565E. The newer data base entry of the Kv1.5 sequence (NM_002234) has an N terminus with two additional residues. This results in a shift of the amino acid numbering of +2 when compared with literature referring to the previous entry (M60451). PCR products were fully sequenced (ABI 3100, Applied Biosystems). For Xenopus oocyte expression, the Kv1.5 cDNA was cloned into the oocyte expression vector pSGEM (29.Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and capped cRNA was synthesized using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) after linearization of the plasmid with NheI (Roche Applied Science). Isolation and Electrophysiological Recordings from Xenopus Oocytes—Methods for isolation and injection of Xenopus oocytes were as described in Ref. 30.Decher N. Maier M. Dittrich W. Gassenhuber J. Bruggemann A. Busch A.E. Steinmeyer K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA using a microinjector (A203XVZ, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Oocytes were incubated with gentle shaking at 18 °C in a ND96 buffer containing (in mm): NaCl 96, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, and HEPES 5, titrated to pH 7.5 with NaOH. In addition, sodium pyruvate 2.5, theophylline 0.5, and gentamycin 50 μg/ml were added to this solution. Oocytes were used for experiments 1–3 days after injection. A two-electrode voltage clamp of oocytes (31.Stuehmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) bathed in ND96 solution was performed at room temperature. The microelectrodes had a resistance of 0.3–1.3 megohms after filling with a 3 m KCl solution. Data were recorded with a Turbo Tec 10CD amplifier using an ITC-16 interface (NPI, Tamm, Germany) and Pulse software (Heka Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) and stored on a PC for analyses. Voltage Clamp Protocols—To activate Kv1.5, oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of -80 mV and pulsed to voltages ranging from -60 to +60 mV for 1.5 s. The ratio of current in the presence of drug divided by current before drug (Idrug/Icontrol) was determined to calculate the fraction of unblocked current as a function of time. The time constant of current block (τb) was determined by fitting Idrug/Icontrol to a monoexponential function. The frequency dependence of peak current block was analyzed by stepping for 250 ms to 0 mV at a pulse frequency that ranged from 1 to 3 Hz. At 4 Hz, a pulse duration of 200 ms was used. The voltage dependence of Kv1.5 channel activation in the absence and presence of 1 μm S0100176 was determined from peak current amplitudes at each test potential (Vt) and the current reversal potential (Erev). These values were corrected for the transmembrane K+ driving force (Vt - Erev) and normalized to the peak current measured at +60 mV to obtain the normalized current, In. The resulting relationship was fit to a Boltzman equation to obtain the half-point (V½) and slope factor (k): In = /(1 + exp[(V½ - Vt/k]). Data Analysis—Pulse (Heka) and Origin version 5 software (Microcal Software) were used for data acquisition and analysis on a Pentium II PC. All fitting procedures were based on the simplex algorithm. The concentration required for 50% block of current (IC50) was determined from Hill plots using 3–5 concentrations of drug for each mutant (3–10 oocytes/point). Results are reported as mean ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). Statistical differences between wild-type and mutant channels were evaluated by a Student's unpaired t test. Significance was assumed for p < 0.05. Drugs—S0100176 was synthesized by the medicinal chemistry department of Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH. It was prepared as a 50 mm stock solution in Me2SO and stored at room temperature. Homology Modeling of the Kv1.5 Pore and Docking of S0100176 — The pore-forming domains (S5–S6) of Kv1 channels share 54% sequence homology with the bacterial K+ channel KcsA in which three-dimensional structure has been solved by x-ray crystallography (24.Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). An open state molecular model of the S5–S6 region of Kv1.3 (kindly provided by Ying-Duo Gao), generated using the crystal structure of the KcsA channel (28.Hanner M. Green B. Gao Y.D. Schmalhofer W.A. Matyskiela M. Durand D.J. Felix J.P. Linde A.R. Bordallo C. Kaczorowski G.J. Kohler M. Garcia M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11687-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) from the Protein Data Bank file (1BL8), was used as a template for docking S0100176. The S5 and S6 domains and the pore helix of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 share 100% sequence similarity. Kv1.3 differs from the sequence of Kv1.5 only in the external S5-P loop and P-S6 loop. We proceeded in three steps to dock S0100176 into the homology model of the Kv1.3/1.5 pores. First, S0100176 was manually docked to the putative site in the central cavity. Second, to remove severe steric clashes with the protein, the manually docked S0100176 was submitted to a short sequence of energy minimizations involving 100 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by 100 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. At each step, the energy was evaluated with the SYBYL 6.7 implementation of the MMF94S force field (Tripos Inc.). Finally, the minimized complex served as input for QXP (32.McMartin C. Bohacek R.S. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), which searched for alternative binding modes. QXP (quick explore) uses fast Monte Carlo searches and energy minimizations for flexible docking to a binding site. During a QXP run, the ligand is flexible while the user can define a few flexible amino acids. In this work, we considered as flexible the amino acids Thr-479, Thr-480, Val-505, Ile-508, and Val-512, in which the side chains pointed toward the docked ligand. A docking search of 1,000 steps was performed. All of the S0100176 binding orientations produced by QXP were visually analyzed and grouped into clusters. For each cluster, the top scoring solution (QXP score) was inspected for contacts between S0100176 and both Val-505 and Ile-508. A cutoff of 4.5 Å between the ligand and any of the side chain atoms of the corresponding amino acids was defined as a potential contact. If these contacts were not observed, then the second best solution of the corresponding cluster was considered. If none of the members of a cluster showed contact with both Val-505 and Ile-508, then this cluster was discarded. For a docking solution that passed this filtering step, we identified the Kv1.5 residues found within 4.5 Å of S0100176. QXP generated multiple solutions. The one that gave a high QXP score and passed all the filters is presented here. Voltage- and Frequency-dependent Block of Kv1.5 Channels by S0100176 —S0100176 is a derivative of anthranilic acid (Fig. 1A). The effect of 1 μm S0100176 on Kv1.5 was characterized by eliciting currents with step changes in voltage to potentials ranging from -60 to +60 mV applied in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of -80 mV. In the absence of drug, Kv1.5 slowly inactivates during the test pulse (Fig. 1B). In the presence of drug, the current appeared to inactivate much faster and more thoroughly, but this effect more likely represents open channel block rather than an increased rate of inactivation. The voltage dependence of peak currents was shifted by about +10 mV by the compound (Fig. 1A) with greater block at the less depolarized potentials. However, for currents measured at the end of the 1.5-s pulse, after attaining a pseudo steady-state level, the reduction was more substantial and not voltage-dependent (Fig. 1C). The lack of an increase in block at higher potentials suggests that this compound does not preferentially block Kv1.5 channels in the inactivated state. The concentration of compound required to reduce current by 50% (IC50) at the end of a 1.5-s pulse to +40 mV was 0.7 ± 0.2 μm with a Hill coefficient of 1.09 (n = 5). There was no shift in the voltage dependence of activation for currents measured at the end of the 1.5-s pulse; the V½ was -4.2 ± 1.2 mV before and -5.9 ± 1.8 mV after 1 μm S0100176 (n = 7; data not shown). To determine whether block of Kv1.5 by S0100176 is dependent on channel opening, we recorded currents in oocytes before and after a pulse-free period of incubation with the compound. The inset of Fig. 2A presents Kv1.5 currents elicited at a test potential of +40 mV before and after exposure of an oocyte to 1 μm S0100176 for 8 min without pulsing at a holding potential of -80 mV. The initial value of the Idrug/Icontrol relationship (Fig. 2A) suggests a tonic block of 10% and that the remainder of the steady-state block of ∼70% developed during the pulse. Alternatively, the apparent tonic block might represent an extremely fast phase of open channel block. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the initial fraction of unblocked channels (Idrug/Icontrol) decreased at less positive potentials (-10 to +30 mV). The time constant for the onset of block (τb) by 1 μm S0100176, determined by a monoexponential fit of the Idrug/Icontrol relationship for each test potential, was increased at more positive voltages (Fig. 2D) congruent with the voltage dependence of the channel opening. A common property of an open channel blocker is use dependence that reflects the dynamics of the on and off rates for drug binding. Consistent with open channel block, the inhibition of peak Kv1.5 was dependent on the pulse frequency. Currents were recorded in the absence or presence of 1 μm S0100176 during voltage steps applied at a frequency of 2 Hz to a potential of 0 mV (Fig. 3, A and B), a voltage at which channels did not exhibit measurable inactivation during the 250-ms pulses (Fig. 3A). Pulse trains were also applied at 1, 3, and 4 Hz, and the normalized peak current amplitudes were plotted as a function of the pulse number (Fig. 3C). In the absence of S0100176, Kv1.5 currents decreased by 4.1 ± 2.8%, 7.6 ± 3.1%, 10.1 ± 4.8%, and 11.2 ± 6.4% (n = 5) when recorded with trains of pulses applied at 1, 2, 3, and 4 Hz, respectively. In the presence of 1 μm S0100176, peak current was reduced by 39.4 ± 8.1% (n = 5) when pulses were applied at the very slow frequency of 0.0333 Hz. The additional block induced by a train of pulses increased with the pulsing rate. The normalized currents were suppressed by an additional 28.2 ± 3.8%, 45.5 ± 3.1%, 53.8 ± 2.7%, and 54.3 ± 2.9% (n = 5), at 1, 2, 3, and 4 Hz, respectively. Thus, S0100176 blocks Kv1.5 channels in a frequency-dependent manner, and at high pacing rates, the percentage block approximates the value obtained at the end of 1.5-s pulses applied at 0.0333 Hz. Frequency-dependent block of Kv1.5 would be an advantageous property for an antifibrillatory drug, because channels would be least affected during normal heart rates and most affected during tachycardia. Ala-scanning Mutagenesis of Kv1.5 Pore Residues—Residues located in the K+ signature sequence and the S6 segment were chosen for the Ala scan based on their proximity to the central cavity. The 23 amino acids that were mutated are outlined by boxes in Fig. 4A. Twenty-one residues were mutated to Ala; the two Ala residues in this region (Ala-501, Ala-509) were mutated to Val. S0100176 was applied at a single concentration of 15 μm, and inhibition of Kv1.5 currents was analyzed at the end of 1.5-s test pulses to +40 mV. At this concentration, wild-type Kv1.5 channels were inhibited by 95% (Fig. 4B). With the exceptions of L510A and P513A, the same pulse protocol was used to evaluate mutant channels. Because L510A Kv1.5 channels exhibited pronounced inactivation, we analyzed the inhibition of peak current amplitudes at +40 mV for this mutant. Because the P513A mutation caused a large rightward shift in the voltage of half-maximal activation (V½ near +70 mV), block was assessed at a test potential of +60 mV. The potency of drug block was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by I502A, L506A, and V516A and even more (p < 0.01) by T479A, T480A, V505A, I508A, and V512A mutations (Fig. 4B). The latter five residues face the central cavity of the channel and were chosen for further characterization. Two are located at the base of the pore helix near the selectivity filter (Thr-479, Thr-480), and three residues reside in the S6 segment (Val-505, Ile-508, Val-512). The IC50 was determined for conservative mutations (T479S, T480S, V505A, I508(V/L), V512A) and Ala mutations (T479A, T480A, I508A) of these residues. As an example, the effects of S0100176 on T480A Kv1.5 currents at multiple potentials are shown in Fig. 5A. At +40 mV and a concentration of 60 μm, the current was only decreased by 8.7 ± 2.0% (n = 6). The IC50 of S0100176 was increased 3.5-fold for T479S, 88-fold for T480S, 26-fold for V505A, 9-fold for I508L, 27-fold for I508V, and 99-fold for V512A (Fig. 5B, left side). Mutation of Thr-479, Thr-480, and Ile-508 to the nonconservative Ala residue resulted in more pronounced increases in IC50 (Fig. 5B, right side). For example, the IC50 was increased 362-fold for T480A and 150-fold for I508A.Fig. 5Changes in IC50 caused by mutations at the putative Kv1.5 binding sites of S0100176.A, T480A Kv1.5 currents in Xenopus oocytes before and after incubation with 60 μm S0100176.

There was no apparent linear relationship (r = 0.23) between the fold change in IC50 and percent inactivation determined at a test potential of +40 mV for wild-type and mutant channels (Fig. 6). Model of S0100176 Docking to Channel Pore—The results of the docking solution that passed several filtering steps (described under “Experimental Procedures”) is presented in Fig. 7. The docking of the compound is illustrated from three vantage points including views from the intracellular (Fig. 7A) or extracellular (Fig. 7B) sides of the membrane and a side view (Fig. 7C) facilitated by removal of one of the subunits. The side chains of residues Thr-480, Ala-501, Val-505, Ile-508, Ala-509, and Val-512 from at least one subunit of the tetramer were predicted to be located within less than a 4.5-Å distance to S0100176. This can be seen more clearly in a magnified stereoview (Fig. 7D) of the area outlined by the dashed lines in Fig. 7C. If S0100176 blocks Kv1.5 channels at the site predicted by our experiments and as corroborated by the modeling, then the compound should be an equally effective inhibitor of other Kv1 channels. Accordingly, the IC50 for Kv1.3 channels expressed in oocytes was 0.9 ± 0.1 μm (n = 4), not significantly different from the IC50 for Kv1.5. Atrial fibrillation is the most common chronic arrhythmia in humans. Prolongation of atrial refractoriness determines the efficacy of class III and contributes to the activity of class 1c antiarrhythmic drugs against atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (33.Wang Z. Page P. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, prolongation of ventricular action potentials by these drugs can also induce long QT syndrome. One approach to minimize this side effect is the development of drugs that block potassium channels expressed in the atrium but not in the ventricle. In the human heart, the ultrarapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKur) was identified in atrial but not in ventricular tissues (2.Wang Z. Fermini B. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 1061-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 34.Li G.-R. Feng J. Yue L. Carrier M. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The Kv1.5 α-subunit cloned from the human heart (4.Snyders D. Tamkun M. Bennett P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 513-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) forms K+ channels that conduct IKur and is a key mediator of atrial repolarization (3.Fedida D. Wible B. Wang Z. Fermini B. Faust F. Nattel S. Brown A. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, potent and selective blockers of Kv1.5 are of potential interest for treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It was well recognized previously that Kv1.5 is expressed in tissues other than the atria (e.g. vascular smooth muscle), suggesting that discovery of a cardiac-specific Kv1.5 blocker would be a difficult goal to attain. Our findings add another level of potential difficulty in the drug discovery process. The key residues in Kv1.5 that interact with S0100176 are shared in common with other Kv1 channels. This has obvious clinical implications because Kv1 channels are expressed in many tissues other than atrial muscle. In addition, a specific Kv1.5 blocker may require activity at a binding site other than the one located in the central cavity. The crystal structures of the bacterial channels, KcsA and MthK, are believed to represent the closed and open state of the channel, respectively. However, both KcsA and MthK lack the PVP motif in the S6 domain that was proposed to be an important structural determinant for the gating of Kv channels (20.del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), including Kv1.5. Hanner et al. (28.Hanner M. Green B. Gao Y.D. Schmalhofer W.A. Matyskiela M. Durand D.J. Felix J.P. Linde A.R. Bordallo C. Kaczorowski G.J. Kohler M. Garcia M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11687-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) developed a homology model of Kv1.3, which was based on the KcsA structure that also considered the potential importance of the PVP motif in determining the open state conformation of the channel. The docking of S0100176 to this homology model indicates several residues in the pore loop (Thr-479, Thr-480) and the S6 segment (Val-505, Ile-508, Val-512) that could constitute drug binding sites. These residues face toward the inner cavity of the pore and are the same sites identified using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. However, with the exception of Thr-479, these residues were not previously reported to influence the pharmacology of Kv1.5. Based on a more limited mutagenesis approach, the S6 segment residues, Thr-507, Leu-510, and Val-514, were identified as potential sites of drug-channel interactions for quinidine, benzocaine, and bupivacaine (7.Yeola S.W. Rich T.C. Uebele V.N. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8.Franqueza L. Longobardo M. Vicente J. Delpon E. Tamkun M.M. Tamargo J.

Res. 2002; 56: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the Kv1.3/1.5 homology model predicts that these residues point away from the central cavity. Further studies are required to determine whether these drugs also interact with the residues we identified here as important for channel block by S0100176. An emerging theme from several recent studies is that the few residues, located in the S6 domain and base of the pore helix and that face the inner cavity, form the binding site for drugs or peptides that block the open state of voltage-gated K+ channels. For example, Val-551 and Ile-554 (in the S6 domain of Kv1.4) form important receptor sites for both the N-terminal inactivation gate and quaternary ammonium compounds (22.Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Val-551, Ile-554, Val-558, and Val-562 line the inner cavity of Kv1.4 and are homologous to Val-505, Ile-508, Val-512, and Val-516 of Kv1.5. It is also noteworthy that Ile-508 and Val-512 of Kv1.5 are located in positions equivalent to Tyr-652 and Phe-656 of HERG, which are the key residues that determine the pharmacological properties of this channel (18.Mitcheson J.S.

There are also several examples of the importance of the Thr residues located at the base of the pore helix and part of the K+ signature sequence. The T479S mutation is equivalent to the T441S mutation in Shaker channels, which reduced internal TEA affinity 10-fold (12.Choi K.L. Mossman C. Aube J. Yellen G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This residue is also important for binding of bupivacaine (8.Franqueza L. Longobardo M. Vicente J. Delpon E. Tamkun M.M. Tamargo J. Snyders D.J. Valenzuela C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), benzocaine (11.Caballero R. Moreno I. Gonzalez T. Valenzuela C. Tamargo J. Delpon E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and S0100176. Interestingly, the IC50 of S0100176 was increased even more by mutation of Thr-480 to Ser. The highly conserved Thr (or Ser) residues of the K+ signature sequence are also reported to be important sites of interaction with blockers of HERG, Shaker, and KCNQ1 channels (12.Choi K.L.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There are several limitations of the approach we used to identify the putative binding site for S0100176. First, we measured the effect of mutations on the block of Kv1.5 channel current rather than directly assaying for altered ligand binding. Second, altered drug sensitivity caused by mutation of a specific amino acid may have been caused by an allosteric effect. This is especially possible for Val-512, which is located between the two Pro residues that are predicted to contribute to significant rearrangement of the S6 domain during gating. Third, the potency of drug block is usually underestimated when currents are measured in intact oocytes. Nonetheless, our approach identified residues that face the central cavity and would, therefore, be expected to be potential interaction sites for a drug that preferentially blocks open channels. In summary, we have identified the residues Thr-479, Thr-480, Val-505, Ile-508, and Val-512 as the most important components of the putative binding site for a novel Kv1.5 open channel blocker. It is becoming increasingly clear that the few residues located at the base of the pore helix and on the S6 domains that directly face the inner cavity are important components of the binding sites for compounds of diverse structures that preferentially block Kv channels in the open state. Blockers of Na+/Ca2+ channels also bind to pore-lining residues within the S6 segment and/or regions near the selectivity filter (14.Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1981880379,"Targeting of a wide variety of proteins to membranes involves specific recognition of phospholipid head groups and insertion into lipid bilayers. For example, proteins that contain FYVE domains are recruited to endosomes through interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). However, the structural mechanism of membrane docking and insertion by this domain remains unclear. Here, the depth and angle of micelle insertion and the lipid binding properties of the FYVE domain of early endosome antigen 1 are estimated by NMR spectroscopy. Spin label probes incorporated into micelles identify a hydrophobic protuberance that inserts into the micelle core and is surrounded by interfacially active polar residues. A novel proxyl PtdIns(3)P derivative is developed to map the position of the phosphoinositide acyl chains, which are found to align with the membrane insertion element. Dual engagement of the FYVE domain with PtdIns(3)P and dodecylphosphocholine micelles yields a 6-fold enhancement of affinity. The additional interaction of phosphatidylserine with a conserved basic site of the protein further amplifies the micelle binding affinity and dramatically alters the angle of insertion. Thus, the FYVE domain is targeted to endosomes through the synergistic action of stereospecific PtdIns(3)P head group ligation, hydrophobic insertion and electrostatic interactions with acidic phospholipids.

Cellular processes including signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, and cytoskeletal rearrangement require selective recruitment of proteins to membrane surfaces. Well established mechanisms for localizing cytosolic proteins to membranes include electrostatic interactions through a basic peptide sequence, anchoring by covalently attached acyl chains, and association with the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1.Murray D.

The inevitable effects of these modifications on lipid interactions indicate a need to develop new methods that provide quantitative measures of bilayer insertion by native proteins.The early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) protein represents a paradigm for understanding the actions of peripheral membrane proteins. Its FYVE domain specifically binds to PtdIns(3)P-enriched membranes, docking EEA1 to early endosomes and facilitating fusion of vesicular membranes (7.Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol.

Despite the structural similarity, different models of their membrane orientations have been inferred, emphasizing the need for experimentally derived estimates of membrane insertion.Here we present a multivalent mechanism of membrane binding and insertion by the EEA1 FYVE domain based on structural and quantitative analysis of its lipid and micelle interactions. Information was gathered by several solution state NMR methods, including the use of spin-labeled lipid probes incorporated at various locations within the micelle. The paramagnetic spin labels broaden the NMR resonances of lipid-inserted residues in an established distance-dependent fashion (26.Papavoine C.H. Konings R.N. Hilbers C.W. van de Ven F.J.

The affinity of the FYVE domain for PtdIns(3)P, PtdSer, and several micelle systems revealed remarkable synergy within the multivalent complex that is responsible for early endosome recognition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—The FYVE domain of human EEA1 (residues 1325-1410) was cloned into a pGEX-KG vector (Amersham Biosciences), expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS in M9 medium supplemented with zinc sulfate, 15NH4Cl and 13C6-glucose, or LB medium, and purified as previously described (13.Kutateladze T.G.

The protein was concentrated into 20 mm d11-Tris, pH 6.8, in the presence of 200 mm KCl, 20 mm perdeuterated dithiothreitol, 50 μm 4-amidinophenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaN3, in either 5% or 99.99% 2H2O/H2O.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra of samples containing 0.2-1 mm unlabeled or uniformly 15N- and 15N, 13C-labeled FYVE domain, 0-5 mm C4-PtdIns(3)P, 0-1.5 mm C16-PtdIns(3)P (Echelon Biosciences Inc.), 0-250 mm d38-DPC (Cambridge Isotopes), 0-25 mm protonated DPC, and 0-30% w/w 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (PtdSer) (Avanti) were recorded at 25 °C on Varian INOVA 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers. Intermolecular and intramolecular NOEs were obtained from 13C F1-filtered, F2-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) (30.Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R.

Reson. 1990; 86: 204-209Google Scholar) spectra with mixing times (τm) of 50-200 ms. The JHNHα coupling constants were derived from 1H, 15N HMQC-J and HNHA spectra (32.Ikura M. Kay L.E. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 204-209Google Scholar).Lipid Binding Properties—Lipid binding was characterized by monitoring chemical shift changes in the 1H, 15N HSQC spectra of 200-250 μm FYVE domain as C4-PtdIns(3)P was added stepwise to 1.8 mm, DPC to 500 mm (or 8.4 mm micellar), CYFOS-4 (Anatrace) to 250 mm (12.5 mm micellar), or DHPC (Avanti) to 300 mm (2.3 mm micellar). Micellar concentration corresponds to the solution concentration of intact micelles and is obtained by dividing the value of a detergent molecular concentration by an average aggregation number. The KD values were calculated by a nonlinear least squares analysis using the Xmgr program and the equation Δδ = (ΔδmaxL)/(KD + L), where L is the concentration of a lipid, and Δδmax is the difference in the chemical shifts of the free and bound protein, respectively. Aggregation numbers for DPC, DHPC, and CYFOS-4 micelles were estimated by pulsed field gradient NMR methods (33.Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar) to be 56, 130, and 20 molecules, consistent with previous studies (34.Lauterwein J. Bosch C. Brown L.R. Wuthrich K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 556: 244-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The intensity profiles were standardized against those obtained for DPC micelles (34.Lauterwein J. Bosch C. Brown L.R. Wuthrich K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 556: 244-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and cytochrome c under similar conditions.Paramagnetic Spin Labels—The 5- and 14-doxyl derivatives of 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines (3-6 mm) (Avanti) were added stepwise to 250 μm15N-labeled FYVE domain in the presence of 1.25 mm C4- or C16-PtdIns(3)P, 0-10% PtdSer, and 250 mm d38-DPC. The 1H, 15N HSQC spectra were collected for each point, and the intensities of backbone amide resonances were compared. Significant levels of intensity reduction were judged to be greater than the average plus one standard deviation and were confirmed by comparison with the line broadening in similar experiment when PtdIns(3)P was absent. The final ratio of spin label to micelle was between 0.7 and 1.3. The spin labels did not alter the protein structure based on the absence of chemical shift perturbations.Synthesis of a Spin-labeled Derivative of PtdIns(3)P and Its Interaction with the FYVE Domain—The d(+)-1-O-[1-[6-(3-carboxy-PROXYL)-amino]hexanoyl]-2-palmitoylglyceryl d-myo-phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate free radical (3) was synthesized as shown in Fig. 5a. The N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-3-carboxylate proxyl, free radical (2) (5.3 mg, 18.7 μmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (0.5 ml) was added to d(+)-1-O-[1-(6-aminohexanoyl)]-2-palmitoylglyceryl d-myo-phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (35.Chen J. Feng L. Prestwich G.D. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 6511-6522Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (1) (6.1 mg, 7.3 μmol) in 0.25 m tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) buffer (0.5 ml, pH 7.8) and stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness, and the residue was washed with acetone (5 × 1.5 ml). The crude product was dissolved in water and applied to a DEAE cellulose column (12 × 15 mm). The product (3) was eluted with 0.2-2.0 M TEAB and 3:7 MeOH: TEAB, lyophilized, dissolved in water, stirred with DOWEX 50X8-200 (K+ form) resin for 1 h, and filtered, and the filtrate was lyophilized yielding the product as the potassium salt (5.2 mg; matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry: m/z = 931.9 [M-H, free acid]1-).Interaction of the FYVE domain with derivative 3 was monitored by collecting 1H, 15N HSQC spectra of the 300 μm15N-labeled FYVE domain in the presence of 1.5 mm C16-PtdIns(3)P and 250 mm d38-DPC, whereas the 6-proxyl compound 3 was added stepwise up to 4.5 mm. Reduction of the backbone amide signal intensity for each residue was plotted as a histogram.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDepth of Micelle Insertion—Five complementary approaches were used to estimate the depth of micelle insertion by the EEA1 FYVE domain. First, a spin-labeled “depth” probe was used to identify the most deeply buried residues of the FYVE domain (Fig. 1a). This 14-doxyl phosphatidylcholine derivative contains a doxyl moiety attached to the fourteenth position of the stearoyl chain. It spontaneously incorporates into DPC micelles and broadens the NMR signals of nuclei that are typically 10-12 bonds away from the micelle head groups (26.Papavoine C.H. Konings R.N. Hilbers C.W. van de Ven F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12990-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27.Van Den Hooven H.W. Spronk C. Van De Kamp M. Konings R.N.H. Hilbers C.W. Van De Ven F.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28.Jarvet J. Zdunek J. Damberg P. Graslund A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8153-8163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When the 14-doxyl probe was added to the 15N-labeled FYVE domain that had been prebound to C16-PtdIns(3)P and perdeuterated DPC micelles, a substantial reduction of the Val1366, Thr1367, and Val1368 amide signal intensities was observed (Fig. 1, a and e). Consequently, these three residues, which correspond to a conserved hydrophobic protrusion in the FYVE domain, are buried most deeply in the micelle core and constitute the membrane insertion loop (MIL). Insertion of the Val1366 and Thr1367 side chains into the micelle was confirmed by contacts observed in isotope-filtered and edited NOESY spectra. Nineteen intermolecular NOE cross-peaks were detected between the resonances of DPC and the Val 1366-Thr1367 sequence of the 13C, 15N-labeled FYVE domain complexed with C4-PtdIns(3)P (Fig. 2). The methylene resonances of the DPC dodecyl group exhibited the strongest intermolecular NOE correlations to the Val1366 and Thr1367 side chains, indicating the insertion of these MIL residues in the hydrophobic core of DPC micelles. The insertion of Val1366 and Thr1367 into the micelle was also apparent from the reduction of their solvent exchange rates. Titration of DPC micelles into the C4-PtdIns(3)P-bound FYVE domain specifically decreased intensity of the cross-peaks between the water and Val1366 and Thr1367 amide resonances in 15N-edited NOE spectra (data not shown), indicating the reduced exposure of these residues to solvent. Despite the inherent mobility within protein micelle complexes (36.Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 515-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the intermolecular NOE and the line broadening data suggest that the MIL is the primary point of insertion of the domain into the hydrophobic micelle interior.Fig. 1Depth and angle of PtdIns(3)P-bound FYVE domain insertion into micelles. The addition of 14-doxyl (a) and 5-doxyl (b) probes (red) to the 15N-labeled FYVE domain (gray triangle) prebound to C16-PtdIns(3)P (blue) and d38-DPC micelles (green) results in the loss of signal intensities in the MIL residues (orange). The histograms show reduction of intensity in the backbone amide resonance of each residue induced by the addition of 14-doxyl (c) and 5-doxyl (d). The colored bars indicate significant changes, being greater than the average plus one standard deviation. The FYVE domain surface colored red, orange, and yellow depicts residues that exhibit significant signal intensity reductions upon addition of 14-doxyl (e) and 5-doxyl (f).

We compared three phospholipids that share the same zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine head group that predominates in mammalian membranes but differ in their acyl chains. In aqueous solutions these lipids form micelles that mimic the membrane environment and are well suited for NMR studies (36.Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 515-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The micelles formed by cyclohexylbutylphosphocholine (CYFOS-4) or DHPC are approximately three times smaller (6.3 kDa) and larger (62.6 kDa), respectively, than d38-DPC micelles (21.8 kDa) based on translational diffusion co-efficients measured by pulsed field gradient (33.Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar) NMR studies. Upon the addition of either phospholipid to the PtdIns(3)P-bound FYVE domain, the protein amide resonances exhibited very similar changes, with the largest chemical shift perturbations observed for the Val1366 and Thr1367 residues. This is consistent with the dramatic change in the environment of these residues upon insertion and indicates a common mode of penetration into the hydrophobic interior despite differences in the hydrophobic packing, surface pressure, size, and curvature of the micelle systems. These results also suggest that the principles of micelle insertion revealed here may be extrapolated to bilayer interactions.The functional importance of the MIL is underscored by mutagenesis studies. Replacement of Val1366 and Thr1367 by Gly or Glu residues abolishes the subcellular localization of EEA1 (29.Kutateladze T.G. Ogburn K.D. Watson W.T. de Beer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution of the corresponding Leu185 and Leu186 residues of Vps27p or Phe20 of Hrs decreases the affinities of their FYVE domains for PtdIns(3)P-containing vesicles by factors of 7 and 20, respectively (37.Stahelin R.V.

Thus, this hydrophobic protrusion appears to represent a general point of membrane insertion among FYVE domains.Deep and stable insertion into the membrane requires PtdIns(3)P. In the absence of this ligand, small but significant chemical shift changes are seen in the MIL upon the addition of DPC, suggesting a weak micelle interaction that resembles the stronger PtdIns(3)P-dependent insertion (13.Kutateladze T.G. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, selective broadening of the MIL resonances was not observed upon titration of the 5- or 14-doxyl spin labels into the PtdIns(3)P-free state of the micelle-saturated FYVE domain (data not shown). Consequently, the nonspecific micelle association of the EEA1 FYVE domain is relatively superficial or transient. Similarly, PtdIns(3)P is needed for the FYVE domains of Hrs and Vps27p to insert sufficiently into phospholipid monolayers to disrupt the surface pressure (37.Stahelin R.V. Long F. Diraviyam K. Bruzik K.S. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26379-26388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although the nonspecific membrane association is weak, it could serve to concentrate protein near bilayers and correctly position FYVE domains for PtdIns(3)P ligation.Interestingly, the depth of FYVE domain insertion appears to be independent of the time scale of PtdIns(3)P contact. That is, the MIL resonances were similarly broadened by the 14-doxyl probes in the micelle-saturated FYVE domain bound to either dibutanoyl (C4) or dipalmitoyl (C16) PtdIns(3)P (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). The longer chain PtdIns(3)P interacts more tightly with the FYVE domain, exhibiting slow exchange on the NMR time scale, whereas the short chain form was in intermediate exchange (Fig. 3, a and b). Thus, the shorter residency time of the protein on the micelle did not substantially compromise the depth of insertion.Fig. 3Superposed 1H, 15N HSQC spectra of the FYVE domain reveal slow (a), intermediate (b), and fast (c) exchange regimes for the interactions with C16-PtdIns(3)P-containing d38-DPC micelles, C4-PtdIns(3)P-containing d38-DPC micelles, and C4PtdIns(3)P, respectively. The relative concentrations of the 15N-labeled FYVE domain (200 μm) and PtdIns(3)P are inset and color-coded. a and b were obtained in the presence of 250 mm d38-DPC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Angle of Micelle Insertion—To further define the membrane orientation of the FYVE domain, the angle of insertion was investigated. The surface of the domain buried within the micelle was identified using a “shallow” 5-doxyl probe (Fig. 1b). This phosphatidylcholine derivative carries the nitroxyl radical at the 5 position of the stearoyl chain and broadens resonances of nuclei that are located one to three bonds away from the lipid phosphates (26.Papavoine C.H. Konings R.N. Hilbers C.W. van de Ven F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12990-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27.Van Den Hooven H.W. Spronk C. Van De Kamp M. Konings R.N.H. Hilbers C.W.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8153-8163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 5-doxyl probe was added to the 15N-labeled FYVE domain that had been prebound to the C16-PtdIns(3)P-containing DPC micelles. This resulted in the reduction of NMR signal intensities within the MIL and surrounding residues located at the level of the PtdIns(3)P head group, including Asp1351, Asn1352, Val1354, Phe 1364-Arg1370, Cys1381, Ala1382, and Arg1399 (Fig. 1d). These residues form a continuous surface of the FYVE domain that was used to derive the angle and extent of micelle insertion (Fig. 1f).The vector that defines the orientation of the micelle inserted FYVE domain was estimated by optimizing the average position of the 5-doxyl radical relative to the micelle-bound protein. All the significant intensity reductions caused by paramagnetic line broadening were used in Newton minimization to satisfy the experimental distance restraints. The vector of FYVE domain insertion into PtdIns(3)P-containing DPC micelles (shown in Fig. 1f) differs from the molecular axis by an angle of 48°. The estimation of the insertion vector is consistent with the chemical shift (13.Kutateladze T.G. Overduin M.

Although several candidate genes have been suggested, the relevant gene(s) have not been identified yet. About 10% of testicular seminomas, however, show a more restricted amplification of the 12p11.2–p12.1 region, in which the various amplicons show an apparent overlap, allowing for the shortest region of amplification overlap approach, aiming at the identification of pathogenetically relevant sequences residing in this region. Here we report on a high-resolution 12p-amplicon architecture analysis using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, the results of which were subsequently confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization studies. The 12p-specific microarray contained 63 positionally selected BAC clones, which are more or less evenly distributed over the short arm of chromosome 12 (average spacing: less than 500 Kb), including 20 clones within the region of amplification. Out of a series of 17 seminomas, seven seminomas showed amplification of the whole amplicon region, of which three showed a dip in T/R value in the center of the amplified area. A more complex amplification pattern was found in the other 10 seminomas: three showed predominant amplification at the centromeric border; one mainly at the telomeric border; six showed a balanced amplification of both the centromeric and telomeric regions. The only nonseminoma investigated showed a structure in which the centromeric border was only amplified. These data support a mechanistic model in which at least two 12p genes, situated at the border regions of the amplicon, are positional candidates capable of actively supporting tumor progression in TGCTs."

Ribosome-bound nascent chains of Sec-dependent inner membrane proteins are targeted to the SecYEG complex via the signal recognition particle pathway. We now demonstrate that the signal recognition particle-dependent co-translational membrane targeting and membrane insertion of FtsQ can be reconstituted with proteoliposomes containing purified SecYEG. SecA and a transmembrane electrical potential are essential for the translocation of the large periplasmic domain of FtsQ, whereas co-reconstituted YidC has an inhibitory effect.

The Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42) facilitate the outgrowth of branches, whereas Rho attenuates it. The mechanism of neurite retraction is unknown. Because the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin causes numerous branched extensions in NG108-15 cells, we have investigated the underlying mechanism in this cell line. In additional studies, we used cultured hippocampal neurons in which forskolin induces branched dendrites. In both cell types, forskolin enhanced the activity of Cdc42, but not that of Rac, although both GTPases were necessary for the formation of branched extensions. Time lapse microscopy showed that forskolin did not increase the rate of addition of new extensions or branches, but it reduced the rate of the retraction so that more branched extensions persisted. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity by wortmannin or LY294002 also reduced the rate of retraction and thus facilitated dendritic arborization. Forskolin diminished the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinases. Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases not only reduced the retraction but also the addition of new dendrites and branches. This reduction was no longer present when Rho kinase was simultaneously inactivated, suggesting an interaction of phosphoinositide 3-kinases and Rho kinase.

The expression plasmid encoding the GST-PAK-Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain was a gift from Dr. J. G. Collard (Amsterdam, Netherlands). The cAMP assay kit was from Amersham Biosciences.Cell Culture—Neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells were cultured at 37 °C with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.3, containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (PAN, Aidenbach, Germany) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 100 IU/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). To induce extensions, cells were cultured in serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen).Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from brains of embryonic rats at day 17. The dissociated cells were seeded on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. The incubation medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum for the first 16 h. Neuronal differentiation was induced with StartV medium (Biochrom), pH 7.3. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere.Cytochemical Staining—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Normal goat serum was used to block nonspecific binding. For staining of β-tubulin III, cells were incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin III antibody (Sigma). The resulting immune complex was visualized with a CyTm 3-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment or CyTm 5-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). For actin staining, cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Biozol, München, Germany) and washed again with PBS.Confocal Image Analysis—A Bio-Rad MRC 1024 (version 3.2) confocal system with a krypton-argon laser was used with an Axiovert 135TV microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images obtained with Laser sharp 2.1T software were processed with Corel Photopaint.Time Lapse Imaging—NG108-15 cells or hippocampal neurons were plated on poly-l-lysine coated “relocate” coverslips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). After induction of neuronal differentiation, phase-contrast micrographs were made from 10 different locations on each coverslip by using an Axiovert 135/Axiocam microscopic system. Afterward, cells were stained for β-tubulin III to verify that the examined cells were indeed neurons. In NG108-15 cells, extensions and their branches were analyzed at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. In hippocampal neurons, analysis was done at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. At each time point, the dendrites and branches of the selected individual cells were compared with those of the previous time point. Newly added extensions and branches were counted separately, as were extensions and branches that had been retracted. Finally, all newly added and retracted primary extensions were summed separately. The numbers of newly added and of retracted branches were calculated correspondingly. Shown are the average values of 15 randomly selected cells.Preparation of Transfection Vectors and Cell Transfection—The coding regions of the RhoAN19, Rac1V12, and Rac1N17 genes were excised from the plasmid pGEX with BamHI/EcoRI and inserted in-frame into the BglII/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). The coding region of Cdc42wt and Cdc42N17 genes were excised from the plasmid pCDNA3 with BamHI/EcoRI and inserted in-frame into the BglII/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1. The mutant Cdc42V12 was obtained from the wild type form by using the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A p110γ-CAAX expression plasmid of the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ was generated as follows. Human cDNA (42.Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S.

Subcloning into pcDNA3 was accomplished by insertion into the KpnI and XhoI sites. Two AfeI sites in p110γ were removed, and the stop codon was replaced by a new AfeI site by silent mutations using the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit and appropriate primer sets. Adapter oligonucleotides encoding the 18 C-terminal amino acids of H-Ras, which contains a C-terminal isoprenylation signal and two palmitoylation sites, were inserted into the AfeI and BamHI sites to yield the desired pcDNA3-p110γ-CAAX. Cells were transfected for 2.5 h at 2.5% CO2 using a calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation procedure (43.Köhrmann M. Haubensak W. Hemraj I. Kaether C. Lessmann V.J. Kiebler M.A. J. Neurosci.

Afterward, the Cells were grown in serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 for 16 h prior to use.Expression of GST-PAK-CRIB Domain—The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells grown at 37 °C. Expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) at A600 1.0. Two hours after induction, the cells were collected and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for purification of the GST-PAK-CRIB domain by affinity purification using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads loaded with the GST fusion proteins were washed twice with PBS and used immediately for GTPase pull-down experiments.GST-PAK-CRIB Domain Pull-down Experiments—NG108-15 cells were grown in serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. 1 × 106 cells were used for the Rac and 3 × 106 cells for the Cdc42 experiments. Hippocampal neurons were cultured in serum-free StartV medium; 1 × 106 cells were used for the experiments. Cells were treated with drugs as indicated under “Results.” Then, they were washed twice with PBS. After addition of 250 μl of ice-cold GST-Fish lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin), the cells were harvested. The detergent-soluble supernatant was recovered after centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. GTP-Rac or GTP-Cdc42 proteins were precipitated for 1 h with 20 μl of GST-PAK fusion protein at 4 °C. The complexes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, resuspended, and boiled with Laemmli buffer. Bound Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-Rac1 (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany), or anti-Cdc42 (Upstate, Milton Keynes, UK) antibodies.Phosphorylation Assays for Akt and MLC—NG108-15 cells were incubated in serum-free Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. After drug treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS. Then, ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) was added, and the cells were harvested. The detergent-soluble supernatant was recovered after centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. To determine the phosphorylation of Akt, anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt and anti-Akt antibodies were used (New England Biolabs). An anti-phospho-MLC antibody was used to measure the phosphorylation of MLC.In Vivo cAMP Assay—Intracellular cAMP levels of hippocampal neurons grown in StartV medium supplemented with B27 were measured by using a nonacetylation EIA procedure with the Amersham cAMP assay kit (Amersham Biosciences).Evaluation of Cell Morphology and Statistics—Cells bearing extensions were examined by using the 20-fold magnification of a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. At least 15 cells/field were counted in 10 areas. The length of the extensions was determined by confocal laser microscopy using Laser sharp 2.1T software. For statistical analysis the Mann-Whitney-U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test (for multiple comparisons) were used. If samples showed normal distribution, analysis of variance and Scheffe's test were used.RESULTSForskolin Induces Branched Extensions in NG108-15 Cells—Within 15 min after the addition of 10 μm forskolin, NG108-15 cells began to form branched extensions. After 240 min, 82% of the cells had extensions, of which 83% also had branches (Fig. 1, A and B). In untreated cells, only 28% of the NG108-15 cells had extensions, 15% of which were branched (Fig. 1, A and B). 20 μm 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, which does not activate adenylyl cyclase, did not affect the arborization (data not shown).To test whether the forskolin-induced branch formation depended on Rho activity, NG108-15 cells were treated with C3 toxin of Clostridium limosum, which specifically inactivates Rho by ADP-ribosylation at Asn41 (44.Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For optimal cellular uptake, a C3 fusion toxin (C3FT) was used, which enters cells by using the binary C. botulinum C2 toxin as a carrier (40.Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most cells, C3FT produced extensions, of which only a few had branches (Fig. 1, A and B). When forskolin and C3FT were applied together, nearly all of the resulting extensions had branches (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that forskolin produced branches independent of Rho.To determine whether forskolin and C3FT affected the Rho signaling pathway, we studied the phosphorylation of MLC, which depends on Rho/Rho kinase activity (4.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 45.Amano M.

Forskolin, as well as C3FT, reduced the amount of phosphorylated MLC, whereas the total amount of MLC was not changed by either treatment (Fig. 1C). Thus, C3FT and forskolin reduced the activity of Rho kinase.The GTPases Rac and Cdc42 Are Necessary for the Forskolin-induced Branching in NG108-15 Cells—Next, we studied the role of other Rho GTPases in the formation of branched extensions. NG108-15 cells were treated with toxin B of C. difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac and Cdc42 by glucosylation at Thr35/37 (41.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). In some cells, toxin B induced extensions, of which only a few had branches. In these cells, forskolin no longer induced branch formation. Apparently, the GTPases Rac and/or Cdc42 were necessary for this effect (Fig. 1, A and B).To examine further the role of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in forskolin-induced branching, NG108-15 cells were transiently transfected with EGFP fusion proteins of dominant-negative (dn) Rho GTPases, which sequester the corresponding GDP exchange factors so that the respective endogenous GTPases remain inactive (46.Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 47.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3795) Google Scholar). In the transfected cells, we also studied the effects of Rho kinase inhibitors and of C3FT. To evaluate whether the number of branches increased with the length of the extensions, we measured the longest extension and counted its branches (Fig. 2B). In cells expressing only EGFP, the Rho kinase inhibitors Y-27632 and H89 (38.Leemhuis J. Boutillier S. Schmidt G. Meyer D.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 48.Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar) elongated the longest extension by ∼60% without enhancing the number of branches. To confirm that Y-27632 reduced the activity of Rho kinase, we measured its effect on phosphorylation of MLC. Y-27632 indeed reduced the amount of MLC-P (Fig. 1C).Fig. 2Dominant-negative Rho GTPases modulate the effects of forskolin on the morphology of NG108-15 cells. Cells were transfected with plasmids coding for EGFP alone or with EGFP/dnRhoAN19, EGFP/dnRac1N17, or EGFP/dnCdc42N17. Morphological changes were quantified 4 h after the addition of 10 μm Y-27632, 10 μm H89, or 10 μm forskolin by using EGFP fluorescence microscopy. A, micrographs of cells transfected with dn RhoA, dnCdc42, or dnRac1 in the absence or presence of forskolin; bar ∼ 50 μm. B, quantification of the experiment. The numbers of cells with extensions ≥50 μm are shown as a percentage of the total number of cells. The longest extension was measured by using the MRC-1024 software of the confocal microscope. The branches of the longest extension were counted. Mean ± S.E.; a refers to a significant difference (p < 0.05) from the EGFP control. b indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05) from dnRhoA, dnRac1, or dnCdc42, respectively.

The 95% confidence intervals of the estimate 0.0046 were 0.0036 and 0.0057; for the estimate 0.263, they were 0.163 and 0.364. Values outside these limits were significantly different (p < 0.05). Numbers correspond to the rows of B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inactivation of Rho GTPase by C3FT also elongated the longest extension by 50% without inducing additional branches. The effect of forskolin on each parameter was different. Forskolin alone had no significant effect on elongation of the longest extension, but instead doubled the number of its branches (Fig. 2B). When forskolin was used in the presence of Y-27632 or C3FT, however, long and branched extensions were observed. In contrast, forskolin did not produce branches, when applied together with H89 (Fig. 2B). Because H89 inhibits Rho kinase as well as PKA (38.Leemhuis J. Boutillier S. Schmidt G. Meyer D.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this finding suggested that forskolin induced branches by enhancing PKA activity.Cells transfected with dnRhoAN19 had numerous extensions with few branches. Similar to cells treated with C3FT, they responded to forskolin with the production of branches (Fig. 2, A and B), confirming that forskolin induced branching in the absence of endogenous Rho activity. Compared with EGFP controls, cells transfected with dnRac1N17 had a similar number of extensions that, however, were short and had fewer branches. Neither the Rho kinase inhibitors Y-27632 and H89 nor forskolin increased the length or branching of such extensions (Fig. 2, A and B). Compared with EGFP controls, cells transfected with dnCdc42N17 had fewer and shorter extensions with only a small number of branches. Y-27632 and H89 elongated the longest extension and increased its branching, whereas forskolin had no effect on either parameter (Fig. 2, A and B).To evaluate the relationship between extension length and number of branches, we performed a linear regression analysis (Fig. 2C). In cells not treated with forskolin, the number of branches (y) increased with the length of the extension (x) accordin"

The enzymes are highly regulated at all levels of expression, and it is becoming increasingly clear that substrate specificity of the PTP catalytic domains proper contributes considerably to PTP functionality. To investigate PTP substrate selectivity, we have set up a procedure to generate phage libraries that presents randomized, phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Phages that expressed suitable substrates were selected by immobilized, substrate-trapping GST-PTP fusion proteins. After multiple rounds of selection, positive clones were confirmed by SPOT analysis, dephosphorylation by wild-type enzyme, and Km determinations. We have identified distinct consensus substrate motifs for PTP1B, Sap-1, PTP-β, SHP1, and SHP2. Our results confirm substrate specificity for individual PTPs at the peptide level. Such consensus sequences may be useful both for identifying potential PTP substrates and for the development of peptidomimetic inhibitors.

The dynamic character of intracellular phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions is best appreciated when cells are treated with generic phosphatase inhibitors, such as vanadate or arsenate, which results in the rapid and massive phosphorylation of multiple intracellular targets and which has pleiotropic physiological effects (1.Morinville A. Maysinger D. Shaver A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 452-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most PTPs show a lack of substrate selectivity when tested in vitro or when overexpressed in cells; therefore, establishing the physiological role of PTPs is difficult. Around 90 PTPs have been described (2.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene. 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3.Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F.

Blocking individual PTPs may enhance specific signaling pathways (4.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Wälchli S. Ibberson M. Harrenga A. Expert Opin. Ther.

Drug Discovery Today. 2002; 7: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), but only a few PTPs have been linked convincingly to physiological substrates (4.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Wälchli S. Ibberson M. Harrenga A. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2002; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the discovery that PTP1B is a negative modulator of insulin and leptin signaling has spurred considerable interest in this enzyme as a drug target (6.Zhang Z.Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 7.Goldstein B.J. Ahmad F. Ding W. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Mol. Cell.

(13.Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) have developed a strategy that uses catalytically inactive PTP “trapping” mutants that are still able to interact with their substrates but are unable to dissociate. Using these mutants, the Flint team and others (14.Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15.Cote J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have isolated and identified substrates from cells that had been treated with vanadate. By using a large panel of substrate-trapping PTP mutants, we have shown that PTP1B has unique substrate specificity for the phosphorylated insulin receptor (16.Wälchli S. Curchod M.-L. Pescini Gobert R. Arkinstall S. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, substrate specificity is important and useful to predict PTP function, and substrate-trapping PTP mutants are useful tools to study substrate specificity. To define PTP substrate specificity in more detail, phosphopeptides have been used. Assays on random peptide libraries (17.Huyer G. Kelly J. Moffat J. Zamboni R. Jia Z. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or on chemicals (18.Pellegrini M.C. Liang H. Mandiyan S. Wang K. Yuryev A. Vlattas I. Sytwu T. Li Y.C. Wennogle L.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15598-15606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that mimic the recognition site of the pharmacological target of PTP1B have demonstrated a preference for acidic residues at positions –3 and –2 from the phosphorylated tyrosine and an aromatic group at position –1. More recently, a reverse alanine scan was performed to test the affinity of PTP1B for different short peptide sequences (19.Vetter S.W. Keng Y.F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2265-2268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and Asante-Appiah et al. (20.Asante-Appiah E. Ball K. Bateman K. Skorey K. Friesen R. Desponts C.

These methods have resulted in “optimal” PTP phosphopeptide substrate motifs. On the basis of such information a selective inhibitor for PTP1B has been designed (21.Sun J.P. Fedorov A.A. Lee S.Y. Guo X.L. Shen K. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12406-12414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). More recently, we have used the “SPOT” assay, a high throughput, on-membrane phosphopeptide synthesis procedure to systematically investigate the optimal –1/+1 amino acid context of a phosphotyrosine for recognition by PTP1B (22.Espanel X. Huguenin-Reggiani M. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Prot. Science. 2002; 11: 2326-2334Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To analyze PTP substrate specificity while starting from a large pool of potential substrates, we have used an M13 bacteriophage library, wherein each phage presents a unique (phospho)peptide. The presented peptide is embedded in the rigid protein structure of a structural coat protein. The phage display technology has previously been used in studies of kinase selectivity (23.Schmitz R. Baumann G. Gram H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 664-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24.Dente L. Vetriani C. Zucconi A. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Cesareni G. J. Mol.

High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The use of a randomly phosphorylated library was also used to identify a consensus sequence for the PTB domain of Shc (24.Dente L. Vetriani C. Zucconi A. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, a cDNA library for proteins that are expressed on phages has been used to identify ligands of the SH2 domain of SHP2 (26.Cochrane D. Webster C. Masih G. McCafferty J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For our study, we have chosen to display the library of peptides on the major capsid protein VIII of phage M13, which results in high copy number presentation (27.Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). From earlier studies, it is known that extended incubation of this type of phage to Src-family kinases results in extensive, non-selective tyrosine phosphorylation (24.Dente L. Vetriani C. Zucconi A. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an observation that we have exploited to study PTP substrate specificity. In the present study, we have used immobilized, trapping PTP mutants to isolate phosphopeptide-presenting M13 phages to analyze PTP substrate specificity. The approach was tested first on PTP1B, for which consensus sequences have been identified (19.Vetter S.W. Keng Y.F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2265-2268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sequences that were obtained were confirmed by using the SPOT assay (22.Espanel X. Huguenin-Reggiani M. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Prot. Science. 2002; 11: 2326-2334Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This latter approach, which involves the synthesis of phosphopeptides on membranes, enabled us to further modify individual amino acids in the sequences that were discovered. Following this analysis of PTP1B, we have performed new rounds of phage selection with PTP-Sap1 and PTP-β, which are closely related phosphatases that differ from PTP1B, and we demonstrated that they show distinct substrate preferences. However, by replacing one specific PTP-Sap1 amino acid, we were able to change the type of substrate that was selected in the mutated PTP. Finally, substrate specificities of the catalytic domains of PTP-SHP1 and SHP2 are determined. Taken together, our data confirm the ability of the PTP catalytic domain to select a preferred substrate in a complex population of displayed tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs, and they demonstrate the validity of this novel approach to study PTPs. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—PTPs were cloned and purified as described previously (16.Wälchli S. Curchod M.-L. Pescini Gobert R. Arkinstall S. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, specific primers corresponding to the beginning and the end of the catalytic domain of every PTP was used to amplify by PCR an expressed sequence tag containing the region of interest. These primers were designed with an EcoRI or MunI site at the 5′ end and a NotI site at the 3′ end. These two restriction sites were used to clone the catalytic domain in frame into an EcoRI-NotI-cut pGEX4TK vector (Amersham Biosciences). For the construction of the trapping mutants, we designed internal primers that create a D → A mutation, as described (16.Wälchli S. Curchod M.-L. Pescini Gobert R. Arkinstall S. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutation for the Arg88 position within PTP-Sap1 was performed by using the following internal primers: for 5′-ATT GTA GCG GTT CTT GGC GT-3′ and 5′-ACG CCA AGA ACC GCT ACA ATA ATG TGC TGC CCT ATG ACT G-3′. The clones used for SPOT analysis were subcloned into modified pGEX2TK that encodes a protein kinase A phosphorylation site in-frame with GST. Constructs were controlled by sequencing. Escherichia coli BL21 (codon +; Stratagene) were transformed, and a single colony was grown in 25 ml of LB with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C until an OD of 0.5 was reached. Protein production was performed at 30 °C for 3 h after the addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 250 μm. The bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) plus a proteinase inhibitor mixture, Complete™ (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by a treatment with lysozyme (200 μg/ml final) for 1 h on ice followed by three rounds of sonication. Supernatant of the lysate was incubated for more than 2 h with 100 μl of a 50% solution of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Finally, beads were extensively washed in PBST (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100), and the PTPs were eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 10 mm glutathione. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%; the amount of proteins produced was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay, and aliquots were stocked at –20 °C until use. GST-PEP constructs were prepared as follows: the primers used correspond to the pVIII capsid sequence of M13 plus two restriction sites (XhoI and NotI): 5′-TAT CTC GAG TCT TTC GCT GCT GAG GGT GA-3′ for the sense and 5′-ATA GCG GCC GCT TGC AGG GAG TCA AAG GCC G-3′ for the antisense. The DNA of the phage was amplified directly by adding 109 phages to the PCR mix. After PCR using Herculase polymerase (Stratagene), the DNA fragments (100 bp) were purified by using Microcon® PCR (Millipore); gel extraction was performed with Ultrafree®-DA (Millipore). The cloning and protein purification were finally accomplished following the same protocol as for the PTPs, with the only difference being that TKB1 (Stratagene) bacteria were transformed, and a single colony was grown and induced for protein production and phosphorylation exactly as described by the manufacturer. Again, all constructs were checked by DNA sequencing before protein production. Phosphorylation of the Phage Library and Enrichment—M13 phages (109–1010 plaque-forming units) were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP) in a total volume of 20 μl with 3 units of Src kinase for 3 h at 30 °C. The library was enriched through an anti-PTyr column (Upstate Biotechnology). In this experiment, we used the slurry in batch. About 40 μl of the column were incubated with the phosphorylation mix at 4 °C overnight. The bound phages were eluted with phenylphosphate. These clones were amplified into TG1 cells and were passed twice again in the column. The amplified tyrosine-carrying phages were then stocked at 4 °C in TE buffer and used for the trapping experiment (see below). Panning, Amplification, and Sequencing of the Selected Phages— Phages (108-109) were incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mm DTT, and with or without 3 units of Src kinase) for 3 h at 30 °C. (The supplier definition of one unit is the activity that is able to transfer 1 pmol of phosphate to cdc2 peptide per min per ng.) The p60Src, purified from baculovirus, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were pre-coated with 3 μg of either GST or PTP-GST for 4 h at 4 °C in a solution of Trapping buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) with 1% bovine serum albumin final. The phages were first pre-cleared by using GST-beads for 30 min at 4 °C and spun down; the supernatant was incubated with the coated PTP-GST for 1.5 h at 4 °C with a constant shaking. Finally, beads were spun down and washed several times (5× for the first panning, then 10×) with a solution of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.25% Tween final. Phages were eluted from PTP-GST by an acidic treatment (glycine buffer, pH 2.7) for 10 min at room temperature with a constant shaking, beads were spun down, and phages were recovered in the supernatant. One tenth volume of a 1 m Tris, pH 9.0 solution was added to restore the pH. Phages were finally titered in both fractions (bound and unbound), and the rest of the bound fraction was used to infect XL1 MRF′ bacteria (Stratagene) following described procedures (27.Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). The day after, cells were scraped, and phages were amplified by using helper phage M13K07 (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's procedures. For the experiments described herein, an increase in the number of trapped clones was observed (bound and unbound ratio, a factor between 103-104). Furthermore this increase in the number of clones was phosphotyrosine-dependent: when the selected pool of phages was not phosphorylated prior to the trapping, no residual binding was observed (data not shown). Phages where purified as single clones, and colony-PCR was performed by using a specific phage gene VIII primers: forward, 5′-ATG AAA AAG TCT TTA GTC CTC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CAG CTT GAT ACC GAT AGT TGC-3′. The PCR products were then purified and sequenced using the same primers. Sequences were read in both directions using SeqmanII software. Dephosphorylation Assay on GST-PEP Constructs and on pNPP— 100 ng of GST-PEP construct was incubated with 10 ng of PTP wild type in PTP buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT). The reaction was stopped by mixing equal volume aliquots with a solution of 50 mm activated sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) at different time points. The total mix was finally spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane using a 96-well dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and the phosphorylation state of the substrate was visualized by using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone G410, Upstate Biotechnology). For pNPP hydrolysis, 200 ng of PTP were incubated with varying amounts of the generic substrate (0–60 mm) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 2 mm DTT) in a total volume of 50 μl at room temperature. Plates were read at 405 nm, and kinetic parameters were determined by using a non-linear regression software (Prism, Graph-Pad, San Diego). SPOT Synthesis and Probing—Peptides were manually synthesized on derivatized cellulose membrane provided by Sigma-Genosys, which also provided the 20 Fmoc-amino acids active esters. Fmoc-phosphotyrosines (04–12-1156 from Nova Biochem) were incorporated in the presence of the coupling reagent, N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (Sigma) and hydroxybenzotriale (HOBt, Fluka; Ref. 28.Espanel X.

Labeling of GST-PTP for the SPOT analysis was performed as follows: 2–5 μg of GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. After washing, GST fusion proteins were radiolabeled by 50 units of protein kinase from bovine heart (Sigma) in the presence of 35 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in PKA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) for 30 min on ice. After washing, fusion proteins were eluted from beads in a solution of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 10 mm glutathione (28.Espanel X. Wälchli S. Rückle T. Harrenga A. Huguenin-Reggiani M. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15162-15167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked (for at least 2 h) and probed at 4 °C in Western wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl) + SPOT blocking buffer (Sigma-Genosys). After 2 h, membranes were washed several times in Western wash buffer and were autoradiographed. Enzyme Assays Using Phosphotyrosine Peptide Substrates—The dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides catalyzed by PTPs was performed by using the continuous fluorometric assay described (29.Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorometer. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme, and the initial reaction rates at various peptide concentrations were measured ensuring less than 5% product formation. Preparation of a Phosphotyrosine-presenting Phage Library— We have used an M13 library that presents random peptides of nine amino acids whose construction and use have been described earlier (24.Dente L. Vetriani C. Zucconi A. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This library was incubated with excess Src kinase, which results in relatively nonspecific library phosphorylation (24.Dente L. Vetriani C. Zucconi A. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Pilot studies using [γ-32P]ATP followed by autoradiography confirmed that phosphorylation occurred in the capsid protein of the library but not of wild-type M13, indicating that only tyrosines in the variable peptide had been phosphorylated (data not shown). The library was subsequently enriched for peptide-expressing phages that that could be phosphorylated by Src by purification on a column containing an immobilized antibody against phosphotyrosine. Eluted phages were re-amplified in bacteria and phosphorylated (see “Materials and Methods,” and Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of a random subset of phages from this enriched library indicated that 13 of 14 phages encoded a peptide with one or more tyrosines, with little tyrosine context bias, except for a 30% occurrence of G at +1 and 23% P at –1 (Table I). The probability that one random nine-mer phage peptide contains one or more tyrosine residues is 25%[1 – (62/64)9]; the probability that a set of 14 random phages produces fewer than two peptides that lack tyrosines is only 0.02%[(0.2513 × 0.75 × 14) + 0.7514]. Therefore, we can conclude that the phage library is tyrosine-phosphorylated and enriched.Table IPeptides presented by randomly selected phagesPhageSequence displayedCtrl-1EFLLSEPRDEADPAKCtrl-2EFEYQVYGNVADPAKCtrl-3EFKDPYTQLSADPAKCtrl-4EFYNLGSVGFEDPAKCtrl-5EFAHTYDAAPMDPAKCtrl-6EFQETYTVPDQDPAKCtrl-7EFHNPYNISPADPAKCtrl-8EFQGPYELLTRDPAKCtrl-9EFYGSISPVASDPAKCtrl-10EFCYAYEIHTLDPAKCtrl-11EFEYGTLTGNSDPAKCtrl-12EFLQATYGSFNDPAKCtrl-13EFYAQFLWPRSDPAKCtrl-14EFYGSVQSSLODPAK Open table in a new tab Phage Display on PTP1B—To assess the phage display procedure with trapping-PTP mutants (13.Flint A.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2265-2268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) which produced an optimal substrate consensus sequence; and (iii) the co-crystal structure of PTP1B with substrate peptides has been elucidated (30.Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31.Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P.

After three rounds of selection of our tyrosine-enriched phage library with the PTP1B trapping mutant, an increase in the ratio of binding/flow-through phages was observed. DNA from phages that had been retained on the column was sequenced (Table II). In all cases, the sequenced peptide contained a tyrosine. Two sequences were found on multiple occasions (4-fold and 2-fold and encoded by the same DNA sequence). Because the theoretical diversity of the phages (920, or ∼1019) vastly exceeded the number of phages that was made and tested, it is highly unlikely that these duplicates are independent. Their multiple occurrence suggests that only few phages were selected in the overall process and indicates that the PTP has retained them with high selectivity.Table IIPTP1B-selected phage sequencesPhageSequence displayedNumber1B-1EFZATYGSAATDPAK(4×)1B-2EFIZQNLADPLDPAK1B-3EFZDIILAGMADPAK1B-4EFQZZGEYTRGDPAK1B-5EFPEZAMLSNSDPAK1B-6EFEPIZNAYQVDPAK1B-7EFZGTYRGQDSDPAK1B-9EFZNLYEGVMSDPAK1B-11EFQSPVZGNFADPAK1B-12EFATZEEYALMDPAK1B-13EFZGTFAPKPLDPAK1B-14EFZGTYRGQDSDPAK(2×)Consensus-2: 50% E and 25% P-1: 92% hydrophobic (with 50% F)+1: 58% G/A+2: X+3: 100% hydrophobic, with 80 % phenolic (67% Y and 13% F); 20% I/L+4: 33% A Open table in a new tab When a phage peptide contained multiple tyrosines, it was not clear at this point which of these had been phosphorylated by Src. To address this issue, we used the SPOT assay (22.Espanel X. Huguenin-Reggiani M. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Prot. Science. 2002; 11: 2326-2334Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28.Espanel X.

This technology involves the synthesis of (phospho)peptides that remain anchored on the membranes on which they are made. Membranes containing hundreds of peptide-containing spots can then be incubated with GST-tagged, substrate-trapping PTPs to test for PTP substrate specificity, as described earlier for phosphoprotein substrates as well (16.Wälchli S.

This approach provides full control over which tyrosines in test peptides are phosphorylated and allowed us to test which of the tyrosines in the set in Table II were involved in the retention of phages by PTP1B in our phage-trapping experiment. Fig. 2A shows a binding assay of PTP1B to the set of (phospho)peptides listed in Table II, with all possible combinations for the position of the phosphorylated tyrosine (Z). Peptides that contained no phosphotyrosine failed to bind PTP1B. Where peptides contained multiple possibilities for phosphotyrosines, a very clear preference was displayed for PTP1B binding. Thus, in peptide 1B-1, phosphorylation of the first tyrosine (spot 2) resulted in much stronger binding than the second (spot 3). Peptide 1B-4, which has three tyrosines, shows that the second tyrosine was clearly implicated. In no case did double or triple phosphorylation produce stronger binding, suggesting that all phages were mono-phosphorylated. Nevertheless, spot 15 (clone 1B-4), which has two successively phosphorylated tyrosines, showed good binding. This is a well known motif that was reported earlier (31.Salmeen A. Andersen J.N.

The presence of DNMT1 in DNA replication foci raises the issue of whether this enzyme needs to gain access to nascent DNA before its packaging into nucleosomes, which occurs very rapidly behind the replication fork. Using nucleosomes positioned along the 5 S rRNA gene, we find that DNMT1 is able to methylate a number of CpG sites even when the DNA major groove is oriented toward the histone surface. However, we also find that the ability of DNMT1 to methylate nucleosomal sites is highly dependent on the nature of the DNA substrate. Although nucleosomes containing the Air promoter are refractory to methylation irrespective of target cytosine location, nucleosomes reconstituted onto the H19 imprinting control region are more accessible. These results argue that although DNMT1 is intrinsically capable of methylating some DNA sequences even after their packaging into nucleosomes, this is not the case for at least a fraction of DNA sequences whose function is regulated by DNA methylation.

These results argue that although DNMT1 is intrinsically capable of methylating some DNA sequences even after their packaging into nucleosomes, this is not the case for at least a fraction of DNA sequences whose function is regulated by DNA methylation. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark involved in gene silencing (1.Stancheva I. Meehan R.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 313-327PubMed Google Scholar), X chromosome and transposon inactivation (2.Beard C. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 3.Walsh C.P. Chaillet J.R. Bestor T.H. Nat.

Cell Genet. 2000; 91: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cytosine methylation of CpG dinucleotides is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), 1The abbreviations used are: DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; CAF-1, chromatin assembly factor 1; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; NCP, nucleosome core particle; ExoIII, exonuclease III; [3H]AdoMet, [methyl-3H]-S-adenosylmethionine. which belong to two distinct classes of enzymes. The first class consists of de novo methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) that methylate DNA irrespective of whether the template is hemi-methylated or not (6.Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 7.Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These enzymes are involved in the establishment of new DNA methylation patterns during development (8.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). The maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 belongs to the second class of enzymes. Disruption of the mouse Dnmt1 gene results in genome-wide demethylation and developmental arrest (9.Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of DNMT1 in propagating parental DNA methylation during replication cannot be substituted by other DNMTs. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle, which consists of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around the surface of an octamer formed by two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (10.Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1097-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). During DNA replication, the segregation of pre-existing histones and the deposition of newly synthesized histones function in concert to promote reformation of nucleosome core particles almost as soon as sufficient nascent DNA has emerged from the replication apparatus (11.Sogo J.M. Stahl H. Koller T. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Deposition of newly synthesized histones H3/H4 is mediated, at least in part, by a conserved protein known as chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), which brings histones H3/H4 to the replication fork via an interaction with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (12.Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 13.Moggs J.G. Grandi P. Quivy J.P. Jonsson Z.O. Hubscher U. Becker P.B. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell.

Kaufman P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 614-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PCNA is a DNA polymerase processivity factor that forms a sliding clamp around DNA and interacts with a number of DNA replication and DNA repair proteins, many of which are constitutively present at the replication fork (16.Maga G. Hübscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNMT1 also interacts with PCNA at the replication fork (17.Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 18.Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and a fraction of CpGs are subject to maintenance methylation prior to maturation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand (20.Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21.Rein T. Kobayashi T. Malott M. Leffak M. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25792-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that DNMT1 may need to be present immediately behind the replication fork in order to promote efficient methylation of nascent DNA prior to its packaging into nucleosomes. However, it is also known that a significant fraction of CpG dinucleotides escape this first wave of maintenance DNA methylation behind the replication fork (22.Liang G. Chan M.F. Tomigahara Y. Tsai Y.C. Gonzales F.A. Li E. Laird P.W. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Packaging of these hemi-methylated CpGs into nucleosomes and chromatin higher order structures may prevent their subsequent methylation by DNMT1. In this study, we addressed whether the first level of DNA compaction in eukaryotic chromosomes, the nucleosome core particle, represents a barrier to maintenance DNA methylation. We find that DNMT1 can methylate a number of distinct CpG sites even when the target cytosine in the major groove is facing the histone surface. However, at least with some DNA sequences, sites located in the central region of nucleosome core particles, where histones H3/H4 contact the DNA, are refractory to DNA methylation. Interestingly, we also find that DNA sequences derived from two loci in which DNA methylation is involved in imprinting (the Air promoter and H19 imprinting control region) exhibit differences in their accessibility to DNMT1. Although CpG sites packaged into nucleosomes reconstituted onto DNA derived from the H19 locus are efficiently methylated by DNMT1, nucleosomes assembled onto Air promoter DNA strongly block DNA methylation. Our results therefore argue that, although DNMT1 clearly possesses an intrinsic ability to methylate many CpG sites packaged into nucleosomes, there are striking differences in accessibility among naturally occurring DNA sequences in which function is modulated by DNA methylation. Preparation of Hemi-methylated DNA Substrates—Control and hemi-methylated 5 S DNA substrates were prepared in PCR reactions where one of the two primers contained 5-methylcytosine residues (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). PCR reactions were carried out as described previously (23.Nilsen H. Lindahl T. Verreault A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA was isolated from a 2% agarose gel and purified using MinElute gel extraction kit (Qiagen). For preparation of 5′-32P-labeled DNA, one of the PCR primers was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). DNA substrates containing the 5 S rRNA gene were obtained by PCR using an EcoRI fragment derived from plasmid pBUless as template. This DNA fragment encodes a 196-bp Lytechinus variegatus 5 S rRNA gene fragment extending from nt -90 relative to the transcription start site (+1). The 146-bp DNA substrates used in Fig. 4 were prepared using 146-mer synthetic oligonucleotides (GenScript Corp.) containing a single 5-methylcytosine residue either in the sense (CpG95) or the antisense strand (CpG96) as templates for second strand synthesis primed by shorter oligonucleotides. The long template oligonucleotides spanned nucleotides -74 to +72 relative to the transcription start site. The 147-bp DNA substrate with the mouse H19 CTCF binding site (nucleotides 3278–3424, GenBank™ accession number AF049091) was amplified by PCR from plasmid H19-4, which includes the H19 imprinting control region from nucleotides 847–4686 (24.Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The 147-bp DNA substrate containing the Air promoter (nucleotides 126021–126167 of the Igf2r locus, GenBank™ accession number AJ249895) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pPP4, which contains the mouse Igf2r gene intron 2 CpG island (25.Sleutels F. Zwart R. Barlow D.P. Nature. 2002; 415: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The sequences of all the oligonucleotides used are available upon request. Nucleosome Core Particle Reconstitution—Nucleosome core particles (NCPs) were reconstituted by a salt dilution method (26.Steger D.J. Owen-Hughes T. John S. Workman J.L. Methods. 1997; 12: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using histone octamers purified from chicken erythrocytes (27.Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The reconstitution reaction contained 4 μg of DNA and substoichiometric amounts of core histones in the presence of 2m NaCl. For preparation of radiolabeled nucleosomes, 500 ng of 5′-32P-labeled DNA fragment was mixed with 3.5 μg of cold DNA. Nucleosome reconstitution was confirmed by nucleoprotein gel electrophoresis, DNase I, and exonuclease III (ExoIII) digestion. Nucleoprotein gel analysis was performed using 6% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:N,N′-bisacrylamide ratio = 29:1) in 0.5× TBE buffer (Tris borate-EDTA) at 150 V for 2–3 h. DNase I digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 10–60 s in DNMT1 reaction buffer (see below) containing 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS, DNA was extracted with phenol:chroloform, precipitated with ethanol, and resolved in 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea in 1× TBE. For ExoIII mapping, reconstituted N1 and N2 NCPs were first purified in a nucleoprotein gel for 4 h. Gel slices containing N1 or N2 NCPs were crushed and NCPs eluted as described (28.Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Purified NCPs were treated with ExoIII (0.5 unit/μl, New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 60 s, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS. DNA was extracted and analyzed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea and 1× TBE. DNA Methylation Assays—DNA methylation reactions were carried out with 0.4 pmol of total DNA (free DNA + nucleosomal DNA) in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm [methyl-3H]-S-adenosylmethionine ([3H]AdoMet) (NCI, 0.55 mCi/ml), and 25 ng (0.5 unit or 0.14 pmol) of recombinant human DNMT1 (New England BioLabs, 50 ng/μl or 1 unit/μl) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the reaction, DNA was purified by phenol:chroloform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was then applied to DE81 paper (Whatman), and the paper was washed sequentially with 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, water, and ethanol. The paper was dried, and [3H]methyl groups incorporated into DNA were measured by liquid scintillation counting in Aquasol (Packard). The fraction of CpG sites that were methylated by DNMT1 was site- and DNA substrate-dependent, varying from 6 to 17% in the 5 S rRNA gene substrate (Figs. 2, 3, 4) to 13 and 35% for the Air and H19 substrates, respectively (Fig. 5). To reduce exposure times for detection of DNA methylation in polyacrylamide gels, [3H]AdoMet (Amersham Biosciences, 1.0 mCi/ml) was concentrated by evaporation in a SpeedVac. DNA methylation reactions were carried out in the presence of 5 μm [3H]AdoMet at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture (10 μl) was loaded directly onto a nucleoprotein gel as described above. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize total DNA and treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) to enhance tritium detection. Dried gels were subjected to fluorography at -80 °C for a few weeks using intensifying screens maximally sensitive to weak β-particle emissions (Kodak).Fig. 3Preferential methylation of target cytosine residues located near the edge of NCPs containing the 5 S rRNA gene. A, ExoIII digestion performed with DNA or NCPs. Digestion of free DNA was for 15 s, whereas digestion of NCPs was for 15, 30, and 60 s. Filled arrowheads indicate the position of the undigested 162-bp fragment; empty arrowheads mark the positions of the first ExoIII pause sites. The presence of undigested 162-bp fragment is not indicative of histone octamer positioning at or beyond the end of the 162-bp DNA fragment because no corresponding pause site in the complementary strand can be identified. The predominant position of the histone octamer deduced from the ExoIII data is illustrated. Target cytosine residues at CpG96 and -138 are indicated by flags. B, methylation of NCPs reconstituted onto 162-bp 5 S rRNA gene fragments containing single target cytosine residues located near the center (CpG96) or the edge (CpG138) of the DNA fragment. Top panel, the dotted lines indicate regions where histones H2A/H2B contact the DNA, and the continuous lines mark the regions where H3/H4 contact the DNA. Middle panel, free DNA and NCPs were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide nucleoprotein gels that were stained with ethidium bromide. Free DNA and NCP substrates were methylated with DNMT1 and [3H]AdoMet. DNA methylation was measured using a filter binding assay and liquid scintillation counting.

Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9163) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm NaCl (A100) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (20 ml, Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with buffer A100. The flow-through fraction was applied onto an SP-Sepharose fast flow column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted in a stepwise fashion with buffer A containing 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m NaCl. The 0.3 m NaCl fraction containing DNMT1 was applied onto a Mono S column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with buffer A100, and bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.6 m NaCl in buffer A. Active DNMT1 fractions were applied to a Mono Q column (0.1 ml, Amersham Biosciences), which was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.6 m NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and further fractionated using either a Superose 6 (2.4 ml, Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column or a Mono S column (0.1 ml, Amersham Biosciences). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the N-terminal region of human DNMT1 (New England BioLabs) was used to follow DNMT1 by Western blotting. Column fractions were assayed for DNA methylation activity using 500 ng of a 196-bp 5 S rRNA gene fragment containing three hemi-methylated CpGs. Core Particle Reconstitution and Nucleosome Positioning—To address whether the DNA methylation activity of DNMT1 is influenced by nucleosomes, NCPs were assembled using purified histone octamers and DNA fragments derived from the L. variegatus sea urchin 5 S rRNA gene. This sequence was chosen because of its known ability to position nucleosomes with remarkable precision (30.Flaus A. Luger K. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hemi-methylated DNA substrates were produced by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). Histone octamers were purified from chicken erythrocytes (Fig. 1A) and assembled onto a 196-bp DNA fragment by stepwise salt dilution (26.Steger D.J. Owen-Hughes T. John S. Workman J.L. Methods. 1997; 12: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nucleoprotein gel analysis showed that, after nucleosome assembly, most of the DNA was found in a slower migrating form corresponding to NCPs (Fig. 1B). DNase I digestion revealed a ladder of prominent cutting sites with the 10-bp periodicity characteristic of NCPs, whereas naked DNA was cut randomly (Fig. 1C). We did not detect any differences in the nucleoprotein gel mobility or DNase I digestion pattern of NCPs reconstituted onto either non-methylated or hemi-methylated DNA (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4). Three mononucleosome bands were detected in nucleoprotein gels (Fig. 1B). This was due to the presence of a mixture of NCPs in which histone octamers occupy distinct positions along the 196-bp DNA fragment. The slower and faster migrating species were designated N1 and N2, respectively. In some of our nucleoprotein gels, the faster migrating N2 nucleosome band clearly appeared as a doublet (Figs. 1B, lane 2), suggesting that N2 contained two octamer positions. To map octamer positions in these distinct species, NCPs containing a 5′-32P-labeled DNA fragment were resolved in nucleoprotein gels. Each species was extracted separately from the gel and subjected to ExoIII digestion. In this assay, ExoIII processively digests the 5′-labeled strand from the 3′-end until it reaches the 3′-border of the histone octamer where the enzyme exhibits a strong pause. Although the gel-purified N1 nucleosomes were contaminated by some N2 nucleosomes (Fig. 1D, lane 2), we detected a strong N1-specific ExoIII pause site (asterisk in Fig. 1D, lane 5). The length of the protected fragment (about 165 bp) argued that N1 consisted of an octamer located about 20–165 bp from the 5′-end, as depicted in Fig. 1E. Consistent with the presence of a doublet in nucleoprotein gels, ExoIII digestion of gel-purified N2 nucleosomes generated two protected fragments of 175 and 185 bp (asterisks in Fig. 1D, lane 6). N2 nucleosomes therefore consisted of two octamer positions, 30–175 bp and 40–185 bp from the 5′-end (Fig. 1E). ExoIII also produced a number of bands shorter than 147 bp (Fig. 1D). The most prominent bands were produced upon ExoIII digestion of both N1 and N2 nucleosomes isolated from nucleoprotein gels, arguing that they did not arise from alternative histone octamer positions. Methylation of Nucleosomal DNA by DNMT1—Recombinant human DNMT1 purified from insect cells has been characterized extensively (31.Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32.Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNMT1 was used to methylate 196-bp 5 S rRNA gene fragments containing three hemi-methylated sites at positions 136, 158, and 181 of the antisense strand. Positions 136 and 158 are located inside in each of the three octamer positions identified in N1 and N2, whereas position 181 is outside of N1 and at the very edge of N2 NCPs (Fig. 2C). NCPs were assembled onto cold DNA at increasing histone/DNA molar ratio and reconstitution was confirmed using nucleoprotein gels stained with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). With a histone/DNA molar ratio of 0.8, most of the input DNA was packaged into NCPs (Fig. 2A, lane 3); subsequent experiments did not exceed this ratio to avoid aggregation of histones and DNA at higher molar ratio of octamers and DNA. Under these conditions, species that migrated above NCPs (due to more than one octamer per 196-bp DNA fragment) or DNA aggregation were not detected (Fig. 2A). Free DNA or NCPs were incubated with DNMT1 and [3H]AdoMet and incorporation of [3H]methyl into the DNA substrate quantitated using a filter binding assay. Remarkably, a very similar kinetics of DNA methylation was obtained with free DNA or NCP reconstitution mixtures containing histone:DNA molar ratio of 0.4 and 0.8. This result suggested that the hemi-methylated sites in the 196-bp DNA substrate were equally accessible to DNMT1 in both free DNA and NCPs. Free DNA did not accumulate during the course of DNMT1 reactions with NCPs (Fig. 2, A and B). This showed that NCPs containing hemi-methylated DNA were stable and that DNMT1 did not disrupt NCPs under our assay conditions. To demonstrate that DNA methylation did occur within intact NCPs, the reaction products containing 3H-methylated DNA were resolved in nucleoprotein gels. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and DNA methylation was detected by fluorography. DNA or NCP substrates lacking methylation were not methylated (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 3). Therefore the de novo methyltransferase activity that has been reported for recombinant DNMT1 (32.Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) was negligible under our assay conditions. In contrast, when the DNA substrate was hemi-methylated, DNA methylation was detected by fluorography in both the free DNA and NCPs present in the same reaction. There was no striking preference for methylation of free DNA, and both N1 and N2 nucleosomes were methylated (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). Because the DNA substrate used in these experiments contained three hemi-methylated CpGs and position 181 was located outside of the histone octamer in the N1 nucleosome and at the border of N2 nucleosomes (Fig. 2C), it was possible that all of the DNA methylation observed with NCPs occurred at CpG181. To exclude this possibility, we examined whether CpG136 and CpG158, both located inside the N1 and N2 nucleosomes (Fig. 2C), were methylated. To map the sites of methylation, 3H-methylated DNA was extracted from nucleoprotein gels and digested with ScaI or Fnu4HI, and methylation of each restriction fragment was detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and fluorography (Fig. 2D). ScaI digestion produced a short 30-bp fragment that contained only CpG181 and a long 166-bp fragment that contained both CpG136 and -158. This digest revealed that CpG136 and/or -158 were methylated in both free DNA and NCPs (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 5). Recovery of the short 30-bp ScaI fragment (which contained CpG181 only) after DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis was inefficient. However, a comparison of the ethidium bromide stain and the fluorogram revealed that equal amounts of undigested (196-bp) and 166-bp ScaI fragments were methylated to similar extents (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 5), arguing that DNMT1 did not methylate CpG181 efficiently even in free DNA. Given that DNMT1 is relatively non-sequence-specific, this may reflect an effect of DNA conformation, rather than DNA sequence context. Fnu4HI digestion produced a long 148-bp DNA fragment, which contained only CpG136, and a short 48-bp fragment, which included both CpG158 and -181. Methylation of CpG136 was observed in both free DNA and NCPs (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 6). Similarly, [3H]methyl incorporation into the 48-bp fragment, which primarily reflected methylation of CpG158 (given the lack of methylation of CpG181 revealed by ScaI digestion), also occurred in both free DNA and NCPs (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 6). CpG158 was located near the edge of N1/N2 NCPs (about 7 bp in N1 and either 17 or 27 bp in the two N2 nucleosomes). In each case, CpG158 was part of the DNA segments that contact histones H2A/H2B. In contrast, CpG136 was located about two helical turns (22 bp) further from the edge of the nucleosome in DNA segments that contacted histones H3/H4. Methylation of CpG136 suggested that other more centrally located CpG dinucleotides may also be methylated by DNMT1. To examine the influence of CpG position on the efficiency of DNA methylation in more detail, we assembled NCPs onto fragments of the L. variegatus 5 S rRNA gene containing single hemi-methylated sites at CpG96 and -138. Unlike the 196-bp DNA substrate used in Fig. 2, nucleoprotein gel analysis of NCPs reconstituted onto 162-bp DNA substrates gave rise to a single nucleosome band, suggesting that histone octamers occupied one major position (Fig. 3B). ExoIII mapping revealed nucleosome-specific pause sites in the sense and antisense strands (Fig. 3A). These ExoIII pause sites were consistent with the presence of one predominant octamer position where the target cytosine residues at CpG96 and CpG138 were respectively located about 55 and 15 bp from the edge of the histone octamer (Fig. 3A). As illustrated in Fig. 3B, these DNA segments contacted histones H2A/H2B (CpG138) and histones H3/H4 (CpG96). The efficiency of methylation of CpG138 was only slightly reduced upon packaging into NCPs (50% compared with free DNA), whereas methylation of CpG96 was more severely impaired (15%, Fig. 3B). Thus, DNMT1 preferentially methylated target cytosine residues located near the edge of the nucleosome. Experiments carried out with a number of other DNA substrates based on the 5 S rRNA gene also reached the same conclusion (data not shown). Maintenance methylation requires recognition of hemimethylated target sites in which the 5-methyl group of cytosine protrudes from the major groove of DNA. Following this recognition step, the phosphodiester backbone surrounding the cytosine to be methylated needs to be rotated to bring the target cytosine into the catalytic site of the enzyme. This DNA conformational change, often referred to as base flipping even though no direct contact with the base is actually involved, is also catalyzed by several DNA repair enzymes (33.Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Histone-DNA interactions could potentially influence both recognition of hemi-methylated CpGs and base flipping. To test whether the orientation of the target cytosine relative to the histone octamer influences the efficiency of DNA methylation, we prepared two NCPs that contain single hemi-methylated CpGs separated by 6 bp (CpG35 and CpG41, Fig. 4A)."
https://openalex.org/W1964805636,"Type-2A protein phosphatase (PP2A) is a key regulator in many different cell signaling pathways and an important determinant in tumorigenesis. One of the signaling targets of PP2A is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) cascade. In this study, we wanted to determine whether PP2A could be involved in regulation of death receptor activity through its capacity to regulate MAPK/ERK. To this end, we studied the effects of two different routes of protein phosphatase inhibition on death receptor-mediated apoptosis. We demonstrated that the apoptosis mediated by Fas, TNF-α, and TRAIL in U937 cells is suppressed by calyculin A, an inhibitor of type-1 and type-2A protein phosphatases. The inhibition of the protein phosphatase activity was shown to subsequently increase the MAPK activity in these cells, and the level of activation corresponded to the degree of suppression of cytokine-mediated apoptosis. A more physiological inhibitor, the intracellular PP2A inhibitor protein I2PP2A, protected transfected HeLa cells in a similar way from Fas-mediated apoptosis and induced activation of MAPK in I2PP2A transfected cells. A corresponding inhibition could also be obtained by stable transfection with a constitutively active form of the MAPK kinase, MKK1 (also referred to as MEK1). The inhibitor-mediated protection was highly efficient in preventing early stages of apoptosis, as no caspase-8 cleavage occurred in these cells. The observed apoptosis suppression is likely to facilitate the tumor-promoting effect of a range of different type-2A protein phosphatase inhibitors, and could explain the reported tumor association of I2PP2A."
https://openalex.org/W2010346587,"Cellular FLICE (FADD-like interleukin-1-β-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) inhibits death receptor-induced apoptosis by binding to FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) and pro-caspase-8. c-FLIP has also been shown to transmit activation signals and to enhance interleukin (IL)-2 production. However, c-FLIP-mediated T cell activation is difficult to detect in most cells. We found that in DO11.10 T cells, c-FLIP expression led to inhibition of IL-2 production, in contrast to the readily detectable c-FLIP-induced activation in Jurkat cells. A direct comparison revealed that distinct signal pathways were regulated by c-FLIP in Jurkat cells and DO11.10 cells. We investigated whether constitutively activated phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in Jurkat cells stimulated c-FLIP. Inhibition of PI3K in Jurkat cells abrogated a c-FLIP-mediated increase in IL-2 production. In addition, c-FLIP coordinated with active PI3K for ERK activation. Furthermore, introduction of PTEN back into Jurkat cells eliminated the stimulatory effect of c-FLIP on IL-2 production and ERK activation. Our results suggest that priming with PI3K promotes the coupling of c-FLIP to T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2019406798,"We explored, by mutational substitutions and kinetic analysis, possible roles of the four residues involved in the hydrogen-bonding or ionic interactions found in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound structure of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, Tyr<sup>122</sup>-Arg<sup>324</sup>, and Glu<sup>123</sup>-Arg<sup>334</sup> at the top part of second transmembrane helix (M2) connected to the A domain and fourth transmembrane helix (M4) in the P domain. The observed substitution effects indicated that Glu<sup>123</sup>, Arg<sup>334</sup>, and Tyr<sup>122</sup> contributed to the rapid transition between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-unbound and bound states of the unphosphorylated enzyme. Results further showed the more profound inhibitory effects of the substitutions in the M4/P domain (Arg<sup>324</sup> and Arg<sup>334</sup>) upon the isomeric transition of phosphorylated intermediate (<i>E</i>P) (loss of ADP sensitivity) and those in M2/A domain (Tyr<sup>122</sup> and Glu<sup>123</sup>) upon the subsequent processing and hydrolysis of <i>E</i>P. The observed distinct effects suggest that the interactions seen in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound structure are not functionally important but indicate that Arg<sup>334</sup> with its positive charge and Tyr<sup>122</sup> with its aromatic ring are critically important for the above distinct steps. On the basis of the available structural information, the results strongly suggest that Arg<sup>334</sup> moves downward and forms new interactions with M2 (likely Asn<sup>111</sup>); it thus contributes to the inclination of the M4/P domain toward the M2/A domain, which is crucial for the appropriate gathering between the P domain and the largely rotated A domain to cause the loss of ADP sensitivity. On the other hand, Tyr<sup>122</sup> most likely functions in the subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-releasing step to produce hydrophobic interactions at the A-P domain interface formed upon their gathering and thus to produce the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-released form of <i>E</i>P. During the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport cycle, the four residues seem to change interaction partners and thus contribute to the coordinated movements of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W2064173200,"Northern blotting confirmed previous results indicating that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase Pyst2-L was highly expressed in leukocytes obtained from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. High levels of Pyst2-L mRNA were expressed in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral leukocytes from nine AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. BM from healthy individuals expressed very low levels of Pyst2-L. Whereas high levels of Pyst2-L mRNA and protein were detected in several leukemia cell lines, Pyst2-L mRNA was detected neither in 33/34 samples of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) nor in leukocyte fractions enriched with CD34+ cells. Certain solid tumor and lymphoblastoid cell lines expressed high levels of Pyst2-L mRNA. In view of the association of Pyst2-L to MAPK signaling cascades, we tested if cell activation, a process involving MAPK signaling, influences Pyst2-L expression. Indeed, activation of T cells and endothelial cells increased Pyst2-L in these cells. Furthermore, TPA, a known MAPK activator, induces the expression of both Pyst2-L mRNA as well as the Pyst2-L protein in leukemia cells. This induction was partially inhibited by PD098059, an Mek1/2-specific inhibitor. Based on the results of this and previous studies, we hypothesize that the high levels of Pyst2-L detected in the active state of AML and ALL diseases and in other types of cancer reflect an altered MAPK signaling pathway in such malignant processes. This alteration may be the result of a failed attempt to counter the constitutive activation of MAPK in transformed cells or alternatively, may represent the activated state of such cells."

https://openalex.org/W2025262363,"Stable transformation of rat embryo fibroblast (REF) cells with E1A and cHa-ras oncogenes leads to downmodulation of c-fos gene transcription. This repression is provided in part by the association of Elk-1 transcription factor with histone deacetylases mediated through effects of Ras on MAP-kinase cascades. Here, we focus on the primary effects of E1A and Ras displayed in transient transfection assay on the transactivating capability of Elk-1, which is a key transcription factor of c-fos gene regulation. Our data show that E1A is able to suppress serum- and Ras-induced stimulation of Gal-luc reporter activity by a full-length Gal-Elk1-428 fusion protein as well as the expression of c-fos promoter-driven luciferase constructs (fos-luc). The repression can be relieved by trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, implying the involvement of HDACs and an inactive chromatin structure formed due to underacetylation of nucleosomal histones. Thus, upon transient transfection of E1A and Ras oncogenes in REF52 cells or their stable expression in E1A+cHa-ras cells, E1A contributes to the formation of inactive chromatin structure through association with p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases at c-fos promoters, whereas Ras mediates its effect through constitutive activation of the MAP/ERK kinase cascade, thereby promoting the recruitment of HDAC1 to the Elk-1 transcription factor. As a result, downregulation of c-fos gene transcription revealed in established E1A+Ras transformants is unlikely to be a consequence of cell transformation itself, but follows from primary effects of E1A and Ras on chromatin remodeling factors."
